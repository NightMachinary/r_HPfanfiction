A fun little thought exercise. Let's assume that wandless magic is possible as long as you practice a lot, and I mean you have to know the individual spell inside and out. Also you require either years to learn to feel how the magic works, or can do a ritual to make you more sensitive to magic. You also know this ritual. With the ritual it'll still take you years at minimum to learn a handful of spells(let's say 5 at max for every two years. 2-3 if the spells are at the level of complexity that a Patronous is). The ritual also has a possibility of making you more sensetive to magic than prescribed to the point that places with a lot of magic will give you headaches, and make it harder to perform magic. Roll a dice, and if you get 4 or lower you're fine, if not assume you screwed it up. 5 or lower if your above average subject is Arithmancy, or Runes. If you failed, assume that in high magic areas performing magic is more difficult, and wandless magic is all but impossible.

You were in, or are in whatever house you got on the quiz in Pottermore, and you have some connections to some of those in the house depending on what year you came in you can also have a personal connection to one canon character of your choice. You also have one magical talent(Metamorph, Parseltongue, Animagus, etc...) of your choice.

What do you do?

** *Talent: Charms*

*A: If I can choose Insert time and origin*

#+begin_quote
  I appear as an ordinary Ravenclaw half-blood. Studious and hardworking, but not particularly talented. I take over (insert) during the fifth year of Hogwarts - this should help me graduate just as canon begins.

  Oclumency is a must, but not much of a problem. I've done some meditation before and have no problems with the beginner stages. I will spare some time for it each evening. I mean, potentially perfect recall? Oh, I am going to abuse this so hard!

  I still turn in "above-average" classwork, but I study hard, and memorize as much of Hogwarts library as I can. I go home for Winter break, and visit a public library for information on making paper and ink.

  When I return, it is with multiple pouches filled to the brim with empty books and ink, all thanks to the Undetectable Expanson Charm - it might be restricted, but I'm a Ravenclaw. I'm supposed to experiment with these things while in the controlled environment of the school and for purely academic reasons. I still make an effort not to get caught.

  While checking out hundreds of books a day would raise suspicion, just wandering between the shelves while the librarian is distracted is normal... And I'm talented with charms. A simple SEP, and students won't think to question me and my cloud of floating, self-writing books.

  While acquiring my reference books, I will also genuinely work on projects - I need to have something to justify my long stints in Knowledge Wonderland.

  Twin Diaries (an excercise in Protean charm) and Very Realistic Snowglobe (expansion charms, environment control, life support, etc) will be useful both as a smokescreen and as base for some of my ambitions.

  In the end, I should graduate with OWLs at the minimum grade that will get me in advanced classes, and aced NEWTs. Why? If I have a family, their disappointment with my OWL scores is a good excuse for my study binge befiore NEWTs. Additionally, it means I can't immediately disappear, yet.

  If magic works outside Earth (I'd test it), then at the first inkling of trouble I'd move to my Magnum Opus (yeah, I'd totally call it that), my orbital habitat hanging around Neptune, the culumination of my efforts towards total self-sufficience.

  If not, I'd still find a way to turtle up. Maybe in the Earth mantle?

  I'm a firm believer that a skilled wizard can set up shop anywhere, as long as they have their wand and and are not immediately rendered deceased. Having time to prepare is a rare luxury, but nonetheless much appreciated.

*A.2 Telling Dumbledore*

#+begin_quote
  Only comes into effect if the plans are completed and I'm gone: If I decided to give Dumbledore any info, I'd not go to the man himself. Instead, I'd write a script for a teen adventure book and pitch it to a college theater club in France. I'd have them either do the play (and I'd handle editing in special effects and producing copies), or I'd get them to do the voice-overs, create an animated movie (with 2D animation charms on parchment) and make sure the kids get the full proceeds from the distribution of "Harvey Polter and the Order Of Spicy Chicken".

  Obviously, I'd introduce myself (and feature in credits as) Albus Wulfric Percival Brian Dumbledore. I'd credit Perenelle Flamel for special effects. I'd make sure that too many people were involved in the production to use Scrying on. (If it's a thing.)

  A copy of the movie, which would none-too-subtly point out both the nature and the location of Horcruxes as well as many other details like that would be sent to a Mrs. Figg, living at Privet Drive, Surrey.
#+end_quote

*If my plans go horribly wrong and my personal Victory Condition is no longer achievable, running to Grandpa Albus will have to do.* He protected Snape, so I'm happy about my chances. I'd still try to fake my death and vanish in the chaos if given a chance, because sopporting cast and minor characters in HP have the lifespans of lemmings.

​

*B: I move to Canada.*

#+begin_quote
  A fair bit of my gold goes to purchase building materials... I will move them myself. I buy a decent plot of land to the north of the country. It's less expensive, and the population density is low, which is quite excellent for me.

  A few charms and a dynamo, and I won't need to give up modern comforts. Space expansion charms and solar lamps mean I can have an underground farming complex with no one any wiser.

  Aversion charms on the borders of my sizable property will be the mildest of my defenses... And due to large radius and my electronics being closed-circuit, there shouldn't be any interference... And if there is? Wizarding Wireless is a proof a moderately talented wizard can ape muggle tech. I can too, and it will give me something to do.

  In the event this will take more funds than I have available, I will most likely get myself hired by one of "Extreme House Flipping" companies, and with discrete use of magic get out of doing any physical work. (It's normally hell on the back, but getting a solid house built in a week pays well). After that, some memory charms to leave a false trail and Mr. Smith the First can fade into obscurity, while Sir Smith the Second appears in the wilder part of Canada.

** What a silly question. I take the shapeshifter ability, Dark Arts at the level of Bellatrix Lestragen - Voldemort's deadliest handmaiden - and painstakingly write down everything I remember about the Canon. I learn Occlumency, found a billionaire recluse somewhere and kill him, take my place and murder Umbridge to make his own Hocrux.

From my super comfortable and rich hiding place - probably in Malta or the Bahamas - I watch the second wizarding war unfold alone. Perhaps I will help with the Hocruxes, simply because living in a world under Voldemort would not be pleasant, but I would conveniently forget to tell Dumbledore about the curse on the Gaunt ring.

So, after the dear director - also known as the super smart and powerful mega-grandpa who wouldn't like me at all - kicks his boots, I wait until the battle of Hogwarts, when Harry pretends he's dead, only to take Voldemort by surprise and stick Griffyndor's sword into your rotten heart.

And vóila, a hero of the Wizarding World, assassin of Voldemort and winner of Order of Merlin, first class. I will probably win some legal positions and, like Dumbledore, I will eventually try to take over the world based on the creed of second chances and lemon drops.

** Being a Ravenclaw at heart, I will be in for a /lot/ of investigation. Figuring out if I am in the Canon universe or an AU. Checking if I am in my own past (check for my parents' existence). Figuring out how much of History correlates to our own (and why?) and abusing the hell out of my future knowledge if the correlation continues. If I am in my Birth Timeline, I would have to figure out how to send myself into the past. Track down JKR and figure out what the hell is going on there.

Figuring out and experimenting with magic would probably occupy me for months. Setup an identity in both worlds. Learn everything about the ministry and its tracking methods. I would however, stay the hell away from No. 4 Privet Drive , cause that would be just begging to get involved in the Plot.

Write down every single detail I know of canon and send it to Moody and Lupin : the characters least likely to Manipulative or Evil versions of their canon selves. Ensure that it cannot be tracked back to me.

** Firstly, tell Dumbledore everything. Duh. After that, your best bet is to actually let things go as close to canon as possible until fourth year (as it is Voldemort's 'resurrection' with Harry's blood which secures Harry's survival and therefore enables him to complete the prophecy).

With the ritual, I would be more likely to ignore it. Doing rituals of any sort without having a strong theoretical understanding of what it does, what it asks of me and what the consequences are is extremely foolish. In order to get this theoretical understanding, I would have to have a solid grounding in magical theory, both basic and advanced. As such, I would prefer to forgo the magical ritual - it would probably be a crutch rather than something really of use. Not to mention that the theoretical grounding would make it easier to perform more varied complicated magic in the long term.

I would likely be in either Slytherin or Hufflepuff, hopefully Hufflepuff as the books aren't very favourable towards the Slytherin house (especially as I would probably be very obviously muggle raised). A magical talent I would want to have is an aptitude to transfiguration - probably the most multipurpose and powerful magical field. It would give me value and let me accomplish a lot of things. Animagus would probably come naturally through this, but even without that, transfiguration is already a valuable field to specialise in.

What I would like to do is remain quiet and in the background for most of the cannon years until year 5. Once Voldemort has come back, I will make myself scarce and hide in a protected hamlet or somewhere in the Yorkshire Dales (especially from year 6 onwards). After Harry has killed off Voldemort, then I can rejoin society. Or I can maybe be a (secret) member of the Order of the Phoenix who does not take part in warfare. Either way, I am not going to put myself in harm's way when there is a possibility that I either change nothing or make things worse by doing so.

This does all change depending on what I agree upon with Dumbledore. He is the wisest character in the whole series, if he has a better plan for me, I will likely take that into consideration.

** I keep saying "tell everything to Dumbledore", but since I'm not the first in this round, let's start with something simpler.

I'd become some kinda overlord, by abusing magic to its full potential. Since Voldemort is a non-issue as long as you have a following, I'd use the Imperius on two people at the same time, force them in an unbreakable vow to never betray me, to never work against me, and to a certain extent to like working under me, and repeat it until I have a strong following of maybe ten, twenty wizards.

Then, each of them would take Polyjuice and kidnap several of Diagon Alley's shopkeepers, wearing the faces of Death Eaters. Then, I would rescue them, after a dramatic and hidden and staged battle between me and the "Death Eaters". I have all the shopkeepers that are indebted to me. If need be, I can also just delete their memories and send them away in the muggle world, after forcing them to write a will in which each of my stooges gain their shops.

Then, I dunno, but I'm set for life. An influential figure, with 10 or 20 strong wizards at my command? What can't they do?
