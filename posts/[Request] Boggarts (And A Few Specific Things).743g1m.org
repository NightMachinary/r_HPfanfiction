Are there any good stories (fanfics or otherwise) focusing on Boggarts? Not as a way to showcase characters' fears, but on boggarts as creatures in and on themselves. There are two specific things I'd like to see in particular, though any other recommendations are fine too:

- A story showing (or discussing) what would happen if someone's worst fear was "a boggart". I think that one's on par with the Pinocchio paradox to be honest. If you have any non-fic ideas for how to answer this question, be sure to post them too!

- Someone in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4zepjr/request_boggart_turns_into_something_and_stays/][this old Boggart-related thread]] mentioned "a story where Neville befriends a Boggart". That sounds fascinating. Can anyone track this down?
