In it, when Harry's name comes out the Goblet, Ron and Percy(?) stoke Gryffindor into holding a vote to kick Harry out of the house. Any who vote to support him are also removed from the house if the vote is against Harry.

Eventually, Harry, Hermione, Neville, the twins and one other (maybe Ginny?) leave Gryffindor and become students of no house. As the year passes Harry & co realize it's much less stressful and they decide to just stay as members of no house.

I remember a particular scene where Snape gives 50(?) points to Harry, but splits them three ways between Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin.
