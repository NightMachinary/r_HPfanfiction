After being told I had a habit of switching tenses (from past to present, usually by forgetting to add--or dropping--the verb before the gerund, ie: "Spot's free," she said, walking them over. vs "Spot's free," she said as she walked them over. or "Spot's free," she said and walked them over. Or some other grammatically correct variation.) It made me wonder about the different combinations and viewpoints you could have sticking to one of each.

For me, second person/present tense would be difficult to both read and write. Reading second person feels like I'm being told what to do (You, You, You, You...), and present tense is just so...passive. (ie: You ask around, finding clues to use in for your discovery of the chamber. The hostile looks don't bother you much. You know they'll see that you're right.) Writing it just creates too many opportunities for mistakes, and there's not a lot of room for creativity.

I've never read future tenses in fanfic but I think it'd be almost impossible to pull off well.

Thoughts?

** I have by far believed that using first person for multiple characters in a single story is hell worthy.

** u/HeirGaunt:
#+begin_quote
  Spot's free," she said,
#+end_quote

The only thing I could think of when I read this was that I was being like "make it rhyme!"

#+begin_quote
  Spot's free," said she,
#+end_quote

** Correct me if I'm wrong, but all of your examples look correct. That's just the present participle and it's fine to use in past tense.

*** Really? I had no clue. A few people were saying I mixed tenses, so I "corrected" a lot of it which killed some of the prose.

**** Yeah, your original should be fine :) Here's an example of it from the books:

#+begin_quote
  “Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father.
#+end_quote

** Second person present is the narrative style in /If on a winter's night a traveler,/ which is absolutely marvelously written.
