I'm looking for a specific fic I read 2-4 year ago which had Harry at Cedric's death making a deal with a demon and he got demonic powers. The demon, who's name I can't remember but I think started with an “A”, slept around with all the teachers and caused havoc at Hogwarts.

This fic was mostly humor and completely crack. It might be a cross over with another fandom but I don't know which one it would be.

Thank you for help!
