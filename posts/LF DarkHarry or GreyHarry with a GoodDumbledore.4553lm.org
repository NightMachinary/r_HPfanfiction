** Harry in time-traveling stories is generally grey, such as:

In *Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650), the Azkaban execution scene was quite memorable.

In *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), he threw fiendfyre and imperious at will.

In *Returning to Start*, linkffn(10687059), he killed many.

Dumbledore in those stories is not bad.

** The very recent (and still regularly updated) Abraxas ( linkffn(11580650) ) has something you could call a "Grey" Harry (though I've got to say that crucio- and imperio-casting Harry towards the end of DH is definitely very "grey" as well).

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** Nope, that's not a grey harry at all. Considering what he does to Rita Skeeter, this Harry is straight up dark lord material (not to mention his reaction is greatly exaggerated and completely out of proportion to what she actually does). So stereotypical and one-dimensional it hurts.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

**** I've got a Harry training to become a Watcher in a Buffy crossover (though set in the time of the Slayer before Buffy) with a good, competent (and badass) Dumbledore in "Uncle Quentin's Spy". Most of my stories feature a good, competent Dumbledore, usually with a ruthless side when it Comes to dealing with enemies.
