I love sad fics. I like them dark, I like them gritty, emotional and all that other good stuff.

Sadly though.... I've read too much fanfiction. All the main big recs I've read. I've even read a bunch of the lesser known sad and angst fics. I've gotten desperate enough to go through pages upon pages of tags on AO3 to find smth I like....

I'm picky about quality, so please no cheap childhood rape stories or stories that feature edgelord Harry! I am fine with slash, femslash, het, gen, gender bending, crossovers etc, have nothing against any ships and am fine with any length. My only requirement really is that they are relatively well written.

Just for reference, these are some of my favourite ones! (I really should start writing down the fics I've read bcs I'm sure I've forgotten SO MANY good ones over time...)

The left words - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18394907/chapters/43563482]])

Antithesis - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456]])

Dead Things (Yeah I know this one is more of a horror/dark fic than a sad one, but it's sad when looked at from Harry's perspective) - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769]])

Breathe (Don't falter) (This is a still updating crossover with Naruto that I really really like) - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17241749]])

And in the darkness bind them (a crossover with LoTR featuring an immortal Harry who has lived an incalculable amount of lives longer than is good for him) - linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9674362/1/And-In-The-Darkness-Bind-Them]])


** These are a couple I have saved that are sad/emotional that I thought were pretty good.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/294722/chapters/471501]])

The Train to Nowhere by MayMarlow on ao3. It's an AU and I wouldn't call this angst really but it makes me emotional. The tone can be so hopeless and I could really feel Harry's emotions and I remember tearing up a lot while reading this.

It's not complete but it's been updating since 2011 and it's one of my favorites. Slight spoiler for the pairing- it's tagged as HP/TR(which isn't my favorite with the age difference) but nothing has happened with it yet.

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5102870/1/The-Double-Agent]])

Harry's the older brother of the BWL. He had joined Voldemort, and he just died and his family are viewing the memories revealing what happened.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5103614/chapters/11740079]])

I read this and Antithesis at almost the same time so whenever I see one I think of the other. Harry and Nevilles roles are switched, so Harry's parents are the ones in st. Mungos. Harry is obsessed with trying to heal his parents with transfiguration. His mental state kind of goes a bit wonky and I would tear up when people would try to help him but he couldn't understand.

*** Damn we share a lot in taste! Sadly I've already read all of these.... TT

I check The Train to Nowhere WEEKLY for updates, it is just that damn good. You are so right about the feeling of hopelessness. You just see all the happiness, energy and life being sucked out of Harry day by day and the moment you think it couldn't possibly get worse the fic proves you wrong. Ngl I have a bit of a soft spot for well written Tomarry/Harrymort, it's a rare beast, but so damn good when you find it.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

** The Many Deaths of Harry Potter by ShayneT linkffn(12388283)

Basically, when Harry dies he returns to a "respawn" point a bit before his death. The problem is that, for example, when he's spent one "life" making alliances with other students and then dies, all that work is gone and they don't even trust him any more. I couldn't even read the whole thing because it was breaking my heart.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28860678][Pandemic]] is new and sad but more in the gritty melancholy sense than in the angsty sense. Superb writing, the best characterizations I have read in ages and a unique story.

If you are prepared by Cybele fits a lot of your requests also but I guess you must have already read it since it's old and popular.

**** one more for you. this is really, really old and not hosted on Ao3 so maybe a chance you didn't read it yet. Sushi's [[http://www.noiresensus.com/authors/a_sushi.html][Civil War series]]. For Pandemic, if the main fic isn't clicking maybe try one of the side stories like Hold the Line or A Horse With No Name first. If they're not for you then I'd just skip it overall.

  Harry has some weird words on his left wrist. That must be one of those strange things that Aunt Petunia hates so much. But it's okay! He likes them.Then, it all turns even weirder. Hogwarts, magic, a Headmaster and a Dark Lord await Harry - he would prefer if they all just left him alone, thank you very much.But when has it ever mattered what Harry wants?

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride.

I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

Millennium have passed by and his age never changes, his skin cannot stay pierced, his body cannot die; thus locking his soul, binding him forever to this existence.

** I don't know if the fic overall is "sad", but I just finished reading Charlie Weasley and the Department of Mysteries. I really like it because it has a detailed and serious depiction of addiction, mental illness and family struggles. It's maybe not as sad as some character death fics, but I found the quality and premise to be amazing and that it's a darker and grittier portrayal than many other fics I've read.

** And the Wolves All Cry by monroeslittle is one of the saddest fics I've read. Throughout it I was trying not to cry, but by the end I was balling. It's what would've happened if Snape never heard the prophecy and Voldemort never learned of it. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8809533/1/And-the-Wolves-All-Cry][And all the Wolves Cry]]
