Essentially the title.

Give me fics that just absolutely blew your mind and made you question everything you think you know.

Any ship except ones with Snape and a minor.

Thanks in advance :)


** I feel like this isn't what you are looking for, but I sorta took a little while to stare at a wall and had a break in fanfiction for a little while...

“Hi my name is Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that's how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears”

+sob please spare yourself+

This one, well, it's dark. If you start reading it, just know that her writing improves a lot as the story goes along.

I loved how they wrote Tom, and some others in the story. Their personalities were spot on, and overall, it was a fun read.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2137872][Pandemic]] The real toll of mental health during the pandemic struck me hard when reading the series. As somebody who is more or less close to Harry's situation - living alone, same age group - this really sent me thinking hard about my life and what I want to do after the world goes to normal.

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.
