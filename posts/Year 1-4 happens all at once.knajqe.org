I'm unsure if this has been written before, but it's curious. What if Dumbledore had put the stone in Hogwarts in the same year that Lucius had slipped the diary into Ron's cauldron. What if Sirius escaped and the triwizard tournament had also taken place at the same time too? Obviously you'd need to take a pick for defense professors and which one. Either Lockhart or Quirrell I could see being possessed as the first is an idiot whereas the second did it in the first book anyway. You could possibly have them all in Hogwarts doing different things. Swap the caretaker with one of them? Have Moody there as a guard. Harry would obviously be involved in all four activities and would struggle immensely. Maybe have Tom Riddle be chosen by the goblet after he's killed Ron. Cerberus vs Basilisk fight? The more I think on this, the more it feels like a crack fic.


** Harry knew he shouldn't have tried out a spell before he got to Hogwarts, but he didn't know it'd be this bad. Perhaps "Modus Durum" the "Hard Mode" spell was not a good choice. Perhaps if he'd stuck with Wingardium Leviosa, things wouldn't have been this bad.

** Wow, I think this would have to be set in fourth year because any earlier I dont think Harry would be competent enough for the Tournament.

But this would be a really interesting fic idea, it could be a crack, but it doesn't have to either it could be a decent drama with just absurd amount of bad things keep happening to Harry.

Now just need someone to write itXD cuz i've never seen a fic like that

** Hmm this would be pretty fascinating. Between books 1-4 I dont think the main conflict was dependent storywise.

The reason lucius ditched the diary was because Arthur was doing raids at his house. I could be wrong but I think the raids were not because of anything that happened in book 1.

I'm almost certain book 3 is independent of 1 and 2 because Sirius escaped when he saw Peter on rons shoulder when the Weasleys won 1000 galleons. This could have happened in any year tbh.

And the tri wizard tournament was pretty random. Nothing in books 1-3 really set it in motion.

I think you'd either have to deage ginny or change her personality abit more or have a different character writing in the diary.

The only things that would be kind of hard to tie in are quirrel Pettigrew and Barty crouch Jr working together. I guess delay Sirius getting the newspaper and have Peter leave the Weasleys of his own volition? Then the events of book 4 could work if Peter finds voldemort then voldemort possesses quirrel anyway. They still break out crouch Jr. Moody is captured. Voldemort sends Peter back to hogwarts to be a spy within the castle.

So quirrel still attempts to steal the stone in the beginning of the year. Its hidden at hogwarts. Moody/crouch is defense teacher.

Actually maybe voldemort possesses quirrel then Peter senses voldemort that's when he goes to him they capture Bertha jorkins somewhere else and I think that could work.

Also voldemort could still went the stone as an extra push for his rebirth potion. Maybe it would make him extra powerful.

If anyone sees any plot holes lmk!

** The thing that immediately strikes me is there really is nothing stopping them happening at the same time because none are congruent on the others. Malfoy had the diary for years before book 1, and Sirius happened to see the paper by chance - the Weasleys could have won the lottery any year. Likewise, the Triwizard tournament could have come any year.

If I was to write this, the way I'd probably structure it would be:

- The Triwizard Tournament is happening to be held at Hogwarts this year, which is also the first year Harry Potter joins

- Harry /won't/ be competing in the Tournament; but it will be used as a convenient cover to 1) try and get some of Harry's blood and 2) release the Basilisk

- Ron, rather than Ginny, gets the Diary. This could go one of two ways:

a) Ron confides in the Diary and it embeds itself to him /pre/ Hogwarts, leading to Harry and Ron not becoming friends on the train, or

b) Ron isn't captivated by the Diary and leaves it laying around soon after Hogwarts and the Sorting, leading to it being picked up by one of the girls in his year - let's say Lavender Brown (one of my favorite characters)

- Quirrell stays as the Defense professor, but fake!Moody is also at the school as security... as is Lockhart, a celebrity judge for the tournament.

And it all goes from there.

His only option is ask help to his obnoxious cousin, Bellatrix, who ends up freeing all the other death eaters arrested in Azkaban in the process, causing a massive breakout.\\
As soon as the news about the dark lord's right hand escaped from Azkaban and leads an army of death eaters to kill Harry Potter, arrives at the ministry of magic, they decide to do the only thing that the ministry does in crisis situations, pretend that nothing happened.\\
In a strategy of bread and circuses, to divert the attention of the people from the crisis in Azkaban, the ministry decides to revive the tri wizard tournament.\\
They bring some students of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang to stage the competition and manipulate the goblet of fire to choose, specifically, the famous quidditch player and a creature with the literal power of hypnotize men's mind.\\
However, thinking that the breakout in Azkaban is a sign of voldemort's return, Lucius and the other death eaters who resigned Voldemort after his fall, decide to put Tom Riddle's diary( which Lucius already know what is), inside Hogwarts, to free the basilisk to petrify muggle borns and have a proof that their loyalty to Voldemort never wavered.\\
At the same time, Barty Crouch Jr, after hear about the breakout in Azkaban, also thought that this was a sign of Voldemort return. Enraged with his father for being put under the imperius curse for many years, Barty Crouch Jr. frees himself from the curse and attacks his father. Defeating him and using the poly juice, go to Hogwarts impersonating his father. In Hogwarts, he puts Harry's name in the goblet of fire for revenge for the boy destroying his master many years ago.\\
suddenly, harry's calm life at school turns to a hell, having to face a deadly tournament, an army of racist assassins and a mysterious creature petrifying his friends.
