I'm a pretty big fan of reading the books fics, a lot of which usually were on fictionhunt. Emphasis on were. Now, whenever I try to access them, or really anything on fictionhunt, it says it's been deleted. I can still read some of them on the Wayback machine, and it looks like the point of no return (the time when fics stopped being archived to the machine) was sometime in September 2019.

Anyone know what happened?

Edit: Grammar.


** None of those fics (as far as I know) are actually deleted. You need to login to read them.

** A lot of the owners for the more niche fanfiction sites moved on and stopped upkeeping them when they started to drop off in popularity.

Pretty much everything is on Ao3 now

** I think on that site you have to have an account and more stories will be available. Pretty sure that's what I did because I love those reading the books fics too
