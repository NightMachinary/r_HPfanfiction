To clarify, I mean "magic that enhances sex," not "sex-powered magic". The sex is the ends and the magic is the means, not the other way around. My experience with this fandom is that it tends to be *really* vanilla. Even if the smut's not the most important part of the story, I'm a little bored with the very muggle ways of getting it on.


** I don't see anyone else posting something so I'll link one.

In this fic your cavets are a bit muddied since the sex basically is the magic and there's a lot of it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic]]

It's not a smut fic. It's just a fic that doesn't shy away from the reality of what people would actually be doing with magic.

** In 'Below the Belt' linkao3(493374), Millicent Bulstrode runs a wizarding sex shop that Dudley Dursley stumbles into while looking for Harry.

It doesn't go into smut, but it does offer a funny and interesting glimpse into what a wizarding world sex shop might be like. The characterization and story is also very enjoyable.

  All Dudley wanted to do was deliver the letter and return to his perfectly normal, relatively pleasant existence. Luckily for him, fate and Millicent Bulstrode intervened.

Idk what you're expecting, but I would prefer going into detail about how you want Harry to enchant his dick with lightning to plough Hermione in the nostril.

** Not on ff.net, but [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=2950][Queens of Darkness, Ladies of Light]].

Harry's goal is to enslave the 7 most powerful women in history and the only way to do that is to have sex with them. Sadly it was abandoned after the 1st lady, but it was very high quality.
