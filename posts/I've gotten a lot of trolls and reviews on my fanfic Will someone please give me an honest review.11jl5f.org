** Sorry, you deserve to be trolled. The grammar's decent and things seem to be spelled correctly. But really, "Lillianiana Natayliana Cassidy Emeraldine DeLorean?" A freaking princess that's "part-veela, part-wizard, and part-mermaid?" The story is absolutely unbelievable, even to people who can suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy an imaginary parallel world that uses magic instead of science.

** Please, please let this be satire.

Its sad that I can't tell for sure if it is, since there is unfortunately legitimate fanfic out there like this.

If it isn't satire, I truly apologize for any hurt feelings, and I will give you a list of /good/ fanfic to read to help you improve.

** Even as troll fic, it's boring troll fic. The My Immortal style is so 2006, and that was actually funny. If you're going to troll, at least be a clever one or one too outrageous to be ignored. This is bad either way.

...and today I learn I'm elitist about troll fic.

** Actually, I'm not the person who wrote this. I just thought it was so bad so it should be shared. She has claimed it is not a parody.
