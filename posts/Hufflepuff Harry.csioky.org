I get it. It's wonderful.

But seriously, /every time?/

It's getting a bit annoying.

At least Slytherin was considered in the Canon so it's obvious people would write that so often (even if it's also getting ridiculous.)

But I see almost no Ravenclaw Harry these days and it's just sad to me.


** Weird I look for these stories but I can almost never find them (Even if I search "Hufflepuff harry fanfiction" on google. Slytherin Harry is the most common I come across and after that its Ravenclaw.

** Hufflepuff Harry is best Harry. I mean it's an alliteration, it's perfect.

** The secret of a Hufflepuff Harry is to make him interesting. BajaB did that by making Harry the hardest working Lazy kid in the world. I did it by putting a Sinanju trained Assassin Harry in with the 'Puffs.

I've been playing with one where Sprout grows all kinds of interesting plants in her greenhouses... Plants that come in handy at the legendary 'Puff parties, where it turns out the 'Puffs share EVERYTHING (and orgies ensue) though Harry tends to be dating a 'Puff and turns out to be the last one in the castle to find out about 'Puff parties and becomes The Man Who Was Molested.

Just make it different enough to attract attention.
