I would like to know Post War fics with them getting attracted to each other at some Point. Whether they have their Canon Partners or not doesnt matter, although i would like if they are single.

However, i could imagine, that during a Summer Vacation trip, while both are in their Swimsuits they get physical attracted to the other one. Smut is welcome. They can however have their Canon Family (children) and are mostly there to keep watch over them.

​

But i would also like Fleur being attracted to him (physically, not love) or tempting and teasing him.

Them sharing a Flat or Vacation house would also be good.

​

So, yeah, being Friend to the Boy-who-lived and Conquerer of Voldemort is, what makes him attractive in her eyes and she wouldnt mind at all share the Bed with him.

  After an exhausting month at work, Fleur was ready to enjoy the holiday with her husband until a sudden emergency call comes and an unexpected guest appears at her doorstep, derailing her whole life. Lemons.

  All is not as it seems in the Epilogue. HP/HG-W/FD-W -- Affair Fic -- PURE SMUT!
