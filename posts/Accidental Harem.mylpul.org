  Draco organizes a no-holds-barred poker game. Harry decides to compete... just a little fun fic co-written by Joshua. I might or might not write more on this.

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.

** There's a oneshot I can't seem to find anymore, where Harry figures out how to conjure food with correct flavor (which had previously been thought impossible), and a few girls who are present when he demonstrates this decide they're going to "share" him between them. It was on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], and the title was something like "what witches really want" (though don't rely too heavily on that exact wording if you try to find it).

Also, I'd recommend:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13055074/1/The-Nargles-are-flying-low-today]]

Where Harry is hanging out with Luna when going back for year 8 & things get silly from there.
