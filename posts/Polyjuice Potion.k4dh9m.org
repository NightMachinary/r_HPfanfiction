How exactly does the Polyjuice Potion work? What would happen if you taken a hair from someone when they were a child and waited a few years before brewing the potion, do you take their appearance when their a child or their present appearance. If you applied the same circumstances to yourself from the question above could you take your younger appearance and look like a younger version of yourself? Can you combine two hairs from different people? What if the hair was from an animagus when they were in their animal form, do they look like the animal or the person. If you answer these questions I'll greatly appreciate it.


** Since it replicates injury in the case of Mad-Eye, I'm going to say it probably is the person as they were when the hair was plucked.

As for mixing hairs or animal forms, I'll point to cat Hermione. In those cases, I imagine there would be horrible magical accidents.

** I believe it's established that you take the form as it was when the hair was plucked.

There is a good oneshot that uses this that is one of my favourites of all time:\\

** I remember one fic (now deleted) where Umbridge was hiding her Dark Mark from the Ministry by Polyjuicing into her pre-Mark self with hair stored in advance.

*** That's actually a smart idea although I suppose at some point you will run out of pre mark hairs?

Neither. Polyjuice only works with new hairs, not old ones. It's why Moody was kept alive in GoF.

#+end_quote

No. Polyjuice only works with new hairs.

#+begin_quote
  Can you combine two hairs from different people?
#+end_quote

No. It would probably make the drinker of the potion a horrific blend of both people.

Since Polyjuice only works with human hair, it would probably end up similarly to cat!Hermione
