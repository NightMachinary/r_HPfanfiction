How would that affect things?

Harry's strong will attempts to control Voldemort, so they're both struggling over the body

Voldemort is able to fully control Harry, but in doing so becomes saner in the process.

Voldemort ends up learning love and empathy because of being inside Harry's body.

Or maybe a mixture or a completely different idea then those 3?
