I'm look for a good H/G fic that explores either one of the following ideas:

1-Fic showing a 3rd party (someone new to the extended family/friend) meeting Harry and/or Ginny for the first time and seeing their reactions

-or-

2-A fic showing Ginny's teammates reacting to either Ginny or finding out she is dating Harry.

I've run across one or two, but I'm sure there are more out there and I've been curious to read more.

Thanks!


** The second is, well, canon already, because they kissed in front of the entire house and team after their victory.

** It's not the focus of the story but my fic has an OC who is equally star struck by Harry and Ginny. linkffn(The Aurors)

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...
