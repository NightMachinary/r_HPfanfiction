I had it saved but phone broke. Hermione and Ron just had Rose but due to a some sort of magical mirror, they go back in time to when they were 11. Rose comes along and they have to take care of her, concince people they are adults in 11 year old bodies, and defeat Voldemort.

This has one of my favorite quotes in a story ever. "I tried to breastfeed her, then I realized I'm eleven years old and don't have breasts!" -- Hermione. Her entire rant about being a "bad mother" is gold.

*** Thanks! The situation is made hilarious by Rose. And Harry's reaction when his two best friends start kissing in their 11 year old bodies always cracks me up

  Rose is just born and Al is due. But after finding an ancient mirror, Harry, Ron, Hermione and baby Rose are sent back into their 11-year-old bodies the night before they first met. Trapped in the past and wary of the Wizarding World, they seek to kill Voldemort as soon as possible. Together Harry, Ron and Hermione shall show the past who the Golden Trio really are.

*** It wasn't terrible but didn't blip on my reread radar. Then again i'm not a huge fan of kid-fics. It did have its funny moments.
