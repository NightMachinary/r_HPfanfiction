Some of my ideas:

Canon Bellatrix Lestrange ends up trapped the year Tom Riddle Jr is born, and decides to raise him. Alternatively, Bellatrix finds out he's a Half-Blood and kills him, becoming a "Dark Lady or Mistress" in the process. (What would a Tom Riddle Jr who knew loved, however twisted it was, be like?). Or what would happen if Tom Riddle Jr and Bellatrix ended up in power?

Canon Lucius Malfoy ends up in the past and ends up getting the Prophecy during the whole Ministry fiasco, and showing it to Voldemort.

Canon Narcissa ends up in the past and begs Dumbledore Draco's protection.

Or AU Worlds:

Canon Bellatrix ends up in an alternate universe where Dumbledore is the leader of the dark (promoting Pureblood ideals and hating on Muggles and Muggleborns), while Tom Riddle Jr is the one that is leader of the light.

Canon Lucius ends up in an AU where Harry Potter was sorted into Slytherin, and raised by the Malfoys.

Or any other ideas you have for the bad guys for either Time Travel or going to another universe? Any ideas at all, that are normally used for the good guys?

Feel free to take someone's idea, make it into drabbles, oneshots or a multichapter. Feel free to post the chapter if you decide to either do one of mine or someone else's idea.

** If you don't mind a crossover with Game of Thrones, Vincent Crabbe Saves Westeros by Ynyr qualifies.

A non-crossover would be Bundle of Joy linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15239844]])
