  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

*** :( I tried reading this one and stopped after a few chapters. It's immediately rushing into standard fanfic Dumbledore!bashing, Harry/Hermione are rebellious and so hard, and also beauxbatons and durmstrang are cooler and more accepting than hogwarts. Also obnoxious werewolf fanon stuff with MOONY! being an actual separate personality in remus's body that he "shoves in his cage" and stuff.

**** Yeah, she is using a lot of tropes, there. It's still better than half the crappy werewolf fics that once can find, though.

  The night that Harry and Hermione used her Time Turner to rescue Sirius Black, everything went wrong. Instead of Sirius flying a hippogriff to freedom, Harry and Hermione were bitten by Remus Lupin.
