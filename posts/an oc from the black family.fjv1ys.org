** As Black As Night by Roses and Lavender features a daughter of Sirius as a main character. Story is based around the fall of the House of Black. It's a pretty good read and I recommend it.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17573267/chapters/41417477][Cassiopeia by SynBarron (SamBarron)]]

OC is Sirius older sister. She brings a lot of positive change to the situation and the Black family.

** Bad Blood by MissLuxe on ffnet only has one or two chapters but features the daughter of Bellatrix, raised by the Tonks family I believe. It seems promising so far.
