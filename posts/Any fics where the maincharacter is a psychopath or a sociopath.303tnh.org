Could be Harry, Tom, an OC, anyone really. Preferably novel length but anyone is fine. edit: serial killer is good too if possible


** There's "Intoxication", a 30k word story by nos tres reges. I'm not sure why it was removed from FFN, but I hope it's alright to post this link here (ePub file):

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]] features a Harry traumatized by some fairly interesting crossover characters. Absolutely terrifying if you saw Hellraiser as a child. The "OCs" in this fic could definitely be counted as having psychopathic tendencies.

**** I thought the interjections about Harry not fearing LV b/c he had a better understanding of 'true terror' or 'pure evil' were an interesting addition to a series that seems to hold up TMR as the end-all-be-all of evilness when he's clearly not.

I found that one while reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1594791/1/Backwards-Compatible][Backwards Compatible]], which I found to be a pretty well done time travel fic.

  Five minutes pass before the neighbors decide to call triple nine; another ten before the fire-engine arrives. The Dursleys were dead long before that. Psychopath!Intelligent!Harry.

  When Petunia had to allow her hated nephew into her home, she'd expected troubles to arise sooner or later. Nothing though could have prepared her for the reality of what was to come. The boy sleeping under her roof, eating her food, wasting her money, was no normal child, oh no. It was an evil little demon hiding beneath innocent features. My take on sociopath!Harry.

  AU. Silence of the Lambs/Hannibal inspired. After recent events in his life, Hermione refers Harry to the renowned psychiatrist, Doctor T. Riddle. He is unlike anything Harry ever expected or imagined, and soon proves to be a great help against the very shadows and name that haunts his waking hours. If only it remained that simple.

** I wouldn't strictly say that this main character's a sociopath, but has a different moral compass to everyone else (through no fault of his own).

If you've even got a passing interest in D&D, you should enjoy this. I started reading it about a month after I started my first campaign and love it.

** I know that you're probably looking for a good narrative and characters, etc, but if you're not, then I can point you to the majority of the fanfics on ff.net where the characters are psychopathic/sociopathic in an insane, fantastic world. Enjoy
