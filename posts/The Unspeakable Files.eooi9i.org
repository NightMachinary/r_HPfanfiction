So, there's a book series by Charles Stross called the Laundry Files. For those of you who haven't heard of it, imagine if the British Civil Service (a tired, lumbering old beast of a bureaucracy) had a department specifically for those extra-dimensional, mind-bending horrors that go bump in the night. Cthulhu and his ilk, essentially. The protagonist is a tech-support guy named after the writer of Conan the Barbarian who just gets further and further from the office and further and further into the fucked up. Which again, is one and the same in the Laundry. Their night shift consists of the reanimated corpses of Officers who die in the line of duty, for instance.

Are there any fics like that about the Unspeakables? Where they fight off existential threats on a day to day basis, and the paperwork causes as much existential dread as the mind-bending horrors? If not, there totally should be. Pretty please write one. Pretty please with a mind-rending multi-dimensional cherry on top? :)


** I'd love to see a fic have Arithmancy (at least at advanced levels) actually work like in the Laundry Files.
