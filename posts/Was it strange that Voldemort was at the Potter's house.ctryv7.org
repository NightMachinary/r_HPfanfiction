I mean I could be wrong but I was under the impression that he normally sent others to do the dirty work unless the people were particularily important. Because of the prophecy Lilly and James were but the public didnt know that. So were the Potters just so well known for being a pain for Voldy that him going to their house personally to kill them wasn't even that suprising? Or was it just something that wasnt really talked about much and then people just assumed they must have been important enough because Voldemort showed up to kill them and their infant phased him out of existence.


** Voldemort killed a few people personally. Off the top of my head there was Dorcas Meadowes and Amelia Bones.

*** Oh ya for sure but it seems to be uncommon for him to.do it himself so would it be odd he did? To the public?

** They'd already "defied" Voldemort three times per the prophecy and were in the Order. James was a rich pureblood who loudly made his views about everything clear; Lily was a brilliant Muggle-born whose mere existence was a thumb in the eye to what Voldemort stood for; they were both close to Dumbledore.

Prophecy or no prophecy, Horcrux plans or no Horcrux plans, they were probably important enough for Voldemort to say "I'm doing this one myself."

** The latter. Doubt they cared all that much, tbh.

** Sometimes you can't trust your minions to do a good job and you have to do it yourself. He knew his members were kinda useless and skipped the middle man.

** It's my understanding that Voldemort appeared with his Death Eaters fairly often, and killed plenty of people himself. I mean, Lily and James definitely fought him three different times, so I don't think it's that odd for him to go and kill them personally. I'm pretty sure it's also mentioned that Voldemort did this with other people as well, but I might be wrong about that.

** They were well-known and popular even setting the war aside. They'd have been known not to be kowtowing to Voldemort during the war, but I don't think that there would have been anything about their participation that set them apart from the Prewetts or Longbottoms, for example. Remember that the wizarding community is a very close-knit one. You'd know everyone of any import at all by reputation, and most of them by sight.

But yes, it's mostly because their baby killed a terrorist dictator.
