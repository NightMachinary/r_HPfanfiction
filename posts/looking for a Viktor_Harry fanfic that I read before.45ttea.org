I cant find a story I read before. What i remeber about it is Viktor's Best friend who is considered an adoptive brother with to the tournament. In one scene Harry races with some of Viktor's friends around the black lake and those who werent racing shot spells as obsticals. The giant squid's tenticals also almost causes them to crash. In another scene the best friend/brother does a spell so on all the bulgarions on the deck of the ship. They were surounded by color and the color depended on if they believed Harry put his name in the cup and if they were angry. Please help me find this!
