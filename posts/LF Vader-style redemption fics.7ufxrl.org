So I just read a fic (which I absolutely do not recommend as it has all the usual OP Harry cliches) where Rabastan Lestrange has a bastard son and tries to convert him to the "dark side". While the author had so many opportunities to make this storyline great (I wouldn't have minded a copy/paste of that finale in ROTJ), he/she squanders it by making it very anticlimactic, nonsensical, and brief.

So to see this kind of thing done right, are there any fics where a dark character redeems him/herself by doing a selfless act and saying "fuck it, I'm saving this person"?

***** Oh, I love your fic Divided and Entwined! Masterful, and one of my favorite war fics (my only gripe is that I prefer H/Hr but thats just a personal nitpick). I look forward to reading this one!

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
