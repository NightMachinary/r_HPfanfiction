This is something I've been thinking about for a while. I realised that it just doesn't make sense that purebloods are the ones becoming terrorists (essentially) and killing masses and murdering people. Purebloods are rich, have the most political influence and while they may not outnumber Muggleborns and half-bloods, they are very clearly the dominant power in the Wizarding World. They're not religiously inspired, either. So why did they become terrorists?

In the history of terrorism, you don't really see groups of privileged people rising up against a group of people who are already oppressed. You see it the other way around, groups of oppressed minorities rising up against a greater power. These people rarely have another alternative, whether that is reality or how they perceive it. Either their government will never allow the changes they want, or there is an external, powerful force they can never defeat politically or economically. Purebloods of the Wizarding World are capable of both of these. We see it in how Lucius changes laws to better suit his cause--hell, he has the Minister of Magic in his pocket. We see it in his wealth, his mansion and even his (ex) house elf.

So the only reason, really, that a pureblood would become a Death Eater is if they revel in torturing and killing Muggleborn and Muggles--a Death Eater, really, is the most sadistic of the sadistic, and the stupidest of the stupid, operating out in the relative open to crusade for immediate change, when they could try for gradual, political change to suit their cause, and potentially reach the same, if not better, outcome. Probably very likely, too, given how politics in the Wizarding World seems to work. There are no elections, and if there are, they are by the Wizengamot. And the Wizengamot, though I am uncertain as to how it works, could be rigged as well--they were, after all, bribed enough to let Lucius walk on the 'Imperius' excuse.

And even if purebloods become Death Eaters just to torture Muggles and Muggleborn, it doesn't make sense. These guys are the elite. They're mostly Slytherins, too. They go for self-preservation, cunning and all that. Put it this way, if you have a shit ton of money, and you could hire a bunch of mercenaries to do your dirty work for you, would you fight yourself? Would you put your neck on the line, your reputation on the line, your soul on the line (Dementors)? They could just as easily hire some dirt of society to kidnap a Muggleborn or two once in a while, so they can get off on whatever it is they want to do to them. They don't need to get out there and do it themselves and risk getting caught.

The whole concept of Purebloods as Death Eaters should never have worked. Muggleborn as Death Eaters? Sure. They're oppressed and some may be desperate enough to do it. But Purebloods? Self-preserving, rich and politically powerful? It doesn't quite make sense to me.

Thoughts, anyone?

*Edit: Some minor grammatical errors and adding some stuff.

**Edit: Okay, just going to sum up some stuff here about the discussion (and to make an apology): Firstly, the political situation before Voldemort started causing mayhem was a lot more complex than I'd assumed (there was a Muggleborn Minister of Magic, Squib Rights marches, etc.), so I stand corrected on the notion that purebloods were 'very clearly the dominant power', because they weren't. They were being threatened politically and there was apparently quite a bit of social unrest when the Muggleborn MoM was elected, too.

Secondly, and the main reason why I'm editing the post and doing this 'sum up' thing. I've gotten a few comments regarding my statement that: 'In the history of terrorism, you don't really see groups of privileged people rising up against a group of people who are already oppressed. You see it the other way around, groups of oppressed minorities rising up against a greater power. These people rarely have another alternative, whether that is reality or how they perceive it.' It was a really broad statement, and because of how broad it was, it was inaccurate as well, as people have politely pointed out to me. I think some people were a little annoyed with me for making such a sweeping statement, particularly when there are really prominent terrorist organisations that don't fit into this statement (e.g., IS and KKK as FloreatCastellum listed). So I do want to apologise if I offended anyone by apparently disregarding these organisations. I have laid out my reasoning below, but it was still quite tactless of me to simply make such a statement.

That being said, everyone was pretty polite about it, and I really enjoyed the discussion. I've learnt a lot just from this discussion about both terrorism and the HP world, so that's a great way to mix study and play, I guess? And although I doubt there will be many more users commenting, given that this post is now relatively old, if anyone has anything more they want to add, I'd love to hear it. Again, guys, thanks for being polite about a sensitive topic.

Sorry, but I think you're forgetting a few terrorist groups, like the KKK or random hate groups that entrap and torture gay people in Russia & Eastern Europe. The people in these groups are often working class, but often, especially in the case of the KKK, are made up of esteemed members of society in highly privileged positions. There's even an argument that modern-day ISIS terrorists are organised and led by people that grew up in rather privileged lives, with high levels of education and tech-savviness.

Anyway, I did mention below my views on religious terrorism, which in short, is that religion is one of the few things that is able to easily transcend social classes, particularly in a country dominated by one religion, and therefore, I consider religious terrorism to be very distinct from other forms of terrorism, especially the ethnic terrorism we see in the Harry Potter world.

*** Well, the KKK were formed around the time the black political movement was gaining power, I believe. In this case, privileged people were lashing out at a threat to their power, at people who were slowly breaking free of their oppression. Although, [[/u/turbinicarpus]] does raise a point that I hadn't really considered before. I'd always assumed that nothing really changed in the Muggleborn political movement, which was a bit silly of me.

I also probably should have been more specific, but to me, religious terrorism is very distinct from other forms of terrorism. Religious terrorism is just so different from ethnic terrorism, ethno-national terrorism or other forms of terrorism, because it's driven by belief in something that is beyond any of us. Because of that, it more easily transcends social class, particularly in an age where social divisions are becoming increasingly blurred, or in a country where a most of the population follow one religion.

The Death Eaters were probably founded in the late 50s or 60s. The first muggleborn MoM was elected in 1962. You can see how they could think their power was being threatened.

** In a nutshell, dominant groups often react aggressively, even violently, when they perceive their dominance being threatened or eroded, even if that perception is inaccurate (i.e., created by propaganda) or if those threatening it are merely asking for equality. Rise of the Ku Klux Klan during the Reconstruction after the American Civil War is one very clear example. (There are many others, but they would be either less familiar or more controversial.)

The canon books cover a very short time frame from a very limited perspective, but from Pottermore and other sources, the wizarding society is shown to be moving in the direction of blood-equality among wizards and at least some respect for Muggles. For example, it's implied that activities like muggle-hunting used to be legal (presumably if they didn't endanger the Statute of Secrecy), but support for legalizing it is considered a fringe idea by the time the story starts. Similarly Nobby Leach was the first Muggleborn Minister for Magic, serving in mid 1960s, which coincided with Death Eaters' rise, the actual fighting beginning shortly after.

That a lot of this might have felt like it was being pushed on them by Dumbledore probably further increased the pureblood supremacists' resentment. But, of course, they couldn't publicly challenge the popularity and the authority of the Headmaster of Hogwarts and defeater of Grindelwald; and they certainly couldn't challenge both him and the Ministry in magic, either, so violent means were out, and they were forced to bide their time and content themselves with trying to poison the Muggleborn Minister.

Enter Voldemort, who could match Dumbledore spell for spell. This made violence appear to be a feasible way to accomplish their goal of restoring their supremacy, so they put on masks and began their terrorist campaign.

** You're referring to fanon here, not canon.

Firstly, in canon, there is no evidence that purebloods (and especially pureblood supremacists) have any kind of grip on political power. A Muggleborn was elected Minister for Magic in 1962, people react to the word "mudblood" in much the same way as they react to "nigger" in the Muggle world. All evidence points towards the wizarding world absent Voldemort being about as progressive about blood as the Muggle world is about race.

Secondly, in canon, the Death Eaters do not go around mindlessly attacking wizards. The fanon-favourite of attacks on Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade do not occur. They serve no strategic purpose. The terrorist-style attacks the Death Eaters do perform are performed against /Muggles/, not wizards. When it comes to wizards, the Death Eaters are more about individual assassinations. That's how Mr Weasley described the way they used the Dark Mark - you'd come home to find it over your house. It's also how we heard of the Death Eaters picking off Order members one by one. And after OotP, it's how we hear they're picking off individual members of the Ministry who are troublesome like Amelia Bones.

*** To your first point, well, I was just about to write down an answer, before I thought of something that blew holes in my own argument, so that's awkward.

For your second argument, well, the thing is, terrorism isn't necessarily about large-scale attacks. If you go by the Google definition of terrorism, it's: 'the unofficial or unauthorized use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.'

Nowhere in there does it mention that terrorism needs to be large-scale attacks the likes of which it's been associated with in more recent times. So, really, Voldemort's tactics that are meant to (and do) inspire fear and intimidation for political aims are very much acts of terrorism, even if he refrained from large-scale attacks in the Wizarding world.

**** That it could still be called terrorism doesn't mean much. Your argument was very much based on the fact that terrorism in the sense of large scale attacks against the general population was counter-productive for socially dominant purebloods. A handful of targeted assassinations, however, while potentially still terrorism, do not have anything like the same effect. There's nothing that doesn't make sense about a political faction eliminating specific figures who stand between them and greater power. It's Coup 101.

***** The targeted assassinations did still have their risks, e.g., Amelia Bones who Voldemort had to defeat himself. A Death Eater would almost certainly have died fighting her. Maybe in a group they could have taken her, but I think she would have at least been able to take down a few before she was killed, too. Their form of terrorism, while not as large-scale and perhaps less risky, still had its risks nonetheless.

Wouldn't it be easier to hire someone? It'd be much safer for them to do so, as long as they take the steps to hide their identity. The job would be done, and they could guarantee their social positions and lives.

You refer to "purebloods" where I believe you mean "Lucius Malfoy". It's a common mistake in the fandom, because the only notable pureblood families in the series we have a lot of information about are the Malfoys, Weasleys, and Blacks.

*** It's true we don't see a lot of notable purebloods in canon. Another one I can think of are the Lestranges, who we do see are quite rich in the last book. I'm sure before they were all incarcerated that they would have been prominent political figures, too (maybe not Bellatrix, she seems a tad too insane for politics).

Basing off what little information I can see from canon, though, I do think that purebloods are in general, very influential. I mentioned in the original post that Lucius was able to walk free, likely due to bribery, which suggests that the Wizengamot also had a fair share of pureblood supporters. And I imagine that predominantly, pureblood supporters are pureblood, as well. So together, that paints a picture of well-off, influential purebloods who control a significant portion of Wizengamot seats, at least enough that they are able to overrule any other members that vote Lucius guilty.

Well, no, it suggests that there are members of the Wizengamot who are willing to accept bribes. That in no way requires them to have any feelings one way or the other on the pureblood supremacy issue.

My point is that you're suggesting that rich pureblood families like the Malfoys are able to influence the government because they're pureblood, whereas I'm suggesting that it's because they're rich. That's the impression the books give too. Quoth Order of the Phoenix:

***** Sorry, should have been more clear about that. My logic is that after such a bloody war, half-bloods and Muggle-borns would be less likely to accept bribes from a suspected Death Eater, because they may have lost family and friends to Death Eaters, or have been targeted themselves. The ones most likely to accept the bribes are purebloods, which does point to a largely pureblood-dominated judicial system.

I will admit that my reasoning is based a lot on assumption, though, and quite a fair bit of generalising. The quote by Mr Weasley also does point to gold being the major form of incentive here. I may be wrong here, but I also don't recall the elder Weasleys talking a lot about pureblood politics or the whole ideology behind pureblood supremacy. In fact, I don't know if he's said 'pureblood' in the entire book, at least not when Harry could hear him. It's possible that the Weasley parents just preferred not to talk about pureblood supremacy in front of children/teenagers.

****** People are less likely to accept bribes if they have integrity. Anything other than that is based on whether the amount of gold they are getting is enough to stopgap the distaste they feel because of the act itself. And while that does mean Lucius Malfoy would have to spend more in bribes if the people he had to bribe were muggleborns, for as long as those people had no integrity there would still be nothing more than gold that he'd need for it.

And as for the reason the Weasleys don't talk much about it, it has nothing to do with “supremacy” and all to do with their distaste of the way the other purebloods approach blood purity; they are, after all, one of the “Sacred Twenty-Eight”, which to an outsider's eye marks them as enthusiastic supporters of blood purity despite the fact that had they been left alone they wouldn't care about that issue and as it is it was only by chance that they qualified.

And even if he couldn't, I suppose he could have had an ally blackmail some of the Wizengamot in his stead. If he had blackmail on them, which we don't really know, but I do hope Lucius isn't so stupid as to not use some of his resources to prepare blackmail against the members of the Wizengamot when he was highly involved in illicit activity.

As for the how the Weasleys don't talk about it, I'm afraid I don't quite understand what you're trying to say about it. Just to clarify, I was trying to say that the Weasleys don't talk about pureblood supremacy in front of children not because they secretly support the ideology or anything, but because they dislike the whole thing and would rather not expose their children to it.

** To me, the whole Potter story had echoes of Germany in World War II all through it; one guy gets it in his head that certain citizens are better than others, is pretty witty with his words and gathers a following, uses fear tactics to get what he wants, expects certain things of the members of his inner circle.

Hitler was essentially the devil, but I've read a few of his speeches and he was certainly persuading. It was all about the Us vs Them mentality, and when people start getting scared of Them, they become quite easy to manipulate. And those that didn't buy into the fear became traitors to the cause and would be punished accordingly.

I was watching a documentary the other night and one of the head guys at Auschwitz literally couldn't understand that what he'd done was wrong, that's how ingrained the mentality becomes (which is horrifying).

I can see how Voldemort would have played on the fear of what muggles would do to wizards if they knew about them (we've all heard of the Salem Witch Trials) so I imagine he went for the 'we better kill them before they kill us' route (like Magneto in Xmen).

** Well no, that's not really the case here. The Death Eaters we see the most of in canon are the highest-ranked members of them all. We have Snape, potions master and intelligence asset, Malfoy, the political arm of the movement, Bellatrix, Voldemort's student, fenrir greyback, the dude that specialises in hunting humans and so on and so forth.

Key point here is that these guys aren't frontliners. They're part of the Dark Lord's inner circle-often because they bring something to the table others cannot. They're the group's primary source of money, training, intelligence and so on. Seeing them in the field is pretty much a statement that shit has hit the fan so hard ole Tommy's fielding his best. And every time they go, the group is exposed to a massive amount of risk as losing even one of them could well cripple the whole spiel in a significant and enduring manner.

My headcanon is that the average Death Eater in both wars was actually closer to a snatcher in terms of threat than someone of an inner circle member's calibre-skilled enough to fight a single enemy head on and part of a large enough group that they can easily overwhelm the defences of even the strongest individual fighter.

They would be poor purebloods that don't have enough conventional skills to make it in the wizarding world or enough flexibility to thrive in the muggle world. They're trapped by the world they were born into and resent the fact that mudbloods can easily skip between both sides of what is to them an unbridgeable divide. That resentment can easily fester. Added to the enticements the Dark Lord would give to sweeten the deal as well as the opportunities for knowledge and loot supporting YKW can bring and they would line up to volunteer. For them, they get to satisfy their prejudices one mass grave at a time and improve their social & professional prospects in the process. Two birds with one avada kedavra right there.

Bear in mind that terrorists aren't just composed of fanatics. Their backbone lies with the disaffected and embittered masses that recognise that the payout for helping these guys win would be massive and are desperate enough to try no matter the odds. And with the huge wealth and influence the inner circle commanded, their chances were pretty damn good.

Bear in mind that Voldemort's reasons for chosing purebloods is actually not as clear cut to me than most. In my mind, Voldemort doesn't care about ideology so much as attaining power. He was, after all, an orphaned, muggle-raised halfblood. Every time a death eater extols the virtues of murdering those exposed to muggle taint, they are unwittingly calling for the death of their own leader.

I believe he was faced with a choice between which side to take under his wing and he chose the one that afforded the easiest and most abundant pool of recruits and resources to take advantage of. Once the fight was done, I give it a fifty-fifty chance that he would have turned on the purebloods in order to eliminate any chances of there being a rebellion after he assumed ultimate power over the wizarding world.

Also, he got to turn the offspring of his erstwhile bullies and detractors into either targets or cannon fodder, so that must have been a plus to him.

*** I'm finding myself agreeing to most of what you said here. I've never thought about it from that perspective, but it does make a lot of sense. The Inner Circle would probably be the ones Voldemort spent the most time cultivating, which seems really obvious now that you've pointed it out, but I always subconsciously assumed otherwise, probably because of how they're portrayed in the books, I think. The only real battle between Death Eaters and Harry that we see is in the Department of Mysteries in OotP, and maybe a little bit in the seventh book, and it doesn't exactly paint a good picture of the Death Eaters. I guess I ended up assuming that because they weren't that competent, that Voldemort didn't spend much time on them? And because many of them ended up blending in with others in fight scenes, I just thought all Death Eaters and supporters to be on the same skill level, and my mind generalised that they were probably of the same background, if that makes sense.

The only point I'm disagreeing with you on is Voldemort's reasons for choosing purebloods, which, honestly, is really only a matter of a difference between our headcanons. In my opinion, his reasons could have gone both ways--either he picked them for their resources and his ability to exploit them, or he picked them because he really wanted to move away from the whole being abandoned by his Muggle father and (at the minimum) ostracised in his Muggle orphanage. Or it could have been a combination of both. But I think that at the point where the series starts, he was unstable enough to be unable to discern between the ideology he spouted to the wider world and his Death Eaters, and the fact that he, fifty or sixty years ago, chose them for how easy they were to manipulate. In other words, he may have chosen them fifty years ago for other reasons, but at the end of the books, I think he'd already forgotten the true reason.

**** Yeah, it took me a while to reconcile the idea that the Deaters in the books were the core of a movement that almost overran wizarding Britain under Dumbledore's nose little more than a decade beforehand as well. It helps if you remember that they only take the stage after 15 years of inactivity, their leader just had his psyche wrecked by virtue of being Wraithed and their first venture in the public world was to carry out a dumbass operation that almost saw Lestrange get murdered by a fucking teenager. Seriously, that was the worst planned/thought out intelligence retrieval operation in fiction (non-fiction is a very different story on the other hand).

And the battle of Hogwarts shouldn't have happened at all. The Deaters had the numbers, the high ground and the magical power to blow the wards. Why didn't they use some of that super magical artillery to soften up the opposition before charging in? One extra salvo would have shattered the defenders' front line and another would have taken down a large number of the best defensive positions available. Hell,a spot of fiendfyre would have killed most if not all of thse defending the gates,leaving the way clear for the auxiliary units to rampage across the school. Instead, we get an object lesson as to what happens when a group that specialises in quick skirmishes with a clear numerical advantage over their opponents attempts to fight a pitched battle against an entrenched foe... though they would still have won if they hadn't stopped to gawk at the Voldie-HP confrontation, which I found equally frustrating.

Point being, the Death eaters come off as clumsy because they're not fighting their standard engagements in canon with the notable exception of the book six Hogwarts infiltration. That was more their speed-probably one of their staple approaches to assassination at that. They were fast, smooth and didn't miss a beat apart from the pre facto gloating they indulged in. That kind of thing means skill and experience, which showcases that they can be dangerous badasses when doing something they've prepared for properly.

In every other instance, they're fighting under unfamiliar circumstances and are forced to adapt on the fly, which is a recipe for disaster when you're usually the one that sets the rules of engagement and pace a battle follows.

What's even worse is their off screen competence. They take the ministry and, a few months later, all resistance has been practically crushed with nary a peep of a serious confrontation happening before the battle of Hogwarts. They set up a simple trap using a taboo word that nets them the golden trio. In a pitched battle against a huge number of determined and capable defenders, they come within spitting distance of total victory despite the odds. This doesn't even cover how the majority of them avoided prison after the fall of loldemort in the first place. Compare and contrast any other member of a fallen terrorist group that manages to survive the carnage.

Compared to the scarily effective badasses they are off-screen, their portrayal on-screen is rather sad.

***** Yes, a lot of what you're saying about fight scenes is something a lot of fans have problems with, including myself. The HP fight scenes are all just very... uncreative and limited. They fire spells at each other that have a clear purpose and Voldemort's spell repertoire seems to consist of a handful of spells: the three Unforgiveables, whatever he did to make Harry bow in the fourth book, giving Pettigrew his silver hand and his fight with Dumbledore where he showcased some more showy stuff. Maybe a few minor spells like levitation and Summoning charms, I can't remember. But it's all quite sad for a vaunted genius who was top of his class throughout his Hogwarts years.

Either way, the fights are all very straightforward with no one thinking outside the box.

Their 15 years of inactivity doubtless took a toll, too, like you pointed out. Lucius got older, he was 40 around GoF, so past his peak. Bellatrix was 50 (I was so shocked when I found out about this, but she was actually 50 around book 5), and had been in Azkaban for 15 years, which can't exactly have done wonders for her physique.

Still, a lot of their off-screen competence can be attributed to how Rowling has portrayed the Wizarding world, I think. In general, people run and scream (World Cup in GoF) and don't really fight back unless they're Aurors or members of the Order of the Phoenix. Which would be fine in the real world, really, because most civilians wouldn't be carrying around a lethal weapon in their pockets. But in the Wizarding world where a bit of teamwork could have ended a terror campaign a lot quicker, it suggests that the Wizarding society, overall, are very passive in their resistance, and shows where the whole 'wizarding society are sheep' idea in fanfic comes from. I mean, sure, they may have been scared to see Death Eaters reappearing but there were hundreds, if not thousands of them there. So the Death Eaters easily crushing any resistance could also be attributed to the apparent passivity of the general populace. And while a lot of them avoided prison, they were mainly throwing bribes around and pretending that they had just been freed of the Imperius Curse, which isn't exactly something many terrorists in the real world can claim: 'I didn't want to, but they put a spell on me!'

So yeah, they weren't exactly portrayed as the most competent group, which is a bit of a shame. It would have been nice to see a few more intense fight scenes that actually showed them as dangerous people, instead of people who have difficulty handling six teenagers.

  Why didn't they use some of that super magical artillery to soften up the opposition before charging in? One extra salvo would have shattered the defenders' front line and another would have taken down a large number of the best defensive positions available. Hell,a spot of fiendfyre would have killed most if not all of thse defending the gates,leaving the way clear for the auxiliary units to rampage across the school.

Voldemort wanted Hogwarts as intact as possible. It's probably the only thing in the world he respects, likes or even loves. He stopped the basilisk attacks so Hogwarts wouldn't close. He could very easily have destroyed Hogwarts and broken the resistance, but he didn't think it was worth it.

#+begin_quote
  though they would still have won if they hadn't stopped to gawk at the Voldie-HP confrontation, which I found equally frustrating.
#+end_quote

The rest of the battle didn't matter, only the Voldemort vs. HP duel did. If Voldie won, no one could kill him. If Harry won, the Death Eaters were left without their master. Either way, the rest of the battle would be moot by the time their duel was over.

** I think you may have somewhat mistaken opinion on pure-bloods status.

Firstly, pure-blood doctrine is rather new:

#+begin_quote
  Slytherin's discrimination on the basis of parentage was considered an unusual and misguided view by the majority of wizards at the time. Contemporary literature suggests that Muggle-borns were not only accepted, but often considered to be particularly gifted. (...)

  Magical opinion underwent something of a shift after the International Statute of Secrecy became effective in 1692, when the magical community went into voluntary hiding following persecution by Muggles. This was a traumatic time for witches and wizards, and marriages with Muggles dropped to their lowest level ever known, mainly because of fears that intermarriage would lead inevitably to discovery, and, consequently, to a serious infraction of wizarding law.
#+end_quote

Secondly, the ones supporting it, were wizards who were against ISoS. As the ISoS came to be, we can reasonably assume that they weren't group in power.

#+begin_quote
  Under such conditions of uncertainty, fear and resentment, the pure-blood doctrine began to gain followers. As a general rule, those who adopted it were also those who had most strenuously opposed the International Statute of Secrecy, advocating instead outright war on the Muggles.
#+end_quote

Thirdly, being pure-blood is in its root more about politics than actual ancestry.

#+begin_quote
  As Muggle/wizard marriage had been common for centuries, those now self-describing as pure-bloods were unlikely to have any higher proportion of wizarding ancestors than those who did not. To call oneself a pure-blood was more accurately a declaration of political or social intent ('I will not marry a Muggle and I consider Muggle/wizard marriage reprehensible') than a statement of biological fact.
#+end_quote

Fourthly, Ministry often fought against the blood prejudice.

#+begin_quote
  Successive studies produced by the Department of Mysteries have proven that these supposed hallmarks of pure-blood status have no basis in fact.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/pure-blood][All those are from Pottermore: Pure-Blood]]

So, since we've established some basic facts, let's take a look at the political situation before the first Voldemort's rebellion.

The war started around 1970 with Voldemort gathering followers.

  We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.

From Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Ch.1: The Boy Who Lived

#+begin_quote
  Anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin' fer followers. Got 'em, too -- some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o' his power, 'cause he was gettin' himself power, all right.
#+end_quote

From Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Ch1: The Boy Who Lived Ch.4: The Keeper of the Keys

How did things look then?

#+begin_quote
  Ignatius Tuft 1959 - 1962 Son of the above. A hard-liner who capitalised on his mother's popularity to gain election. Promised to institute a controversial and dangerous Dementor breeding program and was forced from office.

  Nobby Leach 1962 - 1968 First Muggle-born Minister for Magic, his appointment caused consternation among the old (pure-blood) guard, many of whom resigned government posts in protest. Has always denied having anything to do with England's 1966 World Cup Win. Left office after contracting mysterious illness (conspiracy theories abound).

  Eugenia Jenkins 1968 - 1975 Jenkins dealt competently with pure-blood riots during Squib Rights marches in the late sixties, but was soon confronted with the first rise of Lord Voldemort. Jenkins was soon ousted from office as inadequate to the challenge.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ministers-for-magic][From Pottermore: Ministers for Magic]]

First we had two Ministers that resigned before getting full seven years. One was generally controversial and was forced officially, the second one was controversial among pure-blood faction which may had something to do with his resignation. Then we had Squib Rights marches, which were met with rioting and are another indicator of the general social mood being against opinions supported by pure-blood faction.

So we have pure-bloods for whom the world is falling apart. Muggleborns get elected, squibs demand rights. And here arrives Voldemort with promises of making Britain pure again. He perfectly capitalised on the feelings of then marginalised group.

*** You know, when you said 'making Britain pure again', all I could think of was Trump's slogan of 'make America great again'. Honestly, the whole situation you've described does sound eerily similar to me of what's going on in America today with gay rights, black rights marches, etc. And then, a man comes in and promises to fix America.

It is also definitely interesting to see what Pottermore says about blood purity, and how much it's been twisted into what it is in canon. Because in canon, the portrayal of blood purity is quite different, at least to the extent that these 'pureblood' wizards were not just shunning Muggle/Wizard marriages, but also 'Mudbloods', despite them previously being considered 'gifted'. Their blood superiority seems to have become something more literal, too, rather than just a political statement.

But yes, the political situation prior to Voldemort's rise is rather more complex than I'd realised. It's been previously pointed out to me how Nobby Leach was elected MoM, though I was unaware of the rest of these facts here, which do paint an even more convincing picture of why purebloods chose to become Death Eaters, if they felt that their power was being threatened by those they considered 'lesser'.

Because muggleborns are connected to muggles and muggles are disgusting and they don't want to have anything to do with them.

** We just saw it happen in the US, albeit in a less violent manner. Middle class white people who felt like they were losing their country banded together to support somebody who is known for saying racist, sexist, xenophobic things. The number and magical prowess of purebloods was dwindling so they came together for what was essentially a last stand for their power. You can't underestimate hate and fear as factors to bring people together. It's absolutely believable that a tyrant could bring people together by feeding their fears and turning it into hate.

** u/Madeline_Basset:

  In the history of terrorism, you don't really see groups of privileged people rising up against a group of people who are already oppressed. You see it the other way around, groups of oppressed minorities rising up against a greater power. These people rarely have another alternative, whether that is reality or how they perceive it.
#+end_quote

I'd disagree. Revolutionary groups typically have educated middle -class people, at least in positions of leadership.

A real-world model for the Death Eaters is quite possibly the German Red Army Faction - a small group that spent most of the 70's and 80's trying to advance their extreme Maoist-Marxist ideology by setting off bombs, killing police officers and corporate executives, and carrying out bank robberies to finance it. They were almost entirely university-educated and middle-class.

With the Death Eaters, we have the RAF, but led by a nearly unstoppably, nuclear-warhead-in human form.

*** As far as I know, the RAF consisted of a group of middle-class people who were fighting against what they saw as the imperialist establishment. While they could be considered economically privileged, I'd argue that they're still fighting against something greater than they were. They saw themselves as exploited and oppressed by imperialism, and were attacking key political and economical figures in an attempt to undermine it.

Privilege, in my opinion, is relative. You can put it on a global scale and say that most of the American population is privileged, including those that live in relative poverty, while the starving children in Africa are not. It would be true, but if you start comparing homeless people in America to starving African children, the homeless people are more 'privileged' because they have better access to food and clean water, etc. Looking at it that way, one could also argue that the members of the RAF were less privileged than those political and economic figures they attacked.
