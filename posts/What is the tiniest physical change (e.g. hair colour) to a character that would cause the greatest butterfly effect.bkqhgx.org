Skin colour and gender changes are not included, i.e. Harry doesn't go from Caucasian to East-Asian; Ron doesn't become Veronica.

Let's say that you give a character a seemingly insignificant physical change, e.g. Ron has black hair; what minor thing would cause the most change down the road?


** Well, there is an entire story (linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild)) devoted to the awesome and ridiculous consequences of a red-haired Harry, and even taken more seriously, there is no doubt that if Harry looked less identical to James, his relationship with Snape could be different, and as a result a great many things might change. So yes, that's my pick.

Any one of the Weasley children having a hair color other than red /could/ in fact also lead to some interesting changes, I should hasten to point out. Since Weasleys are in the popular mind defined by their redheadedness, being "the black-haired Weasley" would carry a lot of social implications.

Further up the timeline, there is the fact that had Grindelwald not been so handsome in his youth, the history of Grindelwald's War may have taken a very different turn, because Dumbledore might then not have had a crush on him, and thus recognized his growing madness for what it was /much/ sooner and nipped it in the bud. What the Wizarding World of the 1990's looks like in a world where Grindelwald's War never happened is up to you, but most conservative portrayals of the Statute of Secrecy suggest that the events in the Wizarding World cannot help but have influenced the Muggle ones, and World War II was likely an echo, in some fashion, of what was going on on the wizard side. So without Grindelwald, perhaps there /is/ no World War II.

By then we veer into full on alternate-history, and you'll have to ask a greater expert than I, but purely on the HP side, Tom Riddle's psychology may be very different in this history; he may not hate Muggles nearly as much if he doesn't grow up with the London Blitz overhead, y'know? Nor hate authority (and Dumbledore) quite as much if they don't force him to go back there every summer without a care in the world.

And by the way, there's not much point in forbidding skin-color changes; while that would admittedly be a whole different kettle of fish from other physical parameters if this were the /Muggle/ world, the Wizarding World doesn't have racism the way Muggles do --- it has blood-purism and human-supremacy instead --- so I think that for wizards, Harry's skin color /would/ be just as inconsequential as his hair color.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

*** I honestly don't think Harry and Snape's relationship would be all that different if Harry looked less like James (and more like Lily). Snape hates pretty much everyone and doesn't need a reason to be dickish to everyone around him; but even if he did need a reason, he's certainly creative enough to find reasons other than "he's just like his father" to justify his desire to hate Harry.

Off the top of my head: "he fails to live up to my idealised image of Lily and therefore shames her memory".

Assuming canon first impressions, they'll likely never become friendly to each other but they might not loathe each other the way they did in canon.

EDIT: Actually, if it continues mostly similar to canon, they might actually become closer towards each other as part of forced Occlumency lessons if Snape, not blinded by James-loathing, is able to realize the fact that Harry's childhood was loveless.

And that it is only the fact that said kid looked precisely like Snape's #1 most-detested that counterbalanced this uncharacteristic goodwill.

The numerous times Snape assumes Harry to be "arrogant like his father" and automatically thinks the worst, point out the reason. Of course, the unreasonable fame that Harry got after the first fall of Voldemort surely helped exacerbate those feelings.

Snape however, is blind to the fact that Harry doesn't really want his fame and simply wants to be a normal teenager, doing normal teenager stuff (not pranking, like his father). That blindness can be assume to stem from his similar appearance with his father. Afterall, if they look the same, they should act the same (and that would be true, if Harry was actually raised by his parents).

**** I don't think you can trust that the /HP/ universe's Muggle world is really like ours when you look at the details. It is in a surface-level way, of course, but the background history is by necessity /completely/ different: the Statute of Secrecy involved rewriting basically all of Muggle history up until then, after all (King Arthur was a real English monarch from the 11th century, remember? all that nonsense about him being from the 6th century and an invention of some French poets is just a coverup). So any unfiltered RL knowledge about how the Muggle world work is /heavily suspect/ in a HP context.

Recall that by the "the higher-ups in the Muggle government are in the know" logic of the Statute, most if not all of the major players in World War II /must/ have known about wizards in general and Grindelwald in particular. The wizards, meanwhile, could of course not help but know about the Muggles' conflicts. So I think it is very naive to think there /wasn't/ such a tight bunch of cross-influence as to make the distinction between the two wars basically pointless.

Recall also how Grindelwald's defeat happens in 1945. We are /definitely/ meant to assume that the end of the war on the Muggle side was a ripple-effect of the leader's defeat on the Wizarding side; or else why would Rowling pick such a conspicuous year?

Assuming Merope still gives him love potions (this time for his wealth rather than just his looks), Tom Riddle Jr will be just as ugly as his old man during his boyhood years. He's not going to be charming anyone with his ugly mug. He's not getting the secret of the Horcruxes from Slughorn by flashing his megawatt smile this time, not with that mirror cracking face of his.

So in this scenario, where she's not making up this fairy tale in her head (poor abused girl and pretty rich boy) but rather goes after him with a more ruthless, Slytherin vibe, she might not stop giving him the potions.

So TR Jr. still has his amortentia-induced emotional deficiencies (or was that fanon??), but doesn't grow up poor and bullied in an orphanage.

Instead, he lives either with his parents in Riddle Manor, with his parents somewhere else or with only Merope (if she does end up confessing to TR Sr.), who might at that point be emotionally unstable but still at least one person who loves him.

Anyway, coupled with him being quite ugly too, it would probably change history quite a lot.

  After the fiasco of the Chamber, Molly Weasley has no intention of ignoring the debt the family has toward Harry Potter. The question is only how she can satisfy her sense of obligation while not falling afoul of Dumbledore's restrictions.

**** I've always found it a bit puzzling how basically nobody seems to acknowledge the fact that they were friends in school for several years.

Also, if James does something stupid, Snape is the perfect associate for revenge sex with the trio's history (in fact, this is precisely how at least one Severitus fic I've seen came about). So, while a Harry with Snape hair would raise questions and surprises, I don't see it as /inconceivable/ if one is willing to acknowledge the possibility of an unfaithful Lily.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** Assuming Fate, Destiny, or any other supernatural power that forces the events into Stations of Canon /doesn't/ exist, then you could literally move one random particle on Earth a nanometer to the left and with enough time (I would guess ~6 months for HP specifically) you would /completely/ derail the plot of /any/ story beyond recognition. People vastly, /vastly/ underestimate the Butterfly Effect, especially in situations heavily reliant on chance. Something like that lottery the Weasleys' won before the third year, which lead to the whole plot of PoA? If the lottery numbers where randomly generated (even using a primitive algorithm or magic instead of a computer), then /no matter what you choose as a point of divergence/, it's almost completely /certain/ they will /not/ win this lottery again. Cue, PoA just doesn't happen.

And that's just /one/ event. The plot of Harry Potter has a lot of those. Pretty much the only events free from this phenomena are massive economical and political trends, and even then I would be wary of sudden new technologies introducing unexpected variables and messing everything up.

** Hermione does not have big teeth, therefore she isn't bullied in school, she has friends, isn't a know it all, doesn't get bullied in hogwarts (or has the self esteem not to care), doesn't end up in that bathroom, which means ron and harry don't have to go looking for her, they don't become friends (foraged in fire), she sleeps in that night and doesn't catch harry and ron sneaking out, they get caught by filtch after failing to get past the locked door, they never see fluffy, harry gets super hurt when he falls off his broom, they don't get involved in the Stone plot, voldie gets entranced by the mirror until dumbles comes back, and then voldie gets contained and locked away at the end of first year; and the plots of books 4-7 never happen.

Oh, and the school gets closed early in 2nd year because nobody knows what's causing the petrifying, ginny dies and then tom gets found out by the ICW when they catch him wandering around in the lockdown zone of the school, and, after they pick his mind clean of info and realize who he is and what he had planned and had done already, he gets sent through the Vail and the Crux's get hunted down. Everything is fixed for school to start again for 3rd year, but because of the screw up the ICW has a team look into padfoots escape (after he sees an old paper of ‘injured harry' with ron and a rat in the background) and they realize he's never had a trial, he gets a trial, they figure out he's innocent, he goes through a few years of therapy and gets custody of harry; the dursleys go to prison for child abuse, a rat dies to the Vail and everyone lives happily ever after...

...and the Death Stick losses its power when dumbles dies undefeated, the Resurrection Stone vanishes into some ICW research facility somewhere, and the True Cloak of Invisibility gets passed down to harrys eldest son, and then ‘his' eldest son and so on, just because it's good for pranks and it ‘feels right'.

** Honestly, it isn't the physical change you should index on, but whatever plot-convienent event you want to detail. You can then come up with a tiny physical change to justify derailing it.

Want to detail the plot at year 1 chess match? Ron has a slightly thinner skull and is permanently disabled by the hit to the head.

Want to detail the second task? Give Harry a bit less lung capacity.

I'm sure there are a ton of places you could put a 'harry is left handed' divergence point...

** Well Harry having red hair would make him look less like his father so its possible that maybe Snape would be less of a dick with him. Which would change their relationship and that could have significant impact on the plot.

Another would be Harry's scar being on his chest or some non visible part of his body when he's wearing clothes. That would result I think very different interactions with people. Before he got to school and even after when he meets people out of school he's not so easily identified.
