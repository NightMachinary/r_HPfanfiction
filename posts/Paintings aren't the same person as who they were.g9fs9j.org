Basically the title I see so many authors just use the paintings as a way to keep the character, but remain canonical. The paintings aren't gonna have the same personality. The painting will act however the person who painted it thinks they will act.


** There was a discussion on ghosts some time ago that led me to the conclusion that ghosts are effectively naturally occurring paintings.

Yeah paintings aren't the same as the living person, but some are better than others and have more of the original personality. Painting Dumbledore seemed pretty close to real Dumbledore.

** i always believed in the idea that the paintings have an imprint of personality but an admittedly short internal memory. one that erases over time. they'll greet you with warmth but with a pleasant befuddlement on how you know them?

so a conversation with a painting could give you a cools notes on a person's life but nothing more then was magically imprinted.

it would not know what it was not told it should know, if you saw IRobot "you must ask the right questions" a wizard would have to spend an immense amount of time and magic to make even an attempt at a copy of himself but even then it would be a whitewashed version containing only what they wanted to. you could not force a snape portrait to admit to having regretted life choices because snape himself would have had to feel the need to install them in a portrait to tell anyone who asked.

also things they cant understand they'd have the westworld treatment. "it doesn't look like anything to me" they'd play along with your words while attempting to fit it in a context they'd know. " which is the way to the dada classroom" "oh this way my dear boy" " do you remember the old DADA professor?" " oh my dear boy in my day he was so'and'so but frankly keeping up with the times is difficult"

theyd play the pronoun game constantly, my dear boy, young sir, darling dear. because your name isnt housed very long

it would also forget you after a while. the fat lady would recognize you as one of hers but more from the uniform or if you kept a daily talking to her. but even then the conversations would fade, if you came back after 7th year shed guard her chamber from you as harshly as a full on outsider regardless of whatever you said.

what information or advice they do have is only from what the creator put within them.

i think it would be a task partly like going over your own dreams in detail. eventually you would have to spend so much time doing it you waste away recording what you want youd never have time to do anything worth recording.

**** To be fair lupin is a Gryffindor teacher at that point. The function of the guard to Gryffindor might require him being more keyed into her programming then most.

***** I always saw paintings as a poor copy, they are similar to the person though I imagine certain paintings are different

Like I imagine the ones in the headmasters office are different and more able to take on new information as they kinda serve as advisors

****** I'm not saying entirely no new information but that they're forget it eventually. And as adivors they could listen to information and attempt to provide guidance using their own context. Portraits of teachers I imagine would have spent the most time trying to imbue a helpful teaching mindset. But eventually the role of the latest headmaster would be installed to provide context on the most recent situations of his life and purveyance as headmaster.

**** Then it would be a horocrux and would be sentient on its own merits as the book or locket was.

And that's very Dorian Grey as well

***** Hadn't made the connection to Dorian Grey but it could be a good story to read.

Imagine a portrait of Tom Riddle, decaying as an immortal snake hybrid while the real Tom goes around charming people with his normal looks and way less insanity. Assuming he only makes one Horcrux, which I doubt he'd do.

***** To go full Dorian Grey, I think it would be cool if the painting also assumed any magical transformations (and perhaps aging) that occurred to the dark wizard.

Maybe not as an inherent property because that really wouldn't make sense, but the idea of someone doing that to a painting horcrux while disguising themselves as an upstanding member of society is pretty cool.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.
