Prompt: Harry was sorted into Ravenclaw and gives the most sarcastic (but correct) answers to everyone and everything. Nobody is safe from his sarcasm, and some would think that McGonagall secretly raised him because of all the sass he exhibits. The Eagle Door Knocker is subjected to most of the sarcasm.

Eagle: How can you drop a raw egg on a concrete floor without cracking it?

Harry: Any way you want; concrete floors are rather hard to crack.

EDIT: Guys, thank you so much for all of the recommendations for the fics! Now I know I'll have a few things to read in the quarantine! Stay safe! ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™

Maliciously compliant Harry is my favorite Harry.

  In Potions, he set up next to Harry's cauldron for the first time since ever, and proceeded to whinge and moan about how his arm hurt too much to do the necessary cutting. And what happened? Snape made Harry handle all of Malfoy's ingredients. "Potter, you will help Mr. Malfoy until I tell you to stop."

  Okay then. Snape's favouritism of the prat would end up being unpleasant for all involved. Apparently Snape forgot how literally Harry could take orders.

  So while he was cutting and slicing and mincing, Malfoy made dumb comments here and there, with Harry absent-mindedly nodding along.

  After class, instead of following Hermione, he followed Malfoy. He took up Malfoy's bag, making the blond sputter in confusion. "What the hell, Potter?"

  Harry sent him a sweet smile and said in a kind voice that certainly carried quite a ways down the corridor, "Since you have been invalided so unfortunately, you can't possibly carry your own bag any longer, Malfoy. And Professor Snape did say I'd have to help you until he told me to stop. Do you need to use the loo before we go to your next class? As your dominant arm is so terribly injured, I'll do my best to wipe you properly."

*** This one's fun, but it does get a bit ridiculous towards the end. I'm not usually a fan of a child beating an adult at games of wit or word, because the author tends not to be very proficient, which leads to situations where you fume at the stupid retorts he gives which somehow rob a normally very witty character of breath.

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE. A/N: Slytherin-Harry.

Ron did wonder if she was taking the mickey when she treated his 'baboon's backside' comment like the funniest joke in the world, and a lot of the situations where she brings up mythical animals could be taken as being satirical.

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)

**** It's a slash fic, yes.

But, um, there's no death eater whitewashing or bashing or overt feminisation of male characters. It's just a rather nicely written story surrounding people who happen to be gay. If these are your objections to hp slash rather than just not liking slash in general.

  7th Year Gryffindors learn why it is never a good idea to piss off Ravenclaw Hadrian Morgan. His payback during Professor Slytherin's class is BEAUTIFUL. In carrying it out, orphaned pureblood Hadrian catches the interest and libido of the present Lord Marvolo Slytherin, who -- with the assistance of the entire Slytherin student body as well as a few other surprising characters -- tries to lure Morgan into his life and his bed. But just how naive is Hadrian Morgan, really?1945-era mash-up of most major and minor characters of HP and other fandoms, as well as historical characters. [WAIT, PLEASE! .... ahem.... If you just heard a mental screech of brakes, please understand that this is not a farce, nor crack, nor crap. This has many reviews from now-devoted readers who almost bypassed it, but are now glad they accepted the dare to just try chapter one.]Chapter 13 is co-written by Marksmom.This story has devoted readers who take joy in wicked humor, intense slash romance, and surprises at every turn. I have been coerced by fans into giving this next bit verbatim: "If you don't think you'll like this, at least read Chapter One; odds that you'll regret it are vanishingly small."
