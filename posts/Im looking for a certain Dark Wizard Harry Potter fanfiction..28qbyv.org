From what I can remember, Harry decides to live in Knockturn Alley, and gets a job at an apothecary. He learns about true magic, and takes a dark wizard mark, a pretty design around near the eye and ear. He befriends a young woman who designs clothes and Hermione is also in the fic when he tries to save her. I think he lives in a brothel at first in K.A. Help? It was a good story.

It's one of those uber rare pairings that no one will write about seriously unless it's just a vehicle for smut.

******** Actually, I do remember one. It was started a super long time ago and was finished a few years ago.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1917996/1/Shattered-Illusions]]

I remember reading it forever ago and it was actually pretty good.

I'm sure you've read it already though.

I know gay people, I have gay friends. Gay, male friends.

I don't know a single lesbian.

I've just never really been exposed to it so it seems strange.

************ I concur. I am a guy, I enjoy femslash obviously. I can stomach slash, but only if it's worth the time. Because as a guy, it doesn't seem right with me. The same can be said for girls and femslash. Most fan fiction authors are women, that's why slash is a lot more common on ff.net
