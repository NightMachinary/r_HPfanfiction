Authors like to put logic into the world and magic, which can be fun sometimes, but I love the nonsensical whimsy that the world was in.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New

Fine with het/slash/femslash/etc Does NOT have to focus on pairings

NO Bashing. Flawed characters are a yes, bashed characters are usually a no go.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Victoria potter has that magical feel. An example being the restricted section, which is a literal maze and some students go inside for an entire week, get lost, and end up being pulled out by a teacher days later.

** I think "Victoria Potter" by Taure is a great one, it has that good, magical vibe & honestly the worldbuilding is amazing. The author comes up with so many new yet logical things that make the plot 100x better & Id really recommend it
