As the title says I'm looking for fics where harry leaves hogwarts and goest to an American wizarding school. Preferably 75k+ length.


** I'd link Vance McGill's Ilvermorny Champion but it takes place at Hogwarts for the TriWiz but Harry was raised in American with his mom and sister. It's supposedly going to be updated "soon" but hasn't for about 6 months.

**** I wasn't sure if that was something you'd be interested in and it's Harry/Multi which many people don't like.

Takes place in Minnesota of all places. I think it is good. But It's been awhile, and I might be biased since I enjoyed reading a fic set in my hometown.

  After his second year, Harry begins to realize Hogwarts isn't everything it could be. Are there other options available? While the Hogwarts characters belong to JK Rowling, the story is obviously outside of canon.
