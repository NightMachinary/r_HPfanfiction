  They sought her out for conversation sometimes, cornering her in the garden or at the park, not that they ever had much to say. Really, Harriet thought snakes were rather dull.---------Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. Harriet attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she makes new friends, encounters a prickly Potions Master, learns about the Boy Who Lived, and meets the enigmatic Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, Professor Tom Slytherin.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. AU world with a canonical tone. No canon rehash, no bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. Second Year complete as of Chapter 27.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  Fem!Slytherin!Harry (Mary); realistic!Dursleys; consistent!Professors; follows the books VERY closely, especially the first three chapters or so (deviation from canon is exponential, but slow to start). See first chapter for preface discussion of background/differences from canon. Most chapters K-rated, T for language, several sections from Snape's perspective are T. Later books may be M-rated.

  Rose Potter spent twenty-one years as the Chosen One. Reborn as Harry Potter's twin, he alone has the scar after that Samhain night. Harry knows there's something odd about his sister - she's too old, too mature, and knows far too many things she shouldn't - but he loves her anyway. He's been there for her ever since they were born, so Rose'll be damned if she lets history repeat itself.(In her past life, Hogwarts didn't unite until the very end and everyone suffered for it) (Lily Potter was willing to do anything and sacrifice everything for the safety of her family. Rose intended to do nothing less)In which not all Slytherins are evil, not all Gryffindors are good, and the Wizarding World is more than just an extension of the Muggle one.Years 1-3

** Ok, absolutely AMAZING one is linkffn(Certain Dark Things by eirajenson)

Fem!Harry, Slytherin!Harry and Slytherin!Hermione, Sirius has a daughter, and a lot of AU twists on various canon things - don't want to spoil but it's created such a mystery as you're not sure what's canon and what isn't ahead of time!

It's tagged as being Snarry later on, but we're at book 3 now and still no sign of it, although the portrayal of Snape has been really excellent, showing where he is still a grey and unlikable character but also creating some sympathy for him.

Writer is just brilliant, and I have to say I'm not a fan of Snarry or Slytherin!Harry so would have noped out early if this wasn't /just so good/.

​

The first one is rarely recommended on this sub and yet is personally one of my femharry favs. It also features a rare alive!james and the dynamic is really interesting.

The second one updates daily and I just have to say may be steadily on my way to being my favorite marauders era fic. One of the best slowburns with fem harry and sirius and the plot is just woven together so beautifully and that doesnt even touch upon how amazing and real these characters are.

The third one is really quite funny and such an interesting dynamic (its another time travel and yes i love these!). I laughed many times reading it.

  Instead of a son born in summer, a daughter is born in winter. There is still a prophecy and Privet Drive, but for Holly Ivy Potter nothing is quite what it could have been had a brother been born in her place. Girl Who Lived fic.

  Harry is the girl who wanders in and out of time. Tom knows nothing about her, and despite the fact she has whisked him away from the orphanage to live with her, he's starting to think he never really will either. Regardless, he is determined to never let her go, not even in the face of time, space, or dark lords. timetravel

  By all rights, the story of Holly Potter and Alex Kann should have ended when they parted ways at age 11. Their destinies lay in different worlds: witch and Muggle; magic and science; Scotland and London. Then Alex came up with the idea of selling potions to Muggles. Their waning bond is revived, but can it last while running a nascent illegal business, the challenges of school and new relationships? Time-shifted AU, Pre-Hogwarts, Years 2-4
