Hermione had felt a growing sense of dread as she continued her research in the library. She had initially begun researching the murderer after Harry THIS year, Sirius Black. She'd scoured back issues of the Daily Prophet looking for details on his trial in the hopes it would give clues about the madman and how to avoid him. Her search was in vain. No record of an actual trial could be found.

Sirius Black had been dragged to prison simply because everyone KNEW he was guilty. It seemed impossible, and yet... just last year Hagrid had been taken to Azkaban so that the Ministry could be seen to be doing something, anything, to solve the Chamber of Secrets incident. No trial, just Lucius Malfoy's suggestion and off Hagrid went to the worst prison in the world.

Hermione began to wonder how many others might've been thrown in prison with no trial because people KNEW they were guilty. She began researching, going back further. With dawning horror, Hermione was unable to find any record of another trial. It shared some similarities as Sirius Black. Both were believed to be very powerful dark wizards. Both were defeated in single combat. Both were thrown in prison to never be seen again. But it seemed impossible they might actually be innocent. It was impossible. They had to be guilty.

"Ah, studying Gellert Grindelwald, Ms. Granger?" Professor Dumbledore's voice behind her caused Hermione to jump in shock.


** I was hoping you were going for more of a "literally nobody in azkaban had a trial" angle, but Grindelwald was a good catch.

** Ohh, it actually sounds like one of those film twists in which a hero discoveres a horrible truth about a character everyone had previously admired, only to be found by that characted at that very moment, and then the villian does something horrible to the hero, like when Selina Kyle from Batman discoveres her boss's plan to drain the city and he throws her off the building, after which she becomes a catwoman.

War and stress bring out the worst in humanity. Every civilization is littered with examples of awful things they've done due to fear and war. Hell, the US killed Osama Bin Laden without a trial and dumped his body into the sea.

***** Well to my knowledge that was because there was some uncertainty regarding just how much control the Emperor actually had over Japan during that time. One theory I read suggested that he was little more than a ceremonial puppet to give legitimacy to the actions performed by the IJA and the IJN. I suspect that theory was based on the idea that something similar has happened before in Japan's history, like during the time of the Shogunate.
