Hello all, I'm looking for a specific story, that I read some time ago. In this story the Potter's are alive and well, Harry is older then regular canon and he has a younger brother. This brother is the bwl. Harry is primarily raised by Sirius and goes to Durmstrang. I vividly remember be a scene where Harry puts together a list of spells for his brother to learn to protect himself and Ron Weasley does the whole "ahhh, he goes to Durmstrang, that list is full of dark magic," Thingy. I also remember a scene that has Sirius mad at Harry, in front on the Potter's, for kissing Andromeda Tonks. If that rings a bell for any of y'all, please post what the story is. Or post your favorite fabrics, I'm always down foir a good read. Thanks!


** Except for being raised by Sirius and kissing Andromeda Tonks, it sounded like you were describing linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi). Could it be that you remembered elements of two stories as one story?

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** It is certainly possible. The story I'm remembering has an older Harry, and all of the canon stuff happens to his brother, the bwl. This story you linked doesn't ring a bell for me, so I'm going to dive into it here shorty. Thanks!
