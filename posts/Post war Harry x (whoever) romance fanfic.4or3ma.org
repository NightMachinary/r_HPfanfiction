  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

** linkao3(He Who Must Not Be Normal) This fic was a little rough around the edges but definitely worth the read. This fic is a little short but it's well paced. I think that the author does a good job at portraying this pairing, it's very different from a lot of the drarry fics that I've read.

linkao3(Foundations) linkffn(Turn) Once you read a fic by Saras_Girl you can't go back. They're /amazing/.

Edit: I managed to fuck up every one of the bot requests so I had to fix them, sorry about that.

  Potter has fame and fortune and posh clothes and all he wants is a simple life. Draco has a flat and a cat and a steady job and all he wants is a complicated life. Which makes you think this story has something exciting like body-swapping, but it doesn't. Instead it has Indian takeaway and a blue jumper and people wanting a whole lot of what they can't have, discovering themselves as they discover each other.
