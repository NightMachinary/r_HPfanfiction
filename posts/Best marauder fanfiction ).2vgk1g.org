** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]]. Starts when the four of them start school and focuses on their dynamic/friendship. It's 600k words and they still haven't finished 3rd year, but it's really really excellent.

*** Wow, I'm like, maybe 1/4 of the way through this (Remus's first semster) and I have to say, not only is this fic detailed, grammatically correct, and extremely interesting, it also is in character. This is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!

*** I just read through the entirety of this story in about three sittings this weekend. Just...wow. As someone who has been reading fic on and off since pre-DH, this is the best fic I have ever read. It captures a lot of things so well: living with chronic pain, having friends experiencing abuse but being unable to do anything about it. The characterization of each of the four boys is completely on point, and as they're 11 to 13 year old boys, the actually ACT like 11 to 13 year old boys do.

I have twitter notifications for the author (@AgainstTheMoon) in the hopes that she will resume writing this instead of her fic in another fandom. One can dream...

***** Oh god, so much truth to that. At least this one isn't completely abandoned. Fun fact about Against the Moon: the first 80 chapters were written in one year. She was at one point posting a new chapter every other day. In 2014, the author published a total of two chapters. :(

She has a chronic illness that prevents her from typing, so a lot of the later stuff is voice dictated, which is mind blowing considering how good the writing is. Its not easy to write or do anything with serious health problems, so I can understand the story falling out of priority after the flurry of activity in the first year and a half.

******* Dude I'm on my second read already, it's so perfect! One thing I love is how it's clearly aware of British culture in the early 1970's, and we see much more of the surrounding influence of the boys heritage than we do in actual canon.

*** It's basically any type of physical assault. Things that can fall under this category are stuff like war prisoners, torture, the character in question losing fights (sustaining injuries), abuse/neglect, hospital stays... Etc.

I do tend to read a lot of fiction based around some of these concepts because I find that specifically in fanfiction, the character dynamics and underlying tones of darkness bring a certain tone to the story that by glossing over these details, can get left out. I'm also very interested in reading these because I find them more interesting the the avg teen rated stories. That being said, they're not for everyone, and I've had click off more then a few for going over the top on the whumpage elements.

Edit: Adding this link as an example of bellatrix!whumpage (its also an EXCELLENT story [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/65319]])

Cheers!

** [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/2012/03/here-now-take-and-enjoy-an-epub-and-mobi-version-of-shoebox/][The Shoebox Project]] is awesome, but unfortunately unfinished. Read it anyway, it is so unique, and it will make you cry.

*** I'm reading this one right now, and while the first few chapters were pretty OOC for most characters, after the tenth chapter or so they start behaving more canon - but the premise is really good, and I like the way the young marauders are portrayed!

** shoebox project and against the moon are important mentions but it's pretty strange that no one who clicked on this directed you toward the life and times

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times]]

it's the second best fanfiction i've ever read, though heartbreakingly incomplete (there is hope, sort of)

** Hands down, the best Marauder-era story with Wolfstar slash (in the background) I know is SamStoryteller's [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=14930][Reclamation]]. Tom Riddle centric piece.

I don't normally read slash but this story is worth making an exception.
