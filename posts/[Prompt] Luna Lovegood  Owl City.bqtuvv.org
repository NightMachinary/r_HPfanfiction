I've been listening to Owl City & other Adam Young songs, and I feel like a lot of them could be made into a kind of songfic or something similar that would fit Luna really /really/ well.

Suggestions;

The Real World --- ‘sugar maple wings' ‘downy feathers' & ‘Reality is a lovely place | But I wouldn't want to live there' Sound /so/ much like Luna. Also, ‘Luna Lullabies'.

Fireflies --- ‘You would not believe your eyes' ‘I'd like to make myself believe' ‘Cause everything is never as it seems' ‘Cause I feel like such an insomniac' (this isn't cannon, but I think it would fit her well) ‘If my dreams get real bizarre'

Saltwater Room --- ‘staring up at the planes | That aren't there anymore' ‘Walking down by the bay | On the shore' ‘And you were looking so cold | So like an introvert | I drew my over shirt' ‘You can hear the waves | In underwater caves | As if you actually were inside | A saltwater room' (Something to do with the Black Lake maybe?) ‘And set this ballroom aglow' (TriWizard tournament romance?)

Other stuff I thought could be interesting; Rainbow Veins, Silhouette (Fits Harry more), Honey & the Bee, This Isn't The End (With her Dad, not Mum, dying in an AU I guess), Deer in the Headlights (Animagus), Beautiful Times (full of cool imagery), Peppermint Winter (for a fun Christmas story).

And a whole bunch of others from Sky Sailing.
