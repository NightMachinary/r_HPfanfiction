Hey! I'm just looking for a good dark or grey fiction that has to do with pureblood culture or politics. I'd prefer it to be hogwarts era or Hermione centered but ill read anything thats good. Thank youuu


** What do you consider dark or grey? The plot? I've written an AU story, "Patron", with a Wizarding Britain with a different magical culture. In some areas more progressive than muggle Britain, in some more archaic, but magic is far more common - used all the time, everywhere - than in canon.
