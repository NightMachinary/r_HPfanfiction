** Not sure if this is the one you're looking for but Full Circle by tetsurashian on AO3. It's LV/HP which normally I'm not a fan of (because how do you get over the murder of your parents to fall in love with such a psychopath??) but it's done really well.

​

*Minor spoiler alert* Something is up with the prophecy and Voldemort and Harry's part in it so they're both reborn over and over in different lives and have different relationships. It actually takes them a something like 7 different lifetimes together before they're even civil with each other and even more before they fall in love. It's definitely and interesting take on their relationship and starts off in the current life with them being reborn into the HP canon universe (obviously, that's about the only canon part of it because they change a great number of things.)
