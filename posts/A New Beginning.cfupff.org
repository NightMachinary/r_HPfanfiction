Hey guys! I'd just like to self promote a fanfic I've been writing. It's my first one and I'm pretty proud of it and would love some feedback as I am looking to improve my writing. It's a Harry/Gabrielle fic, post war. Harry fakes his own death and moves to France. With the world believing him dead, odd things start happening and he gets to know what it's like to never be famous. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12731357/1/A-New-Beginning]]
