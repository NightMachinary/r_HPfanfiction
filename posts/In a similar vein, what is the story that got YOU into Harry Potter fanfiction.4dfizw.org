For me, it was linkffn(Backwards with Purpose). The idea of going back in time to do it all again is such an easy sell, and I didn't put it down until dawn the day after I started it. What about you?


** Some dude on /lit/ posted "Why haven't you read fanfiction yet?" in every ff thread with his pastebin.com/wwtmhSKY of recommendation. Clicked it, followed the instructions and started with The Lie I've Lived. Read the entire pastebin since then.

I would hug that guy if I could.

** Believe it or not... none. Before HBP came out, I tried writing a fanfiction of my own version of Book 6. (Even before the title for the book was released). I didn't know what I was writing was called fanfiction, or that there was a load of it out there. This was before I was internet-savvy. I was writing my own fanfiction before I discovered fanfiction!

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

** It was this really long fanfic called Lily and James The Prequel by KirbeeDesirae. I loved it so much but I think the author took it down when it became AU. This was early 2000s.

It was also known as 'The Goy Story' for this line that I'll never forget :

'we're having a girl! ' 'a girl!' 'and a boy' 'we're having a goy?'

** I have no idea, actually. I don't even know when I started reading fanfiction. Or why I suddenly became obsessed with it.

I assume it has been the Draco trilogy (though I only read the first book, I think), because I've stumbled upon it somewhere. No clue.

Afterwards I know I've read a lot of Sirius fanfics. A lot a lot a lot a lot. It was really obsessive. I would spend a few weeks/months reading fanfic, then stop for a few months, then read again obsessively, then stop again... I guess at one point fanfic kinda becomes boring, especially if you read similar pairings/worlds and such. Also, reading a very good fanfiction and then suddenly facing an abyss of awful fanfics was also a pretty good way to stop reading any.

** Hah, which story got me into fanfiction? Deathly Hallows! More specifically its epilogue.

There were many things I didn't like about that book, but the epilogue really turned me bitter. I didn't even have a problem with a teenage romance between Ron and Hermione (dysfunctional relationships are pretty common there), but the idea that they would live happilty in a marriage and have children really disgusts me on a fundamental level. The idea of Harry marrying his fangirl-stalker wasn't much better (at least they have some things in common though).

Almost to until the last page of canon I expected some kind of tragic twist where these relationships would blow up because they are so fundamentally wrong. I couldn't believe that this was JKR's idea of "all is well".

So I got interested in fanfiction in order to find fixes to some of the more glaring issues I had with DH (Horcruxes, camping trips, epilogue).
