I really like reading completed fan fiction (otherwise I always wonder what happened next) what are some of the best fics completed in 2020? (No matter when they were started)


** Well I started and completed a story this year, and the sequel will miss the 'this year' cutoff only by a week or so. It might not be the one most people wanted, and it might be relatively small compared to the great fanfiction epics. It might even be a crossover, which I know many do not like, but I really enjoyed writing it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13521865/1/Kicking-Gotham][Kicking Gotham]] is a HP/DC crossover set post Hogwarts and it was some of the most fun I've had writing since the early days of Shadow of Angmar. The sequel is also almost done. So if you squint it's kinda like a 180k word story in two parts.

***** Phantom scratches an itch I've had for a long time about actual head of house duties and people actually caring about students.

Seriously, having someone noticing that Dumbledore is making a child soldier is huge, much less seeing ANYONE do the little things like advise kids or comfort them, because McGonagall and Snape certainly aren't.

****** Right??

That wasn't the intention I had going into this story (but then again, I didn't really have any intentions...) but the more I thought about it, the more I realised that Regulus is basically the /perfect/ character to fulfil that role. He's been there, he's been recruited as a schoolboy, he's /died/ as a schoolboy, and he has all these frustrations and feelings of injustice that Dumbledore can do to Harry what Voldemort did to him and still come out as the good guy. And he also doesn't have the teaching staff's cumbersome mortal/corporeal burdens - he doesn't need to worry about lesson plans, or angry parents, or even getting injured!

But most importantly he knows that division and secrecy and bottling things in didn't help him and it won't help this generation of children either. They might find it weird, being mothered by the ghost of an 18 year old boy, but he'll be damned if he won't try his best to help them!

  The second anniversary of the war dawns on Wizarding Britain and Harry Potter still does not feel anything approaching normal. He had really thought waking from that 24 hour nap after the Battle of Hogwarts would fix him once and for all, but two years on, he's still unable to sleep through the night, so jumpy that his girlfriend is worried about him, and he doesn't know what he wants to do with his life after he failed the psych evaluations necessary to become an Auror. He had never expected to feel perfect two years after the Battle of Hogwarts, not that he knew what that was like, but he *had* expected to be okay.Good thing Harry Potter's well used to disappointment.

  Harry's words spiraled out through Remus' mind in dangerous fractals. What exactly did â€˜gone' even mean? He had thought Peter was gone for a dozen years, only to find that he was alive. The entire Wizarding World had thought Voldemort gone until he had returned! Why should he assume the permanence of Sirius' death when that line was blurred, when that line was as fragile as the flutter of a Veil? Could fabric not be torn?     In which Remus Lupin must come to terms with third chances coming at a very dear price.*Written for Fireside Tales 2020*

  Regulus Black died twelve years ago and was transported to Hogwarts, as a ghost. It's not the place he would have chosen to linger for all eternity, but he supposes it's pleasant enough.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.
