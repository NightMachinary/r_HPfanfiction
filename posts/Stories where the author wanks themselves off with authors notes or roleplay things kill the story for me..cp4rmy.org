I'm currently reading Thank You Ms Bones Linkffn(3230439)

And while i enioy the story Old Crow has the bad habbit of adding tidbits at the end of his chapters where Minerva talks to him and is like "oh jolly good job posting this story we are ever so thankful"

And it just is starting to grate on me as a reader and i know for a fact he isn't the only author who does something like this...


** The secret is to not read them.

If it's the very existence of his endnotes that bothers you, there isn't really much that can be done about them, as the story was completed in 2008.

Much like Bobmin's introductions, I tend to just blip right over OldCrow's endnotes, other than a quick scan for his recommendations.

*** I tend to use ANs like patch notes. Because sometimes, you write something you have to explain from a meta standpoint. There are some things you cannot explain in universe eg why you diverge from canon given that none of your characters would know canon and could therefore explain in story why things are going differently.

For example, I wrote a world cup riot with a few hundred dead since that's generally what happenes if you put a group of terrorists into a huge civilian crowd. But I can hardly have Harry say "Damn, these Death Eaters act like real terrorists and not cartoonish antagonist's goons from a children's book".

**** Edit:

I certainly understand the impulse for "patch notes." The readers are so often inattentive and you get flooded with the same dumb comments because they are either unwilling to give you the benefit of the doubt (it'll be explained later) or unwilling/unable to handle even the slightest bit of ambiguity. So many get caught up in the minutia of their fandom and it's just /exhausting/ to read the same dumb comments over and over and /over/.

To me, it's a matter of just ignoring that shit, rather than trying to "fix" it through patch notes. Or in those rare cases where the feedback is on-point, taking that and using it to make future work better. The idiots with their idiot feedback aren't worth your time. They're not worth taking the time and effort to write text that's "patching" your work. Just ignore them.

Original jerky comment:

No offense, but that's really amateurish. If you get feedback that suggests something about the story is unclear, then you can either ignore the feedback (almost always the right move), try to do better next time, or go back and edit your work to address the issue.

In the case of your example, you absolutely can have Hermione lecture Harry at breakfast the next morning, "Well, Harry, in such-and-such riot that happened this other time, there were over two hundred dead, so it's awful but not a surprise that..."

All it takes is two sentences that are roughly in-character, and now your story is coherent.

***** I generally agree with what you've said here. When I'm reading a fanfic I prefer that the work speak for itself. If the author feels the need to explain what they meant afterward in an AN, then that's a sign that they failed to achieve their vision.

90% of the time I skip reading author's notes on my first time through a fic. I prefer to experience the story as-is without the author's personality and/or revisionism tainting my view of what he or she has made. Afterward (if I liked the fic enough) I sometimes go back through to read the ANs to get a deeper/different perspective, but I always prefer to form my own opinion of the work's 'meaning' independently the first time.

The issue is people having expectations since they know the canon.

Which won't really address the issue of making the story more realistic while people expect the usual fare and/or have not really thought about the horrors of a civil war.

That pretty clearly falls under "ignore the idiots" along with a tiny skosh of "do better next time."

You're describing a tone problem - you're thinking readers won't understand why events in your story are different than canon because your story is darker and more realistic.

But if you've properly set the tone earlier in the story, then "a riot at The World Cup kills hundreds because, duh, of course it would" flows naturally as part of the story. At that point, anyone who gets all bitchy at you can safely be ignored because they're a dumbass. Alternatively, if you failed to set that more realistic tone, then it's useful feedback to either go do some editing, or just do better next time.

If you're really, truly worried that readers won't appreciate how dangerous real riots are, I still think the solution is organic, in-story discussions.

You could even use it as a Muggle vs. Magical thing: "Well, mu... Granger, of course Muggles died in that riot, they're just dumb cow-eyed animals," sneered Malfoy.

"I should think the horrors of yesterday's body count would get at least a little bit of empathy or sense into your skull, Malfoy," she replied primly.

Or whatever.

******* But no one in-universe should be surprised by it because no one knows that they originally were characters in a children's book.

I mean, yes you can ignore the few odd comments, but it takes little effort to provide some meta-commentary at the end of a chapter. Or if you are vague for the sake of reading flow (eg "a nice Mercedes") you can use the AN to specify before anyone asks. Or point out that you did a certain bit of research (weather archives, Google Streetview, YT, some museum page) to the best of your ability but could not find out exactly how things were on that specific day in the place you are describing.

** This is all just my opinion.

Author's Notes IF CLEARLY SEPARATED from the story are fine with me. I prefer all AN at the bottom of the chapter, after it's clear the chapter is over. That way, it's optional. Before the chapter is okay but not my preference. Those tend to not be as clearly separated, and tend to be more wanky, almost like the author thinks they're super important or funny or whatever.

Pre-chapter AN should be about the fic or the chapter - NOT responses to reviews and individual commenters! Even skimming that shit to get to the start of the chapter is offputting.

In the middle of the chapter itself is anathema.

** Author's Notes are amateurish. I mean that in the literal sense - professional writers don't put Author's Notes in their published novels. At most, you might have a Foreword, often written by someone else.

They're so frigging common in fanfic, though, that I think even if you're really irritated by them (they're #2 for me after SPAG for why I give up on a fic), most folks just kinda roll their eyes and move on.

What you're describing sounds particularly irritating and childish, but if they're always at the end, you can just stop reading at the end of the chapter and move on.

Personally, I would've given up on that fic after the second instance of that kind of thing. The simple fact of the matter is that there's SO MUCH really good, free writing out there by writers who don't do that crap. When the world offers you so much stuff that you could read nothing but "absolutely amazing" for your entire life and never run out, why waste a single minute reading authors that are so amateurish?

*** Appendix's are pretty common, As far as I can tell, full of content the author wanted to include in the main story that the editor said "NOPE, reader don't care". So it is in the back for the geeks who want to understand how some minor character is distantly related to the main character.

But yes, breaking away from the story in the middle is a no-no. But a good part of that is how it is delivered. Fanfic are usually delivered serialized, while the professionally publishing industry has left serialized publishing behind. If you want a comparison, you should compare to the old sci-fi/fantasy publishing 'zines, which I suspect had quite a bit more framing than books do.

Anyway, character driven fics (like Harry Potter) tend to have them less. Probably because if the pride and joy of the author is the amazing world they built, they did a LOT of work that won't be in the novel. Whereas if the pride and joy is the character interactions, they better have got all that before the book is finished...
