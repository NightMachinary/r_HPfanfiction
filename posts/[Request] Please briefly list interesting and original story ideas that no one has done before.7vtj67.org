Yes please, I would love to have more ideas to put in my IDEAS folder! :) And yes you are all very good writers and very creative. :)


** Well, let me check my to-do list...

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section
   :END:

- Harry is afraid of ghosts. Not literal ghosts that can be seen and talked to, things like poltergeists that invisibly move things around and make stuff go bump in the night, stuff he can't see the source of. What happens when he goes to Hogwarts and sees moving stairs, levitation charms, floating candles in the Great Hall, broomsticks...?

- On his 11th birthday, Harry receives a strange piece of parchment, on which is written 'Rubeus Hagrid is the Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry.' Thereafter, he keeps catching himself talking to thin air, going to Diagon Alley without knowing where the idea came from, knowing things about his parents...the idea being that Hagrid is under a Fidelius, but his half-giant nature interferes with people's knowing the Secret. How will Harry solve this strange mystery of the missing person whom only he and Dumbledore (the secret keeper) seem to know of?

- House-elves serve wizards/witches as slaves as part of an ancient magical bargain; elves would serve humans until magical civilization was safe and secure, so that once the humans were in a position of power they could arrange a safe homeland for the elves. But out of ignorance or greed, wizardkind have their civilization but they haven't been keeping up their end of the deal...what happens when a record of the ancient bargain is discovered?

- The Triwizard Tournament becomes the Omniwizard Open! The Centiwizard Contest? Whatever the name, it's not just Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang that are in it; all of the magical schools and hundreds of wizards & witches are involved in an Olympics-sized event!

- At his hearing (or trial) for casting the Patronus Charm, Harry presents a formidable defence; witnesses, affidavits, and loads of evidence, from the previous misconduct of dementors to the Ministry's magical creature detectors and more. When Fudge railroads the trial to get Harry expelled and his wand snapped regardless, his gross abuse of the law in the process turns a large chunk of the Ministry (including Percy Weasley) against him. With the Ministry's unity in serious jeopardy and more people becoming receptive to Harry & Dumbledore's claim of Voldemort's return, what will happen next?

- The basilisk breaks into the Great Hall at dinner! Thanks to Hogwarts' Felicis (luck) wards, a well-timed falling glass chandelier, several mirrors and well placed house ghosts, nobody is killed, but EVERYONE is petrified. How will the population of magical Britain react to their future being turned to (not quite) stone?

- Peter Pettigrew believed (though it didn't actually occur) that the Fidelius Charm had two layers; one to hide the Potters identities, one to hide where they live. He honestly believes that Sirius was a second Secret Keeper, who betrayed the Potters willingly (whereas Peter did so under duress). If Peter thought the Potters would be safe even when he told the secret, what happens when everyone else discovers this? If he's innocent, who blew up the street full of muggles? How did the Death Eaters know of the goings on in the Order of the Phoenix?

- In the near future, Muggles develop new and amazing technology using newly discovered 'exotic energy'. When the magic detectors report a false positive on these new machines and the wizards go in to obliviate and hide the evidence, what happens next...?

- Harry wants to learn wandless magic so that he can defend himself if, like with Riddle in the Chamber of Secrets or the forest during the Quidditch World Cup or during Voldemort's resurrection, he's relieved of his wand. Dumbledore's too distant to teach him during book 5, who else is a master of wandless magic? As it turns out, Dobby!

- They aren't Chocolate Frog Cards; they're Chocolate Frog Action Figures! When Ron brings his collection to a History of Magic class to entertain himself while Binns drones away, Harry gets in on the act, Hermione corrects them on the actual history of each figure, and soon enough the entire class gets in on telling history stories using Ron's collection...using a copy of Albus Dumbledore to stand in for Grindelwald when telling their big fight, substituting Herpo the Foul for Salazar Slytherin and Baba Yaga in place of Circe...

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6hdm41/lf_stories_where_wbwlharry_is_kidnapped_as_a/dj0fbgo/?context=3][One more I found while searching my old comments]]; at a young age Harry is kidnapped, ending up as a slave on a cocoa farm in Africa. When a burst of accidental magic means he's finally discovered, his experiences have well and truly turned him away from chocolate...but then, how will he be treated when he's exposed to dementors?

** I have a few more fics with very unique ideas:

Hermione Granger, Demonologist: A very lonely Hermione summons demons as friends, takes over the Slytherin House, and maintains a cordial relationship with both Harry and Voldemort.

Like a Red Headed Stepchild: What if Harry has red hairs? The story takes off in completely unexpected direction.

Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution: This fic has by far the most violent reaction to a marriage law, but killing off the old establishment is the easier part. What happens next is very much unprecedented.

Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water: This is a crossover that should not have worked. Voldemort's Horcrux merging with Bismarck's spirit and coming back powerful than ever? Fortunately HMS Hood is called back to defend Britain.

The Daring Win: Umbridge raising Harry? OMG!

Heterochromic: Not your average Daphne or Astoria fic.

A Little Child Shall Lead Them: Hermione sends her memories to her two years old self, fixes up the world quickly, and does something truly amazing.

The Sea King: Harry fled Magical Britain after the war and became a fishing boat captain. Sounds boring right? It's such a beautiful one shot.

** All my top 5 favorite stories have unique plots:

1. Seventh Horcrux: Voldemort's soul took over baby Harry. It seems a very dark premise, but the story is brilliantly hilarious.

2. Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived: HP plot successfully ported over to a non magic world, and I like it even better than the original!

3. The Sum of Their Parts: A Dark Lord Harry who is still his canon self, and even joined by Ron and Hermione, the Weasleys, and the DA.

4. Emperor: unparalleled war epic with immense amount of world building, politics, and strategies.

5. The Dark Lord Never Died: Three way war between Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Lucius Malfoy. Malfoy won the first round, but a very cunning and manipulative Dumbledore would have his revenge. Hermione started out as a very loyal Malfoy minion.

** Couple of random ideas:

1: After a Herbology-related accident, Neville discovers that he can talk to houseplants. They tell him many interesting things, like what the weather's going to be like the next day, and whether or not his socks match.

2: Another "Harry goes back in time to relive his Hogwarts years and do it better this time" fic, but with a twist: Harry ends up not in his own younger body, but in the body of a recently-graduated Muggle-born girl. Now he has to cope with not only being a woman, but also try to help his younger self survive.

3: HP/Discworld crossover. During Harry's fifth year, Umbridge messes with forces she doesn't understand, and the result is that Hogwarts castle in its entirety, with teachers and students, appears in Ankh-Morpork, next to Unseen University. Bonus points if the fic includes Archcnancellor Ridcully bellowing "Who put a castle next to my University?!"

4: All the humans and humanoids of Hogwarts have succumbed to a weird sleeping sickness and are all lying in a deep sleep, unable to wake up. Now it's up to the pets -- Hedwig, Crookshanks, Pigwidgeon, Fang, Trevor, Fawkes and all the others -- to find a cure and wake their humans up.

** I've got a couple of unformed ideas that may see the light of day if they get more fleshed-out.

Harry Potter and the Sussex Beekeeper: Sherlock Holmes (the Conan Doyle version) was a muggleborn who left the wizarding world. Harry and Hermione run into him during the horcrux hunt.

Madsong: Harry follows a unicorn, meets Dworkin.

And there should probably be a Harry Potter-Star Wars crossover titled, "These Aren't the Druids You're Looking For."

** Parselmouth of Gryffindor: Hermione is a Parselmouth, which makes her less inclined to blindly follow authority because all of her books denied snakes being sentient despite her evidence to the contrary.
