Harry becomes despondent with the wizarding world and it's callous manipulation. He decides he doesn't want to be a symbol that they can crucify at will. During the triwizard tournament he makes the decision to break the contract with surprising results. Harry doesn't die or lose his magic, he becomes free for the first time and Dobby is there to help him stay that way.


** Gotta tag this. Is it a prompt, a fic search, a request...?

*** A prompt but it'd be stupid to admit I have only used reddit once and have no clue how to tag stuff yet. I thought the idea of magical intent destroying the horcrux in 4th year through the scar connection might make for a whole new AR.

**** If you're not on your phone, the flair button should be right under your post, to the right of where it says 'crosspost.' If I were you, I'd resubmit it, since it's been a day and you've been downvoted. Just submit a new post, then go back and hit flair once it's been submitted.
