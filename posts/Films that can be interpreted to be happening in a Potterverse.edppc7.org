I've watched /The Dead Center/ recently, and, without giving much about it away, it can be interpreted as something happening either in the canon Potterverse, or a somewhat fanon-ish AU universe.

That got me thinking if there are any other movies that are not officially associated with the franchise, but could still be watched the same way. Obviously it should be a more or less easy assumption to make, without having to strain suspension too much or make too many provisions for it to work.

Does anyone know any other movie titles that would match such request criteria?


** I like to add my own little endings to horror movies where wizards show up and obliviate everybody involved. To muggles, it's a horribly traumatic event. To wizards, it's just an ordinary work day.

** Certainly. Lots of fantasy films can fit on the fringes. The live-action version of Road Dahl/'s *The BFG, for example, seems like it could totally be about the tiny pocket of barbaric full-blooded Giants we hear about in Giants. And *Bedknobs & Broomsticks/ can easily be about a "late-bloomer" Muggle-Born discovering her power via a spellbook which somehow slipped below the radar of the Statute of Secrecy.

*** Following the Roald Dahl idea, Matilda is a Muggle-Born witch, Willy Wonka is another muggle-born who got in massive trouble with the Ministry and sagely keeps away in his factory, everything in The Witches, James and the Giant Peach is the result of Muggle Baiting, so on and so forth.

There's a reason Philosopher's Stone reads like a Roald Dahl book.

*** Underworld works rather well, now that I think about it. There's also /The Autopsy of Jane Doe,/ from the more recent ones.

** The Worst Witch show has a very similar vibe, just a bit younger. It could easily be another institute in the same universe.
