I find the idea intriguing, but so far have not found a good story. Can you help?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Although he no longer goes to Hogwarts, he does have a close relationship with Sirius's son Leo, who is being portrayed quite sympathetically in this fic.

There is a rather hilarious conversation between Bellatrix and Sirius about him:

#+begin_quote
  Sirius grinned. "Well, Leo how about it? Cousin Bella has been smashing enough to offer to let you feel like you were involved tonight."

  "I will gladly go to Cousin Bella's flat," Leo said, grinning at Sirius.

  Sirius looked at Leo suspiciously, and then to Bellatrix. "What's so special about your flat?"

  "I have a lot of firewhiskey," Bellatrix said.

  Sirius frowned. "I remember you always drinking wine, though."

  "It is the only way I can lure handsome young men to my flat," Bellatrix said, completely deadpan.

  "Having an incestuous relationship with my son would not be appropriate," Sirius said, also completely deadpan.

  "There is a widely recognized exception for purebloods," Bellatrix said, winking at Leo.

  "Will you sick people stop that!" Cassie Black, Sirius's wife, called from another room. "Take the boy and be gone.”

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

*** Ooooo I love this story. I actively have tried to find another story that might have someone even close to the characterization of Sirius' kid, Orion.

** This is one of my favorites:

Linkffn(Black Bond)

Also does the soul bond trope pretty well.
