With the last book released 8 years ago and the last movie 4, do you feel like the fandom is dying out?

Are there less fics being written and published?

Are less people reading Harry Potter?

How do you think we should keep the fire burning for the next generation?

*** I don't think that the activity in this subreddit necessarily reflect the activity in the Fandom. Ive been apart of the fandom since '05 but have only recently begun using reddit and by extension, this subreddit. I can certainly feel the death of the fandom, as someone else has stated below, there used to be countless sources for the fandom. Lj, portkey, ficwad, harrypotterfanfiction, etc. now it feels as if the community has shrunk greatly. This subreddit has just allowed us all to pool our knowledge and experience in the fandom which makes it feel like the fandom is still alive and kicking but i think its just due to each others enthusiasm rather than the enthusiasm that used to surround the fandom

** I can answer this question! Somewhat objectively even!

I'm the guy that looked at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3jmxv0/i_analyzed_the_character_choices_from_200000_fics/][character choices in fics on FFN]]. One thing I looked at but didn't add to that post was how the rate of submissions have changed over time. So here you go!

[[http://uncertaindecisions.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/submission_rate.png][Rate of submissions to FFN over time]]

I marked when movies and books came out, and you can definitely see some releases occurred right before big spikes in submissions. Just as interesting, however, is how the rate has held up over time since the last movie came out. It is trending downward, but quite slowly when you consider it's been four whole years. I'm continually amazed by how popular Harry Potter still seems to be.

Disclaimer: You shouldn't pay attention to the actual numeric values on the y-axis, since this is the rate of submissions just in my sample of fics. I sampled somewhat uniformly though, so you can get a mediocre estimate by multiplying by 3.5 (I sampled 200k of the roughly 700k total).

*** If I can offer a thought on why the rate has remained steady after the movies finished: it's most likely because the people who write fics, are also more likely to be book readers, who view the movies as an afterthought. They're a nice add-on to the series, but not necessarily the biggest draw.

The people writing fanfiction are already hardcore fans. They'll get excited about the movies, but it they stuck with it so long after the release of the last book, the movies ending aren't likely to impact them much.

Also, though the rate of submission has held up, the communities that traditionally support the writers have not. Portkey, Mugglenet, HPfanfic (the site, not this sub), fanficauthurs, and hundreds more are either gone or completely dead.

******* A lot of any fandom is speculation on what's going to happen. Once the books are over and we know everything that happened, for some people, it's just over. Harry Potter is just as popular as it was in 2005, if you count people who love and have fond memories of it. The fandom is just not as /active/. But all the fans are still out there, and the moment the franchise gives them something new to focus on (next year) there will be a resurgence of online activity. Especially if the Fantastic Beasts films have some dangling plot points that fans can speculate on from one movie to the next.

To me it's hard to say something is really dying when it's still 10 times as popular as the second most popular fandom.

** Without a doubt, yes.

Watching the fandom go from what it was in '03 to now actually kind of hurts. There used to be gigantic communities dedicated to individual pairings, sites with hundreds of thousands of viewers and posts.

Now it's pretty much this sub, and dlp. At least in terms of fanfiction. The larger general HP sub is very y big, but it's pretty much all reports and rehashed discussion threads about subjects that have been talked about a thousand times to already.

Will it did out completely? No, I don't think so. Look at Star Trek, is hung around for decades, and HP was far more popular than it in its heyday.

At the very least, this sub is getting more and more active, with more members everyday, it's almost tripled in size since I joined two years ago. We're not going anywhere.

*** Those parts are over because the books are all published. Most of what was fueling those sites was theories and guesses as to what would happen. It's not really possible to have that kind of fandom anymore, and much as I miss it, I don't think the fandom is dying or getting smaller, it's just not active in the same way. There are more fans than ever, they just show it by going to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter or noking jokes on Tumblr or whatever instead of making wild speculations online.

Compare it to something like ASOIAF fandom. They are at that stage now, the wild theories and tinfoil, and they're all chomping at the bit for the last two books to come out so they can find out what happens at the end. They don't realize that the waiting and guessing is the part you savor, because once it ends, your fandom is over. ASOIAF won't have the staying power of Harry Potter.

** One thing that nobody has mentioned is that all of the low-hanging fic ideas have been written. And by low-hanging, I don't mean bad. I just mean obvious. As much as I like Harry/Hermione, every reasonable version of that, and several hundred unreasonable versions, have already been written. I don't think authors, or readers, feel a need to rehash ideas, once a well-executed fic with those ideas exists. If you're an author thinking about writing today, I can't imagine how difficult it is to come up with an idea that doesn't just feel derivative of someone Else's fic. Also, I think we as readers share some of the blame for the reduced output. In 2005 when fanfic was knew, I wasn't nearly as hard on authors and stories as I am now, because my expectations just weren't that high, and I was grateful to have anything at all to read. I feel bad for a brand-new author starting out today, who has a vast sea of incredible works of fanfic to measure up to. I've also noticed that the hatred for particular authors (robst, lesswrong, two or three others) has intensified to the point where they can't even be discussed on the sub without collecting downvotes almost exclusively, and we get 1 or 2 posts a month dedicated entirely to hating particular works. If you're an author or reader coming to fanfic for the first time, I suspect that would make anyone just give the community a pass, and move on to other fandoms. With the proliferation of online content, it isn't like we're starved for a choice of fantasy works to obsess over, and fandom communities to join.

There are /at least/ three more films coming out, there's a play, and I highly doubt Rowling is willing to give up this world at this point.

Look at how popular stuff like Dickens and Great Gatsby remain, even without the films of them, and that's after a hundred years. It might wane but it won't die. Or maybe I just believe a little too much in the power of love...

So no, Harry Potter will always be alive and well for me.

Personally, I won't be having children. However I do know some new moms who are enjoying reading the series to their kids. It's heartwarming to know there's a whole new population of little ones eagerly waiting their Owl!

You know what? A few months ago I probably wouldn't have done; but you and various other Slytherins, both real, canon, and in fanfiction, have changed that.

Rereading the series with a more mature head has let me look at the house with a more open mind than when I was 14 (when I read DH the first time) and I'm able to see the Harry/Gryffindor bias (good!Gryffindor vs evil!Slytherin) in the series. Add to this the portrails of Draco in fanfiction, as well as linkffn(The Changeling by annerb) which follow a Slytherin Ginny through school, and I have a new appreciation and respect for the house.

And I appreciate all of the support and friendship I've personally received from Slytherin House here on and off Reddit. *Harry was wrong - Slytherins aren't "evil", you're some of the fiercest friends around. I think Rowling was wrong too - everyone should want to be a true Slytherin, equally or more-so than Hufflepuff.*

*** There's the short one that goes around on Tumblr. I assume you've seen it?

**** Yeah, I've read that one. I really want a nice long juicy fic that is essentially GoF without Cedric and instead the Hogwarts Champions are Harry (Gryffindor) and PERSON* (Slytherin).

* I am not picky about who this person is.

** Several of my favorite authors only started publishing in the last year, I think we're fine for the foreseeable future.

** I don't think it's dying, more like stabilizing. I've been reading hpfic since around 2001 (although my 5th grade reading choices were /awful/), and I keep finding more and more really well written fanfiction every day. Especially since [[/r/hpfanfiction]] (I'm new to reddit).

Are there fewer fics? In comparison to the pre-DH years, I think so. We've lost the speculation!fics since the series is already complete.

I feel though that while there were /more/ then in general, there are more well-written fics now, or since 2008. Plus I'm getting more selective, so sometimes it has felt like I've already read everything that there is to read.

** Less fics being written and published? Yes

Less people reading Harry Potter? Yes, though it is more like it leveled off to a reasonable level vs super popular

Keep the fire burning? Read to your kids, get them to read the books before seeing the movies or see Chamber and then read the rest before watching each movie. Discuss the differences between the novel and the movie versions.

Don't forget that there is a new movie coming out too which will cause at least a bounce in both readership and fanfiction. But the "good old days" are gone.

I don't know what will be the "next big thing" in fanfiction, it will take a while for anything to catch up. Naruto is pretty popular and Buffy the Vampire Slayer is still going pretty strong despite being over even longer than HP.
