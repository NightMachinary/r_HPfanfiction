It's a fic where Harry Potter and Theodore Nott are Auror partners three years after the Battle of Hogwarts, and during an investigation of a criminal coven of witches and wizards, are sent back in time to their eleven-year-old bodies by an old Egyptian ritual. They decide to try and save as many people as possible while researching the ritual that sent them back in time and they change things up along the way; starting with Harry being Sorted in Slytherin.

AO3: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28119780/chapters/68898909]]

This fic includes all of that tropey and cliche stuff in (hopefully) inventive ways. Those tropes and cliches (amongst other stuff) include:

- /Fix it!/ As few people die as possible! While I can agree that killing characters can give some added tension or emotion to the fic, I personally love it when as many people as possible survive.
- /Slytherin!Harry/. Harry's not suited for Gryffindor anymore, though he could've been in Ravenclaw. He'll be using the politics of Slytherin (favours and allies) to his advantage this time around.
- /Powerful!Intelligent!Independent!Harry./ Harry's got some new tricks up his sleeves, including and not limited to: spellcrafting, warding, and curse-breaking! [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/lp4upg/just_posted_the_new_chapter_for_my_fic_hbi_hr_at/gobqyif/?context=3][Here]] is a link to a reply to a question I made about how my version of magic works in the fic and [[https://archiveofourown.org/comments/411997479][here]] is a link to a reply I made to a comment I got on AO3 of me describing how Harry's magic works and why he's powerful (more or less).
- /Lordships!/ Yes, Harry is the heir to two Most Ancient and Noble Houses (Potter and Black), but gone is "extremely powerful, bow down bitches" cliche! Harry, like many other children in Slytherin, is simply only the heir of those two Houses and he doesn't have ridiculous power due to that. The Lordships are only titles for those who have seats on the Wizengamot (though many of the older families were appointed by King Arthur and Merlin themselves) and they only have the political power due to their family. Meaning Harry has to deal with the stigma of the Blacks and the fact that the Potters hadn't been in the game for decades. It's a good thing that being the Vanquisher of Voldemort, aka the Boy-Who-Lived, gives him some political power to work with! Though, a lot of people will seek Harry as an ally because he'll have more votes than others in the Wizengamot, meaning that if someone wants a bill passed, they should get on his side to get him to back them up.
- /Grey/Dark!Harry./ Harry's not evil, Merlin no, but he certainly isn't the "Light Golden Boy" anymore! He's killed and tortured and he's practising darker, sometimes illegal magic! And let's not forget the fact that even though he was an Auror, he lived in a house full of Dark history and secrets; including a secret library! And some other stuff I mentioned earlier in the fic but I'll leave that to you to read.
- /PTSD and Abuse./ So, I might have dialled the abuse up just a bit? It's still pretty canon. The abuse is only mentioned in the fic (meaning no scenes where Vernon violently belts Harry), but Harry does experience some anxiety and panic due to his cupboard. The starvation thing is something I'll be touching on a bit as well as Harry dissociating (see if you can spot the mention of that one). I've also apparently given Harry a service/therapy dog on accident, so that's cute.
- /Canon Compliant/ */and/* /Divergent./ As this fic takes place after the books, it's safe to say that anything you read in the books is canon in my fic (though some bits may be exaggerated). It'll stay that way for most of the major plot points (Basilisk on the loose, Sirius breaking out of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, Dementor attack, etc.) until after fourth year where the changes kick-off. The magic system I use is pretty fanon, such as magical "cores" existing and the Trace acting differently.
- /Epilogue, What Epilogue?/ I might have taken a few tidbits out of the epilogue (mainly about Harry being an Auror), but Harry never got married to Ginny nor did he have children with horrid names.
- /Cursed Child nods./ I am mainly ignoring anything that was written in the Cursed Child (mostly because I've never read it), though I did add a few tidbits from the character wikis into the fic. This includes Harry still being a Parselmouth after he got the Horcrux removed and Theo messing around with time turners.
- /Bashing./ My bashing is completely/almost based on canon events/personalities/characteristics. Hermione is a bit insufferable and rude at the beginning ("Are you sure that's a /real/ spell?") and she's a bit closed-minded towards wizarding customs and traditions; Ron's */not/* a prejudiced prat who spits vitriol furiously at the sight of a Slytherin but he will get jealous of Harry during the Goblet of Fire; Molly Weasley will be bashed slightly on the fact that she took over Sirius's house and cleaned it out and threw shit away (like, you could have /sold/ all that stuff, and not to mention the books!) but that's all (and the fact that she's an overbearing, presumptuous person); Sirius and Remus will be touched a bit on their flaws; and some of Dumbledore's manipulations will be mentioned but Harry's not going to be super pissed at him (okay, so I might have lied on that, but Dumbledore's not /evil/). Oh, and the Dursleys, but that's a given.
- /Harry Potter/Theodore Nott/. I absolutely love this relationship. The fanon version of Theo has so much in common with Harry and I feel like they would just click. There's also the bonus that Theo's a pretty undiscovered character so I can describe him/characterize him however I like. It's also a nice difference to Harry/Draco fics, where Theo is still Dark but he's less well-known than Draco and he can sympathize more than Draco.

Feel free to ask me any questions about the fic or if you want more of an explanation on something I've mentioned above!

*** Lol. I try to actually make my fic and anything related to it interesting. What makes you uninterested in the fic? The fact that it has so many cliches (especially Lord Potter-Black)? The fact that it's a time travel fix-it? The fact that it's Harry/Theo?

** I like the concept, I'll give it a try! I've definitely never read a time travel fic where Harry+Theo get sent back. And I always enjoy worldbuilding in terms of other magical abilities so it'll nice be nice to see what auror!Harry can do!

Before I dip my toes in it, I'm just curious on where do you have your magic stemming from in this fic? For example, when spells are cast, is the magic gathered externally or internally? If internally, do wizards have a finite source within them to cast from and are the pools of magic different per person based on random factors, or is it something people can grow?

I'll read it regardless, I'm just curious because I think it's fun to see how everyone sets up different magic systems for their fics (all are enjoyable)

*** Magic is an external and internal force in my fic. Like a lot of fanon, I am using the "core" concept. Magic cores are kind of a magic muscle, where if you use enough magic and train yourself, it can stretch and grow. But it has a limit. It grows naturally as a witch or wizard ages (which is something I've mentioned in my fic, I think, and will be a plot point in the future) and will become at least twice the size of their magical core once they reach their majority/finish their schooling before tapering off. There are magical rituals and such that could boost your magical core, but it's not permanent. Everyone's magical core is different in size, though they're all usually powerful enough to be able to cast some sort of wandless magic (which is taught in seventh year). The kids around Harry's age (meaning his year and the next two years above and below him) have slighty larger magical cores than normall due to the war. The size of magical core is dependant on the magical core of your parents mostly, your family, other factors (such as karma), but if you lived in a densly populated area with a lot of magic, it's possible that it could boost taht child's magical power (such as if a child grew up in Hogwarts, which has a crap ton of old magic in it to the point where even the least magically-sensitive could sense something). There are, again, rituals that could boost an unborn child's magical core and it can result in late bloomers over Squibs if you're having one. Late bloomers have slow-growing magic so they're not as powerful as reguar witches and wizards. It is unlikely that they would progress pass their OWLs in physical exams. However, these rituals could also result in Squibs.

Trauma is definitely a deciding factor for magical cores, as well. A child could be an Obscurus by unconsciously repressing their magic and keeping it locked up without much accidental magic happening (which keeps a child's growing magic stable) or they could become like Ariana Dumbledore and have extremely unstable magic. They could also even make themselves Squibs, or something similar to it. This is how I'm justifying Neville not having much accidental magic and his magic being percieved as weaker than it is (though the wrong wand is also a factor). The trauma of watching his parents be tortured to insanity (and maybe him being Crucioed once or twice or even memory charms to erase the memory) affected his magic.

For the external sources, I already menitoned Hogwarts. Hogwarts is a breeding ground for magic, which is how it created Peeves. All of that extra magic, and the children's happiness via their magic and joy and mischief, formed Peeves. Diagon Alley is also filled with latent magic from being filled with witches and wizards and magical plants and magical animals and magical creature parts. That magic is what I'll have power the magic hiding the alley from Muggle eyes. It's like a circle. External sources like plants and animal parts and such were used in older magic spells, the type of spells that didn't use incantations. I'm talking like hex bags from Supernatural. Potions is also a good example of this, though you do need an internal tap of magic to "power" the potions, I guess, which is why Muggles can't create potions. If their potionerring paraphernelia was steeped in magic and-or charmed, then they could probably create potions until the magic was weak enough to not "wake up" the magic in their ingredients.

Magic is a living and breathing thing, as well. Why do you think there are so many sentient plants or magical creatures? It becomes more alive on various solstices and stuff, and there's also ley lines and other such stuff. Luna's "nargles" are living magic, or the living magic that she can see, at any rate, when she's not using them as a coping mechanism for her bullying. (I'm actually debating with this one, I might also make the nargles and stuff Luna seeing people's emotions and magic and stuff, similarly to Harry's gift though hers wasn't curated like Harry's.)

Magic is somewhat finite in a witch or wizard (or in animals and sometimes plants). You can use increments of it and it can recover easily from the loss, but if you use too much, then you're left weak and with only a little bit of magic to try and recover itself. It's like asexual reproduction or mitosis/meiosis in cell growth. The more cells there are, the faster it grows. If you're only left with a few "cells," it'll take you a while to recover. Or, if you use too much magic and there are too little "cells," then there's a possibility that you'll never recover. On your own, at least.

In my version of Harry Potter, covens aren't just for family groups or groups of close-knit friends. They're so groups of witches and wizards can pool their magic together and use it to cast more powerful spells. However, this type of magic isn't very common anymore and is just barely mentioned in the Ancient Studies courses. Voldemort siphoned magic from his Death Eaters to make him more powerful and others siphon magic from plants or animals to make themselves more powerful. Like in potions. Potions can kickstart your "cell growth" if you're low on magic since they have magic in them, but it would be better if your friend shared some of their magic with you. However, if you mingle magic in a certain way, it could bond you to each other. This is why covens were so close and tight-knit and betrayal was seen as the highest crime (or whatever it's called, I can't think of big words right now). It's because you are bonded to one another and that forms attatchments. I may or may not use this in the future of my fic, I've only just come up with it.

That's pretty much all I can think of at the moment, do you have any more questions? Don't be shy about asking them, either, lol. I love it when people want to discuss my fic or my idea of fanon with me! Your questions just got me in a writing mood and they helped me think up some plot ideas for my fic! (That's why I ask people to ask me questions, lol. It's because they kickstart my writing and help me plan out my fic. I've got like an essay's worth of my own responses in a separate post, lol.)

I hope you like the fic!

**** Thankyou for taking the time to compose such a well thought out response! I love that you've taken the time to walk through and plan all the components for magic! Everything you have described is honestly my ideal setup for how magic works in the hpverse and I'm excited to see how it's slowly brought up and introduced into the fic. I like that you've added reasonable limiting factors for core size and that rituals are temporary for magical growth.

I've read your fic and I enjoyed it and I'm excited to see how it continues! And since you've asked for feedback, here you go:

1. For me personally, it's hard to read fics when the text/paragraph layout is justified. It's really hard on my eyes bc my eyes are used to words being spaced equally apart and when the distance between words changes for each line, it cut my reading speed in half. If I was on desktop I'd probably just inspect the element and manually temporarily change it for myself, but on mobile I don't have a way to do it.

2. I think you have a solid foundation for the premise and motivations but some of the delivery of information is pretty hand to mouth. You tend to explain the reasoning behind every action someone takes, not leaving much room for inferring. That's not always a bad thing because you're giving us backstory info from the past that's needed, but sometimes it's too "mental" and the same understanding can be gained from slightly more fleshed out interactions. I'm not sure I'm explaining myself very well. But overall I think you're doing a good job on the baselines of all the character interactions themselves.

3. The farther I got into it, the better things seemed to flow. There were 2 small bits in the first chapter that sorta took me out of it, and they were when Harry 'swore. Colorfully.' Rather than feeling in the scene with Harry, I suddenly felt outside like I was listening to a narration. It also heavily softened the impact, i didn't get to share the guttural feeling of realizing they are in the past.. Same with when Harry shared his lack of findings, since I didn't get to read any dialogue between them, it felt like a narration and stole away the depth of.the situation a bit.

4. Like I mentioned, the farther you get in the story, the better you seem to have gotten at delivering the info. For example, I think that chapter 4 is the first time you used the italics to actually represent what Harry is thinking (the sneaky thought) rather than narrating/telling us what Harry is thinking. It took awhile but you finally did it again when he thought that mischief and padfoot wouldn't get mixed up. I like your normal use of italics to emphasize certain things of importance, maybe there's another combination text stylizing/quotes you could use to represent internal thoughts more. Whenever you narrate his thoughts (telling us what he is thinking) it sorta feels like there's this buffer between me and the story. Whereas when you have him thinking as an action, it pulls me into it...does that make any sense??

***** Thank you so much for the feedback!

I've been thinking a lot about whether or not I should keep it justified or not. Half the time I think justified looks cluttered and half the time I thing right align (or whatever it's called) is messy. However, I never thought about that fact that a lot of people read fics on mobile. I've always used computers since I don't have a phone. I think I'll do a poll or something on here asking people's thoughts on whether or not they prefer reading stuff that's justified or not.

I can totally understand how the delivery of information feels like reading out of a textbook sometimes. A few people have commented about me "telling" instead of "showing" so I'll definitely be working on that in the future. I just struggle a bit with making sure my point gets across without people thinking the wrong thing. Thank you for pointing it out!

I'm kinda working on curating my writing style so pointing out how I wrote things kinda breaks up the mood or whatever is extremely helpful. I'm really happing that my writing seems to flow well most of the time!

For the last part, I'm a little confused about what you're saying. My brain's having a little trouble with working out what people are writing today, for some reason. Like, I got a comment on the fic and it took me a solid five minutes of staring at it to understand what the person was saying.

Do you mean that thoughts written like this:

#+begin_quote
  Harry couldn't believe that he hadn't seen this sooner. Crabbe and Goyle were /pretending/ to be dumb!
#+end_quote

Affect the realism or the pull or whatever more than this:

#+begin_quote
  /I can't believe I didn't see this sooner! Crabbe and Goyle are/ */pretending/* /to be dumb/!
#+end_quote

But, you know, written better.

Or is it the other way around? Sorry, as I said, I'm having trouble deciphering plainly written statements today.
