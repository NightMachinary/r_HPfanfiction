The Weasleys refuse to sell Marietta Edgecomb their pimple-vanishing cream. No one can figure out how to undo the “SNEAK” jinxed across her face. (Hermione says it will come off when Marietta feels remorse for what she's done, but Marietta feels justified.) So, Marietta figures it out herself.

How does she do it? Does she study hard, become a St Mungo's certified healer, and wow the world with skincare charms? Does she invent her own skincare line and begin a Wizarding World MLM company, where she's the top of the pyramid? Does she learn from Muggle dermatology and adapt it with magic? What do you think?


** Or, she borrows a spare Guy Fawkes mask and plans the Gunpowder Plot on Hogwarts?

*** IDK, I feel like Marietta and Hermione are such different people, that even if they pursued the exact same career, it would be different for each of them
