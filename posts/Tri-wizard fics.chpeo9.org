Looking for fics that include a better tri-wizard-tournament

I say better not because canon was bad, but I dont want any rehash of the same tasks, or for example the same tasks but harry does something other than ride his firebolt.

Please no Hermione bashing Dumbledore or weasley bashing Rehash/retelling of canon Harry or Hermione paired with death eaters

I dont mind fics that start before the twt just as long as it plays a role, I feel like the twt is a place where a author could really have fun with interesting and different magics.

I'd really prefer that Hermione still has a major role in the fic but IS NOT paired with ron.

I've already read patron and Hermione granger and the goblet of fire


** Fair warning about this one, it's /dark/, but linkffn(Princess of the Blacks) has a far better Triwizard Tournament (dragon task is still the same but the others aren't)

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry

*** Thanks. I just read this story and I can confirm that the Triwizard tasks in it are well-designed challenges, different from canon except the first, and that the story shows a good variety of strategies by the different competitors in each task. I liked the story enough that I will read the sequel.

** linkffn(3384712) has an almost completely rewritten Tournement. The tasks are all different, and vary from a dueling tournament to a very tricky puzzle room.

Hermione doesn't feature much, however.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** linkao3(14281440) ? And yes, the JKR's design WAS bad: the second task --- all spectators view the surface of the lake for an hour, the third task --- all spectators view the hedges for an hour.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort.
