Hello!

Okay, I've tried everything. I've Googled everything and posted on forums, and for the life of me I cannot seem to find this specific Fanfiction. For all I know it could be offline. If you have any help or suggestions I would forever be thankful to you!

Basically what happens in this Fanfiction is Harry and Draco are twins. Draco has some kind of mark on his ankle along with a number of other death eaters children. I think Pansy Parkinson and Theodore Nott were two of them. This mark had something to do with a prophecy. Besides that, all I can really remember was Harry punched Draco in the face at one point and stormed out of their home after yelling at Lucius. Harry was definitely the black sheep of the family. The marks on the ankles were also put there by LV. They were given to the first born children of his most faithful.

I also want to say there was romance between Harry and Lord Voldemort, but I don't remember finishing the fic, so I could be wrong.

I read this on Fanfiction.net if that helps.

My fingers are crossed this sounds familiar to someone!

Thank you to anyone who can help!


** It's been a while since I read it so I'm fuzzy on the details, but this is making me think of Sleeping Somewhere Cold by Dark Cyan Star. All those stories are deleted from FF.net, but there is a Yahoo group where all the deleted stories were posted by the author.
