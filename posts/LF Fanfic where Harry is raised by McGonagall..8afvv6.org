Because if there are some I'd like to read them, and if there aren't any I need to write it...


** I'm currently writing one where she will be taking him in starting in my next chapter. That aside, such stories /do/ exist but they're rare. Annoyingly, several such stories that seem to advertise themselves as having Minerva raising Harry trick the reader and basically have an OC raise him in her stead; those are very annoying.

Some legitimate ones (so far as I recall) are "1 High Street", "Hogwarts is My Home" (looks abandoned though, and I don't really count this one since its temporary), "McGonagall's Soft Side", "Harry Potter and the Tabby Cat", "Hand Delivered Letter" (I /think/ she takes him in, she might just rescue him from the Dursleys; I can't remember).

linkffn(12787389; 11437673; 2722845; 12531450; 7989419)

Hope those give you some places to start since finding these can be annoying, and several you do find like "Harry McGonagall" (complete 'MURICA wank) and "Mama McGonagall" and "Raising Harry" are false advertisements where it's actually an OC (or for some dumb reason, an OC who is a McGonagall because that's more interesting somehow) that raises Harry.

  Minvera McGonagall could not stand to watch Albus make this mistake. Harry would not grow with the Dursleys. He would grow with her.

  McGonagall thought for a moment, with no child of her own and one on the way to them now she stood up straight. "Give the boy to me Albus." Harry is raised in Hogwarts until he turns five, in that time the Tonks' adopt him. Over the years, he discovers who he really is, and what the pain on his forehead could possibly mean. Some Fluff, changing the series around and general fan fic

  What if McGonagall had delivered the letter from the start like she had done for every other muggle-raised child? Why wouldn't she have wanted to check up on Harry when she loathed the Dursley's from day one? Well, maybe Harry would have been encouraged to think and try his hardest not to make friends but to earn the respect of his new guardian. Begins after the trip to the zoo.

  Instead of sending his Hogwarts acceptance letter by owl, McGonagall decides to personally deliver to Harry, which sets of a chain of events that changes many aspects of the life of the Boy-Who-Lived.
