Basically anything heavily about what everyday Hogwarts life would be like, with some "Damn it, what's that Harry Potter effing up now?" every once in awhile. I was rewatching the movies yesterday for the first time in ages, which got me wanting to reread the books, but also inspired me to seek out any stories from the perspective of, say, your average Hufflepuff at school while Harry is. Something more comedic in tone, preferably.

Anyone know of any really good fics like this?


** I feel like a story like this would absolutely have to be humor. Or excessively dark. Totally interested in what people suggest!

*** 'Hogwarts is an ancient castle. It is a powerful and strange school with many, many secrets buried inside, underneath and in-between its ancient walls. Some of these things are monsters. Others, cursed artifacts. Occasionally, you even get a shiny bauble of monstrous power. All of them are hidden behind closed-off doorways, trapped corridors, hidden teleporters and more. Is it any wonder that the muggleborn happen to notice the similarities between their favourite school and every dungeon-crawler ever?'

** It's very short and 100% humor, but I remembered reading [[http://notbecauseofvictories.tumblr.com/post/62007098428/steel-plated-hearts-a-kid-at-hogwarts-who-just][this on Tumblr]] a while ago. Not quite a fic but I figured I'd share it.

*** There was another tumblr comment tree about discussions regular students would be having in the school halls throughout Harry's years there, but I can't find it.

*** Ha! I hadn't come across that before, thanks for it. That's pretty much in the vein (though a very short version) of what I had in mind.

** I would like to see one in which one of Harry's classmates had their own adventures that were just as mad as Harry Potter's showing that everyone has a batshit Hogwarts experience and that everything doesn't revolve around him.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2581495/1/Blackwand_Chronicles][The Blackwand Cronicles]] is pretty cool, though abandoned pretty early on. Its not so much about Harry and his life, but its a group of kids who start at Hogwarts in Harry's third year, so he is busy dealing with godfathers and dementors in the background.
