The version on FFN is the "rated R" version and it references more complete scenes on a website that no longer exists. Does anyone have the complete version?


** +I have a copy, but there's a formatting problem with it: half the speech quotes and apostrophes have been replaced by question marks. I think there must have been an error or something when it was downloaded.+

*18 Oct '16 Edit:* I've now fixed all the formatting errors.

If you want it anyway, drop me a PM with your email and I'll send it.
