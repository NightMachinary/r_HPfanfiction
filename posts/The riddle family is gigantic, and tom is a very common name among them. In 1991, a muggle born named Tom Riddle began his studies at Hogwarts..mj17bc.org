** Cue Dumbledore and maybe Minerva freak out. Slughorn if it gets to his ears too.

But no really. Imagine him being really likeable and being friends with Ron, Harry and Hermione and Dumbledore has huge freak out sessions. Like now think of the chamber incident. Would Diary Riddle already know since he is Ron's friend and has presumably met Ginny? How would he react? When they do find out about Voldemort's real name...

*** Would Ginny see the diary, figure out it is not a gift for her but belongs to a "Tom Riddle", and just hand the thing to Tom, her brother's friend who must have misplaced the diary? That action alone would change things significantly.

** I had a similar thought but it being his actual muggleborn half brother (that his father had just after leaving his mother- or who was already conceived when his mother love potioned his father). So more of a 2 tom riddles at hogwarts at the same time thing.

*** I want a big political thriller kind of epic where the other Tom Riddle is a Muggle (since the magic is on the Gaunts' side), but he ends up being the British PM (they are a rich family, so it tracks) and thus ends up entangled in the war effort against Voldemort and actually makes significant contributions to it before discovering that the guy he's fighting against is his half brother.

Of course all of this depends on whether Voldy would have tracked down Riddle Sr.'s children as well when he came after them.
