Are there any well written stories where there's actually a good Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher? The things he or she teaches makes sense, and shows them being a teacher/mentor?

Rather it's Harry himself or someone else entirely is good, just as long as it's interesting and well written.

Would rather the story be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione as a pairing but any other pairing is fine

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Any Era and the teacher can be anyone just as long as the person is competent.

Would rather not have character bashing, unless it's like Percy I suppose.


** The infamous HP&the Methods of Rationality has Quirrel teach a bunch of stuff that makes sense. He takes on the main character (very ooc harry potter) as his protege.

He's also entirely evil, but that's besides the point.

**** It's preachy. I liked it too, but I can see how the undercurrent of "this is the Way, the Light and the Truth", might rub people the wrong way.

The author has a very high opinion of his own intelligence, which I guess can set people off.

**** Fix-it fics are some of the least well loved fics in the more dedicated fandom. The best authors know when to stop, day this is enough. You must have read stories where Harry isn't rich but the richest man alive by a factor of 100 who is due to inherit the country? One of the most important things to know when to stop is personal opinions. Politics especially is something most people don't understand enough to not annoy/offend someone out there. Why not leave it out and focus on the story? HPMOR is written by an author who can't stop themselves in any field. A person who prefers poking holes in things just to prove he can. Its preachy and its smug. That and some of its fans are near cultists is rather off putting. There are some fantastic reviews out there that go through chapter by chapter and pull it apart but I don't care enough to link it. I didn't enjoy it so I'm fine walking away.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - Non-BWL (at least it seems so) Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindelwald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. Strong wordbuilding, slow pacing. Just finished the first year.

Features competent and very plot relevant OC Defence teacher who is one of Harry's potential love interests (and the best one at that).

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725][Forging the Sword]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic that diverges from the end of CoS. Great take on the magic system, that's creative and stays close to canon at the same time. Rather slow paced, with the whole third year being focused mostly on the character- and worldbuilding. Sadly died just when plot was started getting really interesting. Though considering author's earlier hiatuses I still have hope for more updates. In this case the change is in mechanics of the diary - killing Tom would also kill Ginny. But not killing Tom would also mean that Ginny will die. And so Harry is forced to do a hard thing and kill his friend's sister. And things spiral out of there.

There is an OC competent Defence teacher here during the third year (aka the only one that was truly covered).

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] - Heavy AU with a Slytherin Harry who has a twin who was raised by their parents. Contrary to what you may expect it's decent. The fic is held down, by using quite a few bad ideas in worldbuilding (though they are mixed with good ones), and weak technical writing in early chapters, but the plot is strong enough to warrant the read. Ongoing with irregular updates.

Competent and plot relevant teacher in the second year.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12417372][Old Blood]] - Harry Potter mixed with Arthurian legends. Pretty interesting so far, especially in terms of Harry's relationship with (female) Quirrel. Unfortunately after the initial quick burst of updates came silence.

Aforementioned Quirrel is a Defence professor and a mentor figure to Harry.

 

Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse, and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of either. Matou Shinji, the protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him a failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets a letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focuses on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements of both settings with author's original ideas. Features Mahoutokoro, Durmstrang, and original magical school. Ongoing, with currently irregular updates.

Every year has a competent teacher, but only with the two first ones (Quirrel and Moody) we really see more of their work.
