Well written stories, specifically on ao3 (though if you know any underrated ones on FFN, feel free to link). No slash, smut driven plot, or abandoned stories. Crossovers are fine with Percy Jackson and the Olympians or minor ones that don't affect the story much.

Draco: PS.Thank you for the chocolates, which I have not yet tried. What did you do to them?

Harry: PS.The chocolates are completely safe for humans. Enjoy.

Draco: THAT WAS NOT SAFE FOR HUMANS.

Harry (to Professor Snape): “The catnip solution worked, if you want me to make something for Professor McGonagall.”

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** Linka03(15430560) is pretty top tier, and updating regularly.

linkao3(19334905) is also decent, but it has been abandoned for years. However the author migrated to ao3 and said he's writing new chapters like last month, so we can hope.

linkao3(10643571) hasn't update in a year. I usually wait two before considering a fic abandoned, but you might not be so lenient with update frequency.

  The true time-turner was slammed savagely into Hermione's throat. It shattered against her neck, bits of glass and gold piercing into her skin. The last thing she saw before blackness consumed her was a plume of metallic dust and vitreous fragments, tiny prisms dancing behind her eyelids. (In which Hermione accidentally ends up in 1950, pitted against an ascending Dark Lord in his prime, caught in the entanglement of pureblood politics, dark magic, and Tom Riddle's interest)

** I'm pretty sure Antithesis formats weirdly when you use the bot, but I'll try anyways lol. The summary isn't the greatest, but this fic is hands down THE BEST I've ever read. That characterization of Harry is incredible. It's a dark!Harry and a WBWL fic, but without the usual bashing that goes on. Although, it's mostly written from Harry view and he's an extremely unreliable narrator, so because of this it does seem like there's a little bit of bashing. Try to read it at least to the sorting ceremony, and by that point you'll know if you like the style/story or not. It's an absolutely beautiful fic and it deserves more reads. Linkao3(7322935)

I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end.

  In which the Sorting is less of a choice between Dark and Light and more of a fashion statement, Gryffindors are more than reckless, bumbling fools, and Slytherins aren't the only ones playing politics.Because you didn't actually believe that life is so straightforward as to be defined solely by the colour of a tie, did you?

  The war is all but over, and the wrong side won. Worse, the Wizarding World's hero and Ron Weasley's best friend died in the fight. When Draco Malfoy offers Ron a way to go back and fix things, he jumps at the chance. But can he anticipate how his changed moves will affect the board? [Trope stew: this fic began as an exercise, an attempt to use problematic or challenging tropes. A meta-discussion of each trope to follow each chapter.]
