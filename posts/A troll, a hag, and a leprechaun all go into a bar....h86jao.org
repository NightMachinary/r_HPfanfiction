...finish this joke.

This is straight from GoF by Dumbledore, but McGonagall interrupts him. I would like to see what that joke would've been.


** The Leprechaun and the troll get kicked out when the bartender points to a sign that says 'no hags, trolls or leprechauns'. The Hag sits at the bar and the bartender speaks to her. "The usual, Dolores?"

** All I can come up with is a pathetic “you're a little short” joke for when the leprechaun tries to pay. Someone please do better.

** The bartender looks nervous, but puts out some glasses and asks, "What'll yeh have?"

The leprechaun responds, "A whiskey for me. The troll'll have a spot of gin with stabilizing potion, and for her, a bloody mary with blood replenisher."

"They're both getting potions? Nothin fer you?"

"Well, the troll's actually a lad turned into a troll. The hag's a witch with a blood curse, says she'll turn em both back once he's caught her so many unicorns to eat that she's shittin rainbows."

"And you?"

"Me?" says the leprechaun, sipping from his whiskey. "I'm a real leprechaun. Just waitin on her chamberpot."

** October 31, 1981

A troll a hag and a leprechaun walk into a bar they came across while traveling trying to have a fun Halloween

The leprechaun, being of small body, ordered a butter beer. The hag ordered pickled toads and the troll ordered a full barrel of firewhisky.

They were an unusual bunch, but had all met long ago as colleagues in their chosen profession, and started a business crafting and selling vases together. They were roaming the country looking for large clay deposits, as nobody wanted to sell clay to them.

As they merrily are and drank, a new person entered the bar: a hotheaded wizard named Dirk, famous in the town for his dueling skills. Immediately spying the odd trio, he snuck up to them trying to attack the troll before any damage could be done.

The moment Dirk stepped up with his wand drawn, the troll (feeling threatened) backhanded Dirk into the wall where fell dead on the spot.

The trio hastily exited the bar never to be seen again. When the bartender came to his wits, he shouted to the town: “Dirk Lloyd has been killed by a hairy potter!”

Edit: it's pretty bad ik but I had a hard time coming up with any puns or any interactions between the three

** "Three Irish Whiskeys, and ya better be Dublin 'em!" the Leprechaun called out. The Troll and Hag stood back while he downed all 6 jiggers himself.

"That's an awful lot for a little fellow, what's the occasion?"

"The day I've had, you wouldn't believe it! Starts off with a little girl who comes up to me pot o' gold and tries to take it! Well, I tell her to leave it be and I'll give her three wishes.

She starts smirking and says 'Ha, and Mafilda said I was being a swot for getting such good marks in History of Magic. Wish I could see that hag's face when she hears I caught a Leprechaun!'

Well, I brought Mafilda right then and there, turned her into a Hag! Ha, the look on that kid's face. She starts blubbering and says 'Oh no! I shouldn't have gotten an Outstanding; I wish I'd gotten a Troll instead!'

Ya know, I couldn't let that one go, so I summoned up big ol' mountain Troll, just for her. She's panicking now, and I'm feeling fine. Until she says

'Oh, I shouldn't have looked for the gold. I wish YOU had made those wishes instead of me!'"

** The leprechaun pulls out a handful of Galleons and buys the first round for everyone.

The hag buys the second round with dozens of little moneybags full of Knuts and a few Sickles.

The troll goes up to the bar to buy the third round, and puts down a toilet seat and a wash basin.
