They can be any pairing and any fandom.


** I love Hermione-centric crossovers. They don't get requested here a lot.

My favourite is the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/5029][Vanilla Ice Cream]] series by treeson. It's a Supernatural crossover. Truly amazing.\\
Here's the order (I believe some are only on their LJ as well).\\
1. Hermione, An Abridged History\\
2. Being Switzerland\\
3. How Gabriel Solved the Weasley Problem\\
4. Cold\\
5. Children & Wednesdays\\
6. Silver Linings and Dark Clouds\\
7. Brown\\
8. Gotta Move On\\
9. Living Memento\\
10. Full Dark, No Stars\\
11. The Willow\\
12. Done, Three Times Done\\
13. Harvest of Trials

*The Chronicles of Narnia*\\
- linkffn(7888194) - Edmund/Hermione\\
- Linkffn(10467443) - Edmund is wary of Hermione, Edmund/Hermione\\
- Linkffn(4328933) - Peter/Hermione

*Criminal Minds*\\
- linkffn(10937797) - no romance whatsoever\\
- Linkffn(9636909). The sequel has a lot more Hermione in it: linkffn(10127870) [/note: on [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/219401][AO3]], the title of the series is The Adventures of Jack Hotcher and Ms. Granger/]

*Game of Thrones/A Song of Fire and Ice*\\
- Linkao3(602693) - Jon Snow/Hermione & Robb Stark/Hermione\\
- linkao3(13183980) - It's really fantastic and I can't recommend it enough. Robb Stark/Hermione

*Merlin*\\
[[http://treefics.livejournal.com/18145.html][A Morning Walk]], [[http://treefics.livejournal.com/20822.html][The Second Walk]], [[http://treefics.livejournal.com/21253.html][Third Time is the Charm]]. There hasn't been an update since 2011, so I assume the series is on-hold. By "Third", it seems treeson is leaning towards Merlin/Hermione, even though she originally stated she was planning Arthur/Hermione.

*Supernatural*\\
- Linkffn(11475737) - Make sure to read the prequel first, linkffn(10597510), Dean/Hermione\\
- Linkffn(8185359) - has several sequels, Castiel/Hermione\\
- linkao3(13968495) - explores different types of magic, includes time travel. Loki & Hermione (platonic relationship)

*True Blood*\\
- Linkffn(9914567) - set in season 3, Eric/Hermione

#+end_quote

The Winter Witch has good writing, but I found difficult to suspend my disbelief when the author insists on following canon events even though Hermione created huge ripples. It's also jarring the way her power levels fluctuate depending on what the author wants her to do rather than where the story naturally goes. One example is what happens while Robb is fighting in the Westerlands. He leaves Edmure and Hermione behind telling Edmure to "hold Riverrun". Now, it wouldn't be so bad if Edmure just went and fought Tywin. But he talked to Hermione, they agonized over the meaning of "hold Riverrun" and then decided to go and engage Tywin. Instead of, you know, ask Robb himself. It's not that it is inconsistent with the character, it's that it negates on of her major contributions to advance the plot and leave Catelyn alone to release Jamie. It's one thing to redo Edmure's battle of the fords, even though they had a method of instant communication with Rob if they needed to clarify his order. It's a pity, because the writer has clearly put a lot of work in it.

**** My reasoning was I wanted to give Edmure some character growth that he doesn't get in the series, and he wanted to prove himself. The point of the scene was that Hermione is not infallible; she makes mistakes (a big one), and in her own hubris didn't ask for help because Hermione Granger does not -- she thinks she knows what's right so why bother Robb when this helps Edmure? This was fairly soon after her arrival in Westeros and she didn't know people very well.

After chapter 19, most things change canon wise (I've never seen past season 2 of GoT nor have I finished Storm of Swords). I wanted the first part to establish Hermione in Westeros and build up character interaction within the Riverlands and Robb's army before making the changes that I do in part 2, which build into what's going to happen in part 3. Also, her power fluctuations are explained!

But I understand that it's not to everyone's taste.

***** But this wasn't a math problem, or something that would only affect her. There was a matter of interpretation of Robb's command, why wouldn't she call him and check it out? I could get an Edmure that went "I know my lands, I know best".

I kept reading after that and finally gave up in the confrontation on the Throne room where, for some reason fails again to kill Tywin because she wanted to show off with ice spears and fire whips.

  Hermione realized it began with a sense of Impending Doom and finished with a battle outside her tent. Now, she has to decide between staying and helping Robb Stark and the Northern army or returning to her universe. And that line is getting harder to see the longer she's in Westeros.Part One: Chapters 1-19Part Two: Chapters 20-31Part Three: Chapter 32 - ongoing

  "I mean, you appeared to me with all your trench coat, blue eyes, and bloody angel-powered glory, claiming that I'm important in some damn Apocalypse," she softly slurred. "What's not there to love, Castiel?" HP/SPN crossover. Hermione Granger/Castiel. Prequel of "Remembering the Past".

  One person can make a difference: sometimes large, sometimes small. This is the story of a young witch who died under mysterious circumstances and woke up in a completely different world - a world she would change just by existing. Follow the journey of Hermione Granger as she walks the path to becoming Hermione Thranduiliel, the Elvenqueen.
