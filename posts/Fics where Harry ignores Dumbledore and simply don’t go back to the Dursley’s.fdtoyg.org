In most fics I've read at the end of the year Harry asks Dumbledore if he has to go back to the Dursley's for the summer, thing is, I never understood why ha needs Dumbledore's permission. Want any fix that has a Harry that simply don't go back to the Dursley's house at the end of the year and then completely ignore anything Dumbledore do to get him to go back. He could go to one property of his, travel around the world, or even do a Lily and the art of being Sisyphus and abandon the Dursley's to get on with his life. Preferably set in first year, but I'm not prickly


** In canon, the reason he asks is because he wants to stay at Hogwarts over Summer Break. For this, he would have to ask Dumbledore's permission. I don't see though why he could not go somewhere else, as Dumbledore doesn't have the authority to tell him where to go, outside of not Hogwarts

*** It is Dumbledore that given him to the guardianship of the Dursleys so he must have some authority over him for the Ministry of Magic to accept it. And as Harry is not of age, he must go to His muggle guardians and Dumbledore has power and obligations to uphold his transfer of guardianship to the Dursleys.

**** Yeah, but this is only if we consider Harry caring about legalities. Unless we consider Dumbledore using an object to keep tabs on Harry all the time (fandom only) he frankly has no way of knowing for sure where Harry is, even if Mrs.. Figgs notices he's not there and tells him which we don't have any idea of how she would go about this. Dumbledore is not at his office at all times and has to many important jobs to be able to just drop everything to search for Harry when it's perfectly possible that he is just going to spend some days playing tourist at London or something of the kind, or even just going to a quadrich game without someone who would even thing of telling him.

***** Dumbledore could send the DMLE against him as he is underage and in fraud of the Law. It could even cost him some job eventuality as the Ministry wouldn't tolerate a citizen who doesn't abide by the law.

****** And again, for this to be effective it would need the DMLE being able to track him down, which not only is just fandom but also create lots of plot-holes. We know that the trace can't track him if there are magical adults around and this is not even considering that he could go to another country and thus putting all kinds of red-tape on any attempt of bringing him back. Then we also have problem of the daily prophet discovering about his abuse (the second book makes it clear that at least sometimes it became physical) and this would make Dumbledore and the ministry at least reluctant to press charges if they knew, or excuse him of any crime to get away if they didn't.

******* Well We can formulate the hypothesis that the Trace can track under-age wizards but emit an alert when the conditions set by the law are triggered. And so the DMLE could simply consult their instruments to know where he is. The Daily Prophet is controlled by the Ministry, Dumbledore as Chier Warlock of the Wizengamot could simply order the home life of Harry Potter to be classified. This sort of information can be maintained under wraps. And we could emit the hypothesis that Harry Potter Home life is essential to a prophecy that have an influence over the security of the wizarding community. A Government can do many things in the name of national security. As the saying goes Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges.

******** The Daily Prophet is not actually owned by the ministry, we can see it when they do reveal they Voldemort is back at the end of OotP instead of trying to ignore the event so Fudge can keep his job, so they could send the DMLE, but the prophet would give them problems. At HBP we also get told by Dumbledore that the trace can only say if a child uses magic without an adult nearby, we don't actually know if it can tell the place the child is at or how it works, in no moment we are told what exactly Dumbledore can or can't do with his position of Chef Warlock, so he could be anything from the true de facto leader of the magical world to only being able to offer council to the Wizengamont, that we also only know that preside over some trials. Dumbledore is actively trying to hide the prophecy, so no way would he let this information slip. And that is assuming he don't chose to just go to another country and seek asylum if the ministry try to force him to go back.

********* The Daily Prophet told of Voldemort return because Fudge himself admitted to himself his error and permitted it because he knows the he isn't a Minister for War time and knew basically that no matter what he would take the fall. And we can see by the slander that the Ministry has control of the Daily Prophet. In case National Security, that prophecy would not have to be revealed because Dumbledore is part of the Government, he doesn't need to justify the why, he just need to declare on his honor that it is important for national security or Wizarding Security.

********** Again, this is assuming Dumbledore even has that kind of power over the government, we don't actually know for sure what Dumbledore can or can't do as part of the government, yes he was able to save Snape from Azkaban, but was unable to put all the Death Eaters in Azkaban or get Sirius declared innocent even with testimonies about it, again, he could be the dictator of the British magical world or he could be the guy who watches over the wizengamont to prevent them from killing each other in the middle of a meeting but who can't actually take any decisions. Yes, Fudge admits that Voldemort's back, but almost no one heard him, if he really was in control of the press it wouldn't matter, we also have no way of knowing if he resigned to escape the war, he would really only need to give the DMLE carte blanque, the minister is not actually necessarily someone good at combat or who even understands war strategy.

And all of this is assuming Dumbledore is the version who knows about Harry's home-life and do nothing, there is the possibility that he just don't know. The Dursley's were able to hide Harry's abuse from the neighbors for years, they could have made Mrs. Figgs think it wasn't so serious and Dumbledore would have no way of knowing unless he went personally to check, and he have an excuse for not doing so by how busy he is.

*********** Dumbledore knew perfectly of the abuse , he admits it himself in his office after Sirius died in OOTP. Dumbledore was in Favor of Second chance and of reconciliation between the Light and Dark when Voldemort body was destroyed. Dumbledore did know of Sirius innocence as caster of the fidelius and the blood protection was too important for Risking Sirius refusal as Primary Guardian of Harry. So he didn't stop Crouch when the Director of DMLE whisked him to Azkaban without due process. And he has know of what the prophecy really meant as in four year Dumbledore was triumphant that Voldemort used Harry blood. Dumbledore did plan everything from the very beginning as a true chess master.

************ Ok, all of this is fandom. If Dumbledore knew about Sirius he and Remus would probably be very at odds with Dumbledore. Yes, he is in favor of second chances (Draco) but he also knew Voldemort wasn't dead and that many of the DE would return to his service, so if he was really playing chess-master it would make more sense if he garantes they went to Azkaban, or at least the mos important ones like Lucius, that he didn't and Lucius managed to bribe his way out of prison proves that he is not the be all end all of politics at the ministry. Dumbledore only said that he was condemning Harry to ten dark and hard years, it could be him talking about him not knowing about magic or that he thought the Dursley's wouldn't truly love him but didn't think they would became outright abusive. An frankly the way lots of people make Dumbledore near Omniscient is kind of annoying, yes he could possibly know more than he normally would if he used legilimens indiscriminately as some stories show, but nowhere near the extension people try to make it, we don't know what would consist of Dark magic, if it's something inherently about the magic or only a legal restriction, neither do we know if Dumbledore had anyway of knowing what happens at Hogwarts using wards, so all of this is only fandom, for him to be able to manipulate the events from the very begging he would need to have this kind of information. The thing about being happy Voldemort used the blood can be explained with him suspecting the horcrux and wanting Harry to survive or even him just being happy Harry managed to escape Voldemort even without the blood protection. Manipulative Dumbledore is only suspected at cannon, it can bring some interesting points in fanfics if well written, but we have no way of confirming it in canon. Yes, it would answer lots of plot-holes, but JKR was trying to write a story about Harry's life, so many things are just waved and later, if someone asks, maybe given an excuse. The magical world is almost only the background of the adventure instead of being something made to have consistence, she is telling a story, not trying to become the next Tolkien or GRR Martin with in world-budding. This is something that seems to happen frequently with Dumbledore and lots of adults because they are characters that could easily solve many problems and she needs for further parts of the story but at the moment they need to be on the background, hence Mcgonagal dismissing their warnings at PS and lots of Dumbledore's actions. In the end it is an story first thought for kids and that in the end found much more success and a much more critical public than it was intended at the start

************* Yes I will agree with you on the plot points that everything seems to be forced like the adults general incompetence to avoid such events . McGonagall was right to dismiss them because the gauntlet of the Philosopher Stone was designed with a first year education , it was an obvious set up. I can only conclude that Dumbledore wanted to test Harry. It couldn't be a trap for Tom because it needed to be more believable and so very much more hardcore. You forgets that Remus basically owns very much to Dumbledore and so would never believe Albus to be so underhanded. Lucius Malfoy , DE he may be but he is the more acceptable of them all and one of the more likely candidates for redemption so Dumbledore wouldn't sentence him to Azkaban. And better to preach peace that harden them in Azkaban and create more problems when irrevocably they escape the prison. So I would argue that Dumbledore is not the epitome of innocence, he is a politician and a war tactician versed in the Greater Good.

************** I have to agree at him not being innocent and focusing in the greater good, if nothing else the Fantastic Beasts proves this. But really, if we take out Quirell at PS Harry loses any motivation to go looking for the philosophers stone, unless you mean to say that Harry would steal it for himself without Quirel, which goes against his character. Yeah, Remus owns much to Dumbledore, but he also owns much to the marauders, with whom he is closer, beside having a powerful sense of justice, and even if Remus followed Dumbledore Sirius certainly wouldn't knowing Dumbledore willing let him rot in Azkaban. Your argument about him peaching about second chances is incompatible with his supposed actions in keeping Sirius in prison while he was innocent. The idea of Lucius-Oh-of-course-I-will-let-you-search-my-home-let-me-just-give-this-horcrux-to-the-daughter-of-a-political-opponent being one of the more acceptable DE is frankly laughable, if it weren't for his support Voldemort's second raise wouldn't have any close to the success it had. Prisons also only works to toughen the prisoners if it isn't a prison the implements mental torture in regular basis(take for example Al Capone after staying in Alcatraz) the DE wouldn't be toughened up, the majority would probably just die sooner or later, and even the ones who didn't would be very weakened, take Sirius for example and them consider that he got out before Voldemort's resurrection and was protected from the worst of it by his animagus form. Or Dumbledore is manipulative and has power over basically everything in England, but so grossly incompetent his attempts of using this power frankly wouldn't have worked, or he isn't manipulative and is just trying to make the best of the situations with the very realistic politics power levels he actually has.

*************** Yes but only Dumbledore could remove Quirrel from the castle as he is a teacher. And you forget the incentive of the Mirror of Erised. Remus never visited Harry nor written any letters to him , for a link towards the marauders son it is fickle. Remus was basically the Omega with Sirius as Beta and James as Alpha in their group. He lost all and listened to Dumbledore as he is submissive in essence. And you forget that the wizarding Britain would have not survived if all of the DE were sent to Azkaban as their are basically the Heads ans heirs of very prominent old and rich families that are the fondation of the Ministry. The public would never accept that their superiors in the ladder are guilty. Dumbledore has never done anything to ease the Muggleborns into the wizarding way of life, he only worked towards smoothing the differences of the two worlds. Why all of this is never affirmed in the canon, it is so heavily hinted that you can't not see it.

**************** disprovedMost of this is actually fandom, yeah there were rich pureblood families among the DE, but it wasn't all of them, McNair and Greyback for example, and not all of them are in Voldemort's side, while we don't have an exact account of the Potters family wealth we know by Pottermore that they are at least wealth, and many others are show to at least oppose Voldemort, like the Bones and Longbottons, furthermore, in no moment was it said that the government has its base in a hereditary system, the whole Lord and Houses trope is fandom. The whole Alfa, Beta, Omega dynamics is even more fandom in the context that there is literally nothing cannon that comes even close of even suggesting such a thing and it being disproved in real world by scientists, Remus is a person, and thus functions and thinks like a person, if he discovered that Dumbledore was responsible for one of his best friends losing 12 years in hell-on-earth he would get angry, debt or no debt, and again, you are focusing on Remus and forgetting Sirius who would have the strongest reaction. Frankly I think the reason he never wrote to Harry is because JKR only created him at PoA, but for the sake of an argument he could very well decided not to send him letters because he was too young to read them before Hogwarts or because Petunia would get angry, or even because he didn't want to talk with him, Harry was 15 months when they could have last seem each other, not much time for them to bond that strongly, and he was friend with Harry's parents, not Harry himself, maybe he just had no reason to write, you can't expect every friend of James and Lily to decide to take a central role on Harry's life. Yeah, there is the mirror, but Harry has no idea of knowing it would be there, even if he decided to ignore Dumbledore's warning and seek it again. He literally had no way of knowing Quirel was possessed by Voldemort, and if he knew he could have killed him, the idea of making it a test don't make sense, what exactly would he even test. And we don't actually see Dumbledore's political moves, so he potentially could have helped the muggleborns.

***************** I was not speaking of them as Lords in the Wizengamot, as those seat are on selection by some members of the Ministry as the Minister himself who appears to have huge influence over the selection. The Department Heads of the Ministry are all purebloods . And of course there is the famous Sacred Twenty-Eight of Pureblood Directory. A lot of those that escaped prosecution are members of the Sacred Twenty-Eight so we can say that the public would be in hysteria if a great member of those 28 were sent to Azkaban. Yes it is only a private book but in a closed society it may very well be as important as those members of Wizengamot. I also wanted to say that Witanamot is a Council of nobles in the England of Old. Sirius reaction would not be important as he is in Azkaban and Dumbledore can very well organise his discovery by the aurors if he so much as breath incorrectly. Sirius is an escaped prisoner of Azkaban he may very well be considered as Wolf Head by Wizarding Britain and we do not listen to Azkaban prisoners. I do not speak of Alpha Beta and Omega as dynamics but as character personality, Remus has a submissive personality in canon as their is none of the backbone a werewolf is supposed to posses. And he could have sent a letter between Harry 7 years old to 11 years old. He could have inquired to Petunia how the orphaned son of his best friend was faring. No he listened to Dumbledore wishes to isolate Harry at the Dursleys and from the wizarding world. Please those so called protection of the Stone were all studied in first year, Dumbledore could have protected the stone with challenges that only aurors could have a chance of success. It is obvious it is a way to test Harry and see how he would react to a confrontation between him and his parents murderer. He wanted to see if Harry would be a Savior as the prophecy dictated or a coward or worse someone who would be enthralled by the Dark Lord power. It is obvious when Dumbledore tell them as soon as he stepped outside Hogwarts he had the sensation that his place was at Hogwarts a secret ward perhaps ? Does Hogwarts has some lesson in wizarding customs for the Muggleborns ? As Headmaster of Hogwarts it is he that decide of the Curriculum orientation. He doesn't need funding for wizarding customs at least.

***** Did they really though? Canonically, there was no real point in going after Harry until the time they actually did in book 7. His foothold on the government wasn't secure enough. An extra two months to secure the foothold and a guarantied time and place the main chunk of his actual enemies would be is a pretty tempting reason to not attack until they did.

Because let's be real, he had enough spies and moles in the ministry to get the address. How hard would it be to "buy" Harry from his abusive muggle relatives? Or just fiendfyre the block? Or wait for him to leave the house? The opportunity has been there since the end of book 4. And those guards were useless for anything besides an early warning system. That probably wouldn't work anyway if they were offed fast enough. Or Fletcher was on duty.

The whole "protections" on privet drive were one big plothole and chekov's gun.

​

Hell, JKR could have had Voldie and crew attack at the start of vacation and get repulsed by the protections. And then have canon go on as usual, saying Voldie and crew needed a few months to recover.

BOOM! Chekov's gun resolved and actually sounds interesting.

** So... Harry gets to the train station, slips out another way, and slums it in the alleyways for a few months before going back to Hogwarts?

Sounds like fun.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating ancient runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG.

*** By British muggle law, in HBP we see him inheriting Grimald place at sixteen, and we don't actually see him inheriting anything more at seventeen, so we don't know if this kind of law hold at the WW. Tough to be fair there is also nothing the leads us to believe his family accumulated any property besides the one at Godric's Hollow, so this may be a moot point

**** We do not know of which law was used for inheritance in HBP as it was Dumbledore who informed Harry without an official Will Reading with Harry present. And we know that the Ministry can have an influence over those matters with the Will Reading of Albus Dumbledore by the Minister himself. We also learn that there are enchantements to direct the inheritance of some entitlements in some families in HBP. For the Potter Family, we can only question why for a family that is supposed to be richer that the Weasleys, their Home is of the same class that those the Weasley Clan have as shell cottage for ex. We can only speculate that maybe the family did have a manor but lost it for war reasons ? And it is obvious that the house at Godric's Hollow has been seized for public purpose by the Ministry . But as it is a moot point we can only desolate that the Potter Heir is lacking a backbone where it would be good.
