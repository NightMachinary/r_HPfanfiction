** If your looking for romancy stories then I'd recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649126/James-Spookie][James Spookie's]] stories.

But one of my personal favourites is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]. It's a rather long fic and the author is currently writing the sequel but I feel that the first one is good enough to read on it's own.

*** Am I the only one that thinks that while Delenda Est is great, it is also overrated? It just rushes through so much that could be awesome, and expands quite a bit on irrelevancies (for instance: you could remove Lily completely and the story would be unchanged in any significant way).

I'd still recommend it though.

***** ... I don't think it's self aware enough to be called a crack-fic. I think that it's honestly written in order to be awesome, in the same line as Harry Crow (though not nearly as extreme). If you read HHr pairing stories Delenda Est is actually downright tame.

** I'm a silly-head and only don't know how to hyperlink titles of stories so here's a few:

Prince of the Dark Kingdom: s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom (1.2 million words and some change.) Ten years ago, Voldemort created his kingdom. Now a confused young wizard stumbles into it, and carves out a destiny. AU. Nondark Harry. MentorVoldemort.

Heart and Soul: s/5681042/1/Heart-and-Soul (750k words) The Dementor attack on Harry during the summer after his fourth year leaves him on the verge of having his wand snapped. Unwilling to leave anything to chance, Sirius Black sets events into motion which will change Harry's life forever. (Some HP/HG but focuses on HP/FD)

Mastermind Hunting: s/2428341/1/Mastermind-Hunting (600k words) This is a story of the life of Harry Potter. From his disappearance with his friendly relatives to Dumbledore chasing after him around the world, while Voldemort and muggle secret services loom in the background. Technology, Prophecies... one word: power.

A Marauder's Plan: s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan (600k words) Sirius decides to stay in England after escaping Hogwarts and makes protecting Harry his priority. AU GOF.

HPMOR: s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality (560k words) Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... (A little too 'mainstream' for some though)

*** Partially Kissed Hero: s/4240771/1/Partially-Kissed-Hero (480k words) Summer before third year Harry has a life changing experience, and a close encounter with a dementor ends with him absorbing the horcrux within him. Features Harry with a backbone. (If I remember correctly Dumbledore is a very evil but impotent opponent)

Rise of the Wizards: s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards (480k words) Voldemort's attempt at possessing Harry had a different outcome when Harry fought back with the "Power He Knows Not". This set a change in motion that shall affect both Wizards and Muggles. AU after fifth year: Featuring a darkish and manipulative Harry.

It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon: s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon (430k words) At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

The Accidental Bond: s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond (415k words) Harry finds that his "saving people thing" is a power of its own, capable of bonding single witches to him if their life is in mortal danger, with unusual results. H/multi

Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future;s Past: s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past (390k words) The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?
