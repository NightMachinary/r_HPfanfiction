Maybe the Statute comes down due to a changed political climate responding to the pressures of modern technology and culture, but then the HMRC discovers unpaid taxes, Education Scotland discovers that Hogwarts is operating while unregistered and is failing to offer math or science courses, children's services discover that squib children and children infected with lycanthropy tend to suffer a bad homelife, the Care Quality Commission receives reports about St. Mungos using medicinal potions that have heavy metals and toxic plants as active ingredients, and the justice system is baffled that the wizarding world doesn't seem to do trials by jury.

So Diagonal Alley shopkeepers are suddenly facing jail time and millions in back taxes, Hogwarts professors are suddenly out of work and parents everywhere are worried about their kids' educational future, pureblood families are having their parenting goals and strategies dictated to them by social services, people are dying of trivial magical mishaps in muggle hospitals, and all the Death Eaters in Azkaban have received official pardons.

Protest marches ensue, flocks of owls and howlers descend upon various muggle governing bodies, inspectors and officials are getting hexed in the course of their duties, pureblood teenagers are being dragged into the muggle world and being treated like special Ed cases because they don't know how to be muggles, and dark creatures and dark wizards are running rings around muggle law enforcement.

I kind of want to write this story myself, but I have no clear endgame in mind.


** I don't know why muggles would have control over wizards in that manner. Wizards don't follow muggle laws and wouldn't start just because the Statute fell.

*** But they likely did before the Statute went up. The Statute only became a thing in the 1600s, that means for all of Mesopotamia, the Hellenic eras, Romes empire, the dark and middle ages and even the start of the Renaissance, and that is just in "Europe."

Do you think for a single second that Subsaharan Africa, South-East Asia, India, China, Japan, the Americas were all onboard with the statute of secrecy?

In the end there would be a transition period, but if the world merged, just by virtue of the weight of no-maj numbers, Mages would be bound by those laws then further regulation beyond.

And in England, let's consider the roles of the crown and various requirement and rule that would have stood before and during the statute. Do you think a monarch would be willing to allow a class of people to exist that are unbound by his laws?

And what about persons that do not side with the magical world, but have magic themselves. A chance to strike back at the "Purebloods" by aiding in the destruction of all they have built themselves by working with the "Rightful Government and her Majesty" might be a strong pull.

*** Huh, you have a point there.

So HMRC inspectors walk into Madame Malkins'.

"Hi, we're tax collectors. You owe us X amount of money in property taxes for this lovely London location, and also Y percentage of your profits is supposed to be sales taxes, and furthermore, you owe Z amount in royalties for various raw materials that you purchase from overseas. Now, we understand that you probably risked magical super jail if you put down 'amount A paid for B units of dragon hide from wizard supplier C' on your official filing, but magical super jail is no longer a problem, and you can start living like a normal person, without fear of such nonsense. So, where are your records kept?"

"LOL, what? Sod off, you collect taxes from muggles, not witches. My financial records are my business. Now unless you're gonna buy some clothes, beat it.".

"Right, well then, we'll be back.".

Hours later, the inspectors return with policemen.

"Hi, I'm a police officer, are you Malkin?" "Yes, I am the proprietor, what do you want?" "You're under arrest for refusing to cooperate with HMRC." "LOL, what? Sod off. You arrest muggles for committing muggle crimes. These muggle blokes overstepped their jurisdiction by trying to enforce muggle laws on a witch." "Ma'am, that is not how the law works. You sold goods in this country, you owe taxes to Her Majesty. Now turn around, and put your hands behind your back." "I will do no such thing." "Grab her!"

Madame Malkin rolls her eyes. When the policemen grab her, she simply apparates to some moorland. The policemen let go of her in surprise, then she apparates back. HMRC officials are tearing her shop apart.

"The bloody hell do you muggles think you're doing?" "You refused to cooperate. We are seizing your financial records by force."

Madame Malkin draws her wand and petrifies them all. She piles the HMRC inspectors in a heap outside her shop, then sets about cleaning up the mess they made. Hours later, more police show up.

"Congratulations. You have just earned yourself a lifetime vacation, rent free, meals included, to our fanciest digs. You'll rub shoulders with some very infamous people, you'll explore all the fashion possibilities of orange jumpsuits, and you might have even earned some exposure on the evening news."

Madame Malkin petrifies them too, and piles them up in front of her shop. The police and HMRC inspectors are starting to form a wall in front of her shop, unwittingly laying siege. Luckily, her customers can use the floo network, but muggles can't. Madame Malkin sends an owl to the Daily Profit, with an announcement.

"Due to circumstances beyond my control, the front door to Madame Malkins' Robes for All Occasions has been rendered non-functional. Customers are advised to enter via the floo. This temporary inconvenience will be cleared up soon."

Madame Malkin receives no more customers that day. She finishes setting things right from the muggles' havoc. They had started to load up her records, and even some of her merchandise, into smallish white boxes made of a thick, papery material. Madame Malkin locks up for the night and returns home.

The next morning, she arrives at her shop via the floo, only to discover it empty. The doors, windows, and very walls have been bashed in. The wall of petrified policemen and HMRC inspectors is gone. A few policemen are waiting for her in the shop.

"Wow, you sure had some fancy locks. Luckily for us, you magicals can't seem to build sturdy walls worth a damn. It's almost as if you don't know how to build to code. Anyway, you're under arrest. Would you like to hear how many crimes you committed yesterday?"

Madame Malkin looks around. All her merchandise is gone, her safe is gone, her financial records are gone. She decides to surrender to the police after all, if only to see if they will take her in the general vicinity of her stuff.

**** Or they never get into Diagon Alley in the first place.

Again, I'm not sure why you think wizards would just allow this stuff to happen. This is like finding out advanced aliens live amongst you and then thinking you can tax them. Like a child thinking they can tell a grown up what to do. Wizards will do whatever the fuck they want, and paying muggle taxes isn't it.

***** Maybe the Statute came down after the second wizarding war, because the wizarding world was trying to distance themselves from the Death Eaters and the wizard supremacists, so it became fashionable to have a certain amount of knowledge about the muggle world, and people got lax about pouncing on Statute breeches, and then muggle technology developed to the point where policemen were knocking on the Ministry phone booth to get to the bottom of all the weird CCTV footage, and there was a growing subculture that originated on the internet made up of muggleborns and family of same, and the website attracted the attention of ordinary muggles with extraordinary stories, like Dodgy Dirk who escaped the obliviation after the Ilfracombe Incident, and then anyone who accidentally googled anything magical stumbled across this website, so there was a growing awareness amongst the general muggle population of Something Going On, and then the Wizengamot held debates about whether a mass obliviation was too late and if it was time for the world to outgrow the Statute, and then the Prime Minister wanted to respond to rumors of Something Going On by pulling rank on the Minister Of Magic to make the wizarding world stop hiding, and the Wizengamot agreed amongst themselves that upholding the Statute at this point might be too much a Death Eater thing to do, so official discussions were held, laws were enacted, and the two world's tried to play nice, but then they found themselves incompatible, and by the time all the unintended consequences rolled out, it was too late to put the genie back in the lamp.

I don't know, a lot of discussion threads on the subject can be summarized as, "Wizards would just kill all the muggles, hands down." "No, muggles would utterly trounce the wizards, no question." " Well, wizards can just cast Spell X." "But muggles could just use Technology Y." "No, wizards would win with Magical Thingy Z." "See, muggles hold Advantage A." "But wizards could easily counter that with Advantage B." "But muggles would thrash the wizards with Advantage C.". And around it goes.

How about a story where neither side wins, or where neither side wants to nuke a tiny sliver of London, or test their quidditch skills against fighter jets? Why do the two world's have to clash in warfare? The wizarding world didn't go to war way back during the time of the witch burnings, they prefered to hide rather then try to make their problems go away by marching to war.

I guess what I'm looking for is a slow burn story of cultural clashes, that focuses more on ordinary people trying to figure out difficult times, rather then a focus on, "Wouldn't it look awesome if the Hogwarts professors and student body had to defend themselves against a unit of tanks?" More political intrigue and silly scenes of purebloods trying to navigate the muggle world and muggle authorities trying to wrap their brains around the wizarding world, less "Just bewitch the guns to turn around and shoot the soldiers!"

****** Right, it's just that things don't necessarily have to change for wizards if the Statute falls. I get what you're saying, but I really don't see why pure-bloods would suddenly need to understand the muggle world, or why muggles would have any power over wizards, etc. I doubt much would change for wizards. It's not as though anything stops them from being part of the muggle world with the Statute.

**** I find the concept interesting, but the execution weird. Also, why would police go around like that, without more cooperation from magical law enforcement?

Honestly, if the Wizarding World was discovered, I think it would be treated like a foreign nation inside british soil, with talks about integrating the magical and mundane population, and probably with the Ministry cooperating with the muggle side.
