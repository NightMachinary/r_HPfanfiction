How, in your various h/c and storylines, have you got your familial relationships, like for example how Dorea and Charlus are related to Harry.

For example in my h/c is that Charlus is Harry's great uncle, being the younger brother of Fleamont. (I usually write Augusta L as being the middle child of the Potters) The reason I give for Dorea not being blasted off the Black tree is that Charlus Potter is in agreement with the likes of the Black's and his friend Malfoy, that "The Filthy Mudblood scum steal the powers of upstanding Purebloods and take it for themselves."

Another example I am writing in my fics is Anthony G is second cousins with Rolf S (with Newt & Tina being Anthony's paternal great uncle and Aunt).

Petunia and Lily in my stories don't share the same mother, with Petunias mother dying giving birth to Petunia and Rose (nee Brown), a Squib, being Lily's mother.

Hermione's daughter Rose is named after her paternal great grand mother, with her middle name Emma being after her maternal great grand mother, same with Hugo and his great grandfathers, Hugo Evans and Daniel Granger... (yes, I usually write Harry as being Rose and Hugo's father as I usually write Ron, when not bashing him, as being unable to have kids due to the inbreeding of the Pureblood families.)

Over to you folks...


** I cant contribute much, I only have one tought. Am I the only one who thinks the fact that Harry is related to Sirius (as you and many other have in their headcanon) actually weakens their relationship? I mean for me it was always such a strong point that Sirius was deprived from his family, a men without a legacy who found true friendship is James and was above all else willing to continue this friendship even beyond his dead by standing at Harrys side.

If the two were family it casts a strong shadow on this which, in my opinion weakens SIrius character and makes his relationship to Harry a lot more shallow.

*** Remember that in OOTP that it was mentioned that Dorea Black had married to a Charlus Potter. It wasn't mentioned how but before JK revealed that Harry's grandfather was Fleamont, people wrote that Dorea and Charlus were Harry's grandparents.

The way I see Sirius is he never got on with anyone but his cousin Andy in his family, and went to Fleamont after making friends with James. I see Bellatrix as having close contact with Dorea and Charlus in my stories as I write Charlus as the black sheep of the Potter family and Sirius as the "Light Black".

I believe that James and Sirius would have been friends since meeting on the Express and both hating the dark elements in their families, joined together, his friendship with James being why he, in my fics, never chatted up Lily, despite being (thanks to fan fiction) a "ladies man".

** I have tons of ideas for relationships between some of the minor characters that rarely make it into my stories.

Terry Boot's mother is Mary Macdonald in my HC. She married a fellow muggleborn and they both left the wizarding world to escape the first war. They came back shortly after Voldemort was defeated in '81.

Blaise's father was Kingsley Shacklebolt's older brother. His unsolved murder is what led Kingsley to a career with the Aurors. Blaise has no relationship with his paternal family growing up and seeks out his uncle as an adult.

Hannah Abbott and Susan Bones are first cousins. Vincent Crabbe and Greg Goyle are also first cousins.

Alice Longbottom had a sister, Mary, who married Edgar Bones. They, along with their children, were murdered in the war. Neville was supposed to grow up with them. He was raised by his gran and granddad, Leopold Longbottom, instead. His granddad died a few years before Neville started Hogwarts (the reason Neville can see the threstals)

Colin and Dennis Creevey's mother was a witch. She died when they were very young and never told their father. That's how two "muggleborns" were born into the same family.

*** Interesting. I can see the Ferrets bookends being related as viable. Wouldn't be surprised if their mothers were first cousins as well!

With regards to Neville and Augusta, I personally write the grandfather as being killed by Lucius because of Malfoy wanting to get more power in the Dark Faction of the Wizengamot, with Bellatrix not liking it as, in my stories, Bellatrix was attacked by a older brother of Frank Longbottom during her Hogwarts years, causing her to fall deeper into the Dark Arts (I usually have, for that purpose Augusta spared as in my storylines her "brother" Charlus & "sister-in-law", Dorea, ask Bellatrix to spare her for "family sake, even though she is a blood traitor". But I could totally see the Alice thing working.

The Bones family are an interesting bunch in my stoires as I usually write Amelia as the sister to Edgar (Susan's uncle) and Henry (Susan's father) and usually I pair her in some way with Sirius, especially as I see Amelia as a year or two older than the Marauders.

The Abbot/Bones connection is interesting. Personally I have Hannah and Megan as first cousins, with Hestia as Megan's mother and Gwenog as Megan's sister (who is same age as Bill in my fics)

** Fleamont Potter (Harry's Grandfather) and Charlus Potter (Sirius' Great Uncle by marriage) were second cousins, making Harry and Sirius barely related at all (Harry in the son of James, son of Fleamont, son of Henry, son of Thomas, brother of Fredrick, father of Reginald, father of Charlus, husband of Dorea (Black), sister of Pollux, father of Walburga, mother of Sirius).

Yes, I have too much damn time on my hands sometimes.
