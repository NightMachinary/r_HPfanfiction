What if, the magical world was responsible for the creation of the first generation of Borg? Starting with Moody, the replacement of missing or non-fixable body parts slowly evolved into "seeking perfection"?

The how and other details are for you to come up with.


** Alternatively, the war against Voldemort (first or second) eventually spiraled out of control and spread both outside Britain and into the Muggle world. Some of the details of its origins would be forgotten, but future generations would refer to this time as the Eugenics Wars.

You'll have to read the descriptions for the correct reading order. There was another one but I can't think of it at the moment.

Eh I can't get the link thingy to work right

  Harry and Hermione decide to make a soul bond, despite not really knowing what they are doing. Horlarity ensues (portmanteau of "Horror" and "Hilarity"). This short story is not to be taken seriously.

** I'd argue that the aftermath of the war would be a better origin. After Voldemort unleashed the werewolves, ran the snatcher business and had Umbridge deport every undesirable, there would be a lot of demand for prosthetics or magical upgrades to damaged body parts.

Demand was through the roof, supply very limited due to the aftermath of the war, so some people hoped to make some cash with subpar prosthetics. Others tried to modify their own or a friend's. And eventually, one or two spells went horribly wrong.
