Okay hear me out

I wonder what happen if Harry actually dies and Voldemort won. At that point, Voldemort would typically follow similarly to Hitler's moves and invades all of Europe. After that he would have to focus on invading other continents and one of the main ones would be North America. Like I'm no expert but I just know us Americans are gonna put one HELL of fight against wizard nazis.

I'm basing on how America react and join the Allies during WW2 but it could be different since it be just the magical community being hit in America and not the whole country so we could be a downside here.

What's your thoughts?


** Given how hostile MACUSA is to the Muggles, I expect these guys to fully collaborate with Voldemort

*** True but most of them would be Maj-born(muggleborn) and Death Eaters won't like them compare to America would probably accept anyone who has magic.

** North America would probably be last on his list. And it probably is relatively the weakest place that would be completely squished.
