I've been thinking about this topic. Most often fics will present pureblood prejudice as just blatant, ill-informed racism (as per the books). What if there was more to it? And not in the: "they destroy our culture" vane like most fics that promote purebloods do. But in a more subtle and perhaps more meaningful way.

We all remember in the Deathly Hallows how Ron was talking about wizarding traditions, fairy tales and culture, while they were staying in the tent and Hermione and Harry had no idea what he was talking about? Why not expand on that? Let me elaborate.

Consider the Wizarding World as a different culture, a different species even. They learn from the moment they were born what wands are, what wands can do. They understand the destructive power of magic. That it can kill, maim or at least severely injure a person (Janus Thickey Ward anyone?). Therefore, they treat a wand, any wand, with respect and with the reverence due. They understand that pointing a wand at someone is the equivalent of what we would call as pointing a gun (considering the spells they learn in school, pretty much on point).

Now imagine those wand-conscious kids, who all know how dangerous magic can be, who encounter the fascinated and gob-smacked muggleborns that treat their wands as toys, pointing them at everyone and casting silly spells. Wouldn't that be a more grounded reason for racism that the canon one, or the "destroying our culture" as often seen in fanfiction?

Of course it's not perfect (e.g. teachers handing out detentions), or why the muggleborns aren't given very stern lectures about wand safety, etc.... but it's an interesting concept, I think.

Heh... what do you all think?

EDIT: This is, of course, an AU scenario, not a canon justification for the discrimination. I thought I made it clear, but I believe it bears repeating. In canon JKR world pureblood prejudice is based on nothing at all.

EDIT 2: Jesus Christ! All the downvoting. People, I only wanted to talk about a hypothetical in a fantasy scenario, not a talk about racism (this is not a subreddit for that). Racism is bad. People who are racist are evil. Nice... can we move on? This is not me being facetious, racism is always wrong. I just don't think it is a proper topic in this particular scenario.


** I think there is interesting scope in fanfiction for an analogy to be drawn between Muggleborns and immigration and for real life debates around cultural integration/multiculturalism to play out in wizarding society.

I also think canon did /not/ present pure-bloods as having problems with Muggleborns on that basis. Pure-blood supremacy in canon is a racial doctrine, not a cultural or economic one.

** A copy/paste from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c6kup4/1000_years_is_a_pretty_long_time/][this thread]]:

Muggles in the 990s are completely different from Muggles the 1990's. Little basic hygiene, almost no literacy (unless you were a noble), dumping waste out onto the street...yeah I'd nope out too. Granted, we have no clue what wizards did or were like, but I had to assume they were doing better in those days.

The problem is that Muggles improved drastically improved over the following centuries, and wizards refused to see that (or acknowledge it). The blood purists, I assume, don't like change that much, and with new muggleborns brings more change from a source they are unwilling to work with. They took an argument/belief that no longer exists today and ran with it. Imagine the other things that they still believe that are no longer true...?

After all if the uneducated muggleborns can't even use a wand correctly, "they always use the wands as toys", "Remember that girl who cursed me in the back and gave me antlers for a week" and so on and so forth, wouldn't it be reasonable for the people to treat them worse?

Of course, I'm not advocating discrimination in any way. I'm just posing a hypothetical scenario why that discrimination happened in the first place, because muggleborns are more wand-happy than purebloods or half-bloods.

Just a thought experiment.

** 1. One of the main themes of the Harry Potter series is that racism/xenophobia is bad. Draco, Bellatrix and Umbridge's actions throughout the series show how despicable and evil it is. To construct an AU where this is justified misses the point of it all IMHO. You/anyone can write it, but I for one will not be reading it.

2. In GoF, Crouch Jr (as Moody) tells a class of 4th years that they could try to curse him with avada kevadra and all he'd get would be a headache. So the likening of guns, which simply need a trigger pull, to wands, which need years of training, is a flawed one. The first spell that has potentially lethal results is the reductor curse, taught in the 5th year (Harry learns it earlier in the 4th year, but he is shown to be capable of advanced magic for his age), but this is never shown as working against living beings only inanimate objects. Accidental magic is a much bigger threat than most deliberate magic a student is capable of casting for much of their Hogwarts careers. In canon, wizards kill people, not wands. The AU would have to be very very AU, changing the very fundamentals of the magic system.

A key feature of genocides is that, in general, the people doing the genociding feel like they're the victims.

The logical solution would be to add a "magical culture and traditions" class, most countries have them for immigrants (language and culture, and mostly free. I pay 25€ per year for 4 hours a week and we already know where to send my husband when we move to my country). However, there are always people that would be violent, doubly so if the ministry and Hogwarts don't show them that they're making the effort to implement said class.

TP;DR if every Tuesday the wizards play Bingo, a muggleborn can join or not. They cannot come, say that Bingo is a terrible game and that they should all play Cluedo and then expect the wizards to be happy and accepting.

I don't disagree with this take. In fact, I have the same issue with those stories. That's still not grounds for racism and xenophobia (in /most/ instances. Colonizing missionaries should never feel welcomed), though. If Hermione says quills are outdated calling her a filthy mudblood is a ridiculous response

Also muggleborns and muggle-raised children aren't really doing. The only time it was done in canon was "house elf enslavement is barbaric" and that's not untrue. That's also not the purebloods' problem. They take issue with the statute of secrecy and muggleborns "stealing" magic. "Muh culture" is just a bs excuse.

** I understand what you want to discuss here, it could be interesting to find out a pureblood's point of view about the prejudice.

However, this topic hits too close to home. Prejudice exist everywhere in our world. I'm pretty sure we all encounter them on a regular basis, maybe even become the target once in a while. We know that prejudice is never a good thing. It only divide us based on some pointless excuse. The point about prejudice is that it's never justified. [[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/prejudice][Cambridge]] said that prejudice means /'an unfair and unreasonable opinion or feeling, especially when formed without enough thought or knowledge'./

When you wanted to discuss a justified reason for the muggleborn prejudice, it /seems/ like you're looking for a justified reason for people to start judging without knowing and making effort to know about muggleborn. It also /seems/ like you never encounter prejudice in the first place and think that every prejudice could have a justified reason.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6671596/11/A-Necessary-Gift-A-Harry-Potter-Story][A Necessary Gift]] touched on this topic, and honestly it makes me uncomfortable. It become blatant from chapter 11 onward and the library scene on chapter 13 made me close the tab immediately. I have no idea if the author wanted to whitewash the prejudice or if they want to show that the prejudice doesn't make sense. It still make me uncomfortable because even the DimensionTraveller!Harry seemed very prejudiced only after a few years living with the purebloods.

.

To comment on your theories, it's not a justified excuse at all. If we saw a child playing with a kitchen knife, we should let them know that it's dangerous, not letting them because 'they should know better'. It's the wizarding world's responsibility to let the muggleborn know that wands are not a toy, dangerous, and could hurt other people. It's ridiculous that they shift the blame to muggleborn if something happened just because 'they should know better'.

It's silly to dismiss my idea as stupid and yet accept the original one as valid, in a fantasy setting of course.

I don't understand how it could make you feel uncomfortable, there are thousands of HP fanfics officially stating racism and discriminating against mudbloods, just for the sake of it. Most of those justifications are just stupid (many of them are about the "the culture of the wizarding world is being destroyed").

The wonderful thing about people is that they will always question ideas. It's not a blemish upon your character, that you don't want to discuss them. It just makes you normal. The same as most of us.

And yes we all face prejudice every day. Because we are fat, ugly, ginger, different nationality etc. etc. I don't think we should add to that by discussing it in a fantasy setting.

Thank you for at least approaching the issue I posed in a rational way. Most others seem to just be offended.

Back to HP world.

I'm not trying to justify it. Not at all. I'm just trying to find reasons, that are better than just blatant racism, for the prejudice against muggleborns. As I said, what if the prejudice was because of cultural differences due to wand safety? It's a fairly simple idea and one, I think, works better than"mudbloods steal the magic" as in canon.

Other fanfiction that advocate the prejudice usually comes from the perspective of the purebloods that never faced the prejudice themselves so it's easy to dismiss their opinion.

IMHO in "mudbloods steal the magic" is only an excuse, the problem runs deeper than that. The problem in canon is that wizards believe they are superior than other beings; muggles, house-elves, centaurs, goblins, werewolves, etc. Since muggleborns is born from muggles, the prejudice also applied to them.

It's not exactly out of nowhere since it already happened more than a few times in our own history. I prefer this instead of some other made up reason simply because it's simply an us versus them mentality. We don't need a reason to hate them, we just want to hate them.

.

I'm not sure if we can discuss prejudice without adding one or two things from the real world. Prejudice has been a part of our history for a long time. Religions, skin colours, nationality, sexualism, genders, and many more has always been a topic of debate. It's sad to say that humans always have a tendency to discriminate against one another, but it's true. Wizards are also humans, and they can't be excluded from this statement.

Trying to find the reason about muggleborn prejudice is similar to finding a reason about prejudice against jewish. Yes, you can try to find a reasonable explanation; but is that really the reason? Or is it simply because they just want to discriminate against one group of people? Once you 'found' a reason, is it a valid explanation or is it only an excuse to make your prejudice justified?

** Low birth and long lifetime means that most people in power are at least two or three generations away from the rest of the population. These people in power are not just the ones making policy. They're also opinion leaders. This basically results in a culture that is very resistant to change. Combine that with how isolationist they are and you get the British Wizarding World where cronyism and corruption are the cornerstone of governance. This leads to prejudice being both hard to weed out, and imminently and legitimately actionable.

Muggleborns come from a far more dynamic culture. Change is a constant. Therefore, it becomes harder for them to consider any number of social ills as just the way things are. In their culture, they can use legitimate avenues to redress injustice in ways that the canon wizarding world does not seem to allow. If talented muggleborns and half-bloods were allowed to reach their potential, the base that so called purebloods use to justify their stronghold on society would be as nothing.

Basically, at the core of every prejudice is whether letting go of that prejudice would take power away from the most privileged in any society. Its that simple.

Also, most of this fandom doesn't seem to understand how class and race discrimination work.

** I don't think the magic is the issue. I mean, guns are a thing in America and immigrants(from where is banned) who get it might think it's cool but know how to treat it carefully in a way.

But for the sake of a discussion, I raise this idea

Well, I think a realistic Malfoy probably is worried that what happened to French aristocracy will happen. But instead of removal of a king, instead the nobility or the ministry.

Since most stuff can be magicked, the problem lies with food and space. Where wizards number are ever growing but their land arent. This who have are mostly purebloods this became land Lords and people forced to rent since living amongst muggles unless they live in inherited home.

While wizarding space is a thing, it's not a thing most people can do. It can even need a considerable number of resources and skill to do it permanently.

With the land to grow and raise food and resources in the control of pureblood landlord. Threat of emergence of mercantile capitalism brought by trade that muggleborns can bring in the wizarding world but it's not getting out due to breaking statute of secrecy one can't simply magic a property away. In a way merchants challenge the rigidity of structure of society. You can gain wealth and doesn't necessarily need to be born with it. (I.e. The Potters are canonically a mercantile family, I'm assuming Harry's gold is the liquidation of business done by James after the death of his parents).

So imagine being a rich muggleborn being a subdivision developer can make a gated community for new land. Or cheaply bought items then enchanted for wizarding use, this can be the reason for anti enchant muggle stuff propaganda since machine made stuff are precise and better unless it's a precise artisan work. After all who wants a chair to accidentally turning back to straw or furniture being finited to remove accidentally cast color change charm but ended being turned back to tree stumps.

Basically the economy of wizarding world is so stagnant for so long, people in power will not want money to go else where. But their pocket and keep poor people poor as to not challenge their corrupt rulers. the wizarding world may be called a ministry but it is in a way a distopian dictatorship. So citizen productivity is not important in wizarding world than in muggle world so ministry can ignore the plight of the masses so long they please key people to power.

I mean, you are right, the world JKR made makes no sense, but that's an old issue we are all aware of. Perhaps we could rework it?

**** I wouldnt say its stagnant in that sense but money is tied up with the aristocracy. Lets put this way, the weasley are poor pureblood so stuff like tents they have inherited ... Food is never the issue. The issue is materials like wands, clothes and books are all hand-me-downs. That's with three working people in the family, (bill, charlie and Arthur). But they can definitely feed people without a problem. Conjure stuff for temporary use and what not, but permanent stuff are scarce.

So assuming raw materials for potions and all that stuff need to grow on land can be mass produced. But that does not explain why is Remus too poor to get wolfsbane but gets by without a stable job just with ratty clothes or mandrake need to be repotted by hand instead of expanding the pot size. Therfore magical plants must have a no magic when cultivated rule. Thus making it more expensive than food. Raw materials must not be magicked on until processing.(or at least minimized)

I think it's the object permanency of magicked items that's the issue with regards to none raw materials. People buy quils instead of magicking tree branches. Sure you can do that everytime you need to write something but it relies on skill and permanent paper to write on cant. The moment magic runs out it turns back. So food can be encouraged to grow fast but nutrients get used, then you need magic to replenish the land etc. Assuming magical plant take in magic as well, farming becomes highly magically taxing if one does individually thus dedicated farmers who need actual land, specialized expanded farming space and green houses.

Now imagine a magical carpenter with permanent enchanted tools harvesting wood, carving it and assembling chairs, sure its faster than manually doing it but its still a chair at a time dependent on the artisan's effort mentally(ie. Rita's quick qoutes quill writes based what she thinks she hears not what was actually said). Now imagine factory made chairs and the precision job of making identical detailed chair vs. mental energy expended by the artisan to make all chairs identical. Following on that, both has chair has not "magic touched" atribute so the artisan can enchant it with a permanent spell. Now imagine if you scale it up to a thousand chairs. Therfore enchanting muggle objects are illegal despite the radio they use seemed like an old muggle design. It's a trade law that became misappropriated since one can assume who owns businesses (purebloods) it is like monopolistic businesses tries to get laws pass against foreign businesses from entering the market.

Now imagine getting a lot of immigrants where there are few job openings (since magic eliminate the needs of a lot of jobs) and the rich want to hoard money. So "no, theres no job for the muggleborns but hey, food is cheap tho. You just cant afford luxury items, poor peasants" turns into "in oder to deal with unemployment rate and poverty, lets kill the poor unemployed."

** My fic touches these topics. Not in a way that says that it's justified but to show that there is a breeding of toxicity in these pureblood homes. This is what they think- even though it's wrong- and this is how they justify their evil. There was a history between the magical world and the non magical world and there can be no denying that the non magical world tried to commit genocide against witches and wizards with witch hunts. Even though it's been hundreds of years there is bad blood. And I have no doubt that pureblood families told these horror stories to each generation. I think there is a breeding of racism in these households. They are raised to fear the different and then later that fear is turned to hatred. It's turned to looking at the non magical world as “them” the enemy, the ignorant, the weaker etc etc It's wrong and twisted but if you're raised like that you can't even see how warped and twisted your thinking is. My main character is battling these beliefs she was raised with and questioning all the things she had been told in her life. It's not only a change in how she thinks of muggles but it's a change in how she has to view herself as well.

I think people are jumping on you because of how you worded the question. Saying justified prejudice makes it sound like you're saying that it's okay. I think it's clear you aren't saying that but are asking more how was this instilled. What happened to create this hatred and how has the momentum continued for so long.

** I could see it if you think of the magical and muggle Britain as 2 different countries with widely different beliefs, cultures, etc due to magic, longer lives, healing being better, population size. Look at how Japan is depicted half the time for instance. The whole outsider thing. I could certainly see Japanese people being angry if a whole bunch of people constantly immigrate and want to change the culture to match theirs. Look at linkffn(the international tri-wizard tournament) it takes a while to get to the point where this stuff happens but it explains the belief pretty well. This isn't to say it's death eater apologist but it is explained well by a non death eater supporter.

*** You're not making a good point about Japan, since that country is notoriously racist. It is, in fact, one of the most discriminatory countries on the planet in terms of race.

This argument goes down the toilet when it's pointed out that Muggleborns shouldn't be expected or obligated to change their culture to fit the Wizarding World's. People don't seem to be able to separate the fact that Muggleborns have magic with magical Britain. Muggleborns have two choices: they either go to Hogwarts, or they forget they're magical to uphold the statute of secrecy. Magic is /their/ gift, they're entitled to its use, but they're forced into interacting with the magical world at threat of losing their magic otherwise.

Muggleborns are magical and their magic is their own, not the magical world's. They can and should have their own culture /and/ be entitled to having their culture be accepted by the wizarding world at large. They shouldn't be forced to integrate into a culture that already sees them as inferior, and neither should they be expected to not push for change when they see blatant discrimination in their life.

The difference between a bunch of people moving to Japan and a Muggleborn being in Hogwarts is that the Muggleborn /doesn't get to choose/. They don't get to say "no, I'd rather not, get bent" and keep their magic - something that is, again, /their own/ - but rather they get told to go and interact with that world on the threat of having their mind wiped and magic presumably bound. This is not a fair equivalence, and it never has been, but people sure seem to think it should be. Muggleborns are a minority that has been, up until recently, hunted like animals by literal fascists, and would go on to be hunted /again/ like animals by, again, a fascist government. Someone with the means to move to Japan, comparatively, probably isn't.

*** Pretty much. But I just wanted to focus on wands and the fact that they are loaded guns, ready to be fired by an overenthusiastic 11-year-old. I have met very few 11-year-olds who I would ever give a knife, much less a gun.

My question, if you boil it down to the simplest terms was: "How would a society that is always armed with lethal weapons consider the newcomers who don't seem them as such?"

**** Not loaded guns. Fucking military arsenal more like. A gun can do one thing, wands can do a lot more. This would only be one part though I think. I feel like a big part would be that due to the size of the population and magic it would be pre industrial revolution makes a major difference in society values.

***** All valid points, but if we go into minutia of all the cultural issues from history we would never leave the basic premise and would just bog ourselves down.

Example: If we go down the route you suggest, then we would have to examine Hogwarts class size, and then discuss whether other schools exist etc. etc.

But, basically, I agree. A wand can do anything. It's magic after all. It can turn you into an animal, it can give you additional arms, it can make your head go "poof", it can make you a slave, it can boil you insides... it can do so many wonderful things. The cultural impact of such a tool in the hand of children should be severe. (of course for anyone attempting a semi-realistic AU of JKR's world, most authors just go with canon).

As to society values... well... you can theoretically twist them however you want. I can easily imagine a reality where the Founders brought hygiene, critical thinking and democracy to the Wizarding World back in the 1000s. It's not that difficult. Although it does clash with the Statute of Secrecy. So, if we go with Statute, then the Wizarding World separated from the muggle one in the late 1600s. But that's a totally different discussion anyway.

But how would it work. What would be the repercussions? A wand is for all purposes a loaded gun. And every single witch or wizard carries one. It's a permanently armed society. Every single one can blow your brains out with a single spell.

The Wizarding World is actually a very terrifying place to live in. It would be logical they would have cultural norms to counter that, which would lead to the logical conclusion that muggleborns would buck that system. Since they don't know any better.
