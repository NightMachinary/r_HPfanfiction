I feel like most people have got multiple ideas or half-written fics banging around their heads, and it might be motivating if someone seems really really interested in reading their fic about Ron and Harry switching bodies a la Freaky Friday.

Or whatever.


** Heh, I'm not sure this is a good idea at all. I'm already updating two (and a half, ish) fics on FFN, more would probably snow me under completely.

Lets see what first chapters I have kicking about in my drive...

- *HP/aSoIaF Crossover* - A confluence of circumstances lead Harry to appear under the walls of Duskendale during the defiance. He gets chucked in a cell with Aerys and a tentative friendship is formed. Watch through Harry's eyes as Aerys succumbs to madness and Harry is forced to go against him for the good of the kingdom. Harry/Ashara Dayne pairing.

- *Dumbledore Memoirs* - Dumbledore kept a series of secret memoirs revealed only after the death of Voldemort. His old friend Minerva McGonagall collated and edited them together into a single book that presents the image of a deeply conflicted man attempting to protect Harry from the world while always aware of his prophesied place within it. No pairings (Mentioned Dumbledore/Grindelwald but only in passing).

- *Harry/Fleur Vehicle* - Fleur Delacour is both beautiful and talented and she knows it. She thinks it's only fitting that the boys worship the very ground she walks upon. When she comes to Hogwarts she meets the young Harry Potter and doesn't think much of him. However she does see the value of being associated with him. She decides to, basically, seduce Harry for her own gain and has to deal with Harry's (frankly insulting) low level dislike for her.

- *HP/Interstellar Crossover* - The blight seemingly came from nowhere to push humanity to the edge of extinction. It was almost... magical in nature. Harry is part of the team attempting to undo the Blight Curse (kinda like a werewolf curse only for plants) and in so doing comes into contact with a young NASA scientist by the name of John Brand. Later, after the Food Wars and the overthrow of most governments Dr Brand remembers his friend Harry and brings him on for the Lazarus missions.

- *Peradventure* - Oldfic. All of what I have was written some time ago, my first foray into writing and it's not very good. Harry travels back in time (accidentally) to just before Voldemort begins his overt rise. He thinks it will be a walk in the park, but everything is much more political than he'd expected and ill thought out actions upon his arrival set the timeline completely off-kilter. He has no idea what will happen next. Probably Harry/Minerva.

- *Seconds Apart* - This was basically an interesting drabble idea. It's poorly written though interesting on the surface of it. Draco Malfoy as the boy who lived (Narcissa died for him, Lucius did as Voldemort demanded and stood aside). I was going to do some dimensional travel to bring a Harry in (I don't like Draco) but it felt bleh.

- *A Meeting of the ICW* - A short fic documenting Harry and Hermione attempting to make a plea to the ICW for aid. Mostly conceived as a reaction to the 'Wizarding Britain is a backwards craphole' cliché. Mostly infodumps from Hermione on bizarre political situations around the wizarding world and a lot of bureaucracy. Turns out people can be self-obsessed morons in any culture.

That's in addition to the three fics I'm [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11120132/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elves-Most-Fabulous][already]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][working]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10659456/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sun-Queen][on]].

*** Damn these all look interesting. I'm a sucker for fics that have Harry paired with someone other than Hermione or Ginny and all the H/F fics I've read always paint her as a friendless wallflower. One that has her as a more extreme version of how she's actually portrayed in GOF seems hilarious, especially if Harry isn't having any of it at first.

Peradventure also seems right up my alley. Delenda Est comes to mind as a similar fic and I enjoyed the hell out of it.

I really like your Tomb Raider crossover, been following it for a few months. I don't know much about LOTR, but I'll give your other fics a try.

#+begin_quote
  And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered out of it; the tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the third piece of parchment. He held it at arm's length, held it close until his nose was almost touching it. He turned it over; he furrowed his brow, scratched his temple and turned to Barty Crouch. The two held a whispered conversation, held the parchment up to wandlight, then Dumbledore shrugged and addressed the quiet hall.

  ‘Is there a Hogwarts champion,' he asked, ‘called Roonil Wazlib?'

  ‘Yes!' Harry and Ron shouted. They jumped to their feet, arms raised in triumph. And moments later, as one, every other Gryffindor rose to his or her feet, as Ron made his way towards the chamber behind the teacher's table, grinning broadly.

** Hmmm, I have had a few ideas in the past, although even half-written is going much too far. A few scenes with vague ideas on how to connect them to an actual story.....

1) *Hemione and Ginny time travel fic* : DH compliant, takes place five years after the end. The few remaining DEs burn down the burrow in fiendfyre, Harry and the Weasley family (minus Ginny, who off playing Quidditch somewhere) in it. Hermione is the only one who manages to escape, and Ginny hates her for it (/"You should have helped them escape, or died trying"/). Overcome with guilt, Hemione spends a year finding a safe way to time travel, while Ginny turns to the Dark Arts for vengeance. Now a determined Hermione and an insane-ish Ginny travel to a time few days before Harry's parents death.

I have a few scenes involving a huge battle between the DEs and the Order outside Godric's Hollow (James and Lily still die, Hermione escapes with baby Harry), Ginny burning down Gringotts (and hundreds of men and goblins) in fiendfyre when their original plan to retrieve the horcrux fails and a Ginny-Bellatrix duel. A few other scenes too. This one might actually see the light of day, though its still a long way off.

2) *A Harry/Ginny Quidditch story* : Harry and Ginny are on opposite Quidditch teams. A look at how this affects their relationship. I have written a couple of Quidditch scenes, but I am struggling to find an overall plot that will interest people. A simple romance isn't really worth a story.

**** Yeah. That's the basic idea. After her family and Harry's death, she learns the Dark Arts to hunt down their killers, and regularly practicing Dark Magic affects the user's mental state. She will be a sort of loose cannon -- skilled and powerful, but impatient and quick to anger, with no regard whatsoever for collateral damage. So there are obvious parallels to Bellatrix there.

****** Its fanon. No reason I can't use it though. Many of my favorite stories do (/On the Way to Greatness/). It makes sense though -- its called /Dark Magic/.The name implies it should be powerful and addictive and seductive and all that rot. The unforgivables (which are a legal group, not a magical group), at least, use negative emotions for power -- and regular use of negative emotions can't exactly be healthy, can it?

Besides, if Dark Magic didn't have a hidden price, then all those who refuse to use it in fights are idiots, aren't they? There are way too many dire warnings against Dark Magic in canon for them to be completely without cost.

Really not trying to be sarcastic here, but, again, sources? Moody and Bellatrix say this about /Crucio/, but where's the evidence for the other two requiring any particular mental state?

I think the whole "Dark magic is seductive" thing is definitely a workable interpretation of canon, but it's not particularly interesting and doesn't really fit well with the canon theme of our choices being the things that define us, not magic.

******** Not solid evidence, but this suggests all three require determination:

#+begin_quote
  And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange shrieking at him when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse: /"You need to/ mean /them, Potter!"/
#+end_quote

and perhaps this is just personal opinion, but if you /mean/ to hurt, control, or kill someone, then you must be feeling negative emotions. I can't think that someone could strongly, determinedly *want* to kill someone without without feeling fierce hatred or anger or cruelty. (With one exception--mercy killing, and even then I think it would have to be a close loved one that you want to put out of misery, not just some random stranger you feel sorry for.)

And Imperius is absolute control over other people. Harry manages it at a time of desperation, but he admits himself that he doesn't think he does it strongly enough. (Presumably a properly done Imperius victim shows no outward sign of being controlled, rather than "standing there looking blank" like Travis and Bogrod do.) Again, this may just be personal opinion, but if someone wants to control another person--completely, absolutely, taking away all their free will--then they must feel great disrespect for their fellow humans, to have a sense of superiority, to believe their victim a lesser person or somehow unworthy of freedom. I refuse to accept that such feelings are anything other than negative.

Amateur Psychology Hour: I think an exception would be made for sociopaths/psychopaths who aren't encumbered by natural empathy for their fellow humans. (I don't know psychology well enough to say which word is most appropriate in this case.) I think someone with absolutely no care for their peers could cast the unforgivables without the push of negative emotions.

I think seductive dark magic does fit with the theme of choices though, because aren't choices made in hardship the ones that are really important? Choosing not to use seductive dark magic is harder than choosing not to use dark magic that has no greater draw than light magic.

******** IIRC Bellatrix says this about all unforgivables, not just the Cruciatus. So if Dark Magic really does require negative emotions, you can see why it would be bad for your psyche.

Perhaps I'm biased because this is the interpretation of /On the Way to Greatness/, which is the greatest fanfic of all time, but if Dark Magic didn't have any negative side-effects, why don't the good guys use it all the time? Why is there such a negative bias against it if its just the same as any other kind of magic?

From /On the Way to Greatness/:

#+begin_quote
  "Dark magic isn't sanctioned by the Ministry," Harry said cautiously, "but---"

  "Harry, Harry!" Slughorn shook his head. "Surely, you must know better than this revolutionary propaganda! If you have investigated Dark magic, you have to be aware of its effects."

  "It's destructive," Harry said. "It causes damage to the target."

  "Oh, what does the target matter?" Slughorn waved a hand. "A fire spell is a fire spell, Dark or not. The target will burn either way, and the results might even look identical. But do you mean to set something on fire, or do you mean to burnit? That's the crucial difference!" He slapped a pudgy hand down on his knee. "Do you want to cause damage, or do you want to create flames?"
#+end_quote

And this is my favorite part :

#+begin_quote
  "Harry, take care!" he cried. "You make it sound like a trifle, when countless wizards have bowed under the toll it takes. Trust an old man who has seen---who has felt..." Slughorn visibly held himself back and shook his head. "The more time you spend immersed in dark thoughts and intentions, the less room they leave for anything else in your mind. You start, unwittingly, seeing the world through a prism of darkness---and, since you've spent so long nursing a well of anger, you'll find it spills over far too easily... and then..."

  Slughorn wiped sweat off his forehead, and Harry reeled back at sight of naked emotion on his face.

  "You have to control yourself... yes, you have to exercise great control not to let yourself slip," the Potions master said in a hushed voice. His eyes appeared suddenly sunken as he gazed at Harry. "Dark magic is dangerous business, Harry... dangerous and altogether unpleasant if you will practice it, and not be content with just knowing. The things you can learn, the things you can feel..." His voice sounded wistful for a moment. "But the risk... you can lose sight of yourself so thoroughly you will never make it back again. I have known... so many people..."
#+end_quote

It doesn't take away the 'choice' aspect of HP either. Dark Magic itself can considered a choice :

#+begin_quote
  "On occasion, we are forced to make terrible choices," Slughorn said. "Dark magic is another such choice. Would it be better if we could afford not to know it? Yes, certainly. But you cannot blame yourself for gaining knowledge that has saved your life."

  "Dumbledore believes that Dark magic harms the soul," Harry told the stones.

  "Yes." Slughorn nodded solemnly. "And is it not awful when we have to choose between the integrity of our souls and our very life?"
#+end_quote

Besides, the term 'Dark Magic' has been around long before Harry Potter came to use it. It always has negative connotations, and is often considered a making-a-deal-with-the-Devil sort of thing. Taking Dark Magic to be like any other branch of magic cheapens this IMO.

** - Hermione meets someone she went to primary school with. I already have like 5 fics about Hermione's relationship with her parents/muggle world, so it's a bit much at this point. But it's kind of a guilty pleasure.

- Longer Lily-centric James/Lily fic that takes place from the moment they walk off the train at the end of seventh year to (ideally) the moment they died. There are a lot of fics that go from the beginning to the end of seventh year, but I really want to explore what comes next. I don't understand why someone else hasn't beat me to it, to be honest. Working summary is "Lily Evans navigates a strange sort of adulthood marked by secret resistance meetings, funerals, and unplanned pregnancies." However, I'm worried that my Lily is too imperfect and angsty to be likable protagonist. Plus the timeline is a bitch.

- Ginny fic that takes place over Christmas of HBP in diary entry format. Are those totally passe now?

- Bill/Fleur romance though not sure if that many people are interested in reading about them.

- DA fic that's a bit Ginny-centric. I feel like I've never read a long DH-era fic where Ginny is the central character, but at the same time it feels a little bit too formulaic.

- AU oneshot Ginny visits Harry at the Dursleys and goes off on him for breaking up with her. Probably too soapboxy, though maybe people would still be okay with it.

**** I've written some of the James/Lily fic but it's a monster to plot because there's so many major events in only 3.5 years, and there's a very specific way things have to happen to not create obvious plotholes or break with future canon.

With regards to the Ginny fic, the only important canon plot point during Christmas holidays in HBP is Scrimgeour/Percy's visit. But there's a lot of unimportant things that are fun to explore. Stupid stuff, from Harry/Ginny running into each other in the kitchen in the middle of the night to Ginny's mum bothering her about her O.W.Ls. I honestly have a lot of fun writing Ginny's internal monologue, because she's actually pretty confident/funny so it's not just angstangstangst. Plus she's a 16-year-old girl who is trying to figure out where she stands on the whole issue of being a teenage girl.

I've half written the fic, and even though Harry is mentioned fairly often, it's more "oops Harry-saw-me-in-an-old-tshirt-without-a-bra-and-I-winked-at-him-and-now-he-probably-thinks-I'm-going-to-rape-him" than "OMG-Harry-touched-my-arm."

- A crossover novel between the Harry Potter and Michael Moorcock's /Eternal Champion/ series (the Elric saga) worlds. A (completed) NaNoWriMo entry from years back, it would need a hell of a lot of editing to get into publishable shape.

75% complete:

- The remainder of my HTTYD fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7205731/1/Unfettered][Unfettered]] (not HP).

- A rather bland AU Naruto romance (Naruto/Ino pairing). Naruto's left broken after Sakura's death and Ino helps pick up the pieces. Adult Ino is wickely fun to write (not HP).

Started but anywhere from sketched out to 50% complete:

- The Harry Potter/Starship Troopers crossover hinted at in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/8/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][this one-shot]] (summary of story included). A Rico-POV story with excerpts from Harry's POV. Voldemort made Voyager his horcrux (yes, I did this before LessWrong) and it proceeds to possess a bug queen, leading (eventually) to their war on Earth.

- Novelette: As an infant, Harry accidentally ingests Unicorn blood. Rather than live a cursed life, horribly unfair to one who is as innocent as Unicorns themselves, those in Harry's proximity inevitably suffer bouts of extreme bad luck instead. This is "the power he knows not."

- The Robin Hood story as told by Friar Tuck. A horror story, it departs from canon in that Robin has theurgistic mind-control powers which he uses to snare souls into his cabal. Tuck attempts (unsuccessfully) to flee his clutches. I was invited to submit a novella to an original fiction fantasy horror anthology and I didn't manage to complete it on time (not HP).

- Azkaban fic modeled after a prompt of jbern's on AFC. (I won't go into details here because I still intend to write it.)

- *Going Back One More Time* - Ron Weasley arrives at Godric's Hollow on October 30, 1981. With no wand, no plan, and no clothes, he has one day to convince the Order that Voldemort is coming. It should have been anyone else, but heroes don't get to choose when they're needed.

- *The Hidden Snake* - Harry Potter might get all the glory, but it's Draco Malfoy that's doing all the hard work. Snape turns Draco early. Draco becomes the antagonist that Harry needs while he brings down the old guard, one Death Eater at a time.

- *Harry Potter/Hunger Games* - Voldemort wins and enrolls all of the traitors in a battle royale. The winner survivors and gets to leave England. Harry enters the Hunger Games thinking that they would never kill each other, but when he finds a pair of hands squeezing his throat, the killer within awakens.

- *The Last Wizards* - Co-existing with the Muggles should have brought about peace. Instead, it brought disease. Spread by contact through other wizards, the last wizards have scattered around the world. When Neville risks his life to bring him a message, Harry has to decide whether search for the cure is worth the potential genocide of his kind.

- *One Last Quest* - Harry Potter was ninety-nine years old. He was a retired Auror. There was no reason to go back. Then again, when did he ever have a choice? The world is different, but bravery doesn't wane with age. Hermione and Ron join him for one last quest to secure the future of the next generation.

** *Title:* Krumplosion

*Inspiration:* JKR's strangely alliterative world is fantastic for a children's series, but has the capability of making adults roll their eyes in frustration. It practically begs for parodies to poke fun at its strangeness.

I really like fics centered around the fourth year because GoF gave each character some interesting personality quirks. It's often used as a setting for H/Hr fics because Harry spends a lot more time with Hermione than usual. Indeed it's quite curious that the studious Harry from the summer between his eleventh birthday and starting Hogwarts disappears with no further explanation. One of the most important lessons for children to learn from the series - that school can be fun and useful - is lost because a large focus of the series is on Harry's friendship with Ron (who dislikes studying), Quidditch (although sports are also a fun way for children to interact with their environment), and romance later in the series. I'd just finished reading yet another Harry-asks-Hermione-to-the-Yule-Ball first fic and this idea came to me. It is lighthearted, very badly written and shouldn't be read by anyone. Ever.

*Summary:* H/Hr Crack-Fic Oneshot! Albus Dumbledore investigates a grisly scene in the Hogwarts library. The faculty speculates, Karkaroff rages, and a mystery gets solved. Hyperbolic violence. OOC-ness everywhere, and AU elements. NOT to be taken seriously.

*Genre:* Mystery/Parody

*Rating:* M (for descriptions of the aftermath of violent events)

*Publish Date:* Within a week or two

** I wouldn't call it /half/-written, 'cause I never know how long a fic's gonna be until I finish it. Also I haven't actually written very much yet and I'm stuck already. But I have one project ongoing at the moment--a HP/Dishonored Crossover: The Outsider is a god worshipped by wizards and the Void is the space between universes. Non-lethal!Corvo sends Daud into the Void rather than just let him live, and at the same time the Outsider yanks Lily in just before Voldemort kills her. Lily and Daud spend some time in the Void before getting out, but they end up in each other's worlds--Daud about 5yrs after Voldemort's downfall, Lily about 8yrs after the end of Dishonored.

Cue them both trying to get back home. Daud helps save Sirius from Azkaban and tries to convince 5yr old Harry that just because the Outsider marked him and gave him some cool powers doesn't mean he's an awesome benevolent god. I'm not sure what Lily's going to be doing in Dunwall, beyond searching for information, but I want some kind of interaction with Emily and Corvo and I have definite headcanons about what everyone ended up doing.

And I have a fics that I started waybackwhen that I'll probably never finish 'cause I've no idea what direction to take them. One is a time-travel fic where 5th year Lily gets sent forward to 1995. Another is young Harry running away from Privet Drive to London where he stumbles across a homeless Remus, who contacts Dumbledore who decides that the best solution to this problem is to force the Dursley to let Remus live with them and become Harry's primary caregiver. I like both ideas, but I can't do justice to either of them because they're rather more character driven than I do well with. I've also got a half-written HP/Prison Break crossover with Auror!Harry accidently getting on the wrong side of the Muggle police in Panama and getting chucked in Sona with with PB characters.

I wrote it ages ago but just had another peek and apparantly the only excuse I came up with was "We can't alert the Muggles by Apparating out!" which is exactly the kind of crap I came up with five years ago. I'd have to think up something better if I was to go back to it.

How do you mean that the HP/DH might feel disjointed? The writing style? What's I've done so far (about 25,000 words) is alternate so one chapter is from Daud's POV, the next from Lily's, the next from Daud, etc.

***** How much do Daud and Lily's story-lines have in common though? From what I gathered they're basically completely separate? If they come together at the end and aspects of both stories are important in the resolution then I can see it being a good idea. If they're both just living in their own little crossover story then it might disrupt the flow to have the chapters interlaced like that.

You know your story better than I do though, so don't take my word as anything important.

****** No, I appreciate the input. They do spend a while together in the Void--long enough to befriend each other--but you're right that once out their storylines are mostly seperate. I did have plans to at some point create a mirror connection between them--literally an enchanted mirror that allows Daud to contact his home world--and I'm toying with the idea of having Daud stay in HP-world (either by choice or force), but I hadn't considered making the actual storylines come together. I like the idea though and will see about figuring out a way to do it if possible.

So thank you for your comments!

** I have two chapters left of my last fic novel that I've very guiltily not been updating. Then I have to update the headcanon tumblr, make some headway into my /Teddy Lupin, Demon Hunter/ serial and maybe finish the latter two-thirds of my slow-burn Draco/Astoria short. But more importantly, after I finish my novel, I'm going to rewrite it into an original story; so that'll be exciting!

** I'm most eager to read more Dark!Hermione. All that are advertised like that never go to the extreme and really let her loose onto the world, or they go completely overboard and make her nothing short of Luzifers daughter.

I am personally in the process of writing three fics, one of them rather regularly since I do have some betas reading it.

*The Helios Project:* OC-heavy with a focus on Hermione, the OC Aurelius Lander and Harry. Hermione and Aurelius become teachers at Hogwarts and students at Asgard university where they join in a research to be the first magicals to fly to the moon. Meanwhile Harry organises the defense of the magical world against a combined group of dark wizards at the International DMLE in Den Haag.

*Antioch Peverell:* Harry centric, extended universe/AU. Retelling of the canon story up to a certain point. Instead of giving Harry to the Dursleys, Dumbledore gives a small hope a shot. Lily had raised blood wards and Harry needed to be with those of his blood. A lucky incident reminded Dumbledore that not just Lily had relatives, still alive. Also James had some, even though they were as far from being close as possible. But when a small drop of Harrys blood proved him to be akin to the House of Peverell, the Lord Peverell decided to take the boy in as his son. He gives him to his fifth wive Jorunn, a fierce warrior of the babylonian armies who trains Harry in the arts of war, diplomacy and much more. Having the House of Peverell behind him, Harry Potter or as he is now known, Antioch Peverell stumbles through his years at Hogwarts with a bit more grace than he'd have if he was raised by the Dursleys.

And the one that I'm so motivated to write, *Dark Lady Mudblood:* After the fourth year, Hermione is eager to learn more and more in order to stand a chance against Voldemort. Her search for knowledge drives her into the Black library where she find books on a variety of dark magic. Being a victim of her own curiosity she accidentally summons a demon that latches onto her soul and lives within her, making her stronger, smarter and less reluctant to use brutal force to get what she wants.

** I also published one called "Daddy Mooney" because I was feeling sappy. It was written a while ago, and got somewhat popular. It was about Remus trying to visit Harry when he was still a little boy, and being horrified by the Dursley's, kidnapping him, and raising him as his own. Also, totally aged up Tonks, just because Remadora is my cup of tea =)

I could totally continue it on or rewrite it. A lot of people seem to think there's more to the story Its fun and fluffy

** So far it's only a chapter, but the basic premise is that Dumbledore turned Dark after the attack by Muggles on Arianna was fatal. Also trying to come up with a good name for the fic without being cliche.

Another story idea is Grindelwald escaping Nurmengard sometime during the time period of the main series to seek revenge on Dumbledore or to even mentor Harry.

My final idea is of Merlin's life, what's the reason behind the Wizarding World treating him as a God,

'Light Switch'

Works on multiple levels, both Dumbledore turning dark after a major event and in comparison to how his canon personality is portrayed. Not sure if a fanfic with that title exists but it just popped into my head.
