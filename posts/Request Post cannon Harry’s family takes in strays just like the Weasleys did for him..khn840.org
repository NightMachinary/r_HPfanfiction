Looking for fics where Harry and his family psuedo adopt children in need, like the Potters did for Sirius and the Weasleys did for Harry.


** Harry taking in Strays. Not all of them are cannon compliant.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6142629/1/Dudley-s-Memories][Dudley's memories]] by paganaidd. Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Complete FFNet. And it's sequel [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6329597/1/][Snapes Memories]]. Harry is finding a healthy outlet for his "saving people thing" in the form of one damaged little boy. In doing so he finds himself thinking about his old teacher, quite a bit. Complete FFNet. Also an offshoot fic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6486190/1/Fortunate-Son][Fortunate Son]] by call me Cassandra. Complete FFNet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1210501?view_full_work=true][All Must Draw Near]] by Saras_girl. Eventual Drarry. Harry doesn't have time for rumours; he has a shop to run. Which is just as well, really. Harry and Draco take in a homeless girl. Complete. AO3

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3397283?view_full_work=true#main][DragonHeart Caravan]] by witch dragon. Summary: 5-year-old Harry Potter overhears his aunt complaining to his uncle about the "freaks" camping nearby. Maybe if they are the same type of "freak" he is they will want him? Pairings: HP/DM, HP/OMC, Severus/OMC, Remus/OMC/OFC, Remus/Sirius and others as the story progresses Warnings: Under 18 - Harry is still at school. AU, mentions of child abuse, Slash, Violence, Sexual Situations, powerful Harry, manipulative Dumbledore, there are chapters with vampire blood play, het, threesome, and third person remembering of non-con and murder of children. I will give warnings before those chapters so it can be skipped over if you want. Despite these warnings it really isn't a dark story, if you have questions feel free to contact me. Part way through the story Harry and his family adopt some abandoned children. Complete. AO3

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8542714/1/][Dragon Singer]] by Na'hiel. Once upon a time, Parselmages were known by a different name: Dragon Singers. Harry Potter is going to bring that art back to life, though at six years old he doesn't know it yet. Eventual slash, HP/CW. Warning: Story contains child abuse. Adoption happens near the end. Complete. FFNet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8873683/chapters/20344381][Broken Mind, Fractured soul]] by sensiblyTainted. Harry Potter watched his mother die when he was fifteen months old, a piece of Voldemort's soul invaded his own, Vernon abused him, Petunia tore him to shreds with her hateful words, and Lockhart molested him throughout Second-year. After all that trauma, is it any wonder Harry created multiple personalities to deal with it all? In Harry's third year, Severus Snape decides to do something about it. He gives Harry therapy in secret, and this opens Harry up to a friendship with Neville Longbottom, another victim of Lockhart's perversions, and Draco Malfoy who can understand Harry's Slytherin alter better than anyone else. Adoption/helping a child doesn't happen until like the end of the second book. Eventual Drarry. Complete. AO3.

[[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=araceil&sort=title][Against My Nature]] by Araciel. Harry travels through time and stumbles upon Newt Scamander. What follows is an adventure of a lifetime full of magical creatures and found family. Harry and Newt adopt a Obscurus. Unfinished. Deleted off FFNet.. but there is a downloadable EPub in the link.

That's all folks

  "It is not unusual for one child in a family to be singled out for abuse and neglect. Often the other children in the household even participate in the abuse of the scapegoat." Dudley Dursley looks back on his childhood. Some things are a lot clearer now.
