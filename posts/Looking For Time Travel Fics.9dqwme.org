In which Harry loses everyone and goes back in time to save everyone Pairing Ginny/Harry more than 100k words if possible with A dash of smut if possible but not required


** My favorite will always be Backwards with Purpose, as well as it's companion pieces. It's completely heartwrenching, but also quite witty at times. There's no bashing, but the Weasleys are not always 100% perfect, either. In fact, they are against Harry for much of the fic. Except for Ron, of course, who is stalwart and amazing. It does have a Harry/Ginny pairing as well.

** I'm not the biggest fan of H/G so I don't know a lot of fics like that, but Harry Potter and the Nightmare Future's Past is a must-read which seems to be exactly what you're looking for.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516), is a little different: the Trio, along with a 5 days old Rose, all were thrown back to Aug 31 1991. They didn't lose everyone, but their desire to make things better was granted by a powerful artifact. Back in the past, they took over the bodies of their younger self (although they still existed in the background consciousness) and recruited a few more in their effort, among them the 10 years old Ginny. At the end, after they had accomplished their mission successfully, they returned the bodies back to their younger selves, and headed back to their original timelines.

This fic has a good plot and some great character interactions, but could use help in grammar and spelling.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Bonds of Time 1) is a h/g soul bond time travel fic. Not my taste, but its not terrible either.

Linkffn(Ginny Returns) has Ginny travel back solo to quickly put down Voldemort.

Linkffn(From the flame to the Spark) was kind of entertaining even though it died before getting too far off the track.
