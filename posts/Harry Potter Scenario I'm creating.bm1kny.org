I've been creating a Harry Potter Scenario and I was thinking if anyone is able to help me come up with some ideas to help me finish it.

I was wondering if you could help me come up with ideas as to what the characters can do in each year and how the problems can match with the main villain.

I created this as an alternative timeline that Voldemort doesn't exist but another dark lord, but in this case, dark lady as the main villain will a female and she is connected to one of the main characters.

The story is set a year before Harry, Ron and Hermione and the others come to Hogwarts and they exist in this timeline as well because some of the main characters want to have a relationship with them, my friend suggested I sort of follow the movies and books but that just seems boring so I wanted to see what else can happen.

I would appreciate it a lot if anyone can help me come up with some ideas I can take into consideration as I'm not the best writer and I don't want to spoil anything for my main characters so I didn't want to talk to them.

Thank you everyone who would be willing to help me ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…

P.S.

I've posted this in the Harry Potter subreddit but they told me to come here and I don't know why as this is not technically a fanfiction but no one seems to understand what I mean by Scenario....

*** The main things I want to get figured out would be like stuff kind of like Chamber of Secrets like those kind of major events and a way to kill the main villain and I don't want it to be Horcrux's because its been used, and I don't want to have the major things to be like the books and movies because thats boring to me and the players would know all about it and how to complete it and research where as if its something different they actually have to properly think and act like their characters if that makes sense and if it helps you with coming up with some ideas I can send you the word document with what I have down for the years?

** We probably need more informations about the AU before making the scenario.\\
First of all, what is the connection between the Dark Lady and one of the character? Is it something like he is her children, of a old enemy like Voldemort and Harry?\\
Then, about the Dark Lady herself, what happened with her? Since she was not Voldemort, your universe could be extremely different. Did she still recruit with Slytherin, another house or all houses? Was Snape among the followers and did he steal become a spy then teacher? Did the Potter survive? Was Sirius Black sent in Azkaban?

For the scenario in itself, I guess it would depend of the characters and their objective. If they have to be "opposed" to the Dark Lady, countering her plans like with Voldemort might work. Something like "there are several spies of her in the Castle, you have to find them before they complete their mission" (Vanishing Cabinet, make an opening in the wards, hell you can even isolate the castle after an incident with No Hogsmead visits and intercepted OWL so the heros have until the hollydays to find them).\\
You could probably still do a Tournament Year, even if you characters are not the Champions. "International Cooperation" is something Dumbledore could come up it even without Voldemort, and having several Foreign Students coming into Hogwarts is an interesting starting point for multiple scenarios (new friends, enemies, romance and intrigues with the Tournament and possible cheating), you could even change the Year so it happens when your characters are older.\\
As a "Secondary story", you can gives a long term objective to one your character or all of them. For example (probably too close to canon to be of use but well), someone being obssessed with the Death of a Loved one and wanting to bring him back, that stumble on the Miror of Erised and later learn about the Hallows and locating them (depending of what happened to Voldemort, or Riddle, you could have the 3 Hallows in Hogwarts at the same time after all).

*** I don't know what AU means haha

The Dark Lady is the mother of the main character who is aswell a girl, The Potters are still alive she has no quarrel with them as they aren't major characters, Sirius isn't sent to Azkaban as there is no reason for him to be there.

I do have a year for the Triwizard Tournament and different tasks that will happen and I feel like I want the year of the competitors to travel away from Hogwarts so they go to another school and compete there.

**** AU means Another Universe, it used in fanfic when the world is really different from canon (like in your scenario since the Potters live and Harry is not the BWL).

Since the Main Character is the daughter of the Dark Lady, the 2 most obvious scenarios are :

- MC is estranged from his mother and is "good". Dark Lady wants her (either to have her heir or for something more sinister like using her for a dark ritual or wanting to possess her body . . .) and each year (or story) are the heros fighting her last plot.
- MC is with her mother, spends the first year just making connections and dodging suspicions, then is a kind of spy inside the school accomplishing mission while stile trying to maintain her cover.

â€‹

I don't really know if roleplay has the same "rules" than fics, so I'm not sure for the rest. But it's comon for the MC to have a mentor to guide him (monomyth), with a "good" MC, Dumbledore is there and ready (doesn't have a Harry Potter to discuss with after all), but other character can play this role, like the Head Of Houses. If the character is "dark", the Dark Lady herself can do it if they have good relations or pretty much any lieutenant of her.

â€‹

Now there is something I'm curious about: What about Tom Riddle? If he didn't become Voldemort is he the Defense Teacher? Or did he do something else? Did he ever opened the Chamber or is Myrtle alive?

***** Ahh okay fair enough

The thing with the Dark Lady and the MC is that the MC has no idea that her mother is the villain for the moment she only knows that her family she was living with is not actually her family as her family has been under the Imperius Curse for several years.

It looks like for the moment McGonagall is like her mentor I guess but I'm not too sure.

As for Tom Riddle, he isn't the DADA Teacher yet Snape has been for the last few years with Slughorn being the Potions Teacher, he never opened the Chamber and I would say she wouldn't be alive but to be honest I have no idea haha. I'm just trying to figure out the major events during the school years and their connections to the Dark Lady.

****** I see, in that case of path of events you could do could be the discovery of MC mother. It could be something like :

- 1st confrontation with a low level follower of Dark Lady. It could be the Philosopher Stone or something similar. The artifact in itself is not really important since the point is that there is an artifact hidden in Hogwarts and that someone want to steal it. Also the whole "challenges" associated with teacher would be interesting from a player point of view. If PS too "cliche", you can just change the artifact (hell since Riddle is not Voldemort, maybe something about Ravenclaw diadem being found and dark Lady thinking about using it so she sends a follower, but since it's just one idea among others she doesn't send a too high ranked one). So Mc has a first fight with Dark Lady follower who just treat her as an enemy and try to kill her, only to fail and be caught or managing to flee (then punished way harsher than normal by Dark Lady).
- 2nd confrontation: with a true Inner Circle this time. The guy can be here for any reason (assassinate someone, getting informations, anything) who, this time, see ressemblance between Dark Lady and Mc and let her escape or at least leave some hints.
- 3rd confrontation: with Dark Lady who says her she is the mother (Dun Dun Dun). This one is hard because the only 2 ways for MC to be "kidnapped" and confronted by Dark Lady I can see are either totally random (someone throw a portkey at her while she is out of Hogwart's protection, while a Hogsmeade visit or during summer), or follow canon (tournament, she is in because why not, cup is a portkey).

Also another question, since Snape is the long term Defense teacher into your AU, how do you plan to introduce a new "opponent" if your scenario goes on several years. Rowling used the cursed position to introduce a new character each year that was always connected to plot and always put Harry in danger.

******* They are some good events i'll take them into consideration, I think its going to take me so long to figure stuff and I really don't want to follow, the events from the books and movies I want them to be different because I don't want my players to know how to do stuff I want them to actually think about stuff and come up with it if that makes sense?

Well he isn't long term he's the DADA for the first two years, I do have other people as the DADA later on in each year except for the year where the Triwizard Tournament will happen as they won't be in Hogwarts they'll be in another school.

** Hiya! Since you have a lot of world building to do I think there's very little that I can do to help you with, but what I can recommend is watching this video: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etNcsShL3F0]] (part1) [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib1i-t5rLyQ]] (part 2. 20 minutes total).

It's an old interview with Rowling about the important roles of women in her story, and since your antagonist(s) is/are going to be female, you may be able to draw some inspiration from it. Especially the part where she speaks about Bellatrix. Hope that helps!
