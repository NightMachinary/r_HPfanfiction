I saw one a while ago about Neville and the DA, but I can't find it now. I would also be interested in one that follows Ginny or the Twins. Any suggestions would be great.


** I'm not sure if it was this fic specifically you saw but Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness follows Neville for the period during the 7th book.\\

And tvtropes has a fanfic rec page dedicated to stories with a focus on peripheral characters, called Day in the Limelight, which has about 30 recommended fics on it. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterDayInTheLimelight]]

Enjoy!

*** I just found the link to Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, that was exactly what I was talking about. Thank you very much. I will check out that list as well.

*** I really liked Dumbledore's Army, but the second book in the trilogy got kind of gruesome in a (for me) super disturbing way. :-( I liked the third one, at least as far as it got, but as far as I know the author hasn't continued it.

** Hah! I'd like to see Draco and the Philosopher's Stone, Draco and the Chamber of Secrets, Draco and the Half-Blood Prince. Hee hee. I'm sure that's how he would imagine JKR's books being. I mean, who else could be at the center of the universe?
