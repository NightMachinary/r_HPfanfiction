I think I've avoided them because they usually seem to pair Hermione with Snape or Draco.

Has anyone read a good marriage law fic that avoids those two pairings at all? Any recommendations would be appreciated.

Edit: No Snape pairings at all please.


** /Was about to post Snape/pairings/

Saw no Snape pairings wanted.

** I've got a handful! It's been quite a while since I've read most of these, but they do fit your request. And none are HGSS or HGDM. I honestly haven't found many Marriage Law fics that don't use Hermione. But it's often a device anyway.

*Hermione/Sirius*

linkffn(I Solemnly Swear by hufflepuffpower93) linkffn(Necessary by the Order by ladyseradereturns) linkffn(innocence by ceredwen) linkffn(a hidden agenda by kia maro) linkffn(happilyeverafter by igobumpinthedark)

*Hermione/George*

linkffn(the injunction by justcourbeau)

*Hermione/Fred*

linkffn(a sense of belonging by annewed)

*Hermione/Remus*

linkffn(a higher law by Nynaeve80) linkffn(shared destinies by amightypenguin)

Anything by Ladyseradereturns has a smuttier version on her [[http://seradesfanfics.livejournal.com/][livejournal]] if that's your thing. "A Higher Law" is a /breeding/ law, not marriage law, but might still fit what you want?

**** +In general, they're to either a) gain an advantage by forcing a certain type of magical creature to procreate, or to b) force a subset of the magical population to procreate to dilute the gene pool (like if purebloods keep having squibs, a breeding law might be that they can only procreate with a muggleborn or muggle, and within X amount of time). Often they're combined with a marriage law, but I've seen a few that have them without a marriage requirement.+

SO many with Hermione and Snape, you're right!

** Oh, no SS/HG or DM/HG? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3484954/1/The-Marriage-Stone][The Marriage Stone]] sounds like something you're looking for then.

** filter by Harry/Daphne and half the stories will be of that vein. None of them are good, but they're there if you're really bored.
