** First of all my suggestion would be to remember that the books are told from Harry's perspective, a biased narrator. With the exception of a few (Draco, Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle,) we know very little about the other Slytherins besides cheating at Quidditch and being favored by Snape. In my mind most of them aren't evil incarnate, they are simply sitting on the sidelines quietly, much like many of the other students. The very fact that Harry never mentions them in canon tells me that they are simply going about their business as students.

You are right, trying to have full on evil characters do a complete 180 in the span of a year would be difficult. Trying to convince people who don't want to follow Voldemort but have been too scared to speak up because they didn't want to be the first in Slytherin to do so is much more realistic.

** I think it's best to use the starting point that most Slytherins don't need all that much redemption. I generally like to think that the house could roughly be divided into three groups. The vocal extremist minority, like Draco. The quiet nice minority, who don't look down on muggles or muggleborns. Then there's the quiet majority; the ones who don't really like muggles, think they're generally inferior, but are perfectly happy to just keep a separation - absolutely no interest in killing muggles.

That's not a good attitude for the house have, but it's a lot better than the uniform rabid anti-muggle attitude that I see in fics.

** You don't have to 'redeem' the majority of Slytherins. You just have to properly frame their choices. Harry Potter is a hero, he's special, he'll do all the admirable things that we wish we would do but would probably shy away from. From his point of view not doing anything is bad. For the Slytherins, if its not broken, why fix it? Given proper context a lot of decisions make more sense even if you disagree. Why fight for what's right when it doesn't really effect you? If Hermione and the Creevey's are the most visible muggleborns would you risk your life for them or are they just too annoying to go out of your way for when you're still in school? They're annoying, you don't really care either way would you fight your housemates over it?

The first thing to to do in my opinion is to recognise they're still basically kids. Kids gang up on others and do shitty things. Kids can be really mean. I doubt everyone in Slytherin was born the sum of all evil. Slytherin is about achieving whatever you want by whatever means. If you want to get through years of a boarding school you'd best get along with your room-mates and housemates. If your roommates hold certain views strongly it is easier to go along with it if you don't care either way than it is to argue.

If a roommate of yours for the next few years came in muttering about mudbloods etc and nobody else said anything would you stop and challenge them or would you roll your eyes and change the subject?

Some of the things they did were understandable if mean. Hermione is an annoying know-it-all. Harry does get away, sometimes even rewarded for things that would get others in trouble. Hermione getting hexed probably is funny from their point of view.

Another thing to consider when working out the character of an average Slytherin is the hostility of the other houses. Gryffindor might be the loudest but in the books the other houses cheer on Gryffindor to beat Slytherin. It makes sense for them to stick together when everyone else comes in hating them. Keeping them together also means they'll be more tolerant of each other's bullshit. At least that mudblood hater will always have your back if you're getting hexed in the corridor. It all adds up to being much easier to go along with the views of others. Go with the flow and survive. When the Death Eaters took over then you can flex that power a bit, if you go along with it you don't just survive you thrive. You don't have to believe in something to use it. Slytherin as a house would embrace that more than any other.

The vast majority of the house will have done nothing 'wrong' they just probably wouldn't have put themselves in danger which, when you consider that they're just children, is understandable. Maybe you believe that they have a 'duty' of some sort to do what is 'right' but I disagree. They might have been bullies, they might have been petty but so are all school children. 99% of people regret things they did when they were young. The other 1% are either lacking in the awareness to look back or are actual saints.

  I think when Pansy screams that Harry's right there - she's freaking the fuck out. Yet the entire Slytherin house is immediately considered to be traitors and escorted to the dungeons.

That was only in the movies though. In the books, Slytherin House evacuates, and nobody stays behind to fight, initially.

  I'm also fairly certain McGonagall says something about having Slytherin House leave the grounds.

She has them follow Filch to the Room of Requirement. Where, as the sanctuary for the DA, there's a safe passage into Hogsmeade, where they can get to the Hogwarts Express, and get somewhere safe.

The vast majority of the students from Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Gryffindor evacuate with them.

** Let's talk about Malfoy, since he's /the/ Slytherin of the story.

When we meet Malfoy he starts going on about his prejudices, against muggles, against Hufflepuffs, against Hagrid. This is at the center of who he is as a person. In that he judges himself superior based around looking down on everyone else. The important thing to remember about this is that Draco is 11 years old. He doesn't have any opinions he didn't get from Lucius and Narcissa. He's never met Hagrid, he's probably never spoken to a Muggle. The only thing he needs to grow as a person is to grow up without following the familiar path of his parents.

This happens in canon when he's forced into a situation he's not okay with. It allows him to see that everything he thought he knew was wrong, or at least not necessarily true. You can make this happen gradually, teenagers don't need a big reason to be a rebel.

*** I don't understand why you're being downvoted.

"Slytherin House" doesn't particularly need to be redeemed. It's just a place that you sleep at a school full of children. Being /in/ Slytherin does not inherently mean anything is wrong with you.

Unsurprisingly, children raised by the wizard equivalent of the KKK are going to share their parent's views. This isn't an "excuse" for characters like Draco, it's just /reality/.

So I suppose the answer to "fixing" Slytherin house would be to... I dunno, force all of Hogwarts to take a competent Muggle Studies course or something. Honestly, in a society with something like the Statute of Secrecy, the fact that this course isn't mandatory and literally one of the most important classes at Hogwarts is insanity.

** Nanoha Style. Giant Magical Friendship Beam. But really, an active magical thrashing from Harry, to the point that Insert Slytherin Enemy/Bully here realises that Harry might actually be stronger than Voldemort, and decides to find out/ask how to change/be free of Voldemort

** Show them actually struggling between what is right and what is wrong, that slow struggle that takes halfway through the fanfic is more believable, then five chapters in.

Don't make them completely good guys, but also don't make them completely bad guys. Or not all of them.

Have some of them not agree with Dumbledore and Harry, but also not want to join Voldemort, maybe because they don't want to kill, or because they don't want to risk their life or something like that.

If it's during seventh year, and the Carrows are in charge what do the Slytherins do? Do some hold their head proudly, some keep their head down? Others try to help in secret? Maybe they weren't expecting for it to be that brutal and are struggling within themselves.

Maybe have some of them still hate creatures, maybe have some of them still not like Muggleborns, but are acceptable or ignore them.

People aren't black or white in terms of morality; everyone has a little bit of grey inside of them. Show that grayness, bring it out of them. What do they do in certain situations and do differently in others?

Also remember that not every Slytherin needs redemption; but if you want a Slytherin or two or maybe a few, to get redeemed; just make sure that it is believable enough.

** Are we redeeming Death Eaters or Slytherins here?

Slytherins imply that we're dealing with /children/. The majority is just regurgitating things and acting like they've seen from parents, etc. All they really need is better role models/friends with a less dulled moral compass. They don't really need any redemption besides "become better people".

This is assuming we're dealing with Slytherins before the N.E.W.T. years. At that point, they become more independent and their beliefs and actions are much less prone to quick changes. They may be full Death Eaters at that point (especially 7th years), and thus need more of a "proper" redemption arc.

** The way I have always written redeemed Slytherins is mostly by using background characters as the new Face of Slytherin. Those that choose to be neutral and stay out of conflict, inadvertantly allowing those like Pansy, Malfoy and Flint to be the loudest and most obvious Faces of Slytherin. Honestly, the way that Pansy, Malfoy and Flint act is not at all cunning. In fact, they act pretty Gryffindor-ish. I reckon they only got into Slytherin because their families expect it of them

*** Malfoy acted really Slytherin-ish and cunning, (but cunning does not mean clever, it helps for sure, but you don't have to be).

Read just the first book, he makes up a meeting point with Harry for a duel, but does show up and maybe even trip off Flinch.
