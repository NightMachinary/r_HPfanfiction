Gryffindor's sword.

Can be pulled out of a hat. That's it.

Ravenclaws Diadem.

Makes someone more intelligent when worn.

Slytherins Locket.

has all kinds of powers of we know exactly zero or what we do know cannot separate from it being a horcrux.

Hufflepuff's Cup.

... its defined use on the wiki is horcrux (doesn't count) and a EATING UTENSIL AHHH.


** We know from canon that the Locket of Slytherin has a mirror inside where, as a Horcrux, the eye of Tom Riddle can be seen looking back at you. My theory, as used in my stories, is that it is enchanted with the same spell that Dumbledore used to hide the Philosopher's Stone in the Mirror of Erised: you can seal any object or person into the mirror-space. As [[/u/The_Wayland_Smith]] said, after all, IRL lockets are meant to hold things.

There's a theory out there that the Cup of Hufflepuff was the prototype for the dishes in Hogwarts that teleport the food directly from the kitchen. It can summon any food you wish for, from anywhere. It's not /exactly/ Conjuring food (which is still impossible) but is as close to it as it gets and a perfect defence against starving.

White Squirrel's /Lady Archimedes/ posited that the Diadem of Ravenclaw works by removing the barrier between conscious and subconscious. Thus if you have the right mental focus you can take in all of a situation in seconds Ã  la /Sherlock/, but if you put it on unprepared you'll just pass out from sensory overload (which is what happened to Helena).

(I don't think the Sword of Gryffindor needs to be made any stronger than it already is. It can already pierce Basilisk skin, absorb the magic of something as powerful as Basilisk venom, and be summoned from inside a Gringotts Vault. That's already /way/ OP.)

*** My only problem with that reasoning @ Gryffindor's sword is that all its powers comes from it being goblin made. This implies that there's nothing really special about the sword itself that makes it unique. Well, besides the way it's summoned, I suppose...

** Going by wizard logic for what they'd have these items do, I'd say:

Gryffindor's sword can cut/pierce anything, kinda like legendary swords were said to be able to do. Doesn't matter if it's enchanted to never break, or a shield charm, or dragon scales, the sword can cut through it.

Ravenclaw's diadem I feel like instead of just making someone smarter, it could enhance the user's intuition kinda like how Felix Felicis did where it nudged Harry into doing or saying something but was still within his capabilities. So the wearer would be struck with brilliant inspiration, would know a person at a glance, etc.

Slytherin's locket could possibly work as a portable prison since a locket holds images of people/a keepsake of a person inside, with it capable of absorbing someone either physically or just their soul and trapping them in the locket, like a precursor to Azkaban.

Hufflepuff's cup I assume was inspired by the old Celtic legendary items, so it could be any liquid the drinker desired would appear in the cup, and never run empty, but another legendary item was to reveal the good/worthy from the wicked/liars so maybe the drinker from the cup would get some kind powerful elixir to cure them/extend their life if they are worthy, but if they're unworthy they are poisoned or forced to reveal all their misdeeds.

*** Gryffindor's Sword being able to cut/pierce anything makes sense as its special unique power, with one exception -- it implies that it had no need to be imbued with Basilisk venom to destroy Horcruxes, which it does (or at least, it's heavily implied).

**** The description of horcruxes seemed to imply that their durability comes in part from magical self repair, so perhaps you could stab a horcrux with it, but it wouldn't destroy it, as soon as the blade comes out it would heal back up, but the basilisk venom means the damage can't be repaired without phoenix tears.

** I always wondered why Tom Riddle didn't just use the freaking diadem. Voldemort with a significant IQ boost would be way overpowered, so I assume that's why ... but logically he would have at least tried it on. Maybe he thought he was too intelligent to need it, but still. What an incredible resource, wasted on a Horcrux.

** *Gryffindor's Sword:*

- Absorbs magical powers (canon: Basilisk Venom, fanon: Elder Wand (Harry Crow), Dementor's Soul (could kill dementors afterward))
- Self-learning, i.e, the wielder learns how to use it
- Can be summoned by the heir of / true Gryffindor

*Ravenclaw's Diadem:*

- Increases mental capabilities while wearing, helpful in organizing the mind, learning Occlumency. In one story, Harry used it to access and store the memories from the hocrux in his scar.
- Teaches ancient charms

*Hufflepuff's Cup:*

- Can conjure food (either breaks the Gamp's Law, or summons them from somewhere)
- Turns water (or any liquid) into some sort of Elixir of Life, Felix Felicis, Veritaserum, Perfect Wolfsbane, etc (any great potion).
- Removes poison from liquids.

*Slytherin's Locket:*

- Protective Enchantments like against Legilimency, Mild Curses, Poison Detection etc
- Helps in parselmagic/parseltongue

** You could give them unique powers based on what they're known for.

Gryffindor's Sword - Comes when it's wielder calls it. Kind of a Dimensional Sheath so the "True Gryffindor" be that heir or wielder or whatever can always have it to hand when needed.

Ravenclaw's Diadem - Theoryhax. Basically whilst wearing it, you'll remember anything you read.

Slytherin's Locket - Immunity to Poisons. Glows when a Poison is detected nearby (Like if someone Potions your food)

Hufflepuff's Cup - Best one I've seen was a Potion's Amplifier, can't remember where. Like Wolfsbane drunk from Hufflepuff's cup would be permanent, that sort of thing.

** Sword absorbs powers and becomes stronger the more it defeats opponents. Can sometimes be used to shield from magical attacks and even an impomptu wand able to cast limited spells in a pinch.

Diadem increases intelligence... which is no small power [imagine a 50% boost to IQ and memory, going from 120 to 180 IQ is a big deal]. Also gives the wearer perfect occlumency and improved legillimency.

The cup is normally used as a potions purifier or multiplier. Make sure your drink isnt poisoned is very usefull for a ruler. only a small amount of mandrake restorative? no problem just chuck it in the cup and cure all the basilisk victims.

The locket is the least known, I would normally use it as a means for the wearer to speak parstletongue and thus able to get into slytherins secret locations. Also as a protective amulet that reflects back most low powered spells. Can also work as a magical sensing device allowing the wearer to know when magic has been cast nearby, if an item is enchanted etc.

** Gryffindor's sword is powerfull enough as a goblin made sword.

I always thought Ravenclaw's diadem as a perception amplifier of sorts - it does not give you new skills but enhances the ones you already have. Ravenclaw does not value onlly intelliigence but a thirst for knowledge, creativity, individuality... which would match with getting the best out of the wearer.

I think that Hufflepuff's cup has to have some kind of healing properties. It would be so in-character with loyal and kind hufflepuffs.

As for Slytherin's locket, I always wanted to believe that it hold the instructions to properly open the Chamber of Secrets, even though the timeline of Tom Riddle finding it doesn't match with the time when he opened the Chamber of Secrets and it bothers me a lot. It would make total sense that what the locket hold is the secret to Slytherin's ultimate weapon inside Hogwarts.\\
The locket itself can only be open by a parseltongue, meaning it would probably be opened by Slytherin's own descendants. A locket is meant to keep personal secrets and what's more personal to Slytherin than his basilisk - he owned a basilisk horn core wand, he could speak to snakes, he was the most private of the four founders so he made his own little chamber of being alone and unbothered.

** There was a fic that made the Diadem give people eidetic memory as its special power (hence improving intelligence by making people not forget any knowledge). That's a pretty simple and straightforward way for it to work, and pretty neat. It also made it completely useless for Hermione (who, in that fic, had eidetic memory entirely on her own).

** So I want to get my two cents in here even if it'll probably be buried.

I liked White Squirrel's depiction of the Diadem as removing limits on the mind, so in the same vein I think having the other items remove other sorts of limits would be fitting.

The Sword would remove your subconscious physical limits. You know stories of adrenaline-powered mothers lifting cars and stuff, but how about having that all the time? Would make it make more sense that a 12-year-old could punch through a basilisk with that. They'd probably also explode their arms a la One For All, though. Unless there was magical protection as well, which would make sense but that's a lot of enchantments.

The Cup purportedly lets the drinker not fear poison - but what if the real ability is allowing the user to digest and process anything? Poison, rocks, dirt - basically food is no longer a concern, all without breaking Gamp's law.

The Locket... I'm having trouble figuring that one out. It would be very Rowling if its ability was to remove moral limits, that's basically just saying Slytherin = inherently evil, but it could be an interesting way to explain Voldemort and the Gaunt Family. Doesn't explain Selwyn being a loser who just gets murdered by Voldemort as he takes it back, and Umbridge was already a bitch before getting near the locket.

** The Sword of Gryffindor is not only goblin made but also inset with rare gems that allow weilder to empower it with magic. It is said that if God stood before the empowered Gryffindor's Sword God would be cut.

Hufflepuff's Cup has been known by many names such as the Cup of Permance or the Face Stealer's Cup. Any potion drank from cup will permanently by applied to the user but said potion can only be applied permanently once. The potions that do not follow the rule are those that have different ingredients with each brew for example the Polyjuice Potion.

Many theorize that Slytherins Locket holds the intangible. It is inexplicably linked to his madness later in life. The hint of it's secret lies in the words he spoke when it was given as a gift to his wife. "In this Locket I give you all my love."

Ravenclaws Diadem is delicately crafted with a unique set of runes, fairy wings and mithril. It is stated in Ravenclaw's diary that it requires one with great will and intelligence to wear. The diadem allows wearer to see all divergences in the timeline for thirty seconds. Before it was lost Rowena Ravenclaw was the only successful wear and contributed to all of her greatest creations. All other wearers of the diadem were left comotose until their death.
