I just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10051784/1/Uchiha-of-Ravenclaw][Uchiha of Ravenclaw by Hebisama]] and am now wallowing in the depression of not having more of it to read. Despite not knowing or caring at all about Naruto I enjoyed it more than I ever would have guessed and I highly recommend it to anyone that thinks it sounds remotely interesting. I just wish it was like twice as long. :( It's probably a bit of a long shot but does anyone have some recommendations for similar types of stories? Doesn't need to be exactly the same - mainly looking for some combo of slice of life, friendship, some romance, coming of age type stuff. Anything that seems somewhat related really. Thanks!
