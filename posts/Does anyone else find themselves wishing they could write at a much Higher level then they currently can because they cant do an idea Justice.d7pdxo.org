I currently have an idea for something but Don't feel like I can do it justice at all. Its the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12272790/chapters/27893463][The Goblin's Debt]] challenge Not the Smut part but Instead the Goblins Using all the Powers that Helpful Goblins normal have but for evil. In the Goblin Debt Challenge the Goblins try to Get a Fem!Harry sign a contract and she goes to advisors but I want to explore the idea that the Goblins already got to her advisors first. the advisors being Hermione,Luna,Andromeda(I would also add Fleur).

*The idea is that the Goblin have already worked out who Fem!Harry would do to for advice and have already got them onside in getting Fem!Harry to sign the Contract*

Andromeda they use any resentment she has against Fem!Harry for the death of her Husband and Daughter and the Idea of raising her Grandson without Fem!Harry interference, Along with the contents of the Lestrange vault.(which my be mostly empty after Fem!harry,Hermione and Ron's escape from Gringotts

Hermione agreement to make Sure her and Ron are considered Guilt free for their part in helping to rob Gringotts along with Playing on her insecurities that Ron might pick Fem!Harry over her so they sell her on the Idea of getting Fem!harry out of the Picture for a few years.

Fleur they Play on the Fact that Bill and Fleur are both employed by Gringotts do the Goblins agree to Give Fleur and Bill promotions , Pay rises and tenure . Along with playing off Fleur Dislike of Fem!Harry(I don't see Fleur having a very good relationship with Fem!Harry compared to Canon harry).

Kingsley they use his responsibility as Minister against him by Agree to not Rebel while Fem!Harry is in their Custody(not that they wont be making Preparation to rebel even while Fem!HArry is in their Custody).

and Luna who they Play on any Anger that she has over what Happened to her father and the Rookery(with Luna mostly stay to make sure that Fem!Harry does not get screwed over to badly.)

So the Goblins get to Fem!Harry advisors and Kingsley and already Have the Parameters of the Contract they want Fem!Harry to sigh worked out by the Time in the part in the first Chapter of the Challenge happens with Kingsley Suggesting playing his Part and Send Fem!harry to what she thinks are trust worthy advisors(you would think that she would find it's suspicious that her advisors were already in a group waiting for her.

then her "advisors" fairly quickly Guide her into a agreeing to a Contract within the Parameters that they and the Goblins has already Agreed to.

with the part of the Challenge I am interesting in ending when Fem!Harry hand over her wand and enters Gringotts

I like the Idea that None of Fem!Harry Advisors are experienced in the wording of magical contract leading to mistakes

Like in the Challenge contact that they get Fem!harry to agree to they get " I will suffer no permanent harm, including but not limited to physical, mental, emotional, psychological, and financial damage and damage to my reputation." added to the contract but I like the Idea that that is the Goblins taking advantage of the inexperienced of Fem!harry and her advisors,because that doesn't restrict the Goblins nearly as much as what Fem!harry and her advisors think because 1. with magic their is not much that can't be healed and 2. they didn't set a time limit, so something that could take Fem!Harry decades to Recover from and have it technically not be permanent harm.

*How would you have Sneaking evil Goblins that have all their the stuff that their normal helpful counter parts have Screw Fem!Harry over in the Goblin debt challenge threw the Contract alone?*

for their own contacts the advisors kept it Simple they Help get Fem!Harry to Sign the Contract and then get their payment when Fem!Harry signs her contract. Fem!Harry Contract is a a lot longer leave more areas for the Golbins to screw her over.


** I take it the Goblins are using a passive magic effect similar to the effect that wearing the locket Horcrux had on the trio to increase the feeling of anger,resentment, insecurity,ect that Fem!Harry advises are feeling towards her?

As for friendly goblin tropes thing that could be used screw Fem!Harry over.

1.time dilation That is Normally used to help Harry turn into a super wizard over the summer could be used to extended the time Fem!harry is in their Goblins custody.

2.the Occlumency Ritual the friendly Goblin use to help fem!harry could be used to make sure that Fem!Harry never forgets.

3.The goblin had the philosophers stone in the bank for a time, if they learnt how to make them then the Elixir of life could be paired with Time dilation.

4.The Super goblin healer could be used to heal any damage done to Fem!Harry but I think OP already covered that.

Their Are more ways that friendly goblin use to Normally help Harry that I just can't remember right now.

** Literally every day

EDIT: Adding some "for examples"

For example, I've got this idea for a /Worm/ fanfic called "canon fodder" that's a series of one-shots. It takes all the names announced as deaths during Endbringer fights and gives you a little 5k-25k word peek into their life. Who were they? Why did they answer the call to fight an Endbringer? Some were heroes, some villains, some just trying to get by. But when humanity itself called out its desperate need, they answered, and paid the ultimate price.

I just can't think of enough good ideas and express them with emotional heft.

For example, I've got this idea for a /Game of Thrones/ fanfic about The Night King being reborn as Bran. I wrote the first two chapters ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-night-bran-got-peggy-sue-crack.768275/][first-draft-ish posted here]]) but it's just not as funny as I want it to be. I've written another two chapters but they're garbage and I can't get them to work.

For example, I've got this idea about a time-looping Harry that's a sequel to "Sisyphus," which is amazing and you can read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651][here]]. Sisyphus ends on a down note, and I've got the basic outline of how to write a sort of "second half" that wraps it back around to a happy-ish ending. But I can't do it justice.

For example, I've got this idea about a jumpchain-style protagonist who moves from one world to the next, and as he does so he gets plopped into the head of a main character. He gets all of that character's powers and even drags a wee bit of past powers with him. The catch is that he also brings the souls of all past characters along, and every single one of them is a fundamentally broken person.

So by the seventh or eighth jump, you've got this whole group of sad, broken men all living in a mental space together trying to find some growth or solace or way home or something. Sort of a /Twelve Angry Men/ or /Glengarry Glen Ross/ but instead of jurors or salesmen they're all struggling with how to cope with being stuck in the head of an eleven year old Harry Potter. And Harry's trying to figure out how to deal with the fact that he went from having basically no real family to having a whole bunch of fathers/older brothers overnight.

A terrible first draft of the first chapter is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-wandering-fanfic-si-harry-potter-multi-cross-worm-star-wars-etc.665851/][here]].

I get ideas all the time for self-insert fics but where the SI ends up in the body of someone who makes them into an impaired person. So they're not the stereotypical fix-fic-speed-run protagonist. Instead, they struggle with the addiction or disability of the body and brain they get plopped in to. For example, having to [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/must-love-dogs.612788/][think with a dog's brain]] or having to deal with a [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/an-unfortunate-insertion-worm-squealer-si.694075/][hideously drug-addicted]] body (both /Worm/ stories).

Unfortunately, these are both stupid and not executed terribly well. The dog one was fun to write and had a few funny moments that I'm actually proud of having written and enjoy re-reading, but overall they're just... /bad/ compared to the beautiful castle in the sky that only exists in my head.

** Every writer started off as shit. Honestly, there's nothing for it but to keep at it and put yourself out there. Write, find people (either in person or online) who are interested in reading it and have them critique and comment on your writing. I've taken creative writing classes in college just for fun, and that was basically all it was.

Its a pretty common experience for fanfiction writers to look back on stuff they wrote years back and be embarrassed by how bad it is (I certainly have). But really, that's a good thing, because it shows just how much better you've gotten.
