I'm looking for a fix I read a while ago where Harry is reborn into the Game of Thrones universe. He is born in Essos and is selected to marry Rhaegar through an arranged marriage. He is brought to Westeros by Steffon Baratheon. He is the master of death in this fic as he is trained and has control of the faceless men. He goes on a tour of Westeros with Rhaegar where they eventually marry and take over the 7 kingdoms after Aerys dies. Might be helpful to note that this is a mpreg story as well. Any help would be appreciated.


** I have no idea about the fic, especially seeing as I'm not into slash, but you should know, 'Request' is when you want recommendations from people. In your case, it should be 'What's that Fic?'
