It just seems too strange that Mr. Riddle did not use nuclear weapons.


** He wanted to rule over the wizarding world not utterly destroy it

*** He can use it on Muggles. After all, it seems that Wizarding Britain is limited to London and a few small magical settlements like Hogsmeade and Godric's Hollow. So, that leaves plenty of cities like Manchester, Coventry, Liverpool, e.t.c, highly populated muggle cities with negligible Wizarding population .

** One word, Fiendfyre. Any situation where the use of Nuke would be justified (so when you want a total destruction), you can reach the same, if not better, results with Fiendfyre.\\
Also, why bother stealing and transporting a nuke when you only need the wand you only carry around to use Fiendfyre? And the fact that Fiendfyre is able to bypass, or rather destroy most magical protection (which is far from sure for Nukes, since in the end it's still a muggle thing), may also have played a role in why it is inferior.

** Here's one where Voldemort uses nukes against multiple muggle cities. He also takes over Al-Qaida and gets the anti-wizard religious extremist terrorists to target the wizards he wants them to target. North Korea is also easily taken over with some polyjuice and a few Imperios, and provides a sample of enriched uranium which is easily magically duplicated for hundreds of nukes.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
