Can be very close to canon or pretty AU, even crossover is fine.

I don't care which dirty tricks the story uses to make me tear up, as long as it is readable.

Suggestions?


** Stage of Hope starts out a comedy and devolves into something much sadder and darker, with basically realistic consequences for having a bunch of teenagers fighting a losing war, and suddenly being transported to a much better off universe. I've read it many times and I still cry during Hermione's last conversation with Snape.

[[/spoiler]["You're stronger then I or your Snape ever were."]]

*** Sad story, but I don't find it depressing.

After Luna told Remus the true story, things start getting better.

As the title says, the story has hope, and eventually they get there.

**** True, but it does get getting increasingly depressing the longer they go on. Especially considering how funny it starts off with. Reading chapter one you would, for the most part think it was crack.

** linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty). If you're fine with femslash, this Bellatrix/Hermione story is great for what you're looking for. It starts out meekly, then builds up to what you think is going to be a nice happy ending, then it pulls the rug out from under you 3/5 of the way through. The last 2/5 of the story is basically trying to pick up the shattered pieces.
