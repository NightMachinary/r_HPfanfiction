#+begin_quote
  After his adventure in the Department of Mysteries, Harry finds a new power over air which gives him confidence. He's "live and let live" until you come after him, then watch out. This starts just after the revelation of the prophecy at the end of book5.

  Harry decided that the only way he can win this war with his sanity intact is to train his own way without interference. But then he discovers an ability that he needs help with and only one person can provide that-Tonks. They bring the fight to the DEs in their own way so that the war will finally end.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** If you liked those two, you'll probably enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning]] by Swimdraconian. It is a bit of clusterfuck, as the author introduced a ton of different magical shit, but so far he's handled it very well. Has that bleak, gritty outlook, heavy use of dark magic and dark creatures and generally apocalyptic atmosphere (though apocalyptic towards how much Harry is fucked, not the world getting destroyed).

It's aged a bit (ok a lot) but I think you'll like linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure by jbern). Try to stomach the 2nd person point of view, it gets better. It has all sorts of good things: ancient cities, magical secrets, demons, treacherous goblins and Harry learning, and most importantly applying all sorts of magic and mayhem.

And for something completely different: linkffn(In Blood Only by E.M Snape). This is a Severitus - Snape is Harry's actual father - but unlike all other such stories, they /don't/ get along. At no point. This story will kick you in the head and when you think you're getting respite, it will punch you for good measure, it's that depressing. But very well written.

**** Hm don't remember about the Snape/Lily thing. It's more than 5-6 years since I last read In Blood Only.

Stronger than Hope is probably the best mentor!Snape story around. Both he and Harry are relatively in character, while the plot is interesting and the pacing fluid. I'd rate it 4, maybe 4.5/5.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]

  OotP AU. Dark magic, Death Eaters, politics - and in the middle of it all, Harry Potter. Tested against enemies old and new, he learns that power requires sacrifices, revenge, doubly so. No slash, no bashing, Crouch Sr is alive. Book One of Dark Triad Trilogy.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
