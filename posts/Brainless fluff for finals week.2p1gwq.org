Anyone know any fics that make you go awww without needing to do much focusing or 'getting into' the story? Preferably longer ones, preferably sans het?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]] is always a good one.

Alternatively, if you're willing to entirely shut down your brain for about a week and then contemplate suicide once that haze of blissful idiocy is over, try any of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/263365/slytherin-nette][slytherin-nette's]] works. I'd start with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1670793/1/The-Perfect-Girl][Perfect Girl]].

Sorry, but are you not willing to leave it as an hypothetical of ending your life and look to finish the job? Look no further! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7868754/1/Behind-the-Veil][Behind the Veil]] will get you there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771/1/Partially-Kissed-Hero][But wait, there's more!]].

For real though, if you haven't read Make a Wish or other works by Rorschach's Blot, give them a try.

*** Thank you for your suggestions ^{^} I've actually tried reading all of them except behind the veil, which I'm looking at now and which doesn't seem to be the lightest reading in the world. Perfect girl was really funny. But, I'm not sure why anyone would feel guilty about reading fanfiction? I feel like, if you enjoyed it, it did its job, right?

**** Because you have to mold your mindset to a certain form to enjoy some of these stories.

And some of that mindset tend to stick with you.

** One of my favourites is Corresponding Follies by EnglishMuffin2.

It's slash, Harry/Sirius

It isn't available anywhere but I /do/ have a copy for download.

[[https://mega.co.nz/#!A9wFXIyC!4pdMg5p4f1s3uhVYjXmPN-PPV0j3ucH80wbiF2jrKso][Here is the MEGA link.]]

It isn't an epub or even a pdf so to read it just open in with your browser and read it like normal.
