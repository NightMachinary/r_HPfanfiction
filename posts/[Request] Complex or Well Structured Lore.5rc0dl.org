I am looking for fics that are more detailed in their construction of the society and lore/complexity surrounding magic. Whilst I always loved JKR's originals for their story as a self contained work, I feel like the exploration of myth and legends with the knowledge of magic is incredibly interesting. Having read fics like Circular Reasoning, Denarian Knight and the subsequent series, found here: linkffn(2680093;3856581;3473224;4359957), I love the concept of complex or extremely powerful Amoral beings that are more closely aligned to magic than to the regular world. I feel like it adds a "Always a bigger fish" mindset, which makes interactions between characters interesting. Having also read Blindness, MOR and Wastelands of Time, I enjoyed the complexity of the magic being used. I was wondering if there were any other longer fics (75K+) that were complete or regularly updated which are similar? I don't mind crossovers, but I would prefer for them to focus more on the characters from HP, than other story arcs, instead just using their ideas as a basis of unique or complex magic. Thanks!

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.
