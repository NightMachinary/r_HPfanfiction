Are there any good fics out there where Harry actually /wants/ to become immortal?

There are plenty of stories where he is immortal but doesn't care. I want one where he actually wants to become immortal.

*** Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about. The one where Harry is basically Stein from Soul Eater right? Yeah, he becomes immortal but later regrets it, so I don't think it counts.
