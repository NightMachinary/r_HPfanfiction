Does anyone know any good harry is raised by creepy pasta. Specifically ones where he's really close to Ticci Toby or has things that make him stand out during the sorting (Mabey he has blood flowing from his eyes like sally or BEN or a part of his cheek missing like toby or he's cannibalistic like eyeless jack). Any fics where he is raised by creepy pasta and like to murder people works with me. -_-

  Something about this pasta seemed...wrong. Maybe it was the fact that the sauce, while smelling of tomatoes, looked uncannily like human blood. Maybe it was the fact that the entire bowl consisted of one impossibly long noodle, spread out in shapes that looked oddly like nooses and bullwhips. Maybe it was the fact that the dish itself radiated an aura of menace and terror.

Literal creepy pasta from Infinite Pokemon Loops, chapter 15.

  Harry Potter's uncle goes too far and a broken, bleeding Harry is left in his cupboard. However, he is rescued and taken in by our favorite, faceless entity in a suit; Slenderman. How will Hogwarts deal with a corrupted Harry Potter? Harry Potter x Creepypastas. Dark-ish!Harry. Teen for general Creepypasta goodness and language. Manipulative Dumbledore and Weasley Bashing.

  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.
