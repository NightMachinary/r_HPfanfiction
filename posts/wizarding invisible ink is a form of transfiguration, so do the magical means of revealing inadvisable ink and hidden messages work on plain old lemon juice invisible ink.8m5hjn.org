** I imagine revealing inadvisable ink is probably not the best idea.

****** a. "What good does that do anyone?"

b. "Well you see I've developed the habit of writing my ideas down. If I can actually write it that mean's it's a bad idea and should not be done."

a. "So that notebook of ideas that was stolen..."

b. "I fear that the thief may be in for an unpleasant time if they attempt any of them."

*** Inadvisable ink is the type of thing I keep reading fanfiction for. Now I want someone to put it in a story. Have sometime write an essay with it, only to have it turn out to insult the professor. Using that ink is inadvisable.

** Depends. If it's merely a reversal of the transfigured ink, then no, it wouldn't do anything.

But apparently spells can work on some pretty abstract concepts, so if it's a charm that works under the principle of revealing hidden writing, then it would reveal lemon juice invisible ink since it's just hidden writing. It would likely have an easier time of it than magical invisible ink, since there's no magic to overcome to make it revealed. (it would also reveal writing that's been painted or scribbled over, or the old blue/red trick where you need the special glasses to see the text)
