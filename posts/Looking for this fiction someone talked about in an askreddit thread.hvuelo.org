Might not be your thing, but there is a really good fanfiction out there that starts right after the final battle. It's not a major plot point nor are they the main characters, but Fred comes back as a ghost and reading the interactions he has with everyone made me smile.

***** I think so.

The main thrust of the story is that Kingsley tricks Harry into taking a super-traumatizing test that makes him Supreme Benevolent Wizard Dictator, aka “Auror Commander” who can arrest whom ever he wants and fire any auror he wants (generally aurors can't be fired by Minister, DMLE, Head Auror, or Wizengamot).

Harry fucks off to Japan to recover from his post-war, post-test PTSD. He comes back after a year or so and assumes his post. It's a complete story but does have a sequel that I never read.

  The morning after defeating Voldemort, Harry finds he wants nothing more than to be left alone. However, angry goblins, dementors, and a well-meaning Minister make this impossible, imposing on Harry more responsibilities than he wants... and then some.
