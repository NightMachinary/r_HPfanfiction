** There was a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/90hvz8/infuriating/][post]] about this a few hours ago.

The author's just being a dickhead. Monetising fanfiction, for all intents and purposes, is illegal if anybody who owns the rights to Harry Potter get ahold of it.

While not withholding chapters for money, Yudkowsky, the author of HPMOR, tried putting his story through "official" channels. Naturally, this got shut down pretty easily, and now he just uses it to promote his shady charity.

  shady charity.

Wait, I though it was a research institute? A debatably efficient research institute, but a research institute nonetheless, not a charity. Unless I'm getting things mixed up?

By the way, gotta love your flair.

** Hasn't this been the case for a couple years now? It's a shitty thing to do, because fanfiction pretty much only exists because of the goodwill of the actual authors.

** It's not held hostage, it's just abandoned. I don't think he ever posted another chapter after the patreon thing, even though he got a lot of money through patreon.

My pet theory is that he got ass-blasted by JKRs lawyers and had to sign a cease&desist with an NDA in order not to be sued.

*** He got commitments for money from patreon, which pay out per chapter. Since he didn't put out any more chapters I don't think he got paid.

*** If that happened the story probably would've had to be taken down though, right?

** Iirc he had a fair bit more than that at some point but still didn't deliver. That amount is after something like 3 years absence at this point.
