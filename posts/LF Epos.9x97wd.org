And by Epos I mean stories that feature actual grand plots and heroic, legendary deeds. Not the poem :)

I don't wanna read another Slash-for-Slashs-sake story. I am tired of FemHarry-selfinserts, I am done with FemHarry's boinking old men like SS or Tom Riddle/Voldemort. I want to read what the original books are about: fantasy! -

So please, give me your best Epos! No matter the length, throw them at me!

​

All the best, and have a nice day

-Syg


** Amen.

Very hard to find something interesting when all you can see in the updated section is pretty much all you mentioned.

*** Indeed. I understand that not everyone shares my desires just as I dont share theirs, but I feel recently the good stories (in my opinion) arent updated as much as the "others".

** Linkffn(the odds were never in my favor) Linkffn(Prince of slytherin)

Both of those are fairly long, look to go longer. Odds is fem!harry with some fairly epic deeds both by the mc and others. Deep plots and shadowing starting to move. James potter take place of Sirius black and Lily died to a mob rather than the V-man. Neville is boy who lived.

Princes is all about a long spanning interwoven and ever deepening plot. As has a very interesting regulus black. It's a wbwl, twin potters, so shady dealing to result in Harry's placement with dursleys.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Eventual Gideon Prewett/Harry Potter. Tags will be updated when it becomes relevant. Updated every Saturday.

  It starts because Harry can't stop being a good person. To leave his adventuring past behind, Harry moves to Gryffindor District, Hogwarts in order to open up a new item shop. Somehow that leads to being held at sword point by a handsome-but-extremely-rude Tom Riddle. As far as business relationships go, Harry supposes there are worse starts.

  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.

  Unspeakable Granger wakes up with missing memories in Hogwarts...in 1942. Hermione might not remember much, but she knew that even post-Voldemort, there were many wannabe dark lords she and her friends had to fight against. The world wasn't automatically sunshine and roses just because they've defeated Voldemort. Also, go back? What go back? She doesn't even know how she got here, there's no guarantee there's a safe way to jump forward!Yet the possibilities that are open to her...if she could change the wizarding world half a century earlier, maybe they'd be more prepared against dark lords in the future. Perhaps a better world for the friends she'd left. With this in mind, Hermione Curie (Granger) sets out to use her field healer and master arithmancer abilities to the fullest (if she had to invent a couple of things earlier than they actually happened in her old future, so be it). Not to mention that in her very-biased-opinion, the wizarding world needs to be dragged out of its old prejudices, kicking and screaming if necessary. But who is that particular prefect? Her mind itches at seeing him...

That doesn't seem incompatible with a fantasy epic?...

*** All FemHarry-Selfinserts I have read so far are rather boring because they usually just re-tell the Canon story with a haughty FemHarry that acts like she knows everything already. Most FemHarry-Selfinserts then hook up with a character that had a goodlooking actor in the movies and there we have it, the average Self-Insert story.

If you happen to find one that does not feature such a plot, feel free to let me know.

**** linkffn(The Fight For Rights) has a very fresh take on the Potterverse and a female-Harry, despite its being obvious that she's /partially/ based on the author. No shipping. No Stations of Canon (it's post-Hogwarts). Lots of adventure.
