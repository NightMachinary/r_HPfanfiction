Not one that involves any characters from the books, but characters descended from them say 200 years or more down the line, and not centered on hogwarts?


** I'd be interested in what you have planned. I have something like that on my harddrive.

In my story the magical society struggles because they have problem recruiting muggleborns and half-bloods to join the magical society. Knowledge vanished due to nobody using it, massive energy outputs from fusion-reactor driven powernetworks destroy wards and make brooms fall from the sky. Some muggleborns are stuck in VR worlds, and halfbloods often find the work with genetics and nanotechnology more interesting than magic. The ones the magical world can recruit are often from the slums and are very prone to use their abilities against the muggle nations that made them live in the dirt.

I've never continued writing it due to the massive worldbuilding effort required. So whats your story about?

*** Without giving too much, the struggle the wizarding world would have with a voldemort like figure after an extended peace, and likely disarmement due to the extended peace.

**** How does disarmement work in a society where every child got a lethal weapon on his/her body 24/7 from age 11 up?

******* No, in the books there are classes that teach basic defense, as well as a highly influental and respected auror office(nevermind magical law enforcement) i say influental and respected as two aurors in the books became ministers one right after the other(puppet minister not counting) and one who was poised for minister had his son not been a nutter.

But as a government 300 years down the line, nothing even close to the scale of voldy has happenend since, and the minor issues are easily handled by magica law enforcements, would you keep properly funding a school for defense teachers, nevermind a highly trained unit, as well as pay them pretty well for doing jack all? Nah you wouldnt.

******** Its still not exactly plothole free. The point stands: Everybody walks around with a lethal weapon that has the potential to unleash unthinkable destruction. All it takes to rearm is to read a book.

And yes, you would pay Defense Teachers. After all, you need a police force. You need people who can deal with dark creatures. You need cursebreakers. You need Unspeakables and the list goes on.

And even if theres nothing like a Voldi happening, there will always be bad guys. And the Aurors, at least in canon, weren't exactly highly trained supersoldiers. Neither was the Order. They were a police force. The Order was a bunch of civilians who had good marks in DADA.

So, what you're saying is that in your world there is no need for anyone to defend himself at any given point. There are no more vampires, werewolves, dark wizards or other stuff that wants to rip you apart, curse your or steal your soul. Because that is the only szenario where I can see the DADA position to go away.

********* Ill answer this a bit better when i get off work, but aurors are more like the swat team highly trained. Magical law enforcement dealt with everyday issues and is even stated in the books more than once.

********** The Aurors /are/ the magical law enforcement. WIMR they are even described as "wizard cops". And the point is moot, because law enforcement is trained in D(ADA) as well!

I don't want to put you off writing this, the premise sounds really interesting, but IMHO this is a part where you might want to think about a bit more! Keep the work up!

*********** No they arent they are a sub dept. Thats like saying a detective is a traffic cop. They have different skill sets and jobs standard MLE are just that standard cops. Aurors are highly trained. In PoA i belive it is Harry even asks Arthur if theyd send aurors after him for blowing up his aunt, aurthur laughs, and says no regular law enforcement would handle a situation like that were it a real issue.

Wait no i think it was oop when arthur tells him of the regurgitating toilets sorry.
