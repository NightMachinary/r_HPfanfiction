I really like these three together, but there isn't much out there that's good and finished (or frequently updated). Most of the time when an author adds Tonks to the HHR pairing, they also add a few other girls (Fleur and Daphne are very popular too). I don't mind that, but the triad is what I'm looking for now.

â€‹

Any rec's you have would be great. I would also read Harry/Hermione/any other girl. Triads can be fun, but seem to get over shadowed by harems.


** You might try /Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass/ by Temporal Knight. If I recall correctly, it's technically just Harry/Tonks, but pre-Harry/Tonks/Hermione. The author suggested that she/he would write a sequel, but that hasn't yet been started so far as I know. linkffn(12188150)

*** Even though it isn't a triad yet, there are some great moments where it becomes obvious that the three of them deeply care about each other. This makes Grains of Sand the best triad fic I know despite never actually getting to the sexual part of the triad but sticking to the emotional half of the deal.

*** Sadly, I've already read that one. It was great, I've read it twice actually. Maybe need to read it again.
