  {DONE!} What drove Hogwarts' most brilliant student to become its greatest foe? Step into a mind that has failed to see past the darkness, and watch the chilling memories that were poured into Tom Riddle's diary resurface...

Written between 2001 and 2003, so not all the knowledge we have about Tom Riddle now was available at that stage (e.g. the Horcrux).

** I always like recommending linkffn(Witchcraft by a Picture), though Voldemort isn't the protagonist. The first few chapters are a little sappy and boring, but the development of Tom/LV is good in my opinion.

  If you think that Hogwarts was squeaky clean in the 1940's, think again. Sex, drugs, violence, love, jealousy, and a bit of murder? Welcome to Hogwarts! Tom Riddle/OC, Alphard Black/OC, OC/OC. Rated M

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List][The Evil Overlord List]] is pretty good. Its AU with Riddle having a genre savvy voice in his head.
