:END:
I remember reading this a few years ago, and I haven't been able to find it since. Unfortunately, I don't remember what site I read it on or the character's name, but all I remember is that the main character had an aunt called Alice and it had a tragic ending. I have an inkling that it was on Quotev because I was on that website religiously during this time, but I still can't find it. Thank you!
