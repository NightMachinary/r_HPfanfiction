I've been hunting for this specific story for hours and still no luck..tho I've found more to read lol. My last hope is posting here in the hopes someone knows what story I'm talking about lol. I'm also interested in any good dark lord Harry or Harry/Tom pairings as well.

It's a story about Harry growing up in a sense maturity wise and finding family frimiore bout tunic tattoos which he has borgin paint them on using basilisk venom and he's also one of the seven which rule over the ministry so to speak and it's a Harry daphne pairing iirc he also gets into a dual with Ron and Ron uses a dark spell to sever Harry's arm which Harry uses one of his tunic tats to regrow said arm
