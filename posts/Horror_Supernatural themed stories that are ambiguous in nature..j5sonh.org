I want to read spooky atmospheric Harry Potter stories were the Horror isn't in your face but still mysterious and eerie. My motto is that less is more! Don't like gore or overly tragic stories. But just unsettling transcendental or even Lovecraftian in nature. So subtly and aesthetically scary.


** The horror in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8446057/chapters/19350271][On a Pale Horse]] might not be subtle enough for your tastes, but definitely delivers on that Lovecraftian/eldritch abomination vibe you're looking for.

  Fueled by curiosity and tempted by power, Iris Potter delves into magic far older and sinister than the kind they teach at Hogwarts. When she stumbles into a world filled with dark gods and primordial entities, she realizes that she's gambling with so much more than just her life. Eventually powerful Fem!Harry. Fifth Year AU.

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

  The Patronus charm requires a happy memory. Harry Potter doesn't have many, and the Dementors get Sirius, after all.But the story is far from over.

***** It really is! I wasn't expecting the ending either it was fantastic. Thank you for all of the great recommendations! If you like stuff like this and haven't read these stories I want to recommend them to you.

1Quo Vadis? It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way (oneshot that is very chilling) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5614134/1/Quo-Vadis]]

2) The Eyes ¬ª Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. (Very eerie and well written)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9767473/1/The-Eyes]]

3) The Serpent and the Mirror ¬ª Dr. Dumbledore suspects that Harry's hallucinations about Hogwarts and the Dark Lord hold the clues to a terrible family secret. What are the Potters hiding? And what is Harry's relationship to the shadowy Voldemort? Now COMPLETE. (Not exactly horror but very mysterious and has a big twist in the end)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6034766/1/The-Serpent-and-the-Mirror]]

4) Leviathan Rising Set in Gof, what if Harry had found a way to overcome the second task? What if while searching through the library he came across an insignificant seeming little book that teaches him the magic he needs?
