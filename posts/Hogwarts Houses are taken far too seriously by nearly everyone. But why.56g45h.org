I have read very few stories in which there is a character who points out how your Hogwarts house does not define you for life. Why is this a rare concept? It seems so many writers and readers alike are fixated on the Houses, and the traits that supposedly decide which is a best fit for you. "He/she is a Gryffindor/Slytherin/Hufflepuff/Ravenclaw" is used as an insult in some shape or form in many stories. It baffles me! Houses are often used to stereotype a large group of growing teenagers as if their House is tattooed on their foreheads, headlining their resumes, and essentially a huge part of your life in the big picture.

And yet, nobody ever says anything. By extension my issue with this includes the stupid house points system. Behave a certain way/excel in your studies/do normal teenager shit and be awarded the House Cup. What benefits does your house gain? The banners in the Great Hall bearing your house colors for one feast? "Bragging rights"? Oh yeah we won the house cup! Take that, evil slytherins who were evil from the moment their eleven year old selves were sorted!

Anyway, incoherent and unorganized rant over. Houses are stupid. People who place excess importance on Houses (both in universe and out) are stupid.


** We had a 'house' system in my school, lots of British schools do, even my nephews who are at 2 different schools both have houses. I was in the green house and that meant we had our lockers outside the classroom on the left one year then inside the classroom on the left in the next (we were 10-12) and that was it.

What happens though is you end up spending a portion of your day with these people and apart from the others and an incredible us vs them mentality builds. We even assigned personality traits to various houses that I'm sure were random, blue house was musical, green was academic, yellow was sporty and red was kind of useless (hufflepuff).

Not that it matters in the end as the only one I'm still friends with was from red house but if I'm ever talking about or bump into anyone from school then I will instantly remember what house they were in and the same goes for the others.

(We had houses again when 14-16 years old as well with separate 'study areas' and that was even more devisive. I ended up drifting apart from a best mate because his designated study area was a 2 minute walk away from mine. There were prank wars and a fair few fights between those houses.)

*TL;DR: Humans are pathetic, create an artificial divide and we will embrace it wholeheartedly.*

** I think houses are taken too seriously because of how Slytherin students are portrayed in the books. Hufflepuffs are only thought of as duffers because of two lines said by Draco and Hagrid in PS.

People in general like to categorise things. Putting people into houses (boxes) makes it "easier" to sort out somebody's personality when that is not at all the case seeing as people are made up of all the houses characteristics.

Then there's house loyalty.

I like Helga. I like to think that she was anti-Sorting, and anti-segregation. I like to think that quote is her thinking, well, Godric's claiming the brave, Rowena the smart, Salazar the (pureblood) ambitious, and if I claim something else, like the empathetic, then there will be students who are averagely intelligent, and content with that, and will never quite belong to a house and will always feel left out and excluded from Hogwarts. So I won't put anything on my house, everyone is welcome at Hogwarts, so everyone is welcome in my house.

The hat even calls her 'Good'.

Parchment remains a luxury good in the Muggle world.

Magical Quills that correct your spelling etc are rather more advanced than Muggle pens.

Sending letters by owl seems to be quicker and more direct than sending letters by Muggle post as an owl will find the recipient wherever they are.

In any case your whole idea of "advanced" seems to be strange. Clothes are just fashion. There's no such thing as advanced fashion, it's all just social trends. You seem to be defining "advanced" as "Muggle" which is patently circular.

My headcanon is that the hat places you based on what you value, not what you are. As a part of growing up, many people do become what they look up to (especialyl when surrounded by people with the same mindset).

That's the only way I can explain Neville, Hermione, Draco, etc (without giving the hat some "future potential seeing" power). Also the fact that the hat is supposed to find abstract qualities in 11 year olds.

[I assume you meant 'elevation'?]

Which is already status quo: The Purebloods are in total control of the government already. Destabilizing said government to put in a Tyrant isn't at all conducive to ambitious goals. Not to mention that the Terrorism also destabilizes the economy.

There is very little chance to become influential under Voldemort's rule, unless you totally abandon your personal goals (which would also be anti-ambition). A proper Slytherin who seeks power would want to become Minister for Magic and not one of Voldemort's lackeys. A proper Slytherin who wants to get rich would oppose Voldemort. A proper Slytherin who wants to become popular and prominent has absolutely no reason to support Voldemort, because most people don't like Dark Wizards.

It's really dumb for an ambitious person to be a Death Eater and I'm not even getting into the whole issue with possibly dying on a failed Death Eater raid (death is also pretty bad for your ambitions).

** I think people just need to Overhaul the house system. Gryffindor/Slytherin/Hufflepuff/Ravenclaw, all these houses need to mean something. (Also think the mascots of the houses need to change, Dragon/Basilisk for Slytherin, Griffin/Phoenix for Gryffindor, Fairy for Hufflepuff, Sphinx/Centaur for Ravenclaw.

**** It's a magical school smart one, of course they need to mean something. Are you that stupid to think that a magical school would implement a house system just so they can be like their muggle counterpart? Of course not.

***** And it's exactly this thinking that circles round to OP's point. Congratulations, I guess.

Like I've noted elsewhere Houses are not a magical thing, any more than freaking pumpkin juice is.

I don't think the houses really mean anything magical. It's just 4 different groups that represent a different thing.

***** Are you that stupid that you think that dividing up kids into different sections to make it easier to schedule smaller classes is an idea that is only useful in the muggle world?

****** Dividing classes? Are you dumb? There are like 40 kids in one year, in a castle that is so big, not even the headmaster knows everything about it. If they needed to divide classes they wouldn't need a magical hat to do it, obviously it has some purpose, smart one.
