Fics where Harry travels back and dumbledore isn't an evil or a manipulative bastard No slash (not counting dumbledore/grindlewald) no fem Harry no bashing


** Dumbledore is basically good, but kept at arm's length out of fear that he would bulldoze other people's wishes in his quest to do what he thinks best, in Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past.

Since it was deleted by FFN, the only place I know of to get up to chapter 43 is [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]]

** Dumbledore is good in these time travels:

A Little Child Shall Lead Them, linkffn(10871795): 20 years old Hermione goes back to her 2 years old self, tells everything to Dumbledore the next day, who then takes things from there. It's my poster fic for how Peggy Sue time travels should be done.

Delenda Est, linkffn(5511855): Harry is thrown back to 1975 and has to team up with Bellatrix. It's Harry who doesn't trust him at beginning, but Dumbledore is surprisingly cooperative later. He even sends Hermione to apprentice under Bellatrix.

Many Thanks, linkffn(4692717): A unique Hermione time travel narrated from James Potter's POV, and she's mostly takes care of things in the background with Dumbledore.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

**** Oh. I read it a long time ago and remembered that it had time travel with Dumbledore involved and helpful pretty early. But yeah it has its issues.

I think there's another time travel to Dumblerdore's school days fic that I came across. Dumbledore seems pretty okay with some flaws in there but who knows where it's going.

I think it's linkao3(Weeping Angel)

And there's another I read recently but Dumbledore doesn't really show up much and he's not bad but not particularly helpful either. However, Harry seems in character and it's a cool concept.

Linkao3(Resurrect the living)

It's been a while since I read time travel in HP universe so I think I've forgotten a fair amount of Time Travel stories. You might want to check out ao3. Tag system is pretty good. You can filter using time travel and good Albus Dumbledore or something. Or just filter out Manipulative/Evil Albus Dumbledore.

  The fiasco at the Department of Mysteries had many consequences. One accident with a time-turner sent Harry to a faraway past. But who can really he rely on in this farce of home? And should he really trust Albus Dumbledore to have his best interests at heart?Harry was going to go back to his time. Back to 1996. He was going to go back to the Department of Mysteries. He was going to save his friends, and everybody in his time whose existence is being threatened.But how? At what price?And what will be left of him in the end?
