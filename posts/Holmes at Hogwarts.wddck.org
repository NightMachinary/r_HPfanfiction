Are there any fics out there where Holmes is a student at Hogwarts?


** Not that I know of but there /is/ one where Harry imitates Sherlock (violin, deductions and all) but I can't for the life of me remember what it's called.

If I remember I'll let you know.

****** I'm not sure if I ever got through it, can't remember if it was finished when I started, will have to go back and look.

** Note: I'm a Sherlock fangirl, so these are all based on Sherlock (BBC). If you wanted ACD Holmes, they are probably not exactly what you're looking for.

[[http://writingispurdy.livejournal.com/14958.html][The Magic of Deduction]]: Follow John and Sherlock through their seven years at Hogwarts. With lots of Sherlock-characters.

[[http://rachelindeed.livejournal.com/10054.html][The Almost Empty House]]: In my opinion better than The Magic of Deduction, but, yeah, basically the same summary. Shorter, though.

[[http://pandarus.dreamwidth.org/354061.html][The Case of the Unwelcome Owl]]: Where Sherlock /didn't/ go to Hogwarts, but is Luna's cousin. (And that is almost as good, isn't it?)

** Sherlock Holmes is not a student at Hogwarts in this one, but this is a great Holmes/HP crossover. There is at least one sequel you can find on the author's page. Not the current Sherlock set in modern times, alas, but based on the literary Sherlock Holmes, still awesome, so it involves a wee bit of time travel.

** Well, of course you meant Sherlock. Sorry, with all the news about Katie Holmes, my mind went there and never came back. Anyway, I see fanfiction.net carries HP-Sherlock crossover stories. You might start [[http://www.fanfiction.net/Harry_Potter_and_Sherlock_Crossovers/224/7190/][here]].

**** Thought you meant John at first. Guess I know where my head's at.

A 2-minute search yielded the following three crossover fics: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7368815/1/][/The Butterfly Effect/]], [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7311801/1/Whispers_in_Corners][/Whispers In Corners/]], and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7311801/1/Whispers_in_Corners][/A Study in Magic/]].
