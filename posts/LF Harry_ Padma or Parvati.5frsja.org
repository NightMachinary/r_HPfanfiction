I'm looking for a decent post Hogwarts fic where Harry ends up meeting either Parvati or Padma Patil. Most fics tend to go through the apologies for the Yule ball debacle I'd love to see a fic that doesn't have that. Or a good DH fic that has Harry interacting with one or both of them.


** linkffn(Sword of the Hero) has Harry/Padma to start with.

  The Hero Trilogy, Part One. After the tragedy of his fifth-year, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts and to a war that will shake the Wizarding and Muggle worlds to their very core. Peace rests on the edge of a sword, and on the courage of Harry alone.
