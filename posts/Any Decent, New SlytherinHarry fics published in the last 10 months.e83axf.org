Or really obscure Slytherin Harry fics, stuff that hasn't been listed here a hundred times.


** linkao3(20049589) has Harry re-sorted into Slytherin before the start of fifth year. It's been decent so far, at the very least.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

**** I'd recommend you read it! Even I don't like resorting gifs. But once I moved past the resorting in the fic, I totally loved this story.

  Hermione Granger is special. She has always known it, really, even before she received her letter. It was too bad that she had never met anyone as special as her, but she was hoping that would change now that she was going to Hogwarts. And she wasn't wrong, because the moment she laid eyes on Harry Potter she just knew he was very special indeed. Obsessive!Hr, Slytherin!HHr

** Mine :)

Jk it's not decent, or is it? I just started mine so he's not in Slytherin yet, but it's in the tags that he's gonna be Slytherin sooooo....I don't know if this fits the criteria. Search up my name on AO3 or FFN if you're interested in works in progress.
