Hi, all. Recently completed my first fanfiction and looking for feedback. It's the first story of a planned series about the Founders of Hogwarts, written like a historical fiction, whilst merging HP lore with real historical and mythological people and events. Needs tidying a bit but it's all up there so please check it out and let me know what you think. The link is below: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11620282/1/The-Heart-of-a-Lion]]


** When I saw your story was about the founders, I decided I wasn't interested. However, I clicked on your link anyway just to peek at the first chapter and was genuinely impressed with what I read. You most certainly have something special within your words (and your proposed series) with dark truths of the time era. With only the first chapter done, I do plan to read on. Cheers to you.

Also, your summary is fantastic!

** Read the first chapter, I was quite hooked. When I'm done with my current read I'll definitely pick this up. Keep it up OP!
