A rather painful (for Wormtail) battle later, Voldemort realizes that the Skrewt certainly counts as an enemy and its blood might have interesting properties.

The Death Eaters are surprised at Lord Skrewtemort's new appearance.


** I swear I read a fic once where they replaced Tom Riddle Sr's bones with transfigured sticks, so Voldemort was revived as an evil tree...

I can't find it, but I'm pretty sure it existed...or it was a very memorable dream.

It might actually have been a dream. I had another dream once where the logic was that fresh fruits and vegetables were 'too good' for Harry, according to the Dursleys. When he got to Hogwarts he tried them for the first time and decided he loved radishes. I think my subconscious is a Harry/Luna shipper.

What were we talking about again?

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Hermione's mind was in turmoil, she actually felt sick. No wonder I couldn't get him interested in me if he was kissing Ron Weasley. Now there was an image she didn't need in her head.
#+end_quote

I don't normally read slash, but I would have been entirely fine if that is where this setup was going.

Actually, an entire fic of Hermione misunderstanding Ron/Harry's relationship and dreaming up an elaborate hidden romance would be hilarious. She thinks the fight after the goblet is a lovers quarrel. XD

It details quickly though. Really hard to follow the flow of the first chapter.

Edit: made it to chapter four before I had to throw in the towel. I like H/Hr, but even beyond the flow problem that fic was packed to the brim with unnecessary tropes. I had to stop at "I insist you call me Lord Potter" :/
