Just finished reading Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm, and I dont think I have ever cried this much while reading anything. It is one of the best pieces of text I have ever read. Just wanted to share this with someone. Thanks to the author, and to people who keep fanfics going!


** Stages of hope is one of the best the community has to offer. If you need a pick me up after that, I highly recommend linkffn(Oh God Not Again) and linkffn(Seventh Horcrux).

*** Nah, he should read Cauterize: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize]]

and then, perhaps, India: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4176058/1/India]]

Keep the waterworks on.

**** You are an evil person. I have read both of these now. Are fanfics usually this sad? 'India' was totally unexpected and refreshingly sad :(

***** (I might up the evilness stakes by sharing that I wrote /India/...)

Fanfiction isn't normally that sad. Some on the opposite end of the spectrum (meaning it's even money you'll laugh out loud) include:

/Where in the World is Harry Potter/ (first of a trilogy) by nonjon [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter]]

/Harry the Hufflepuff/ (first of several in a series) by BajaB [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff]]

/The Best Seven Years/ by Blutaiger (Calvin and Hobbes go to Hogwarts) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2760303/1/The-Best-Seven-Years]]

****** It was really good! Cant really up vote more than once :( . I have always had a bad attitude towards fanfics, but the ones I have read so far are certainly better than the "Cursed Child"
