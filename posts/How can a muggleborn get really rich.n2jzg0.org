Give your ideas!

Mine is: use mind magic on rich muggles so they give away their money to the muggleborn. Then exchange the money for galleons in the bank. You can do it indefinetely. Although, the value would be reduced I think. Maybe it wouldn't work like I imagined. If so, please explain.


** The issue with all the inevitable ideas you'd come up with is why did no one else do it first? Why did the Death Eaters, who don't believe Muggles are humans and love imperio not just use them for funds? Mugglewank fics where the OC uses stupidly imbalanced gold to pound to galleon ratio's in fics should explain why everyone and their mother doesn't do it first, and how the wizarding economy survived it.

*** Who says they don't? Knowing the Wizarding world, I would imagine a lot of Pureblood families' commercial empires are made of using magical exploits in various areas of Muggle economy.

And of course, people being people, these Purebloods lobbied to have Wizard/Muggle trade and/or exploits banned, unless you get a special Ministry dispensation.

â€‹

And to answer OP's question, transfiguring stuff into silver seems to be the fastest way. I'd imagine even if the laws allowed robbing Muggles blind, showing up to Gringotts and asking for a 1 billion galleons wouldn't fly because of inflation fears alone.

** Here's a legal one, especially if they're in the 90s:

There's a HUGE market for information technology in the wizarding world. Just think about how long it took them to search the library for information about Nicholas Flamel. A Google search could've done that in a fraction of a second.

With almost any physical product (apart from the really complicated things like ultra brooms) the situation is that there's a lot of people who could make that thing by themselves, so you can't make that much money selling it. But not information. Everyone still relies on good old books for that.

If anyone can create a magical variant of the smartphone and internet, capable of providing a massive amount of information with an easy-to-use search function, maybe also with instant messaging and online shopping, and capable of some number crunching tasks for arithmancy research too, it would easily make many millions of galleons. Perhaps even a billion, which would probably be a record considering the small size of the wizarding world. Especially if it took a ton of effort to develop so competition won't happen for a while.

It doesn't even have to be magic compatible electronics. All software consists of mathematical constructs built from simple instructions which in turn are constructed from logic gates. It doesn't matter if that logic being done by electrons in silicon or by something else.

** That's just stealing with extra steps. I assume that this is the sort of thing Aurors are well-practiced at arresting people for.

Repairing stuff, including renovating buildings, would take some skill, but probably be less illegal if you take care to make things to muggle standards. I have a WIP about Sirius and Remus fixing up #12 Grimmauld Place until they can rent it out to muggles.

** Instead of doing a currency exchange since I can't imagine that staying unnoticed or going over well with the wizarding world I would recommend using that muggle money to buy things in the muggle world that are either useful to the wizard or can be resold. Property, jewelry, raw materials, food... it'll cut into profits but I would think it would be more viable long term.

** I think the old favourite is antique restoration. Maybe old cars too?

It wouldn't be like billionaire level but enough to live a simple life

As an artist I've thought a fair bit about the concept of transfiguration and how that could translate to working with materials. So again, most artists don't make a mint, probably, but it would be an enjoyable way to live

I'm bad at this because I don't really care very much about being a millionaire

I mean, even working as a cleaner would be pretty easy lmao

****** The possibility for a morbidly amusing one-shot aside, there's no real canon evidence that magic cast by a witch or wizard dissipates following the death of said witch or wizard. If it did, things like the Sorting Hat, magical portraits, the Marauder's Map, and possibly even Hogwarts itself would essentially not exist in any usable state.

** There are at least 2 reasons that should make your plan fail :

- This one could easily be fanon, but there is a theory that say that "Muggle money" is worthless in the Magical World, including for the Goblin. According to this theory, the Goblin only accept to change Pounds against Galleons to ease the integration of the Muggleborn, but they either share the cost with the Ministry or the Ministry completely refund them afterward.\\
  With that in mind, the Goblin could refuse to exchange a massive quantity of Muggle Money, especially if it becomes a comon occurence.
- The other reason is that they wizards are not completely stupid. If rich Muggles start to give a lot of money to random people, it should make some waves in the Muggle World if only because the "heirs" trying to protect their inheritance (as an example we have the "Bettencourt case" in France), if some Muggleborn just happen to receive a lot of Muggle Money at the same time, the Ministry should make a link sooner or later.\\
  I don't remember if the specific law is precised, but Canon made it very clear that the usage of Magic on a Muggle (without a reason) is at the very least an offence, one that would probably send the culprit in Azkaban for some time.

**** If I remember well, it was shrinking keys (that would eventually disappear) and bitting Tea Pots. But I doubt any Wizard became rich doing that.

That way Arthur Weasley presented the situation, it was more a problem of Wizards messing with Muggles using Magic than a true attempt from a wizard to make money.

** Not at all. They won't be able to use magic in the Muggle world, and getting rich in the magical world is hard.

Probably your best bet is to find a tomb Gringotts doesn't know of yet ... and hope you're good enough to break the curses.

** Since galleons are made of gold, I'd watch the value of gold and sell, when the exchange rate is high. I'd then buy galleons again and repeat.

One galleon apparently equals roundabout 5 pounds and considering that the goblins will probably exchange pounds to galleons for a tiny fee I'd say that you'd get one galleon for maybe Â£ 5,50 - 5,60 ish... Sounds rather profitable to me...

** I think the best bet for a muggleborn to get rich is to leverage their magic in the muggle world. It's not illegal: it's only illegal if you are enchanting muggle objects. Using magic in the muggle world is perfectly legal as long as no muggles learn about it. The hardest part is getting the proper paperwork in the modern world to pass any background checks.

Take broken furniture from RoR, fix it with magic, sell in the muggle antique market. (I can't take credit for this idea; saw it in a fic.) You can start with the RoR as your initial seed, but furniture restoration is huge business. Haul it to your workshop, let it sit for a month or so (because quick turn-around would be suspicious), then cast a few repararos. Profit!

Honestly, pretty much sorting through the RoR will give you endless money-making schemes.

For a longer buildup, get a bunch of expanded space containers (trunks, etc), and sell offsite storage services to businesses. They don't expect to be able to access things on their alternate site. You haul it away in a truck, shrink it down for storage, and reverse the process if they want access to any of it.

Shipping/logistics. Shrink the stuff down, apparate or floo to wherever, unshrink and deliver. With a good scheduler, one person can deliver a LOT of stuff. You'd only need one delivery vehicle, as you can shrink and carry that with you as well.
