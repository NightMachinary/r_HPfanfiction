Had this on my mind for awhile, but would if Remus had run into the Dursleys by chance in the muggle world while working as a bag guy at a grocery store or something. He sees Harry being mistreated, reports to Dumbledore and is obviously ignored, and keeps seeing the (mild) abuse happening. Maybe Dumbledore even ignores him twice?

What does he do? Threaten Vernon? Stay close and observe further? Let him stay there but actually start trying to help him and finally defying dumbledore?


** I'm pretty sure I remember some fic where Remus was teaching primary school and (I don't remember if intentionally or by happenstance) Harry was placed in his class. I think Remus ended up effectively kidnapping him? I don't quite remember and I'm not 100% certain that it /was/ Remus.

** I'm a bit late for this but I think this would put Remus in a difficult position because he can't really force the Dursleys to stop the abuse nor can he adopt Harry. But I think he'd try to look after Harry in secret at least. Though I can't be sure it's not my fannish side talking here. Remus tends to side with the underdogs, though, so it's not impossible, particularly if Dumbledore chooses to ignore it. This would also make him reexamine the way he views Dumbledore since like most adults, he seem to trust him completely.

** I've seen one with some elements of this, Alpha Queen by sakurademonalchemist (linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10478871/1/Alpha-Queen)]]). It doesn't follow everything, but the basics are that Remus adopts Kaede/Lucy of Elfen Lied in Japan and has issues with the group hunting for her and others like her so he moves to the UK, and into the same town as the Dursleys resulting in a confrontation with Petunia and Lucy going to Hogwarts with Harry.
