Voldemort also invited Lily Potter to join him, Death Eaters went to school with him and knew him as Tom Riddle, and a bunch of family, including the Blacks had muggles somewhere in their family tree. Umbridge faked a familial connection. So pureblood ideology is mainly a rationale for their prejudice. Walburga definitely knew Voldemort was a half-blood.

Walburga would have been more than fine with Snape who Voldemort held in such good standing he agreed to spare Lily's life and that he eventually gave headmaster to Snape. As long as you support the cause, it doesn't matter if you're actually a half-blood so long as you outwardly justify the ideology which supports the movement.

Edit:

  It depends how you take defying, doesn't it. I mean, if you're counting, which I do, anytime you arrested one of his henchmen, anytime you escaped him, anytime you thwarted him, that's what he's looking for. And both couples qualified because they were both fighting. *Also, James and Lily turned him down, that was established in "Philosopher's Stone". He wanted them, and they wouldn't come over, so that's one strike against them before they were even out of their teens.*

The inconsistency between Hagrid and this interview is because Hagrid is not reliable here. Hagrid is not privy to the finer details, and has the information the general public has.

If it were a plothole, JKR would have admitted in the interview it was a plothole as she does later.

  Yeah, I know. You know, I-- I've got a bit of a problem with this myself, because every time I think it straight in my head, I go back and look at what the fans are theorizing about, and I think, yeah, maybe they've got a point. There is an easy answer to "how would Dumbledore know?", because you can-- he... you can, one can... (laughs) Forgive me if I speak as though it's all real for a moment.

Later in an interview when asked about it, JK said that it was possible to join even as a Muggle-born if Voldemort thought you'd be useful but I think it was mostly her trying to cover that plot hole.

******** It's quite irrelevant whether it was a plothole or not. At the time of that interview JKR intended to finish Harry Potter at the Deathly Hollows. The whole thing is irrelevant to the story as there is no influence on the plot whether Lily would have joined the Death Eaters or whether there were a Muggle-born being a Death Eater. Something that is irrelevant to the story, no matter how much JKR tries to cover it, is a plothole in my opinion.

Of course, as a fanfic writer you can either disregard it or use it for your story.

In fact, I'm going through my past comments as well and I can't quite find the feature that says "People Who Downvoted Me". I'm sorry that you're so concerned with the state of your karma score. Take an upvote from me. I hope you feel better.

In response to your actual comment, I don't quite think that's the actual definition of a plothole. JKR states the fact about the recruitment directly and admits to plotholes elsewhere in the same interview (under the usual definition of a plothole). Indeed, your own comment seems to be suggest this isn't about irrelevancy but JKR having not fleshed out the ideology.

#+begin_quote
  JK didn't yet have all the details of the Death Eaters' ideology in place

Of course, I've already tried to establish the ideology is very flexible and mainly to justify the Death Eater's movement.

And it seems, from your conflicting usage of the word, you agree that irrelevancy to the main storyline is hardly a plothole. There are so many world-building details extraneous to the main storyline.

Upon further review, I'm even more confused. Previous, like my original comment stated, I was pretty sure that comment scores fluctuate upwards and downwards to hide the true score, indicating the unreliability of comment scores. This is confirmed by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/a7kvlu/why_do_upvotes_fluctuate_so_much_when_you_refresh/]] (and many other posts like it). However, reddit's FAQ, despite admitting that scores are fuzzed, state that scores should be accurate. In any event, I don't recall debating you, much less downvoting you. Take another upvote as well.

****** It's from a 2007 podcast interview between JKR and PotterCast. Here's the transcripted quote:

MA: What about the three times-- The thrice-defying of Voldemort?

JKR: Of James and Lily?

MA: Of Neville's parents. Well, James and Lily, too.

JKR: It depends how you take defying, doesn't it. I mean, if you're counting, which I do, anytime you arrested one of his henchmen, anytime you escaped him, anytime you thwarted him, that's what he's looking for. And both couples qualified because they were both fighting. Also, James and Lily turned him down, that was established in "Philosopher's Stone".

On the one hand, Severus welcomed back his long-lost ideations of skinning that Sirius Black alive for this outrageous vandalism. (He'd call it what he wanted! If the woman's mere vocalizations were not a crime, than placing her in his private office without his written consent /would/ be; he'd see to it!) On the other hand, Severus was beginning to think that he, perhaps, understood the other man just a bit. (And /that/ was a thought Severus wished to set alight on a pyre and mercilessly liquidate from his otherwise uncontaminated brain, almost more than he wanted to skin Black.
