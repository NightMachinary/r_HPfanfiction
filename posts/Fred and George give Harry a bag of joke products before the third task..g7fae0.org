Fred and George wanting to help Harry through the Third Task give him a bag of prototype joke products to help him through the maze. After Harry is transported to the graveyard, Wormtail loosens the ropes to get Harry's blood. Harry managers to get his arm free, and manages to toss a canary cream into the cauldron right after his blood is added to it. The potion then turns bright yellow, and then a figure arises from the cauldron...


** That's a lot like "Knowledge is Power" where Voldemort comes out as a giant squirrel.

******** I know what you mean. Some of his stories are pretty well done actually but Harry Crow is bad simply because nothing ever goes wrong for the characters. It is one of those stories that makes you happy because all the characters you like get a happy ending, which is nice but unrealistic.

********* I haven't read much of his stories but I'd say they're not very good. At least RobSt seems to genuinely like Harry Potter, unlike Sinyk who is sometimes mentioned in the same tier (authors with well-known fics that are rather bad) and wants to bash everything except for Harry and his harem.

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.

These are pretty much all love potions. Harry could have tried to throw one in the graveyard, it broke on his arm and Pettigrew thought it was blood leaking from there. Now Voldemort was born in a love potion keyed to Pettigrew or Harry.

Now, imagine if the Pygmy Puff climbed into his robes, and Pettigrew cut it instead of Harry?

  Oneshot from Ron's POV. Ron tries to explain to the twins just how Harry made the Ministry of Magic make a new classification for magical creatures, and why the puffskeins were now considered the scariest magical creature of all time. No pairings.
