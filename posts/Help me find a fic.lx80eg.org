:END:
Not too long ago, I read a story from Albus' point of view (I think? It might have been Hugo) where the clan was gathered at the Burrow for Christmas, the kids had to sleep outside in tents, and Teddy and Victoire were in a bit of trouble and didn't know how to tell everyone. It was very sweet and funny and I wanted to find it again. Any help? Thanks everyone!


** I found it! It is "The Secret Diary of Hugo Granger-Weasley, Aged Thirteen and a Half" by Floreat Castellum. Here's the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12148666/1/The-Secret-Diary-of-Hugo-Granger-Weasley-Aged-Thirteen-and-a-Half][link]]. Such a good story.
