:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The story mostly consists of the articles themselves and how the general public reacts to them. I don't know for sure that the fic ever explicitly confirms that it's Harry writing them, but I do know that the public never finds out.

Anybody recognize this?


** linkffn(poison pen) maybe? it's the only one that I've read where something like that happens.

**** Ha, that's pretty close! The raven/dragon thing totally jolted my memory. Author's name is Raven Dragonclaw and the story is Celestial Requiem.

She(?) is the one that also wrote the Elemental!Harry stories, those were all the rage in 2003-4.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
