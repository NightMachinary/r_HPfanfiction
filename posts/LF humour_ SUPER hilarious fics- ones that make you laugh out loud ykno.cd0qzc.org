  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** By the far the funniest set of fics I've ever read:

Linkffn(6466185) Harry the shuffle puff and its sequels has had me in tears before. I don't want to spoil any of it, but especially if you have a slightly lazy streak this is for you.

Linkffn(8197451) Fantastic Elves and where to find them is also absolutely brilliant. Harry escapes the Dursleys at a young age and thinks he's an elf, so he goes around granting muggles boons (to start with), wandering from place to place.

Both of these are extremely well written and well worth your time.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

#+begin_quote
  JK Rowling once said in an interview that she thought about having Dudley have a magical child on platform 9 3/4s at the end of book seven, but decided that no magical blood could survive contact with Vernon Dursley's DNA. In a long list of ideas she got wrong about what should happen to her characters post-canon, I've always thought that this was pretty near the top.Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he has an encounter that will uproot the course of his life, change his relationship with his cousin and his parents, and introduce him to some really fun new alcoholic beverages.Mostly non-ship focused, but there are plenty of relationships happening in the background. Despite my reservations, this mostly takes the Harry Potter epilogue as written, but makes a few significant changes the plot revolves around.
