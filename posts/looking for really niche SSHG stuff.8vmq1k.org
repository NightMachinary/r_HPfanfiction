Awesome marriage law and/or wandlore emphasis? Help my nerdy little heart


** Linkao3(Hermione Granger and the intended vessels) Marriage law fic. I do want to warn you that is that Snape is quite in character here and their "relationship" is not healthy or exactly happy. This is not one of those fics where his flaws are forgotten or where he turns into a sappy romantic with no explanation. It does have some great characterizations and writing though.

  [newly edited as of Feb '18] Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.By killing Draco, she saves Dumbledore and keeps Voldemort at bay for a little while. But evil never sleeps for long. When a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. She's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

** I don't have a specific fic to recommend, but I know where you can look:

[[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/categories.php?catid=4&parentcatid=4][The Petulant Poetess]]

These were my first discoveries when I started reading fanfic more than a decade ago...and I am embarrassed that I thought SSHG was pretty much all there was - it took me years to read more widely and find other pairings.

** Have you read linkffn(Care of Magical Creatures by Mia Madwyn)? It's a marriage law fic. I'm not a big fan of the portrayal of Hermione in this one, though. I think she comes across as too juvenile (which is especially odd when they're marrying her off to Severus). Overall it's a pretty good story, nice and long.

Also by the same author is linkffn(The Marriage Benefit by Mia Madwyn). It's not a marriage law story, but it's a great short-medium length fic.
