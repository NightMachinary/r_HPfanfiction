It's always seemed to me that the secondary school teachers are incredibly powerful, and the rest of magical society is pretty mundane. That could be down to Dumbledore surrounding himself with powerfully mages for the purposes of war, but why do other magicalal folk seem so humdrum?

Why are wizarding households full of house elf servants that they seem to take no pleasure I having? Why not just do the chores with magic as easy as breathing? Why risk the lack of privacy and self determination?

Why does Molly have her children doing so many household chores without magic? They have to clean number 12 by hand (because of the trace? In an unplottable location, in the presence of adult magic users, under Dumbledore protection?)

The ministry of magic seems like a huge employer, but what magic is performed there? Flying notes?

Why do owls carry post instead of just using magic? Why can do few wizards conjure a patronus that can carry a message?

Where are the apprentices, and does it seem like snape is the only one to hold a mastery in his field?

And why, Oh why, does everyone get married to their high school sweetheart? You live 100+ years folks, and you're all paired off at 17? Even a regency style culture can't explain that.

Perhaps pure blood rhetoric isn't only bigotry. Maybe there's an actual, plausible reason to try and concentrate the few magical traits that are inheritable.

What if magic really is only a carefully cultivated breeding of mundane witches and wizards who stated out as simply having an affinity for the elements, or being particularly lucky, or an efficacious midwife, or a green thumb farmer. (Basically all the things people were accused of in the witch trials). Then you intermarry repeatedly until you get offspring capable of using a wand, or natural at mind magic.

So, most offspring are very barely magical, and don't get invited to hogwarts. Stupid lessons like turning teacups into tortoises belay the concept that most magic isn't really useful at all, except for the few, rare, very powerful. Death eaters are drawn to voldemort because joining a coven enhances natural gifts and isn't all that unusual (as first, later he's less charismatic and more a despot of course)

Maybe you only take an apprentice or a lover if you have a sixth sense leading you to a sympathetic magic user.

*edited to add I'm not sure what rule or etiquette I violated to garner downvotes. Should this have been titled "Discussion" instead of "Prompt"? Not overly interested in karma, but I'd like my posts not to be buried in the community.

They aren't too interested in gaining power. Think about real life - are /you/ secretly researching how to build nukes? No? You're getting an education to work an office job, maybe thinking of starting up your own business, or work a trade? Yeah, so are they. You'll have your Dumbledores and your Elon Musks (or at least Elon's public image), but most people just want to make their parents proud and have a hot dinner at the end of the day.

Status, and magic isn't as all-encompassing as you think. We see that Mrs. Weasley has books that tell her how to do things around the house (and that Lockhart's one isn't too useful), and remembering spells and charms is a pain in the ass.

Whatever's going on in the DoM, creating new spells, researching new Potions, the normal bureaucracy stuff, Portkeys, the Trace, Auror and MLE training (assuming that's onsite), practicing Obliviating Muggles, studying and disenchanting artifacts, and probably a bunch of other stuff. We only visit, like, four times in canon, and two of those are court scenes.

#+end_quote

Owls are magic, and can find people who are hiding from many conventional methods - Harry can get letters to and from Grimmauld Place, even if they don't talk about as much as he'd like. Only a few wizards can cast a corporeal Patronus - that's tough magic with a very fringe use. I don't think many outside the Order know that Patronuses can actually carry messages - Lupin doesn't mention it to Harry, even though that makes absolutely zero fucking sense if he knew about it. We knew that the previous Order suspected he was a spy, so they probably didn't tell him about their secret method of communicating.

#+end_quote

Potions Master is [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Potions_Master][just the official title of the Potions teacher at Hogwarts.]] It doesn't have any particular meaning. Slughorn is another one. Compare that to Voldemort and Lily, who were both exceptionally talented, but are not Masters.

Small population. Also trauma bonding. Also wartime youth get married fast.

Like what? The only thing that's heritable that I'm aware of is Parselmouth, which is indeed being concentrated and passed on. By the Gaunts. So that worked out /super/ well. Maybe there's an actual, plausible reason NOT to do that.

As far back as written records go in-universe, that's just plainly not true, and purebloods would be all over it if it were. The existence of Muggleborns seems to foil the idea, too.

Again, even IF it started out like that (which there's no evidence of and plenty of evidence against), it certainly didn't work that way when Hogwarts was founded.

*** Thanks for being interesting and thorough.

There's very little backstory for adults, so what if is an interesting thought experiment for me. You rebuttals are interesting too.

I suppose we only see glimpses into wartime and the brief period in between, which could account for the warbride theory of early marriage, despite longer lifetimes.

Muggleborns could of course be spontaneous mutation or the outliers of defunct squib lines.

It seems that magic, and indeed at least one particular magical talent are inheritable, such that most magical families and even half bloods, sire magical offspring. Unless there is a population of disenfranchised magic born children not included at Hogwarts.

And the purebloods do indeed get beat by school children. What accounts for the relative strength of magicals?

#+end_quote

I mean, how many characters actually get married to their high school sweethearts, anyway? Lily and James, Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione, and I think Arthur and Molly? Compare that to Draco and Astoria, Lupin and Tonks, Neville and Hannah (who weren't dating at Hogwarts, I think?), Luna and her husband whose name I forget, George and Angelina, Fleur and Bill, and the copious amounts of people who just never got married. And those are just the ones we're aware of.

I think that's the canon explanation, as per Rowling's Expanded Universe.

Magic itself is heritable, but I assumed you were talking about magical traits beyond the ability to cast spells.

Depends on the spell, but force of will and strong emotions seem to have an observable benefit, as well as experience, fine dexterity/diction, and a general knack for some spells (Neville's pretty trash at magic, but his first Reducto vaporizes a table).

***** Also Alice and Frank Longbottom. Ted and Andrometa Tonks. It's a significant portion of the prior and current generation that are central characters. I suppose I'm extrapolating to the general population based on that? The others are not sweethearts, true, but many are classmates certainly - almost identical in age, class, circumstance, place of birth. Very little variation for a world where travel is so attainable and adults would potentially meet marriagable adults in a broad age range.

This indicates that the death eaters should have won, yes? Based on their fanaticism and experience. Unless collectively the current generation has an inexplicable better knack for offensive and defensive spell casting. Not only are they adults and fully trained wizards (by whatever standard) they're also the surviving war veterans.

Would a British wizard necessarily know where to go to avoid Muggles in, say, China? We do have two romances (albeit one briefly-lived) with the two foreign wizards we spend any time with, Krum and Fleur.

#+end_quote

Only Bellatrix is actually a fanatic (and is noticeably the strongest). The rest are doing what is selfishly good for them, and are motivated by ideas of blood purity only as a secondary thing. Otherwise, they'd be much more lenient on blood traitors like the Weasleys. The experience of the rest of them (which has rusted in the time Voldemort was 'dead') is balanced by mortal terror on the part of the students (and they were probably underestimating the DA).

Same goes for other subjects. Geography - What's the European Union? (The most googled question AFTER the brexit referendum) How does our government work? Capitals of countries? English - How do you spell words correctly? ... I've met people who've thought that America and GB are the only countries in which English is an official language.

Most people know who my country's president is - but the minister of education?
