The whole hot-headed, stubborn, angry personality gets old really fast and can become slightly nauseating. I just want a nice, well-written James/Lily fic in which Lily is a bit more mellow. I don't mind her being annoyed by James and telling him off every once in a while, but just something where they're not screaming every two seconds please. Thanks!

I don't like James/Lily, because I found the Marauders as a group rather nauseating in canon and their interactions cringe-worthy, and most James/Lily fics are terrible schoolyard dramas. This one cannot be more different. It has excellent character interactions, a well built mystery and engaging legal drama. The courtroom drama is excellently done. The romance is rather understated and does not hijack the plot like every other James/Lily fic ever. James is a bit OOC, but I don't like canon James, so I don't mind.

  Lily Evans is pretty, intelligent, vivacious... and accused of murder. James Potter is privileged, arrogant, and conceited... and her best chance at avoiding Azkaban. If only he wasn't convinced of her guilt.

** This is actually a huge problem I have with the portrayal of females in HP fanfic in general. Whether it be Hermione, Ginny, Molly, or Lily, some writers just delight in having the female characters constantly berating, harassing, or downright abusing the male characters.

I'm all about having independent female characters who have strong personalities, do their own thing, stand up for themselves, etc. But that doesn't mean they have to be violent or angry about it 24/7.

*** I couldn't agree more. I'm a female, myself and it honestly irritates me so much how males are portrayed as having to be submissive to their female partners. Girls don't have to be cruel, hotheaded, and stubborn to be labelled as strong and independent characters, but unfortunately that's the reality of fanfiction.

** This is exactly what turned me off Lily/James fic for the longest time. I didn't find one I liked until [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305538][Amarathine]]. She has another too, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=334471][Hunter's Moon]].

** sort of related, but was there ever a jkr quote that went something like 'i think lily would be good for james bc she'd slap him down when his head got too big' or am i hallucinating it

edit: found it

#+begin_quote
  “I think that Lily would have been great for James because she wouldn't have put up with any of his rubbish. So I think he would have become a lot less spoiled.”

*** I think that's vaguely familiar. I just wish fanfics wouldn't exaggerate it so much where Lily is angry like 24/7.

** I love the "Boyfriend" series by Molly Raesley (which I assume most Lily/James shippers have read already, but I don't see it here so)
