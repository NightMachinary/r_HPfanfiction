** One of the only fics where posting updates is actually something we appreciate rather than spam. Trying to decide whether to reread the whole fic this weekend or just the new chapter though

*** Absolutely. Seeing Abby wholeheartedly embrace the opportunities and the challenges together is tooth-rotting in the best way :).

*** I strongly recommend that you skip the blurb and just try reading chapter 1. If you like Abby, you'll like the fic.

My own summary would be something like: Harry is raising his three children alone after losing Ginny in an accident, but is struggling to cope without her, until he finds a quirky muggle waitress who starts to draw him out of his shell and help him heal.

** Well, I know Harry said he'd pull strings to keep Abby's memory safe if she doesn't succeed in her audition. But I'm kind of hoping he takes the simpler option and just gives her a ring. Ideally making the offer before she auditions, so that she knows it's not dependent on the outcome, it's not just to protect her or anything, he means it regardless. At this point she'd be very surprised by moving that fast, but I think it's clear she'd accept it. The kids might be more upset though.

It's curious that she's already more comfortable with Harry than any previous boyfriend when one of them was her best friend for years, but I guess there's different types of comfortable. She could be comfortable being around Sam without being comfortable letting him into every part of her life.

(Amusingly, Abby's worst case scenarios for babysitting are actually much more manageable in a Wizarding household. Falling down the stairs? Bones and nerves are fixable within days with the right potions. House on fire? Harry could extinguish it singlehandedly. Heimlich? /Anapneo/.)
