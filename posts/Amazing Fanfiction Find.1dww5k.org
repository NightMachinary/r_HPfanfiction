** O.o

Written beautifully? It's written like an essay. It's also a massive USA wank.

*** Definitely agree with you here. I read it a while ago and it was definitely not worth the trouble. I mean, yeah some very small parts of it were interesting, but that was less than a tenth of the story. The rest was long-winded filler, cliched, and just kinda ridiculous. I'm from the USA and wholeheartedly agree it was the author masturbating furiously to the thoughts of an american wizard and an ass load of 'Sues.

*** Compared to a lot of stories, it is actually written well for stories that go on for that long, and its a different plot compared to the most I have read so I like it :)
