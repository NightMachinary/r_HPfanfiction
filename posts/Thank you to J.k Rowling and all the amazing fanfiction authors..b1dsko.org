I just wanted to say thank you... For all the amazing stories everyone has written. A lot of you guys will never know how much your stories help people. I know they helped me a lot... I have really had depression issues and have a rather... Bad home life. I grew up in a neglectful and verbally abusive household and Harry Potter was the only thing that kept me going. Their was nights where I would lay awake crying listening to my mother and her boyfriend fight. Their was nights I just wanted to die. Their was nights I tried to as well... But anytime I got down and couldn't go on I would find a new Harry Potter fanfiction and dive into the wonderful world of Harry Potter. It stopped me from suicide twice at least... Where I was close to making another attempt and decided maybe I should try to read instead... When I finally turned 18 I saved up whatever little money my mother didn't force me to give her and got a deathly hallows tattoo on my leg. It reminds me how much the Harry Potter series and all of the amazing fanfiction authors have helped me through my life...So... Thank you guys. I genuinely appreciate it..

That being said anyone know any good funnier long length fics? Something like a black comedy.. (I think that's the name if not I sound really racist) I could use a reason to smile right now... Life's hard at times..

To anyone going through a hard time or feeling down just remember theirs someone who cares. I know it can be hard and you might feel alone but their is always someone who cares. You're loved and will always have a good book to turn to in dark times.


** This has been amazing to read. I doubt I was writing during your teenage years; we're probably around the same age, or you might be older. This does, however, remind me that my work may be there for someone when they're really low, and they might see it as an escape. So, from a fanfic author to the readers - Thank you for reminding us of what we are capable of doing with our work, and the lives we can touch through our silly little stories that we post on the internet. This has made me smile even though I'm up at 1am, being sick.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** I concur so greatly with your story. I was 11 when Sorcerer's Stone came out in the US, and I waited for every book and I truly believed it's why I'm alive today. I'm currently 30 on meds and taking care of my depression and anxiety, but I was very suicidal then and if it weren't for me wanting to know what happened to Harry, Ron, and Hermione I would not be here. A lot of people tease me a bit for having such a huge Harry Potter addiction, but Harry, and JK Rowling since she wrote the books, saved my life and why I'm here living a much better life than I ever expected to have. Forever a fan regardless of the politics, Harry Potter will always be my super hero.

Reading and writing is a beautiful thing.

** Have you read the sun source? It's a long comedic fic and is probably one of my favorite Harry Potter fics. Hope life gets better for you and you start to see some of it's upsides!
