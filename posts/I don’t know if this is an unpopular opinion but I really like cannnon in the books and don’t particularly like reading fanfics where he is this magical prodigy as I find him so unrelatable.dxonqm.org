I don't mean to be rude but I wonder why a certain segment of the fandom wants Harry to be this super genius wizard.

*** He actually is pretty proactive. It took fanfiction to make me realize it, but his curiosity really drives a lot of the plot.

I like OP Harry as a power fantasy, but usually cunning Harry makes me cringe because it's like "Harry is the first person to realize that goblins will become the personal army of whoever says Hi first" or something like that

**** Maybe it's the disconnect of book 6?

It was my least favorite of the series. It's like Harry was dumbed down. For 3 books before that one he has been training. In 3 he learns the pantronus because of the dementors. In 4 he learns to survive. In 5 he teaches others how to fight. What does he do in 6? Takes trips down memory lane with Dumbledore and ineffectualy spyes on Draco. If he was proactive about it he could. Have found him in a month with the magical map that can see everyone in most of the castle and can see through polyjuice

For me book 6 Harry contradicted a lot of Harry's character from before

***** I actively seek out FF from before it came out. I kinda struggled my way through the last two books and I won a trivia contest at the midnight launch party at borders when OotP came out. I agree with you really hard.

The Map can't see inside the RoR. That's why he had to employ Dobby and Kreacher. And he staked outside the RoR/hidden things. He just couldn't get inside and didn't know the RoH even existed until around May.

****** The Harry of year 1 found the mirror in a couple of nights after getting the invisibility cloak.

He could have cought Crabe or Goyle poly juiced and turned them in to McGonagall or make them talk.

** I don't need Harry to be a super genius or a prodigy, but I also don't want to read "close to canon characterization as possible" because, to be honest, few of those have actually gotten it right. Either because they don't truly know what Harry is like in canon and/or because keeping close to canon requires a canon level idiot ball. Forging the Sword is probably the best of the bunch, but even that's a training montage to improve the trio.

But also why must a character be completely relatable to enjoy them? I adore canon Harry. I relate to him being a lazy, antisocial, sarcastic little brat. I don't relate to him being a wealthy, magical Jesus with a Jesus-esque capacity for forgiveness and love. I love Bellatrix. No part of her is relatable to me. I can't stand Hermione, but I relate to being a condescending know-it-all with large front teeth. Really all I'm asking for is well written and Harry centric.

** For my escapist needs I like to have some op/cheat/super component that can solve most/all problems.

I look for other things (actual well-developed characters/stories) when I am open to feeling things.

-- not to say that these are mutually exclusive, just that I focus on different things at different times --
