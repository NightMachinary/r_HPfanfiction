I'm relatively new to this world (a few months), and I feel like I've read all the recent Harry/Ginny stories.

I'm only beginning to sift through the older stories. I already discovered [[/r/harryandginny][r/harryandginny]] (it's delightful). I think I have a pretty good cache of hgfan1111, but what are the best ones among the community.

Also, I'm looking for early Harry & Ginny that isn't due to a soul bond and ruminates on those early years. Something like Harry Loves Ginny and Ginny Loves Harry shorts, but much, much longer.

On an aside, I love the world or Harry Potter fanfiction. First, FF I've read as well. I haven't been in the Harry Potter world since Book 7 came out. And in retrospect, I wasn't the biggest fan as a child, but I just love how huge of a world JK originally built and everybody plays in. I'm especially fond of Harry/Ginny. They compliment each other so well.

Anyways, thanks all for any recs and build such a great world.


** Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things]], linkffn(6473434), yet? Harry and Ginny got together early, but not due to soul bond. It's not recommended on [[/r/harryandginny]] either.

  Nora x Mary Louise fic (Noralise). I got the idea of how Mare and Nora came to meet, and how Nora became a part of the Heretic family. This will be a three-part story focused on Nora's growth from siphoner, to vampire, to lover. Plus, a little help from family goes a long way. ;) First fic in this fandom, thank you for having me! Please read and review.

** Try "Seeking Ginny" by Casca, which is an H/G classic.

Also "Carpe Diem" and its sequel "Alpha and Omega", by Imogen, published during the Three-Year Summer between the releases of /GoF/ and /OotP/. Her profile page also has little one-shots devoted to that universe.

** linkffn(The Thorny Rose) and its sequels.

Ginny uses the knowledge of 16-year old Tom Riddle to help Harry win the Tri-Wizard Tournament, while also getting him to reciprocate her feelings.

There is a Soul Bond, but not until the third sequel and it's a ritual rather than a phenomenon.

Be aware, Ron and Dumble-bashing.
