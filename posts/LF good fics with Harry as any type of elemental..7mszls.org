** [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4118383/1][Harry Potter And The Elemental's Power]] was deleted from ffn I think, hence the fictionhunt link. It was pretty good though. Harry's an ice elemental which he discovers at a very young age. I don't remember if it was finished when it got deleted.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11995519/1/Harry-Potter-Air-Elemental][Harry Potter: Air Elemental]] was also pretty decent. See if you can guess what type of elemental he is. linkffn(11995519)

*** I like the first one, I love their bickering, it is really underused in most fanfiction.

It definitely was. The last chunk of it was hilarious.

*** Harry Potter and The Elementals power was the first long ff story I really got into. I remember waiting on updates for chapters and just generally really loving this story. Then I came back to a while after it was finished and while I thought a lot of the plot ideas were original and fresh I generally noticed a lot more issues with it then I had the first time I read it.

This story probably has something to do with my desire to find and read good elemental stories. Unfortunately, none of them really are :(.

  Harry receives a rather unusual 17th birthday present from the Headmaster. A present that changes anything and everything.

  Ginny is setting everything on fire, and Harry is calling down storms and throwing lightning out of his hands. How things would change if Harry's power was something different and he had to learn how to use it along with understanding a mysterious bond.
