So I've seen so many fanfictions where a character walks into Gringotts in order to have magical blocks removed, or to have some fancy ancestry test done and I find it completely implausible. I mean, Gringotts is a bank, yes it serves as a gathering place for many Goblins, but some people write it as if it were the Mines of Moria. Also, why would an ancestry test in a bank reveal compulsions placed on you? I just find it completely unlikely, thoughts?


** Well, it's canon that Bill works for Gringotts as a cursebreaker, so they obviously have some departments that aren't strictly financial. And then people just make up stuff from there.

*** I came here to post this very thing. It is clear from this alone, along with the whole "will reading" aspects of canon, that Gringotts is NOT just a bank. Goblins also clearly do other odd jobs, hunt for treasure and information, and serve as guardians and executioners of wills and other legal documentation.

It's only logical to ALSO imagine that they (Gringotts and the goblins) serve as some sort of investment and financial transfer system as well, which also happens to be a discussion that was recently had on this subreddit. The wizarding world would not be able to function as canon describes without such a system.

Now... the jump into magical aspects might be a bit of a leap, but if they have to deal with wills, it only makes sense they can test inheritance of some sort. And if they are utilizing curse breakers, it also would not be a surprise if they don't just use them for tombs but also for objects and perhaps even individuals willing to pay. This means its also not outside the realm of possibility that one might use Gringotts to have other magical issues fixed (as you said, magical blocks).

The point is, Gringotts is definitely more than just a storage repository and bank for Wizarding gold. They clearly do much more than that going by both aspects of Canon, AND logical conclusions drawn from the canon world and how it functions. Where you draw the line on what they are capable of is the real question.

*Edit:* I personally don't really have a problem with it going much further into things like rituals, provided the fic does its job and provides some background and detail to the matter.

**** The problem isn't so much that Gringotts does more than just storing money. Private banks in the real world will do more than that as well.

What is unlikely is that they do all those services themselves. It would be far more likely if they would contact Lawyers for you and stuff like that. Another problem is the fact that for some reason wizards in those fics enthrust them with litteraly every important service while Goblins and wizards ar not exactly friendly.

The biggest problem i think is more that Gringotts is presented more as some sort of super entity where all Harry's problems get solved in one go. He enters the bank and when he exists it he is in total mary sue mode controlling the world

** I have no problem with the Gringotts being more than a bank, but most people just go overboard. Ancestry office - it would make sense for Gringotts to have one for inheritance purposes but it would alos make sense for this to be in the ministry. Rituals- hmmm, this one stretches things a bit. Purchasing basic things for the main character and doing all sorts of other itty bitty jobs - this is just silly. Fascilitating the purchasng of Property and other high value items - can see this happening. Etc.

*** Yes, estate planning -> inheritance dept -> ancestry rituals kind of makes sense. And investments -> real estate -> warding (to protect your investment). And even, interfacing with muggle banks -> providing muggle IDs (since purebloods presumably don't have a muggle birth certificate to get legit ID).

But the special portkeys, and non-real estate shopping, and healing are all kind of odd, no relation to finances at all.

**** See, I always imagine providing muggle identification is done through the muggleworthy excuse commitee. They handle all minor incidents and it would make sense that in order to get proper identification you would need the department to help legitimize your claim, otherwise the muggles might think you were practicing identity fraud.

***** Yeah, I could accept that too. But having Gringotts get you ID so they can open an account for you in a muggle bank is at least kind of logical.

Unlike goblin healers that are better than St Mungos despite the fact that they hardly ever work on humans, so they shouldn't even know if goblin methods will work on wizards.

** In my opinion part of why they write it as more is because its easy. We know little about it so you're not 'wrong' if you write it doing these other things. You might not be right but canon doesn't say explicitly that these things don't happen. I'd sigh if I read it but I wouldn't move on like I might if Wizards don't need wands or something else that is both unnecessary and contradictory to canon.

A big question mark is what else do goblins do and where the bloody hell are they? Do they really just have a bank and their entire species is there grumbling away at helping humans? We know they have rebelled but otherwise we know so little about them and perhaps most importantly we don't see them outside of Gringots context that surely there has to be something else going on?

*** I do agree, it's easy, but I just always find it so implausible, generally i find we know so little about goblins that they're easily mischaracterised.

I do wish we knew more about them, as Gringotts being a gathering place for all of them just doesn't seem right. In Fantastic Beasts we see goblins working a bar and the wiki says one works as a bell boy for MACUSA, so clearly they don't only employ themselves at Gringotts or at least they don't do so in the US.

Then there must also be some form of goblin leadership, since they communicate to the MoM through the Goblin liaison Office. Of course, there is also the possibility the MoM tries to restrict or organise the Goblin's leadership so as to prevent further Goblin Rebellions, seeing as they seem to have a fairly negative and controlling relationship with Goblins. I mean, if professor Binns succeeds in passing Umbridge's audit of his classes, his negative portrayal of Goblins, constantly talking about the Goblin rebellions, must be ministry approved.

Ah man, it's all a really interesting topic and just supposing that all Goblins live in Gringotts and that it serves as more than a bank seems simplistic and unlikely.

Dunno. Maybe it is, maybe it's not; I don't think him passing Umbridge's test is really definitive, because he doesn't /only/ talk about Goblin Rebellions; it's just as likely (and rather funnier) to imagine Umbridge came in while he was droning on about the minutiae of the youth of Ulric the Oddball, was bored out of her skull, found nothing Ministry-objectionable to what little she heard, and decided to quickly move on without hearing any more.

** Not saying it's right, but people do that because it's the oldest part of the canon (even predating the Ministry of Magic itself, if I'm not mistaken). The only thing that rivals it is Hogwarts. But I'm with you; it's a bank and goblins aren't really keen to help wizards with anything other than storing their money. If you want ancient, mystical services done, give Madam Pince something to do other than shelve books.

I don't see why they wouldn't. They can make a profit off of other things and perhaps get one over on a wizard or two so why not?

** The goblin nation can do a multitude of things for you, and goblins seem to be restricted to Gringotts in canon. (We only ever see one goblin outside, right? And they were kidnapped by Voldemort.)

So you can't go to Thraknash's Enchanting Emporium in Hogsmeade; if you want something that Thraknash enchanted, you have to go to Gringotts. Meanwhile, the goblins want as many customers as possible (capitalism ho!), especially foreign ones because they seem a mercantilist sort, so I'd expect them to offer as many services as they can. For a hefty fee.

*** There was the group of goblin creditors who followed Ludo Bagman around at the Quidditch World Cup, and then at Hogwarts.

Only seeing goblins at Gringotts otherwise is just a consequence of seeing the story through Harry's POV. The only public places for wizards that he ever really visits are Diagon Alley and Hogwarts/Hogsmeade.

It's not unreasonable to assume that the goblins have other premises to sell various goods and services, it's almost certainly more that Harry never had a need to visit one of those places, so we never see it.

Not in the fantastic beasts movie (so in the US). Goblins even have wands there.
