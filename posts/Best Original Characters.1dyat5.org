- Describe the OC.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Alexandra Quick.]]

Very much set in the Harry Potter universe (magic works the same way or is at least interpolated from what the original books suggest), but it is set in the United States some years after Deathly Hallows with all that entails (more schools, more people, tribalism with regards to native peoples and different ideas from various immigrant groups).

Four books so far. They're all very good, the second in particular is incredible. The fifth book is in the works, as far as I know.

*** I've been reading the Alexandra Quick books. They're also fairly well written, so far (I'm in the middle of book three). I like Alexandra. She's definitely not a Harry-clone OC.

** I have quite a few favorites if you don't mind, all from very different kinds of stories :)

- Archibald Penrose from [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307662][Muggle Studies]]. He's a Muggle Studies professor who engages in much exasperated banter and antics with his students, 100% droll and fun.
- Constance Palmer from [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=288707][With The Devil]], the daughter of a Puritan minister in Salem, Massachusetts in the time of the Witch Trials, and has the most engaging voice for anyone interested in historical fictions.
- June Benard from [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294705][Bathing in Roses]], which is a part-romcom, part-satire of the genre, a plucky down-on-her-luck OC done right, and there are so very few that are.

** Adele Polkiss from [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244417/1/Hocus-Pocus-Adele-Polkiss][Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss]]

I don't know I liked her bratty child-like attitude.

** Riley from byebyebirdy's -on the balcony series. She's really well developed with an elaborate characterization and backstory. She doesn't seem to exist solely to be Sirius's girlfriend, like all the other Lily's best friend characters in MWPP stories.

Edit: fixed my iPad's atrocious autocorrect

** My absolute favorite is Emily Swain from [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=4448][The Knight Errant Chronicles]]. She's a Faery Soldier who's brought in to teach a more hands-on version of Defense Against the Dark Arts during Goblet of Fire. She's got a complex backstory about her involvement with the Faery/Orc wars, a torrid history with Lucius Malfoy, and she's caught the eye of everyone's favorite Potions professor.

It's got all sorts of great stuff...great story, multi-dimensional characters, and a nice dose of smut if that's your sort of thing :).

** I like claire and serene from the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/140916/Leila-B][whole again series]] (it's very old) by leila b. It was written after POA (the book) came out and didn't reflect what happened in the rest of the books. I like reading older stories from when people didn't know how things were going to pan out. This author tells a well planned out alternative that spans over four stories, ss/oc, sb/oc and rl/oc. Really worth a read.

Claire is a squib born into a pure blood family who couln't accept that she had no magical abilty. they forced her to attend her first year of hogwarts any way in case her powers were late to bloom. SB played a prank on her that nearly led to her being killed, her family then pulled her out of hogwarts and basically kept her under lock and key and hid her from the world out of shame. She takes over the role as spy for Dumbledor when SS gets found out. she is very brave but doubts herself often and keeps up a facade to hid her weaknesses.

Serene is a muggle born who due to grindlewald war never got a hogwarts letter so had to try and cope living in the muggle world with /weird/ abilities. Her parents put her in a mental hospital when she was a young teenager because doctors decided she had schizophrenia and delusions of grandeur. They left her there and never came back and she had to convince the doctors she was better. She then learnt everything she could about magic independently. She is also very good at divination and has visions she doesn't understand.

** Her and another lady are accepted into hogwarts as mature students.

daniele from /the visitor/ by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7434407/1/The-Visitor][lady sophie of lalaland]] is ok too and it's a good ss story.

A lady who reads the HP books is attacked by her crazy BF and while she's being beaten and falling into unconsciousness she finds herself in hogwarts and tries to rationalise what's happening to her. She then uses her knowledge of the books to try and /fix/ things, which of course doesn't go to plan...

If you've seen Life on Mars it kind of plays out like that.
