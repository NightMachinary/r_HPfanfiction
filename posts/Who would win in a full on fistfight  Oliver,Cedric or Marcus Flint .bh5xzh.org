** *Round 1:* Marcus wins through dirty tricks and blackmailing the referee.

*Round 2:* Oliver practices non-stop for 2 years and comes back to re-challenge.

*Round 3:* Cedric, the youngest and the loser for both rounds, is so embarrassed about his defeats that he becomes a dark wizard Death Eater and slaughters whoever is still standing.

** Marcus just because he'd cheat. Oliver is a bit lighter and speedy and Cedric would just want everyone to get along.

** Both wood and flint were older and presumably bigger than diggory, and less concerned with fairness than winning. Wood's tenacity versus Flint's dirty brutality.

Given that Flint is described as trollish, I'm going to assume he was fairly heavier and muscled. Might edge out by that. Or he could be a coward once wood loses his shit abd turns into a maniac.

** Diggory would try to stop the fight. Davies would be observing from afar. Flint and Wood would duke it out and Wood would win because as someone said below Wood is crazy.

** Cedric's younger, Marcus might have been held back several years so he might be quite a bit older. It really depends of when you're talking about. If it's late enough Cedric would be an inferius.
