** Have you tried the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]] series? To date, it's still the only Harry-has-a-brother AU I've been able to make it through. YMMV though, the last couple of installments are HD slash.

** So I have something... It's my fanfiction and it isn't complete yet (it's over 150k words now, close to 200k, and I just posted ch29), but one of the things I am doing is trying to show the Slytherin side of the war in it. Example Draco doing the things he did for his family. What neutral families are faced with etc.

It's AU and one of the main characters is Neville. The pairing is Neville OC, but I think it could interest you. The OC is a Slytherin and Draco's twin sister. Also, I don't know if this will be a deal breaker for you, Harry isn't really a main character. He's still the chosen one etc, but most of my fic is told from Neville, Draco, and Graces' (the OC) POV. Occasionally other characters, but mostly those three.

***** I'm up to date =) I got a wee bit obsessed there for a minute. I just love the line Neville always repeats to graces (don't want to put spoilers just in case, but the crying one). And yay updates! Can't wait!

****** Oh! I'm so glad you like that ! I've actually multiple times writing had my doubts on it, so I'm really excited that it seems to be liked. Especially because I have it through out the rest of this story and the second one following.

It's massive (900k+), characterization is excellent, and while is sort of romance focused, its in no way the dominating force of the story. Slight AU

**** It looks like the author updated her profile one month ago, claiming she is still working on the story. But ... caveat emptor.

****** That's true. The author is still active though. She started working on her IRL book, so fanfiction took a backseat. It's certainly better than normal FF abandon, which is an author leaving the fandom and never reappearing again

** There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero][Unsung Hero]], but IDK if that's what you're looking for. Features a Ravenclaw Harry with a BWL brother, but I don't think the author says anything negative about Slytherin (mostly Gryffindor).

Be forewarned, though, that it is *not* a H/Hr story. It's H/Lu. There's also infidelity, which is why I quit reading it, but you may not care.
