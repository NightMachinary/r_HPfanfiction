It was a fic in which Amelia Bones had a marriage contract with Harry, and I think Narcissa Malfoy did too, though I'm not sure about that one.

One thing I recall is that Harry and Amelia did regularly sleep together, but it wasn't for sex, just cuddling.

  Why is it when you're drunk you come up with the greatest ideas! Well they aren't really great, especially when your father and his best friend, forget they did this and it comes back to bite you squarely in the ass. Thanks James, thanks Sirius. Marriage is a beautiful thing, when you are aware of it. But what happens when you're 15? HP/NM/AB Response to a whitetigerwolf challenge
