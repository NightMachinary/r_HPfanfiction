It just occurred to me that I've never read a Draco in Gryffindor fic, does anyone know of some good ones? a little review would be helpful if you have the time to write one (if you find any worth while). Edit: well lol guess its not as popular as Harry in slytherin


** Hey. I found a list of Draco in Gryffindor while searching through a blog. Hope you'll like it (I haven't read them)

**** It's going to be pretty short, but i'm going to focus on him, his family, and how he's affected by being in gryffindor. I don't want to give too much away quite yet just because i'm still working on it, but I'll comment on this post again with the link once the first chapter is up :)

*** Harry Potter and the Children of Change, spoilers. I'm just a few chapters in, can I just ignore the abuse of the Dursely's in this or is it central to the plot/development? Because it is slightly over the top, I pretty much lost it at 'breaking a few ribs for waking Vernon up, as was standard practice for Harry's nightmares.'... what? lol

**** You can skip it. It isn't the best fanfic but it covers what you asked for.

***** thanks, I think I'm going to drop it its too morally up itself. Growing up black is good though, if not a little long winded.

****** Well yeah, I agree. I don't think you'll find many fics with Draco in Gryffindor. When you have something with draco it's normally because Harry gets sorted into Slytherin. Or, I would assume, because you are dealing with a coupling I don't read (such as Draco/Hermione).

**** guardian/minor relationship would be a good way to explain it, but it is only comes into play rather late on in the story. It is a WIP but on hold.
