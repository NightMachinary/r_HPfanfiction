Hey guys! I'm hoping that someone will be able to help me find an AU H/G fic. I remember parts of the plot, but my google-fu has failed me, so I turn to you!

- Harry defeated Voldie and had never gone to Hogwarts

- Met Ginny they become roommates, neither of them knowing that the other is a witch/wizard

- 

  - Ginny realizes who Harry is when she sees pictures of his parents and realize that they are the Potters

- They start dating, and eventually go to the Burrow. Brothers were going to attack Harry, and Ginny steps between them. At first a brother thought that she did that because he thought that Ginny was protecting Harry from her brothers, but it was really Ginny protecting her brothers from Harry

- Harry wants to marry Ginny, but can't without telling her everything. Has to petition to the wizarding committee in order to tell her about Voldemort. (I believe she has to take an unbreakable vow to not tell anyone)

If anyone has any suggestions that would be great!


** I believe you're looking for Easier to Be by hgfan1111. Unfortunately she took all her stories down some time ago. I really liked her stories but I don't have any copies of them.

*** Ah that would explain why I can't find it. I was wondering if it had been taken down since I had searched FF for h/g with m/t rating which was how I originally found it...

That's a shame though. I'd have loved to reread it!

*** I read that a while ago and it doesn't seems quite right... they weren't roommates, and both knew the other was a witch/wizard. Ginny was the MoM daughter!

** The brother scene sounds very familiar, but I can't place it with the other parts since those don't sound familiar. Any chance you have 2 stories meshed together? That might be affecting your google-fu
