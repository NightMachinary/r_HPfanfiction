SPEW conquers the world with an army of soldiers that can apparate in places where wizards can't (which is really overpowered).

Yes this was the result of me reading the original name wrong.


** A few months back, I postulated that some Ministry bureaucrat misheard Hermione when she was registering SPEW, and so the Ministry now recognizes the "Society for the Promotion of Elfish Warfare." Draco finds this out and, as a way to both mess with Hermione and to get revenge on Harry for Dobby, starts an official S.P.E.W. that goes after house-elves that are considered "rogue." Draco, surprisingly, gets many recruits from current house-elves that view any elf that wants freedom or pay to be "rogue" and an "insult to house-elves everywhere."

**** ? I don't see what you mean. The thing about being the vast majority, is you proliferate (I'll be honest, I don't see this as much of a race for numbers, but even if it was) much faster.

  Harry's escaped from Azkaban and wants Revenge! Now this isn't your normal everyday kind of revenge, Harry is a second generation Marauder with a bone to pick with just about everyone that thinks they can just discard him like a worn out shoe
