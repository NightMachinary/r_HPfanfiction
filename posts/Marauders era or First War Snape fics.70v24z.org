Looking for good, relatively obscure Marauders era or First War Snape-centric fics. I've read most of them and they're not very good.

Requirements: No Marauders or Lily bashing. No Snape whitewashing.

I've read all of Laventadorn's work, The Snape Chronicles by Rannaro, Romance of the Age by nimmieamee and The Apprentice by Deborah Peters. Those are the kind of characterizations I like.

Thanks.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

*** I've read it. I still prefer the Apprentice because of the academia world-building and the realistic teenage interactions, but I'm following this one.

Some parts weirded me out like [[/spoiler][Lily giving tacit permission to the Marauders to attack Snape and the Slytherins when they hadn't done anything]] but I'll admit that it's a refreshing take, especially his interactions with Dumbledore. The latest chapter is also really good. I didn't see that plot twist coming. Thank You.

** I have a few recs that are short one-shots and obliquely related to the war. Curiously, I don't have any fics bookmarked that follow Snape through that period of his life in any great detail. So these may or may not be satisfying, but I'll put them out there anyway:

linkao3(358691)

This is focused on Sirius, but the pairing is Sirius/Snape, and Snape is the major secondary character. Interesting portrait of both of them, great prose, and canon compliant in that neither of them is a nice person.

linkao3(638566)

A rather chilling picture of young Snape's moral deformity, hinting at only a very small touch of the capacity for mercy.

linkao3(2052663)

This fic spans the time between Severus pledging himself to work with Dumbledore to the spring after Lily's death. It's Aberforth/Severus, so the pairing may not be your cuppa, but it's Delphi, and she works her usual magic by humanizing Snape without sanitizing him.

linkao3(65865)

Another Delphi fic, this one set just outside your preferred timeline, after Lily's death and Snape's first year of teaching. For me, this is an agonizingly sympathetic portrait of a very damaged and unfixable young man, and its insights into the kind of lost soul Snape is are amazing.

[[http://lilith-morgana.livejournal.com/279989.html][Those children's voices]] by lilith_morgana.

This was written before book 7, so it's not canon compliant. The nihilism and self-loathing and darkness in Severus ring true, though, and this interpretation of his connection with Lily is fascinating.

**** Xylodemon usually writes very exuberant, plot-and-dialogue heavy Marauders fic, and I've read a few even though I'm not terribly fond of the characters. But Sirius can be interesting and tragic and an arsehole in his own right, and Xylodemon doesn't gloss over that.

But yeah, hate!sex between these two lends itself to complications. I'm surprised there aren't more fics about them.
