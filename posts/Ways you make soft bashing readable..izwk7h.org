I don't really enjoy stories with the main plot revolving around hard bashing. Especially if its the same popular bashing tropes that are heavily overused. If you are going to spend 70% of your book having harry bash dumbledore in his office "You old goat.." , "Listen here goatfucker." , "Old Dumbles you better stay out of my life, stop stealing from my vault and giving me love potions." then prepare for me to only read 30% of your story. I can get into some of it but it has to come with creative plot that makes me excited to read it. I can only read how molly is evil so many times and I just can't do the stories where they have the same bashing arguments over and over while every single scene dumbledore makes harry go to his office so they can fight.

My point of this story is to ask the community this. If you write bashing that is, how do you do it in a tasteful way that doesn't turn off your audience? I would love to hear creative ideas on ways people do the same trope different. Cheers!


** I don't have any published works in this fandom (yet), but I don't really believe in bashing, and just simply wouldn't include it. I'd much prefer to create a backstory for a character which explains their unpopular patterns of behavior, or better yet, allow the character to grow throughout my work. : )
