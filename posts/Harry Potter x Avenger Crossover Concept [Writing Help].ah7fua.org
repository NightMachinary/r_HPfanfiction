I have this idea for where post 2nd YR Harry but pre 3rd YR Harry winds up in the Avengers world. He tries to use his magic to live on (with the limited spells of a 2nd YR), but he winds up attracting the attention of Shield, who naturally end up interested in his abilities.

I'm trying to decide a few things.

1.) How Shield will choose to approach Harry. I'm thinking emotional manipulation. Send someone who can establish themselves as a trustworthy, possibly parental figure to this young orphan kid and learn about his powers. This way they can nurse an ally in Harry while learning about who he may be connected to.

2.) What spells Harry would know. The wiki isn't super reliable, so I'm hoping to get help to compile a list. I'm thinking he may know Obliviate since he's seen Lockhart use it, although he may not be able to use it skillfully.

3.) How Harry will develop his skills as a wizard. I'm thinking of using that trope where he can absorb knowledge from Tom Riddle because I don't really want him to learn the magic from the Marvel universe (like Dr.Strange's).

4.) The Wand. If the wand breaks (knowing myself, I'll most definitely break it) what alternatives are there to wandless magic, if any.

Any suggestions to any of the above are appreciated! Thank you!


** 1) Harry's abilities would, in my mind, make the full time deployment of an agent reasonable. For the sake of the story, maybe even have him fall into this world and help Black Widow out (or make him fall out of whatever Black Widow tried to prevent - Tesseract induced dimensional rift, whatever... your call).

He has a basic idea of magic, and I think you could reasonably argue that with training and focus, he could work on making himself more knowledgable/powerful by formulating his own magical theory in time.

2) Levitation, Lockpicking, some basic transfigurations (material change, color change, form change, inanimate to animate), some defensive spells. Incendio, Aguamenti, Lumos,... I'd agree on a very rough "makes the target a vegetable" Obliviate.

3) As I said, through mental training and discipline, Harry could "basic research" his abilities as a wizard and formulate his own magical theory with time and effort. We know that Uagadou, for example, teaches a lot of wandless magic, instead of the mainly foci-bound magic Hogwarts teaches. I think you can get plenty creative there before you hit a wall of disbelief. The magic of Harry and the magic of the Sorcerers are quite different anyway. Harry is in himself a source of magic, while sorcerers use the energies of the multiverse to do magic, so an outside force. In that he may eventually become quite interesting to them, given his unique way of doing magic.

4) The wand is a focus. We know from Pottermore (no matter if you think of that as canon or not. I think of it as sometimes good inspiration) that there are different dogmas of magic use. Uagadou, as I already said, teaches wandless magic and uses foci only for more complex magic. There are also staffs, and I could think of many more reasonable foci to use. If you want to go with the Marvel universe, maybe you could let Harry find an item made from [[http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Uru][Uru]] (the stuff Thor's Hammer is made from). Or maybe he is the only one who can use the [[http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Darkhold][Darkhold]] without being corrupted. The Marvel universe allows for a lot of creativity there.

*** Thank you for your detailed feedback and advice!

I may try to take a page from Uagadou's book like you've suggested.

** I love this way more than im supposed to. I like the idea of sending someone trustworthy, and for that I think maybe cap America? I think they have a lot in common (all the crap I don't like about harry I also dislike about him) and he could give Harry the perspective that this world is also worth saving etc. Maybe also get him in touch with a family (clint's for ex) would bring him that weasley vibe and he would become attached.

Spells. I think that would be the hardest part since in avengers world that would be no one to teach him stuff. That way I think you could either bring the whole golden trio (hermione would teach him in that sense) or just teach him a very few spells and let him learn the basics of wandless magic with dr. Strange. That would also create the possibility of wand breaking and not relying solely on it. Spells could be all duel spells he already has. Maybe accio even though is a fourth year spell.

That's it I hope you find this useful and you can understand most of it (English is my second language). Congrats on the awesome idea!

** oooh, this sounds fun.\\
only thing i have an idea for is #4. when it comes to wand alternatives, i keep thinking about the method used in "Merlin", a tv movie from...late 90s i think (edit: 98). Here, magic is taught in three stages: Incantation, gesture, and finally mind/will alone. I dont recall a lot of the specifics (like if there were specific incantations for the first stage), but it was an interesting way to go about it.\\
(the series was based on Mary Stewarts Arthurian Saga...i think)

** Fourth year Harry winding up in Avengers world when he touches the TWT cup would make things so much easier perhaps even cleaner because at that point he would have enough knowledge to be powerful without being OP and you wouldn't need to invent ways for him to acquire new knowledge, he could just make do with what he already knows and maybe he could just work on using what he already knows more effectively and/or creatively instead.

But if it has to be "/post 2nd YR Harry but pre 3rd YR Harry"/ then absorbing the horcrux's knowledge could be an options to increase his own but then the question is how will that work exactly not to mention 16 years old TMR's knowledge would very probably make Harry, if not instantly then eventually, incredibly OP for Avengers world.

A 12-13 year old Harry has no idea that he is carrying part of someone else's soul with him, has no idea about any kind of mind magic apart from obliviate so he can't just decide that 'oh I'll just connect to the horcrux and learn from it'.

There has to be an event that would make Harry realize he has access to some knowledge even if he has no idea how it's possible or why. People used this trope in different ways, in some cases Harry, after some traumatic event or something, just absorbs every bit of knowledge horcrux had instantly and just continuous on instantly. Some "authors" write some line like 'I have to sort all of this new knowledge' or similar bs to give illusion of Harry not really having a great handle on what he absorbed but that line is usually gets forgotten quite quickly when plot demands it. I think having horcrux talk to him is even worse.

I'll recommend treating horcrux just as collection of memories and making Harry see part of some lectures TMR attending in his dreams he would recognize he's somehow watching TMR's memories and they are helpful so he tries to put himself under hypnotic sleep or something or may be someone from SHIELD or some other character from that world could help him with accessing the memories at least initially.

About the wand issue

If he will just learn to do everything he could do with a wand, without it, then just don't break it.

Unless you have a great idea for how Harry acquires new material/object to use in place of a wand or you're confident you could write him learning wandless magic in a exciting way which is pretty hard to do.

Usually we get stuff like 'Harry concentrated again but after -some amount of time- later feather was still standing. He vowed to work on this as long as it took him.' then later in the same chapter 'After -some amount of time- Harry's hearth filled with joy, when he saw the feather rise up' then in next chapter we see a line like 'He continued his studies in wandless magic' and then in the next chapter Harry is the master of wandless magic.
