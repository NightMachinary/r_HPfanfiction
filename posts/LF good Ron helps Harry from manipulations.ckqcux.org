Any fics where Ron learns of Ginny/Mollys atempts to potion Harry, learns of Dumbledores manipulations against Harry, really any fic where Harry is used, Ron discovers it, and Tells him?


** There is no such thing as Good guy Ron in fanfics. Jk, but this really sounds like a rare prompt.

** There is a snippet in which Ron subverts Manipulative!Dumbldore's plans for Harry: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8527691/5/An-Incomplete-Potter-Collection]] (search for "Ambitiously Ron" without the quotes).
