I've just finished Just Try and Keep Us Apart linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11544228/chapters/25922121]]) . I didn't expect to like it because it's a Harry/Charlie pairing and i rarely enjoy non-canon pairings... and this was so good I'm now finding myself shipping those two.

What about you? What story suprised you by being awesome?


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/Deathly-Hallowed]])

Though I would read a little bit of this and drop it.

Read the whole thing and loved it.

Depicts a world in which lovecraftian type things exist. I personally love the theme of old gods that are real and dangerous. Don't really want to spoil too much but if you have free time, give it a whirl.

Also, it is of course likely abandoned. The author did say he planned to update it this summer, but I would imagine real life happened. So just be aware that it might not ever be finished.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

** I was incredibly skeptical at first about Harry Potter & The Prince of Slytherin -- I mean, the first chapter is practically a wall of text with every Slytherin!Dark!Angsty!WBWL!Harry cliche in the book (which isn't that bad, I guess, except that it claims to be different from every other WBWL story). The monologue is excessive and pretentious and starts with a passage on Harry's hair issues; to me, it was just massively offputting at first and I picked it up and dropped it a few times before powering through to the realisation that I actually really liked it.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/]])

Same goes for The Pureblood Pretense, actually. Thought it'd be a generic girl!Harry fic with bland OCs and no challenges at all, and was proven very wrong indeed.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** Hmm. I would say /Turn/ - linkffn(6435092). I had tried reading a handful of Harry/Draco fics before, but I hadn't really cared for any of them. Add to that, pretty much every fic more than 300k words is egregiously long and should probably be edited down. Not this one though. While I didn't particularly love Draco (I thought his characterisation was one of the relatively weaker parts of the story), I loved the writing, the kids, the portrayal of Harry and Ginny's dying relationship, the Weasleys, Blaise Zabini and most importantly - the themes appealed to me greatly. Easily one the best stories in the fandom.

Honorable mentions to /Great Expectations/ and /Etc Etc --- and Life Goes On/. First one is a pregnancy fic (in itself an auto eyebrow raiser) and I was a bit wary of the first chapter. But it turned out to be really well written, with witty dialogue and real life issues tackled in a manner that felt genuine. If it weren't for that chosen baby Albus subplot tacked on it would be one of my favorites, but it is very good nevertheless. The second is an Albus/OC fic. I'm not quite sure why I started reading it, actually, but soon I was consistently in a /"Wtf, no, why is this so goood?"/ state of mind. It is certainly not a particularly HP-ish story, but god, the perpetually cynical and machiavellian reporter Clemence Fitzgerald is absolutely perfect for a satire fic based on romance tropes. linkffn(7217938; 3980670)

  From the moment Charlie left Hogwarts, he'd heard about Harry Potter. The longer time goes on, the more their lives become intertwined and the more Charlie can't keep himself away (8 year age gap be damned).This is an AU, but uses as many elements from canon as possible. It follows the order of the books but is mostly from Charlie's perspective. Up until later chapters of the story, this all could feasibly exist within the canon universe.Don't be turned off by the 'Underage' tag, I just wanted to cover my bases. Also note the story is only rated at Teen. That being said, if that's a trigger for you then protect yourself and pass this one by. I hold no grudges :)

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.

Recommend by a friend who swore that the featured couple would grow on you. My teenage self was sceptical but it was the fic that converted me to the idea of Snape/Hermione being together.

This particular fic is 'de-aged Snape lives' in 8th year. Snape loses his memories of his adult life entirely and it follows his interactions with Hermione and the Trio through their NEWTs.

The ending is a bit curious but I still found it enjoyable. I've gone back to this fic repeatedly over the last five or so years and have a soft spot for the works of Ms Figg (RIP).
