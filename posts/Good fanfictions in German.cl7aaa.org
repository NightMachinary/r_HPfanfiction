I'd like to read some fanfictions in German and I'd like to get some suggestions as long as the stories are long and well written.


** To be honest, I doubt there are any good German stories. But many good ones were translated, sometimes well, sometimes by what seemed like a preschooler in his first year of language education. Mind, this is my experience from 16 years ago before I started to consume all entertainment in English. Maybe the quality of translations has become better since then.

I would say to just go here and take the search engine for a spin:

[[https://www.fanfiktion.de/Harry-Potter-FFs/c/103005001/1/updatedate]]

Or just search ff.net with Language set to German and sort by Reviews. The translations of the biggest stories in the fandom should show up pretty close to the top.

*** In the end it's just for practice; as long as they are not total garbage I am fine with it.

**** Ah ok, so you are learning German? I would argue that them being good quality is even more important then. Else you might pick up some bad mannerisms from the stories.

So I would say that reading translations of the big stories in the fandom is the way to go. Often those are translated by professional translators that did that in their free time. They should have much better German than pretty much everything that has originally been written in German.

***** I am sorry I think we misunderstood each other. Are there any fanfictions written by native German speakers? I live in Germany and my main problem is to understand what goes even a smidge out of Hochdeutsch.

****** Well, those translations are done by native German speakers. Even more so, more often than not, by native German speakers professionally trained to stay on Hochdeutsch.

But if you are deadset on reading fics originally written by Germans, my link up there should have tons of them. The only problem is, that the search engine is missing the most basic features, so it might be a chore to find something readable.

Sorry that I can't help with any links to specific stories. Wie gesagt, hab seit 16 Jahren keine mehr auf Deutsch gelesen.

******* But finding study material in standard German is not an issue; slang is. I watched Türkisch für Anfänger and dubbed movies at the cinema here and the latter is much easier than the former.

******** I think there is a basic misunderstanding here. Maybe you mean that you have problems understanding the many different dialects we have here? Those are pretty much never used in the written word. Same as the speaking patterns used in Türkisch für Anfänger. Those are exclusive to the spoken word.

********* Well then that's a problem XD Guess I'll just read Harry Potter in German as I intended to do anyway and see if I can find some movies where the characters speak in dialect.

********** Well, it is the same in Spain or India or I think even most other countries. While there are many, often very different spoken forms of the language, in the written word everybody uses the standard form.

Just imagine the chaos if people from Bavaria started to write in their insane dialect :D Or the people from Saxony! I can already see the 150 "Sch's" per page :P

Good luck anyway! I think the best you can do is watch TV (I know, it sucks in Germany, but the scripted reality shitshows tend to use slang and dialects to make the people look even more stupid), watch Movies and talk to people.

*********** People from Baveria do write in Baverian tho XD. I live in Augsburg and I feel like they are speaking (and writing) in another language. I had a teacher at Uni who was from Hannover and listening to him speak was wonderful :). My bf is from Berlin and the way he speaks is way easier to understand than other inflections, but I think I read somewhere that Berliners do not really have a dialect anymore.

************ What? Are you actually talking about instant messaging or something? I was thinking books and newspapers when I said that the dialects don't exist in the written word.

If someone writes to me on WhattsApp in his dialect I don't understand I tell him to cut the shit and write normal, and I have been born here and lived here for 30 years. It is commonly considered pretty rude to write in dialect to someone you know was not raised with the dialect. It implies a "Yea, you figure that out! I can't be bothered to translate my thoughts into actual German." mindset.

Also, while I can understand every spoken dialect, I sure as hell don't understand the written dialects.

Well, as I myself have never felt a need to learn to understand the written dialects, I can't really tell you how to go about it. Maybe ask a friend to help you with the most common words? Dunno.

************* Whatsapp I meant. Answering something like this would make me feel bad and in my experience there are plenty of people that already get annoyed when a foreigner can't speak impeccable German so making comments is not really a priority.

Some old people cannot speak standard German at all I think, but it's the same in Italy so
