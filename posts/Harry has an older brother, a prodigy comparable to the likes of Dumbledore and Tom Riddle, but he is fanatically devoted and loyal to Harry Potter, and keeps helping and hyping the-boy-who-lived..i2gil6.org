"Potter's done it again." Severus Snape said with a sour scowl.

Severus complaining about the elder Potter boy was nothing new since he started this year. Rest of the professors at the monthly meeting just groaned.

"Would you care to enlighten the rest of us what Mr. Potter did again Severus," Albus Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eyes.

"While helping a fifth-year student Mr. Potter seems to have discovered a new way to brew the Polyjuice Potion," Pomona Sprout interrupted Severus, her voice filled with pride. "His method seems to use some exotic ingredients, but it completely eleminates the month-long wait for the potion to stew."

"Yes, yes. The boy found a way to improve a potion that has potion masters throughout the world thoroughly frustrated with dumb luck. Dumb luck, that's all it was." The potion master's scowl deepened even further.

"And what did our young prodigy had to say about the incident?" Filius Flitwick asked excitedly. He was always looking forward to have Mr. Potter in his class. By this point he was not fazed when the first year got a spell on his first try. Filius had made the young student demonstrate some second and third year spells, yet the results did not change. By this point everyone accepted Alan Potter as a prodigy perhaps even bigger than Dumbledore.

"He just pointed out that his brother would make further groundbreaking improvements on Polyjuice potion and more." Pomona answered with a smile. That was other thing Mr. Potter was famous for aside from his trumendous talent, his devotion to his younger brother. Everyone just took it in stride, after all one needs some eccentric behaviour to go along with prodigal talent. That and everyone was happy young Alan was normal in every other way, Merlin knew they did not need another Dumbledore.

--------------

This can be a crack-ish wholesome fic. Featuring a prodigal yet devoted and loyal Alan Potter, the Hufflepuff. Harry Potter, when he arrives to Hogwarts finds himself also sorted in Hufflepuff, since he always works hard to make Alan proud. Harry finds himself surrounded by loving friends, caring upper-years, and a fanatic and devoted Hufflepuff army, courtesy of his brother.

Or

This can be a mature fic where Harry and Alan overcome sinister plots and go on adventures with supporting army of 'puffs. You can also have Alan using his devious nature to crush any threat that may rise against his brother.

** This is making me want to write so bad! I don't think this would be a 'Potters live with the Dursleys' fic, it has more of a 'Sirius was never sent to Azkaban and takes in the Potters' vibe. Anyone agree? I can totally see Sirius loving and raising the boys and encouraging their behavior. Maybe Remus is a surrogate 'mom' and tries to balance out Sirius. (Could see Sirius and the boys calling Remus 'Moonmy' and Remus being absolutely not amused)

** Ok! This has officially cured my writer's block. I just finished a rough outline for what I estimate the first 8-10 chapters to be. I'll begin drafting them sometime soon, with the hope that I'll be able to start posting in roughly two weeks. The first chapters will cover setting up the story, and Harry and his older brothers first year. I don't want to entirely rip off the prompt (I will give credit) so I would very much appreciate suggestions for Older Brother's Name (first and middle) and I'll credit you in my story! If you'd like an idea of the plot, it starts with Sirius picking up the boys instead of going after Pettigrew. They will then leave the country with Remus. The fic will then time travel to Harry's first year, while OB is a fourth year. They both will be Hufflepuffs, and while I like Ron, I've decided that Neville will be Harry's BFF. There will be a BIG plot point at the end of first year, which will really shape how the story progresses. I do not believe there will be Wolfstar, and I have no idea who I want end pairings to be, as I have no idea where I truly want to go with this fic. Let me know if you're interested!

*** I was thinking about this prompt and how it can be spun for a story. Decided to pitch it today, after a good sleep and clearer head.

But one thing, you should consider before making older brother more than 2 years older than Harry. James and Lilly were both 20 when they had Harry, so unless you mess around with timelines it'd be a pretty creepy reading 16 year olds having a child.

As for a name, personally love the idea that older brother is /something/ Fleamont Potter. It would be a good way for James to honour his father.

I would love to read your story. And if you like to discuss ideas for the story I'm interested.

**** Thanks for the age tip I keep forgetting how young they are! I really like having Older Brother be 3 years older as it gives more of a balance, so I might bump up the ages of James, Lily, and the Gang. I made Older Brother's middle name Charlus, so I might hyphenate it so it's Charlus-Fleamont.

***** Charlus is a good middle name. I'd much prefer it over the hyphenated one.

If you're going going to make Charlus three years older than Harry, it might need some additional work. We don't know that many 'puffs, especially ones that'll be with Charlus.

My idea was making him 2 years older, so when Harry starts Hogwarts, Charlus has already integrated himself into the school. Also, by making him two years older you get access to a list of characters and things you can do/interact. The Weasley twins, Cedric and so on. Cedric can be Charlus' best friend, sort of like a mix between good parts of Ron and Hermione, supportive, loyal, intelligent, and so on.

Plus I have this hilarious image in my mind where Charlus does something impressive and dangerous without thinking much and Cedric, the perfect 'puff, pulling his hair out and saying, "No Charlus, not everyone can perform Arithmancy adjustments and modify spells on the fly."

"But Ced, Harry can also do that. And he's so much better than I was two years ago."

*** I was thinking just the opposite actually. There's hardly any sibling bonding/mentoring in the canon, not including the Weasley family. Sirius and Dumbledore both had bad sibling relationship, and they don't do anything to mend that. So I was thinking of presenting a story where there's a good sibling relationship, kind of like what Sirius and Dumbledore wish they had after seeing Harry and his brother.
