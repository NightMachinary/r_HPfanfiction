I've been in this fandom for about 3 years but every few weeks I always find some extremely popular, good story that I've somehow never seen before. I'm trying to build up a super library with a bunch of long, well written stories so that I can read through them all without searching for more, which is why I'm here.

The only requirements I really have is that they're at least 100k words and Harry centric. As for pairings, well I don't really read slash stories but that's it.


** I'm surprised neither of these have been mentioned yet:

linkffn(5511855;11111990)

Grow Young With Me isn't finished yet, but it's being actively updated. Both stories stand on their own literary merits, and as a bonus they both have unusual pairings.

**** It's one of the few stories that I actively try and keep up with. Typically, when I see a story is incomplete, I'll just drop it, even if it does get the occasional update. But GYWM is one of the rare ones that I have been following for the past few years, not caring if months go by without an update.

** A Long Journey Home fits your requirements:

- Best, most well written - It's sadly incomplete but the prose is of a very high quality
- At least 100k words - It's 203k words of bliss
- Harry centric - The Harry equivalent is definitely the main character who gets the most screentime, though other figures, both canonical & OC, are definitely present.
- Pairings (no slash) - The most prominent by far pairing (4 chapters of narrative) is het, though there are brief mentions of slash relationships in the past

** Copy and paste. I have the flair for a reason.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]] by Sovran is my favourite fic, period. One look at my profile will show you I've got physical copies. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but it takes the idea and creates a gripping and emotional adaptation of the original story. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. Honestly, the story is less about the bond, but more the reactions of the characters to it, and it's amazing because of it.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

** A couple notes: Grey Space is a fair bit shorter than you'd like, but you really oughta read it anyway. It's incredible.

The Changeling is Ginny centric, but top notch: put it on your list and get back to it one day.

Finally, I've included a few crossovers. Of Wizards and Heroes is slash, but it's more implied than demonstrated and it's quite possibly the best Avengers crossover that's also over 100k words. Say a Prayer is the start of a series, and it's rough until it gets going - the crackyness and over-the-top bashing fades away, but it remains a very fun read. Illusions of Grandeur more or less requires you to be knowledgeable of the original five season arc of Supernatural. The rest you can wing.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

** Faintest, Slimmest, Wildest Chance is set in the summer after the fall of Voldemort; completely canon and deals with Harry and Ginny overcoming trauma from the war, dealing with their relationship, and the entire Weasley family coming to terms with Fred's death.

At times hilarious, at times tragic, at times romantic, and times profound, this fic has completely believable and canon characters and is good enough to feel like a continuation of the books. Highly recommend.

  Harry left Ginny to keep her safe, but Hogwarts during Voldemort's reign was anything but. Although they both survived, each bears scars from their year apart. The end of a war and the death of a brother don't make for an easy romance, but as long as there is the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance.... The Weasleys gained and lost a member in one night. Will they ever be whole again?The first of three fics covering the first year after the war; this one focuses on Harry and Ginny's summer as well as the Weasleys' recovery as seen through the eyes of Bill and Charlie.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of Slytherin) in which the author turns all the fun tropes on their heads.

Linkao3(boy with a scar by dirgewithoutmusic) a series of vignettes in which one thing is changed. My favorite is the kids who chose themselves, though that ones not harry centric.

Linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom) in which Voldemort won the first war and Harry becomes something of a protege, but not a dark harry fic like you'd expect. This ones a little dicier on the well written front, there are a lot of grammatical errors and homophone mix ups, but the writing in terms of plot and character is top notch.

Linkffn(the accidental animagus) in which Harry gets adopted by the grangers and can turn into a cat. Mostly love this one for the depth of the wizarding /world/ that they build in later books.

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** This is a controversial one on here that people seem to either absolutely love or absolutely hate, but my personal favourite HP fic is linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of slytherin). The writing is brilliant. It does use a lot of tropes, but it subverts basically all of them in ways never seen before it.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I saved this post with the intention of returning and posting my favorites and five months later remembered. I hope that you are still interested in building up your library! Most of the ones I read are slash as most of the fics written in this fandom are slash, but they are all clearly marked.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816][Away Childish Things]] is a Drarry fic. I saw it recommended here so frequently I finally read the damn thing and wish I had done so earlier. It is so touching and deals with going through trauma and isolation beautifully. (153,881 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10678911][Blood Magic]] is an old classic in the fandom. It was originally written pre-HBP, so there are no Horcruxes. It's a response to the Severitus challenge. I've returned to it again and again over the past decade and still love it. (334,522 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/825875][All Life is Yours to Miss]] is another Drarry fic. Draco and Harry are professors at Hogwarts. Harry is popular and beloved. Draco is a recluse who lives in the dungeon. After a petty prank has consequences, Draco is forced to actually interact with the world. (114,741 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852][Turn]] is an extremely popular Drarry fic while also being a bit canon-compliant. Harry does a good deed and helps an old man and, as a "reward" gets a glimpse into another life he could have led. (306,708 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][Boy with a Scar]] is a series of one-shots answering different "what-if's". For example, what if Dudley had been a wizard? what if Harry was a girl? what if Petunia actually properly took in Harry and saw him as her nephew instead of a burden? I love this series because each one oozes empathy. Just noticed that it was recommended by another person in this thread. (208,651 words; not technically complete but each stands alone)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296][Blood Crest]] is a WIP. It is still regularly updated. In this, 9 year old Harry accidentally gets himself apprenticed to a not-so-nice necromancer. No pairings yet as Harry is still young (448,991 words and counting)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189][The Changeling]] was recommended by another so I won't belabor the point. Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. I really don't care for Ginny (just don't find her interesting), but this author writes her very well. True to character and compelling; one of my top three in the fandom. (182,592 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/31886][Memories and Dreams]] is technically a series. This is another that oozes empathy. Harry and Ginny accompany McGonagall to bring Dudley's daughter his letter introducing him to the wizarding world. It is canon compliant. (140,315 words; complete)
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/741255][The Problem with Potions]], Harry is fascinated with potions and perseveres in studying it, despite his terrible teacher and lack of talent. I don't remember the pairing in this one. (222,341 words; complete).
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/977214][Animagus-Verse]] is another WIP. You know how kids can apparate when they perform accidental magic? This one has Harry as an accidental animagus. He runs away from the Dursleys and lives as a street cat for a little while until he gets picked up by another family. This fic is well-regarded for its world-building. This was updated just one month ago. (865,030 words and counting)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is my all-time favorite fic in the fandom. It's Drarry. Lupin steals Harry away from canon-level abuse with the help of Snape. I don't want to say too much more, but just know that it is written with love and care. It's absolutely gorgeous (373,077 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is truly one of the most unique fics I have ever read. It deals with what it means to be human, artificial intelligence, and the Absurdist philosophy. This was also updated just a month ago (425,194 words and counting)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162][The Devil You Know]] is the first part of a series. Harry strikes a deal with the scarcrux. "Marvolo" gives him information and Harry reads books and performs rituals for him. The first part is 67,782 words, but the second part is 39,487 words and counting. It was updated two days ago.
- I don't remember the pairings in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12578866/1/Modern-Romance][Modern Romance]]. It has an unusual framing device. The concept is that each chapter is another entry in Witch Weekly. Each author anonymously submits tales from their love lives using code names for the people involved. There are overarching narratives. It's fun to try to parse out who is who. (293,493 words; complete)
- Harry Potter takes the "Boy Who Lived" title a bit seriously in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The many Deaths of Harry Potter]]; he just. won't. die. Every time he does, he comes back in pain and back in the past. He gets smarter but faces down a more cunning enemy. (242,571 words; complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] is recommended frequently enough that I feel the need to include it here. I thought it was... fine. The trio are morally grey and you know they are because they tell us many times. I think it's better to show not tell, but this fic has a lot of fans. (143,267 words, complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11487602/1/Resurrexit][Resurrexit]] is a murder mystery. Harry's wife dies under mysterious circumstances and he will do anything to find the perpetrator. (74,756 words; complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] is the most polarizing fic I have seen on this fandom. People get lowkey flamed for recommending it. I love it and it's extremely popular, but the people who dislike it hate it (I suspect in part because it's recommended so frequently). If you don't like it by chapter 10, give it a miss. (661,619 words; complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] is the only crackfic I really and truly like. There is no Harry, only Scarcrux. Tom is just trying to live his best life (or, Harry's best life) in disguise as Harry going through Hogwarts. What could go wrong? Really and truly funny. Balances humor and plot well (104,212 words; complete)
- In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]], Snape discovers canon-level abuse at the Dursleys when Harry gets his letter (he is intrigued by the letter being addressed to "the cupboard under the stairs"). I like this one because the fundamental characteristics of the characters aren't changed; they're just put into extremely different circumstances. (213,669 words; complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] is another famous comedy. Harry goes through the veil and finds himself in an AU where he and Sirius died in the 1981 Godric's Hollow attack. They set out to live their best lives. (246,320 words; complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]] is another mystery. This one was the first Haphne I ever read so I thought her characterization was novel; I am prepared to admit that I was wrong. That said, it's still well-written and engaging.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8052019/1/Rosella-Dumbledore]]

Story is called Rosella Dumbledore, and it's LONG, like 550k+ words long. One of my favorites of all time.

If you want something a little shorter I recommend anything written by James Spookie. He typically does the Lord Potter type stuff.

  I got sick of seeing the same old shit, done the same old way, in Harry Potter Fan-fiction.So I decided to take as many new ideas as i could think of, while mixing in things that I have seen before in ways I haven't seen before.That means that while there will be graphic sex, among other things in this story, it won't be for a few chapters. Also there is an excessive number of content tags, but I want to be through, and rest assured anything tagged will be in the story at some point.
