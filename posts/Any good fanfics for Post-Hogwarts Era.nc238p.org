** linkffn(7374621) is the one fic I've found whose writing style closely resembles the original series. It takes place immediately after the Flaw in the Plan chapter and it almost reads like the eighth book.

  In the morning after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry felt tired. In the morning after the morning after, he was downright exhausted. The war may be over, but there are still battles to be fought.

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.
