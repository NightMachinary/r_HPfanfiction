** Not familiar with Alex Varus but the most extreme "brainy Harry" story is ROMPH spelled backwards, which this subreddit mostly hates. It has its own subreddit and fandom which only slightly overlaps regular HP fandom. It is complete, around 600k words, weaker in the first 50k or so (except for some good moments), has cringy sections throughout, but imho some parts are terrific.

It is at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108]] if you want to give it a try, plus it has its own web site mentioned there. Warning: it is not for everyone.

** I think he's more cunning than intelligent (not that he isn't intelligent) in linkffn(On the Way to Greatness). The first few chapters feel like rehashes of canon but it becomes far more original as the story progresses.

Also I have to recommend linkao3(1113588). Hope you don't mind a very morally grey Harry.
