So... any time Harry gets new robes for any reason, it's always green or dark green or almost black with a green sheen or emerald, etc.

Just... why. XD I know, Harry has green eyes and they are exceptionally green. That's fantastic, Harry! You've got something good going for you, Harry!

Green in good shade will make eyes pop out, yes, but there are other colours out there, but it's always green.

I don't blame even one author because to be completely honest - if I were to write anything, I'd probably give Harry robes /with some amount of green/ in them too.

But, I don't know about you, unless I stand quite close to someone the only thing I'm able to say about someone's eyes is that /they're there/. Maybe if they're light or dark.

So let's go all out, let's give Harry robes in black, deep wine-red, navy blue! His eyes will still be there and still be green! :D


** Because Harry has avada kedavra green e̶y̶e̶s̶ orbs and everything only exists to increase the greenness of his e̶y̶e̶s̶ orbs

** Most of the time things like this are done so that Harry stands out, even more, his eyes are special " Killing Curse Green" They're bright they shine, they are a focal point. I know this girl she has silver/grey eyes, you can see them from easily 15 feet away if you look her in the face they are that... ABRUPT.

​

Choosing clothes that fit well with who he is and what he is going to do are important, in a lot of fics where he gets these new fics its because it is a Slytherin Harry, or he is trying to appeal to the Pureblood society. Showing himself in their colors will help greatly even subconsciously.

​

Next we have the question of why green. a lot of science actually goes into color coordination, and what we think of when we see someone. In-universe this probably isn't as well known but there are some people who would obviously know of this, clothiers being a part of that group. Green with Green... Pops for lack of a better word, it draws the attention and with what Harry is known for; Surviving the killing curse, reminding people of that may act as subtle intimidation. this is the boy who lived he who shrugged off a killing curse and in recent years has fought and will continue to fight Voldemort.

​

Personally, I'm not even sure what color I would put Harry in as the green works on so many levels and for so many reasons. It doesn't help that my favorite color is also...green

** Probably a mix of the eyes bit and his dress robes. I think they were bottle green? That, plus the whole eyes bit, I guess.

** Well, you kinda answered yourself. His eyes are green, and if we're talking about a Slytherin!Harry fic, that's even more the reason. Black goes well with anything, and looks sleek and elegant too.

** It's to match his eyes, or his House depending on which house he is in. IRRC his canon robes had highlights in green too.

Normally this is helped by the fact his eyes tend to be quite noticeable.

** First of all, I don't know how any of you replied because I couldn't post anything yesterday. xD Second of all, I don't see it either on this reddit or in my posts or anywhere. x''D

Also - I know green and green pops out and yeah, feel free to give him green robes as well, but /come on/, other colours are fine too, it's not like his entire wardrobe has to be coordinated to match his eyes. xD It's tired and boring. Let him wear other colours too.

Be like Dumbledore - say "Fuck it!" to all fashion conventions and just wear eye-searing robes with patterns all over the place! :D
