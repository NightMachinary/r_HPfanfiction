A story were somehow harry comes across or creates a ritual to give himself an immunity to Atrophy(Atrophy meaning the decline in effectiveness or vigour due to underuse or neglect.).

I don't how he comes across it for all I care Oliver wood could have him do the Ritual at the end of first year so that his quidditch skills would not Atrophy over the summer holidays.


** that's oddly specific.

*** I like it though. It is a cool ability while not being too overpowered.

*** At first its seems like a weak minor ritual but think about what it would be like to have your skills,body,mind, abilities, ect never Atrophy, to have it not matter how long you haven't used a skill 5 seconds or a hundred years your skill had not deteriorate at all from the last time you used it.

** It IS oddly specific and a bit tricky but interesting and doable. A more interesting ritual may be a muggleborn handing Harry it to keep his body from losing its edge during the summers as he can't fly or do magic. Cue unintended side effect of protecting and restoring Harry for a not-very-nurturing childhood and get all deep maybe?
