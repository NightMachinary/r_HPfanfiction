** sorry but that sounds like the perfect recipe for 3 different options:

1) found family where harry is raised by a lovable group of ragtag criminals.

2) harry escapes with accidental magic. you can go anywhere from there. does he grow up on the streets? is he found by an adult?

3) The criminals fake harry's death, release him far away, and just keep committing crimes. this is a good recipe for a crossover or harry getting left in a forest and getting adopted by the fae.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

***** I can relate. When I'm just browsing for fics to read, I usually will skip incomplete ones (and absolutely skip ones clearly marked as abandoned).

That said, my inbox just now has a new chapter for a fic that hadn't been updated in two years, which is why I subscribe/follow those fics. Several seemingly-abandoned fics I follow have gotten new chapters in the past year. (Some that were previously being actively worked on have NOT, which is saddening, but I still am optimistic.)

Some abandoned fics have such wonderful ideas that I enjoy rereading them, even if there is no resolution. So while it's frustrating not to have the story complete, I'd rather have what is there than not. Life is a journey, not a destination.

** There is a certain cynicism that one learns to adopt as a dhampir. We are beneath our sires, reviled by other non-humans, and outright despised by most of the rest of the magical world. Most of us stay where we are safest, near our sires, but safety is relative when your prospects are limited to “daylight-capable operator.” Those of us that get away from the covens and courts find life no more pleasant. You're an outsider looking in no matter where you go. Either way, we learn not to hope for much; Just that things won't get worse.

The kid looked like he had stopped hoping a long time ago. He couldn't be older than seven or eight.

“Told you.”

He had told me, he just didn't tell me how bad it was.

I was contacted for a ransom job by an old British squib. Her neighbors were abusing their nephew, a wizard, and she wanted to put the fear of Svarog into them for it. I took the job for half rate, both because the targets were non-magical and to get away from the overwhelming stench of cat piss.

The squib provided me with the target's normal schedule and a rough layout of neighborhood, so it only took a couple days to figure out the best time to pick him up. He liked to hang around with his friends after school and go looking for trouble. All I had to do was plant a pack of drugged beers near one of their hangouts and wait to collect sleeping dumpling.

I did not count on the wizard kid to come looking for his cousin, or that he'd try to stop me, or that he'd be powerful enough to send us both to the Shetland Isles in a fit of accidental magic.

In retrospect, it's not all that surprising that the kid could do that. I still don't get why he did it, though. His cousin's an asshole.

Left with no quick way back to get the target before he woke up and a magically exhausted kid on my hands, I took the wizard and adjusted the plan. I took him to the safehouse, gave him a cursory physical and a Pepper-Up, fed him, and called his family.

The kid begged me not to, said they wouldn't pay, but fearfully shut right up after being told to quiet down just once. I knew they wouldn't pay for him, that's why their neighbor called me.

When they picked up I delivered my altered ultimatum: Pay a modest ransom for their nephew or I will abduct their son as well and triple the price. Attempt to involve the authorities and I will deliver their nephew and evidence of their abuse to the wizarding authorities.

The response was venomous and smugly satisfied: “Keep him.”

*** I knew Uncle Vernon wouldn't pay to get me back, even if he thought Dudley was in danger, but when the kidnapper went still it hurt anyway. Maybe even more than usual, since I know what it means when people freeze like that. They don't like it when they find out there's something wrong with me and don't know how to react. They go all stiff and their faces look strained. Sometimes they start acting really polite and try to make it look like they didn't notice, but I guess Uncle Vernon must have hung up because the kidnapper didn't say anything for a while. He just stood there.

“Told you.” He didn't say anything back, just nodded a bit, which hurt even more. He'd been surprisingly nice even though he's a kidnapper. A kidnapper from America, by his accent. He didn't get angry or hit me when I tried to fight him off Dudley, or when I accidentally did something that put us on a small island. He even made sure I was okay and gave me a sandwich and a weird tasting energy drink in a cool bottle. Now he was probably going to get rid of me.

It just hurt. My head hurt and my heart hurt and my eyes stung, but I quickly wiped the tears away before the kidnapper could turn around and see. I shouldn't cry in front of people, it makes them uncomfortable..

“Are you going to kill me?” I asked when I was sure my voice wouldn't crack. He turned around and looked at me with an expression I've never seen before. Perhaps it was his eyes that made it strange, they both had two colors in them. Around his pupils they were dark gold-ish, and around that they were blue. He turned away again and looked like he was thinking hard about something.

“No,” he said, “I don't kill kids.” He paced slowly around the room, rubbing his chin.

“Oh,” That was good, at least. Or maybe it wasn't. If he wasn't going to kill me then he would probably send me back, or drop me off somewhere and I would have to find my own way back or maybe get lost and have to find someplace to stay or-

“Hey,” He had come closer when I wasn't paying attention and startled me. I hurriedly wiped more tears out of my eyes and looked up at him. His face was more gentle now. “You'll be alright. I'm not going to hurt you. This was not planned, but you are in no danger because of it. Okay?”

I didn't know what to say to that, so I just nodded that I understood. He nodded back and went to place a chair across from where I sat on a simple bed.

“Why are you doing this?” I asked. I didn't expect an answer, but he seemed like he wanted to be nice so I asked to see how he would react. He stared at me for a few moments like he was weighing something in his head before sitting down.

“Because I was hired to kidnap and ransom your cousin, and failed.” I was as shocked to get an answer as I was by the answer. The fact that he sounded honest was even more surprising. “After you apparated us to the Shetland Isles I had to bring you back here to make sure you weren't magically exhausted and adjust my approach. You know how that went... Are you alright?”

“I...” I couldn't answer him, I wasn't really looking at him anymore. I thought this was about my strangeness, that he kidnapped me because of what I did to get him away from Dudley. I was too scared to notice that this stranger, this foreign kidnapper hadn't refrained from getting angry at me for what I did, he hadn't reacted at all. He didn't even talk about it or ask me about it, just mentioned it in passing. He had a name for it, and was worried for my health because of it. He called it magic as if it were a real thing.

“Hey, kid!” He barked, snapping my attention back to him. He looked concerned. “I'm sorry, I didn't mean to set you off like that. I won't mention your family again if it makes you anxious.”

“No,” I tried to keep my voice steady but the words came out all watery. I don't know why I was crying again. I shouldn't cry in front of people, it makes them uncomfortable.

“Okay, we'll stay off that topic. It's alright.”

“No,” I said again, a little less shaky this time. “Not that.”

“No?” His eyebrows furrowed, concerned and a little confused now too. “Can you tell me what's wrong?”

“I... What did you call it, what I did?”

“Apparition?” He frowned in further confusion, then his face slowly went through a few other expressions. Concern, deep thought, alarm, and finally recognition. I realized with sinking dread that I must have said something wrong. I shrunk back onto the bed, pulled my knees up and tried to prepare for what always came after.

“You don't know, do you?” he asked in a soft voice, “You don't know what you are.”

He was wrong, I did know what I am. “I'm a freak.”

“No!” He moved to stand, reaching out toward me, but froze partway up when I braced. The hit didn't come. When I peeked over my knees he was sitting down again, holding his hands out apologetically. He didn't look angry or concerned or pitying. His face was calm, but his eyes were different. They looked older, duller. They just looked... tired. Like some of the old men that come to school with their grandkids on Veterans day.

“You're not a freak, kid. You-“

“Harry.”

He nodded patiently, “You're not a freak, Harry. You're a wizard.”

** The Stalone Mafia was the most feared gang in all of Britain, with a vast reputation for immeasurably violent murders, robbing, and even the odd randsome here and there. The Stalone's were mastiful, they always got what they want, when the want. Of course, the police had a tendency to get in the way, but with their gangs lifetime of experience, it wasn't too hard to get out of such a pickle, only a mild hindrance.

Well, it usually was simple. It usually was just a simple crime with decent pay at the end of it, at least until today that is.

Markus Stalone stood outside the door of a room, where their victim was sat strapped to a chair. His head slowly moved around, as though he was bored, yet there was obvious fear in those vibrant green eye's. The boy must have only been about five, yet he seemed so terribly small and thin that he was obviously malnourished. And the most peculiar scar was on his forehead- that which looked like a lightning bolt. Markus could only assume it was from abuse- it was too deep, too distinct in shape. It seemed as though someone had gone out of their way to torture the boy.

"What fuckwit would just give their child away like that?! He didn't even ask for money!" His lover, Anthony, ranted as he stalked the room, as though trying to stop grusteskly murdering someone and putting his anger into the way he walked. "The kids doesn't even seem to be that frightened of us! What was he even going through back at that grossly perfect looking Lego metropolis! What are we going to do with him?"

"We could always get money off him by sending him through human traffic- fuck! What was that for!?" Markus cursed, rubbing the side of his face from where Anthony had sliced his cheek with a knife. "You haven't pulled a knife on me since I broke into your house back in high school!"

"That, was for the stupid suggestion." Anthony declared, slipping his knife back into a hidden pocket of his jeans. "We are /not/ putting him through that." Anthonys gaze softened as he turned away, looking through the glass and back into the room of the child. "...You know Mark, he reminds me of you in your younger days. Meek, a bit scruffy, got some wit about him too... yes, I'm keeping him."

Markus eyes widened as he watched his blond lover, looking at him as though he'd grown two heads. "You're... keeping him?"

Anthony turned back around, and as sly as a snake, wrapped his arms around Markus's neck, a stray hand ruffling Markus's dark ebony hair. "Yes, you know how I've always wanted to start a family. And... I always wanted a child." Anthony's hand moved up to cup Markus's hand which still sat on his cheek. "And besides, he looks like the pair of us. He even has my eyes."

"And my hair." Markus supplied, before sighing lightly. "Fine, but your going to take care of him most-"

Anthony was already squealing, and with a roll of his eyes, Markus kissed his lover on the lips.

  Warnings Inside. Dumbledore ought to have known better than to leave an orphaned Harry Potter in the hands of the Dursleys. A twist of fate has the boy-who-lived living with criminals. Sly, cunning, street-smart, sorted into Slytherin where his housemates have been raised to hate him, will Harry survive? Or maybe it's the House of Snakes that doesn't stand a chance.

** Sort of what you were describing in an early status

Birth of a Villain

Chapter 1 -- Evil on Fluttering Wings

The fat man struggled to rise from his chair when the front door for #4 Privet Drive exploded into his sitting room.

"Did you think you'd get away with it, Dursley?" the first of the intruders asked conversationally. The tall thin man was clad in black tights with a golden-orange jerkin, golden-orange boots, gloves, wings, antennae, a belt buckle in the shape of a butterfly, and elaborate goggle-masks with red lenses.

"Selling defective drills is bad enough," his shorter, fatter companion continued. This pudgy fellow was in a similar butterfly-themed outfit. "But selling them to us is a form of suicide."

Vernon Dursley quaked under the gaze and weapons of the two costumed henchmen, his terror only grew when the leader of the Fluttering Horde strode into the ruined sitting room.

"Dr. Girlfriend says we can expect the Po-Po to be along in 9 minutes, so let's make this snappy," The Monarch sneered. "I want the replacement drills, Dursley, and all of my money back."

Sales. Vernon's fear consumed mind suddenly realized that this was yet another sales opportunity and went into its negotiation mode. "You asked for cheap drills and cheap drills you got, Monarch," he blustered. "If you want to upgrade, it will cost you."

"Henchman 24?" The man in the butterfly costume ordered.

The thinner of the henchmen fired his pistol into Vernon's left knee. Dursley grasped at the ruined joint and screamed in agony.

Seven-year-old Dudley Dursley thundered down the stairs to find out what was happening while seven-year-old Harry Potter peeked out the door of his cupboard.

"Top of the line drills, Dursley," the Monarch sneered. "And the full 100,000 pounds returned in full. Do I make myself clear?"

Vernon nodded through his pain.

"Good," the Monarch nodded. "Henchman 24, to make sure Dursley understands how serious I am, grab his son as a reminder that one never crosses the Malevolent Monarch!"

Henchman 24 stooped to lift a squirming, squalling, Dudley from the ground. Then he repositioned his grip and tried again. And then again, "Jeeze Monarch, this kid weighs a ton."

"What about this one?" Henchman 21 asked gesturing toward the curious Harry Potter.

"Whatever," the Monarch said dismissively, "a kid's a kid."

"You're coming with us, little fella," Henchman 24 said to Harry as he was lifted from the ground.

"Okay," Harry said, speaking for the first time since the explosion.

Outside Harry and Henchman 21 climbed into the back seat of the purple Monarch Mobile (which bore a suspicious resemblance to a 1973 Dodge Dart with wings spot welded on) and waited for the Monarch and Henchman 24 to finish threatening Vernon and join them.

"Don't worry, little guy, no one is going to hurt you, the guild has strict rules about kids."

"Okay," Harry said again. "What's a guild?"

"A guild is an organization that controls other organizations," Henchman 21 explained. Seeing that the boy clearly didn't understand, he continued. "You go to school, right?"

"Yes, sir," Harry nodded energetically.

"Oh, don't call me sir," Henchman 21 laughed. "Save that for the Monarch. Call me, 21. Anyway, your school has its teachers, who are in charge of the classes, and the principal who is in charge of the teachers, right?"

"The headmistress, Mr. 21?" Harry asked hesitantly.

"Right, the headmistress," 21 nodded. "Well, she's got a boss too, the school board."

"Okay," Harry nodded.

"That's how our organization works," 21 continued. "We have squad leaders who are in charge of the troops, they're like the teachers. The Squad leaders work for the Monarch who is like your Headmistress, and The Monarch reports to the Guild of Calamitous Intent, who is like the School Board."

"Oh," Harry nodded as the Monarch and Henchman 24 got in the car. "You're really smart."

"There's something no one has ever said before," Henchman 24 snarked.

"That's for sure," the Monarch agreed.

"Hey, I'll have you two know that I got my G. E. D.," 21 responded snippily.

Harry has a sneaking suspicion that this might turn out to be fun.

*/Super Villain/*

"Woah," Harry said in wide-eyed wonder. "You've got more toys than Dudley!"

Henchman 21 stood proudly next to his massive display of collectibles. "They're not toys, Harry," he said gently. "They're collectibles, most of them are mint in box."

"They're freaking toys, 21," Henchman 24 said, shaking his head. "Here you go kid," 24 continued, handing Harry a metallic cylinder that looked quite like a torch.

"Thank you, Mr. 24," Harry said accepting the device, never noticing the pained look that showed clearly through 21's mask. Harry pressed the button on the cylinder and a three-foot-long shaft of glowing plastic shot forth, and the cylinder started to issue a metallic hum that changed tone as he waved the simulated laser sword around. "Wow!"

"That's a first-run replica of Ace Cody's Fusion sword from the original Star Smashers trilogy," 21 explained. "Of course, I've got another one, still mint in box, but this one is for cosplay."

"Star Smashers trilogy?" Harry asked.

"The original trilogy," 21 continued, "Not to be confused by the horrible prequels where access to the Bleed was caused by a special kind of Amoebic dysentery."

"The Bleed?" Harry asked, truly confused by the devotion 21 had toward his toys, as nice as they were.

"The Bleed," 21 continued, his voice taking on a mysterious timbre, "is the vitality field formed by all living things. It surrounds us, infiltrates us, and fixes the universe's complications."

"Oh jeeze," 24 sighed.

"This is... real?" Harry asked.

"What? No," 24 explained. "This is all from some silly movies. 21 just gets all fanboy about this sort of thing."

"Oh," Harry nodded. "I've never been to the cinema."

"You've never seen Star Smashers?" 21 demanded. Upon seeing Harry's head shake, he pulled out three videotapes. "Harry, you're in for a treat!"

24 and Harry watched as 21 fussed about setting up his television and VCR to his satisfaction. "So, who's Dudley anyway?" 24 asked.

"Excuse me, Mr 24?"

"Dudley," 24 pressed. "You looked at 21's crap and said he had more toys than Dudley."

"He's my cousin," Harry explained. "You met him today."

"The fat kid I couldn't lift?"

"Yup," Harry agreed. "He has lots of toys."

"More than you, eh?" 24 laughed.

"Oh, I don't have any toys," Harry sighed. "Uncle Vernon said that maybe this year I'll get something for Christmas though."

"Hmm," 24 nodded, wondering if maybe he should have shot Vernon Dursley a few more times.

​

​

- So basically, having Harry around blunts Mrs. Doctor Monarch's maternal drives, so the Monarch, who isn't ready for that much of a commitment, keeps Harry around to keep his wife from nesting.

- Periodically, a hero type (Like Captain Sunshine, but never the Ventures) returns Harry to his family, where he is rapidly re-kidnapped back to what he considers heaven on Earth. He decides that he wants to become a villain, and manages to pick up a Junior Membership in the Guild, then he starts going on crime sprees with 21 and 24, it is noticed that when Harry is along, the crimes succeed when he isn't don't.

He is made Henchman #2 (because #1 dies. A lot.)

Harry hates heroes. When he ultimately ends up at Hogwarts, he decides that Draco is a fledgling hero and Harry sets out to destroy him before he can achieve anything.

** It was always risky to do a job in the day, but their sources told them that it was very likely that the boy would not be left out of the view of his parents for quite a while other than this.

The family was called the Dursleys, and four people lived in the house, Vernon Dursley, who was a wealthy man who worked at Grunnings drill company, his wife, Petunia Dursley, who was a housewife, their son Dudley Dursley, who was six years old, and their nephew, Harry Potter, who was either five or six.

The team waited in their car as Petunia Dursley dragged the two children to the neighbor's, chatted with the elderly lady living in the house for a moment, then looked at the blond-haired boy to her left. After a few moments of the boy screaming at her, she nodded quickly and offered the boy a hug. She snapped at the child to her right before walking off with the blond.

the team held a quiet discussion, realizing that the boy who was walking away was their target.

"The other boy is their nephew, isn't he? We could just take him. He's still family, and they would be willing to pay, wouldn't they?"

The other two in the team agreed and waited as the boy was inside the house. Then, in the afternoon, he walked out, jumping along the sidewalk. the man in the back opened the door, and as the boy began to skip by, picked him up and threw him into the car. the man in the passenger seat covered the boy's head with a sheet while the boy struggled and the car started.

They were gone within moments.

​

When they arrived at their place, located very rurally, the boy was silent and still. The man from the backseat, who had long black hair and brilliant blue eyes, hoisted the boy up and carried him into the house.

The house was considerably unremarkable on the outside, although the inside was filled with luxuries stolen and bought. The man carried the boy down the stairs, to where a room was. The room would have looked like a very ordinary guest room if it weren't for the locks on the outside of the door, the ropes in the corner, and the lack of windows.

He tied the boy up and removed the sheet from his face, studying him carefully. Harry Potter was rather small, with incredibly pale skin that only seemed paler with the dark hair and the dark sheets and the bright outfit that hung off the boy like they were blankets rather than clothes.

The clothes puzzled the man. The Dursley boy wore nice ones that fit him well, while Potter's wouldn't fit him if he doubled in size.

The man left, locking the door firmly behind him. Upstairs, the other two sat at the counter, the phone between them.

"They do have a phone, correct?" he asked, although he knew it was a stupid question.

"Yes, Michael. We checked. They should be home by now, so call them."

He rolled his eyes as he lifted the heavy phone, dialed the number, and waited for the answer.

"Hello," a man grunted, obviously put off about answering the phone.

"Hello," Michael deepened his voice, making it impossible to tell who was speaking by voice alone, "We have your nephew. If you want him back-"

"We don't," the man cut him off, "We don't want him back. You can keep him."

Michael sat in silence for a moment, stunned, as the line went dead.

** The kidnappers, who are really just a pair of dumb second story men take the kid to their fence who just happens to be Remus Lupine or a friend of the Marauders and knows who Harry is. after questioning Harry about his home life The Fence takes the kid in and hides him from outside magical detection. the Fence takes the kid to his cousin's house, (some Slytherin or Ravenclaw like the Greengrass's or Davis Family) they raise the boy to be a magical thief and Keep Dumb-as-a-door of his back. at that point you have two options,

A) at age eleven Harry gets his letter and goes to Hogwarts with friends in Ravenclw or Slytherin so he's not sorted into Gryffendor. he befriends a few of the quiet and dangerous types and continues his job of thieving, i'm sure the castle is full of jewels, gold, and shiny things. the RoR alone is a goldmine of treasure. hijinks ensue in a very crack fic way.

B) Before age eleven Harry leaves the UK for the States or the continent, he's outside of the Hogwarts range and doesn't get a letter. he makes a name for himself as an international thief, life is good until he's called back to the UK by the Fence because his name came out of the GoF and he'll lose his magic if he doesn't compete. Basically GoF but with a slippery gentlemen thief that is armed to the teeth and cares little about the UK's opinion of how he gets the job done.

either way it could be fun with the same end goal, Harry defeats old Tom Riddle with his criminally gained skills at the same time he robes the Wizarding world blind and steals all the girls hearts.
