SOLVED I'm looking for a specific fix where Insane!MOD!Harry ends up on the train to Hogwarts with Tom Riddle. He ends up in hufflepuff(?) and is kind of the outcast. Harry goes by Azrael i believe. Ends up being TM/HP. Final clue is that I have a feeling it's got something to do with the word “October” but that could be BS. Thanks!


** I believe this is what you are looking for.

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, Tom/Lily and Tom/Harry, not threesome
