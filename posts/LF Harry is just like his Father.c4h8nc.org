Whether it's to annoy Snape who kept making that comparison when he wasn't, or for other reasons, a Harry that's like James. Does better in classes, torments Malfoy and Snivellus (They deserve it) becoming an Animagus at an early age (For whatever reason - because he found out his father did it and he's trying to live up to it or something)

No Slash, and No Hermione pairing ideally, but if it's a Hermione pairing make it more like Book 5 Hermione, and not Fanfiction I CAN DO NO WRONG EVEN DEATH EATER HARRY DOES AS I SAY Hermione.


** I prefer book 4 Hermione. Book 5 Hermione helped with the murtlap, but also pretty much shanghaied Harry into teaching DA.

  A collection of related one-shots spanning Hogwarts, where Hermione never has her Halloween epiphany and so the trio never forms, leaving Harry & Ron to bro their way through Hogwarts, forced to learn for themselves what they need to know.

  Expectations are funny things as the Wizarding world learns when introduced to a Harry that has inherited James' confidence and Lily's charm and a complete disregard to anything that doesn't affect him. Who cares about rocks and stuttering professors when they've got dragons and godfathers who didn't wait thirteen years to break out of prison to play with?

*** I liked that fic. Harry's competence level is nice and it just doesn't rehash canon.
