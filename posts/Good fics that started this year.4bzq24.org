Share FF that started this year that you feel is "well done."


** Do you mean within a year or since January? Some good ones always crop up during the holidays.

** linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House) and the sequel linkffn(The Hogwarts Six and The Darkest Wizard) (yes she actually completed a 270k word fic in 7 months). Imo the best SI in the HP fandom.

I'm choosing to interpret the request as "within the last 12 months", but the latter almost makes the 2016 cutoff as well.

  Fourth year has come, bringing Tournaments, Prophesies, Dark Lords, powerful magic, Death Eaters, politics, and rearranged geographical features. Follow Harry, Ron, Neville, Tracey, Daphne, and a Slytherin!Anti!Hermione as they deal with all of the above as well as the greatest danger of all; themselves. For what is more dangerous than capable, daring, teenage witches and wizards?

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** linkffn(11761312)

Fem Harry H/Hr femslash, is a sequel to a well-written story linkffn(11251745) that. though can get a little wordy, has realistic depictions of a growing teenage relationship with all the angst and self-discovery needed for a mature outlook. At the very least, it is written from a female perspective and tries to give more weight to the problems that witches face, which is a perspective that could be explored more in HP fics. It can be a little less descriptive and suffers from some bland writing. That said, the author has had an update schedule that she has kept for at least 10 months, so if you do like this WIP fic, you can have a little confidence of seeing this to the end

  Sequel to The Power of Love: Voldemort is back, the Ministry is in denial, and Dumbledore is stalling, but Jasmine isn't alone. She and Hermione are supported by new friends, defended by two shieldmaidens, and empowered by ancient magic. Eliminating Voldemort is the least of the tasks which prophecy expects from them, but how will these witches transform the whole magical world?
