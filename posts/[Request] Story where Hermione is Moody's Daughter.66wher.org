Hi! I've been trying to find this fanfic for a few months and can't find it anywhere - and I know I favorited it. Basically, Hermione was sent forward in time to present day to hide from Voldemort. Once she gets inducted into the present day Order, Dumbledore & Moody decide it's time to send her back to her proper time with the Mauraders, where she's James Potter's godsister & falls in love with Sirius. Does this sound familiar to anybody?

** Question: does she go by a different name in the future and fucks her kid while not knowing and is actually is their kid and goes back in time and fucks her father begore firing and teleporting their kid away creating a loop of awkwardness/inbreeding because if it is than it must be the best work of art ever except for the one where the horny teenagers families start cock blocking until they have a secret wedding and the girl decides to fake her death followed by the guy fucking what he thinks to be her still cooling corpse before they commit suicide hoping that their horcruxes worked and they can fuck each other forever as liches/wraiths.

The horcruxes didn't work...
