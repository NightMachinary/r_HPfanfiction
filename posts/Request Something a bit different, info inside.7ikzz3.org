Looking for stories with these pairings, can be other pairings as well.

With little to no character bashing, any rating any era is fine.

Not okay with Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, but any other pairing I'm fine with.

Pairings in particular I'm looking for:

Harry/Tonks, reading linkffn(Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass), loving it so far; with a few complaints with some of the way the characters are written. The way Tonks is written is really neat though.

Blaise/Parvati

Padma/Anthony

Luna/Draco: No Seer Luna please.

Ginny/Draco: Would rather it not be dark Ginny.

Harry/Non Ice Queen Daphne

Neville/Ginny

Hermione/Ron set after the war, maybe with some PTSD with Harry being a minor or reocurring character, as long as he isn't main character.

Seamus/Lavender set after the war. Maybe dealing with the attack that Greyback did to Lavender.

Susan/Draco: Doubt it's popular, but any story with a pairing with them would be great.

Any Hufflepuff/Slytherin pairing.

A Severus/Minerva friendship story, I don't ship them but I like the idea of the two of them being friends.

No Harems.

Those are just suggestions, any other pairing except for Harry/Hermione and Draco/Hermione is fine, anyone can be the main character not just Harry.

Please don't have Harry be incredibly powerful or super smart, a little more powerful or smart is okay just don't make it unbelievable.
