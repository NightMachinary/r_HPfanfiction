I've been trawling for this non-magic AU fic I must have been reading all the way back in 2005, 2006 or so, with no luck. I don't remember a lot about it, except that it was (I think) a British university AU, someone was an art student (when aren't they?) and someone either worked or performed with their band in a pub where someone else was bar staff - but my most vivid memory is of Remus owning an aquarium that Hermione (?) worked in. It was very lengthy and, at the time, extremely popular, and I'd love to find it again. Accio fic?


** Okay this is way late, but if you're still looking, the fic is [[http://dirtytrousers.livejournal.com/][Dirty Trousers]]. [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/ls9ottew8nyt73u/Dirty%20Trousers.pdf?dl=0][I also have a copy of the PDF saved]].

*** Oh my gosh, you are my HERO! Thank you for confirming I had not gone completely mad. Honestly, I think the nostalgia for 2007 has hit me hard, I'm all emotional :')

But seriously. THANK YOU. Now off to re-live my teenage years reading this on a dial-up modem.
