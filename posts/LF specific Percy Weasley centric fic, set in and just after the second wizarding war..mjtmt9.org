:END:
Percy has some form of natural legilimency where he had a sense of peoples intentions/actions? He has a short relationship with a guy during the war who is spying on him, to see if he is a traitor to the ministry. They sleep together and while the guy thinks Percy is sleeping he searches Percy's apartment. While he is doing this even though Percy can't see him he knows what the spyguy is doing.

I'm pretty sure it was on AO3 but I can't seem to find it so it may have been deleted, hoping not though. Thanks.

*** Yes! This is it, thanks. I completely forgot about everything with Cedric.

Hope your day goes well.
