Right, I don't remember much about it except it was a site of its own based on HP fanfic but it only featured purebloods/death eaters. So it was fine to write a story about whoever as long as the pairing was with someone in those categories.

It probably isn't even around anymore but I posted a couple of Hermione/Lucius fics on it years ago and wondered if they were still about.

*** Thank you, I found it!

It's defunct now which is a shame but at least I know which it was. It was Granger Enchanted, the Malfoy Manor section.

Edit: my description was hopeless, I didn't remember it being a specifically Hermione site!

**** I remember a group of people trying to compile an archive of the site when it first shut down, but I'm not sure if it was ever completed.
