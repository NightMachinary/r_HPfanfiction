He would have been a Voldemort/Dumbledore-level wizard.

Think about it. Snape is already one of the most skilled wizards in the franchise who's not one of the big three (Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindlewald). A master potioneer, invented and modified numerous spells and potions while in school, a master Occlumense, skilled in legilimency, the dark arts, and non-verbal magic, can cast a corporeal patronus, and a pretty capable duelist.

We also know that depression can inhibit magical ability (discussed in relation to Tonks in Half-Blood Prince, also Merope, also probably why Dementors are so effective). And Snape was miserable for most of his life.

Imagine how powerful a happy Snape would have been.


** There's a difference between depression and unhappiness. Tonks does not lose her ability to cast magic (she duels death eaters and fixes Harry's nose). She casts the patronus! Feeling incredibly unhappy! Merope did not go to Hogwarts and was raised by two inbred idiots, which probably explains her poor magical abilities. Dumbledore was plagued throughout life by what happened to his father, his sister, with Grindelwald, and with his brother throughout his life. He was so haunted by his sister that he put on Gaunt's ring, because of how tempted he was by the ring, despite the fact that he knew it was probably a trap. Yet Dumbledore is one of the most powerful wizards.

Snape invented spells and did well academically, but that doesn't guarantee that someone will be on the level of Dumbledore or Voldemort. The latter have an unusual talent for magic.

*** Snape's abilities were more than academic though- as I noted, he could cast a corporeal patronus, perform non-verbal magic skillfully, was a capable duelist, and was if anything Voldemort's better in the field of Legilimency/Occlumency.

And the ability for one's mental/emotional state to affect one's magical ability is clearly considered possible in-universe.

Which means very little considering that Harry taught that spell to most of the DA in a few hours.

He slapped a 16yo around and invented a good cutting curse. Other than that we see very little of Snape fighting and honestly more of his potion improvements. Which were way more impressive tbh.

*** Tonks casts a very weak Patronus, which I think was [[/u/AntonBrakhage][u/AntonBrakhage]]'s point. Her depression directly affected her magic.

Dumbledore's grief was a /century/ old, so it stands to reason that he'd worked through it enough to regain his skills. There's no indication of what he was like immediately after Ariana died.

Snape's grief was much more recent, and was constantly reinforced by him having to live at Hogwarts and be surrounded by people who reminded him of the source of his grief..

** Yeah fuck no...a patronus is done by a 13 year old Harry so nothing special

He beat a 16 year old...well done

He invented a lethal cutting curse and made notes in a potions book...like the Marauders did the map and they were all animagi apart from Moony who could probably be one if he wasn't a werewolf

He was good at Occlumency and legiliemncy...so he was good at Occlumency I'll give you that but we don't know how good he was at legilimency cos him doing it against an untrained 16 year old will make him look op. Also it doesn't mean he's very powerful.

Like Voldemort was depressed half the time and didn't love anything but he became super powerful so it doesn't mean that happiness will make you stronger

And we don't know if he was better than the other Marauders as we don't see much of their magical ability so he has no chance of being the next super powerful wizard.

Harry has more of a chance if he grew up in the wizarding world, was encouraged to study but not obsessively like Hermione and actually tried in school. He threw off voldy's imperious at 15, which all full grown wizards (apart from maybe Dumbledore) could never do including Barty crouch at.

*** 1. Remus said the patronus is exceptionally advanced magic.

2. He escaped McGonnagle, Flitwick, and... was it Slughorn or Poppy during his escape scene. All are highly capable magically and Flitwick was reputed to be a master duelist.

3. James at least was also considered an exceptional wizard.

4. Not only good at Occlumency, but good enough to fool Voldemort.

5. No, of course its not a simple happiness=strong magic. But it IS canon that one's emotional state can inhibit magic.

6. Its true we don't absolutely know if he was better than the Marauders, but again, James (and Lily) at least are depicted as exceptional, and if Snape was in the same league in school, then its at least possible to imagine that he could have been bette runder other circumstances.

Harry is also exceptional at certain narrow aspects of magic (flying, dueling, most defensive magic). However, that's neither here nor there.

Perhaps Snape would not have been on the same tier as Dumbledore and Voldemort, but I'd say even canon Snape is solidly in the next tier down, along with James and Lily, Amelia Bones (at least from what Fudge said of her), and Tina from the Fantastic Beasts films (she was able to hold Grindlewald at least briefly in a duel). McGonnagle might be there as well, although outside of Transfiguration I don't know if she's all that exceptional.

** So ... arg, how to break it to ya ? Snape is not powerfull, he is educated. He knows many things, and is intelligent enough to use this knowledge to further his goals - be it creating new spells, potions, or playing for both sides. But it is never told that creating a spell is the mark of an uber powerfull wizard. Sure, he's good at occlumency. Apart from potions, it's the only thing he's really great at. Sure he knows his dark arts, but that's knowledge, not talent. Sure he can silent cast - so what ? They learn how to do that after their OWLs ! Corporeal patronuses ? Harry managed to teach several children how to cast it, meanwhile he learnt how to do it when he was 13. We never see him in an even fight. Either he's smacking a fraud, a 16 years old who's not done with his schooling, or he's jumping through the fucking window to flee - which means he's afraid of McGonagall, which means she's better than him. Also, depression doesn't magically seal your ... well, magic. Proof of concept ? Harry fucking Potter. He feels like he screwed up with Cedric then Sirius, and his depression takes the form of a massive anger at first, which then leads to a massive void in his heart. Results ? Nothing. Sure, you could agree that Tonks had problems - but that wasn't a loss of power, just a loss of motivation. Also, Merope, lmao. She wasn't weak because she had le big sad, but because she was the product of a massive incestuous relationship. Inject new blood, and poof, Tom Riddle Junior. Also, Harry was miserable for most of his life. He still is quite powerfull, for a minor then a yound adult.

*** "Snape is not powerfull, he is educated"

You have heard the saying "knowledge is power", I assume? There's a reason for it. People too often think of Potter magic as though its a video game, in terms of "power levels" where each person has x amount of innate power (ie the "magical cores" bullshit). While the evidence in canon points much more toward "power" mostly coming down to a combination of knowledge, memory, reflexes, and mental/emotional state.

Merope's lack of ability being due to incest is also a HUGE assumption. I'd say her utter lack of formal education probably played a big role in it. And yet, she was still able to brew an effective love potion. She's not innately unable- just brought up in circumstances that made it impossible for her to exercise her full abilities.

Dumbledore also cites her mental state in Half-Blood Prince as a possible reason for why she didn't/couldn't use magic to save herself IIRC.

**** It's not that huge of an assumption. If your family tree is full of crossing branches, then the kids are sure to have some problems. There was a king, in Spain, who lived less than 40 years, learnt how to talk only after his 6th year, and much more - all because of inbreeding.

Also, her father hated her in part because she couldn't do magic. If that's the case, then we're stuck in a chicken-egg situation.

Furthermore, Dumbledore didn't state she couldn't save herself, he said she didn't want to. Remember : she was alone, abandonned by the man she loved and came to believe loved her back, woth no money anf a chilf underway. It's not hard to think she'd believe suicide to be the best option. Or I guess, stop living.

Also, the way you think about how magic work is also like a videogame. You raise your int stat, your wis stat, keep yourself happy and voila you're strong.

I myself believe magic is like a muscle. A non vital one. Muggles don't have this muscle, and so can't even see things bathed in magic, like dementors. Squibs however, can see dementors because they have the muscle - it is just too small and atrophied (is that a word ? Don't remember) for them to train and use it. Some wizards then can be more powerfull than others because their magic muscle has more growth potential, but ultimately anyone that trains their magic will be better than someone who justs sits there pretty using an accio once in a blue moon.

With this way of thinking, you can actually understand why children are forbidden to use magic when they're not 11 - for the same reasons you shouldn't lift until you're 18. It stunts your growth.

** Yeah, Snape was able to duel 4 against 1, with those 4 being some of the most powerful wizards and witches in their world (Flitwick was even a dueling champion), they were dueling to kill while he was trying to avoid any harm coming to them, and they /still/ couldn't defeat him.

He's clearly insanely powerful, but Snape haters have a talent for denying reality, there's no arguing with them.

Also, the children learning the Patronus charm is an inconsistency, since Lupin says many adult wizards can never do it. And indeed, Snape's Patronus is the most detailed of all.

Plus, probably the best Occlumens in their world, but apparently that doesn't count as a mark of magical power, only magically punching people does?

Edit: Now that I think about it, does anyone other than these three /invent/ a spell? I can't think of any examples. And Snape was doing it as a teen.

And if people want to focus strictly on dueling... were Dumbledore and Voldemort particularly skilled? We seem them dueling each other so we know they were evenly matched, but we don't know how skilled they were compared to /other/ people.

*** The other possibility is that most children could learn it with half-decent instruction, and Wizarding education is just that shit.

Edit: Define "invent a spell"- the Marauders made the map in school. Fred and George created various joke items, but its unclear how much they invented and how much they just used old spells/potions in new ways. Hermione also used old spells in new ways (the protean charm on the coins for Dumbledore's army), but its unclear if she invented any new ones (the "Sneak" jinx possibly, since no one else was able to break it). Flammel appears to have been the only one to manage a Philosopher's Stone, and worked on the discovery of the uses of dragons' blood with Dumbledore, but his inventions are more in the realm of potions/alchemy than spells.

In backstory, of course, the Perevells created the Hallows and Herpo the Foul is credited with inventing Horcruxes and Basilisks.

**** I could see that also being a possibility, but wow, imagine the teacher being all "I'm not going to teach these children the alphabet, reading is /hard/, man" 😂

Then again, maybe Lupin in particular struggled with the Patronus? Because of his own issues? And sort of assumed it was a normal thing.

The Marauder's Map uses a Homonculous charm, a preexisting spell. They just applied it so that it would keep track of several people at once. Likewise for F&G, and Hermione - they use preexisting spells. Hermione didn't even think of the special use of Protean herself, she says she was inspired by the Dark Mark. She's very intelligent, clearly, but she isn't the sort to experiment and come up with something new.

Creating something from scratch? I don't think we see anyone else do that. I'm not referring to all wizards ever, of course, all spells were invented at some point by someone, just the characters we see more frequently in the books.

Edit: Just remembered, both the Wizengamot and Harry's examiner during the OWLs (who sees dozens/hundreds of children every year) are very impressed with him casting a corporeal Patronus. So clearly it's not common. And yet we have Harry teaching the others in the same book, so it's not like JKR decided to change the lore between novels. No idea what the explanation is.

***** Harry is just that awesome a teacher, I guess.

Honestly, I think he'd do better taking the DADA job post-war than being an Auror. Harry is too much of a rule-breaker, and too honest, to be a natural fit in a government office, I think. If that seems like a contradiction, well...

You might get away with being a rule-breaker if you're also a good team-player/brownnoser, and can get your colleagues to cover for you. You can get away with being honest if you play by the rules. By I have a hard time seeing someone who is an honest rulebreaker lasting long in a high-level government job.

I do believe Flammel invented stuff from scratch, but in the field of alchemy, not spells.

Oh yes, I think he did too, but he's also considered extraordinary even among wizardkind.

Honestly, their society seems very stagnant and uninterested in research. Which I guess is the natural consequence of having magic that can solve almost all of your problems. No incentive to look further. Even Snape's spells are more the result of being bullied and wanting to have something to defend himself (a spell to prevent being eavesdropped on, a spell to trip someone chasing you, a spell that works like Diffindo), rather than pure creative drive. I think Levicorpus might be the exception, it seems like an early attempt at a flying spell (might have been inspired by seeing Lily fly, as a child)
