** New-ish: linkffn(12484195) .. fic started in May, still consistently updating. Has a “Rise of the Wizards” vibe going in newer chapters.

Also try linkffn(12642061) but it is pretty bashy.

** I would be interested in a similar premise but where the story focuses on Hermione, not harry. Either at Hogwarts, or even better, he continually fails without her and she has to live with the consequences of being Muggleborn in a world without harry potter

*** Why would Harry fail without Hermione? Shouldn't it be the opposite? Book knowledge wouldn't bring you far outside a school situation. I hardly believe that she would have survived the troll with books.

**** He would probably have been a bit better academically without the answerbot if he had to seek out his own answers instead of just having them conveniently provided.

Or he would wind up in an early grave one exploding snap, quidditch, or chess game at a time.

He would have been a bit worse socially without Hermione, though, from a canon perspective.

***** I agree with the two first part but don't understand the third one. Isn't Hermione one of the reason why Harry doesn't have more friends? I mean, she is obviously annoying to have around (she don't have any friends except for Harry and Ron) so maybe that's why nobody wanted to befriend the most famous teen in British Territory. Because nobody want to bear Hermione even if the price was befriending a star.

****** I mean that he's not very well socialized. He doesn't seem to be that good at it. He latched onto the first decent person to talk to him on the train and they were insta-besties. It probably could have been anyone who wasn't a total dick--so not Malfoy--and he would have latched onto them, too. He never had friends. He never learned to make friends. He just doesn't seem good at it.

Edit: Hermione may have kept people away, but I'm not convinced that her not being around would allow him to befriend them, anyway.

******* I agree about Harry's aptitude to sociolize at his first year, but as he grew up, or even during his first year, he would have probably adapted. Hermione was the factor that kept people to befriend him. During none of the books, do we see anyone who introduce himself to Harry, trying to befriend him. Even when Ron was away during fourth year, so it's not Ron the problem but Hermione. Harry however, managed to befriend almost all member of the D.A and the Quidditch team.

I'm going to counter your argument by mentioning that both the DA and Quidditch were basically forced upon him. They weren't his idea and he didn't seek them out. When you spend so much time with someone, it's hard to not become friendly at least--unless they're a total dick, e.g. Malfoy.

I guess my argument is that he's not incapable of friendship, he's just not going to go out of his way to find it--based on who he was in the beginning. Later, I think he would avoid new people just because he didn't want to deal with fanboys/girls (Colin Creevey, etc.) and "Chosen One" bootlickers.

**** It's just an AU idea. You could argue that without Hermione, Harry would not have been successful in the end. We don't know that of course. It's just one of many possibilities.
