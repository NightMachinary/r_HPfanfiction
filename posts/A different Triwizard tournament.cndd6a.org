I've read so many fics where people just use the tournament from canon as a main base for their story whilst have a slightly different sub-plot....I want to see something different. An example of this is The Lie I've Lived by Jbern. Please rec


** Black Queen series by Silently Watches has a different tournament, more tasks, junior and senior contestants. But the series is quite dark in places which isn't to everyones taste.

Triwizard tournament is in the first book.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** In my series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn), the Triwizard Tournament is decently different, with three age divisions and some new tasks. The series features Harry, Ron, and Hermione in Slytherin and a healthy dose of politics and worldbuilding. Also, no bashing and no child politicians!

  Chessmaster Volume I. AU. Harry discovers that cleverness is the best way to outwit Dudley and his gang, which leads to a very different Sorting. While Harry and his friends try to unravel Hogwarts' various mysteries, the political tension in the Wizengamot reaches new heights as each faction conspires to control the fate of Wizarding Britain. Sequel complete.

** Linkffn(Hallowed) features different tournament events, different competitors from Beauxbatons/Durmstrang, and a different Harry (6th year who entered on purpose and wins the nomination legitimately). Highly recommend, though it's likely a dead fic - I think the Transfiguration challenge is particularly unique and interesting

  Once upon a time, three brothers came up with a plan to change the world forever. Centuries later, wizards still fight over the scraps of their power. However, only one person can truly lay claim to their destiny. AU. Harry/Lisa Turpin pairing in later chapters.

** Linkffn(Patron by Starfox5)

It's 4 tasks themed after Fire, Water, Air and Earth, and the entire thing has never been canceled and is still going on after centuries. And Harry has to seriously win, because whoever manipulated the goblet entered Hermione as part of the prize (it's from a time when slavery wasn't unusual). Also, it's filled with assassination attempts instead of kidnapping because Voldemort decided that kidnapping a celebrity with hundreds watching isn't that great of an idea.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
