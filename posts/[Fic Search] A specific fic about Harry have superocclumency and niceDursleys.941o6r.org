I think instead of Dudley the Dursleys had two daughters and that's what made them kinder to Harry as he was their only "son". Harry's occlumency power let him reach into peoples minds and copy blocks of info from their mind and transfer it into his own (e.g. he could copy german from some rando's mind and then he would know german) The dursleys and Harry were on the run and living life out of motels for some reason that I can't remember. At some point in the story Harry had all of his memories wiped and the story got really weird and I dropped it there. I /think/ the story title was one word maybe hunter or hunted but that could have been the author's name.


** Mastermind, I think
