In the mood for some OP Harry stories, give me your favorites! Also please let me know what the pairing is! Thanks!


** linkffn(Blindness)

Most fics with a powerful Harry are awful because the author endows a character with great power, but then fails to let them use that power. That isn't the case in Blindness. This fic is a good read, has some interesting exploration of magic.

**** Sorta.

He develops a sort of "Mage Sight" that lets him see the world/things/people/etc as shades of color. And that's were the OP really starts coming into play. As the story goes on Harry starts to see how magic interacts with the world, then how people auras start affecting things around them and then how souls might be real.

Honestly I've really enjoyed the story so far, and keep meaning to do a reread.

***** I'm thoroughly enjoying the more socio-political bent the fic is taking after Voldemort.

Many fics just handwave the ending as 'oh, society improved, less bigotry etc etc' but this actually dives into what precisely that might take to accomplish.

Not to mention all the research into the Hallows.

Overall one of my favourite current fics now that Philosophize finished his Fem!Harry trilogy in December.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** linkffn(Rise of the Wizards) is an emphatic rejection of the pro-muggle 'magic bashing' that's oddly common in fanfic. Harry is always a sympathetic protagonist either, which I like.

(Rather terrifyingly, it also predicts Trump's presidency well in advance. I now eagerly await my new magical overlords.)

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

*** Don't see how the Merging Harry is OP. He constantly says how he'd get thrashed by the top tier and barely survived the Ministry battle with Dumbledore at his side.
