:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Sorry if I make any mistakes on this post, I'm new.

So I read this fic ages ago and now I want to read it again but can't find it. I'm almost positive it takes place during The Philosopher's Stone time frame.

So Harry goes with Snape to Diagon Alley, they're in the bookshop and Snape let's Harry pick some extra books because it'll help with his education. Harry finds a book on the Dark Arts fascinating and Lucius spot's this (and obviously finds it ballsy and a little funny) and if I remember right Narcissa finds little Harry adorable?

Any help would be greatly appreciated~!


** Are you sure it was Lucius? Because there's one where Draco comes across Harry reading a book on Dark Arts in the bookstore, and he and Narcissa invite Snape and Harry for lunch. Narcissa even says that Lucius will be sorry he missed lunch with them, and she and Snape share secret smiles because Lucius is actually the one who wrote the book. Harry doesn't meet Lucius until a later date.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
