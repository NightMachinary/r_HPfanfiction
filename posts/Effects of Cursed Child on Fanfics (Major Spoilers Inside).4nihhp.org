The plot of CC has been almost universally panned here, but lots of authors will write fics based on characterizations in the Play. Here are some what happened in the play:

- Albus, Rose, and Scorpius are confirmed to be the new trio. Scorose is now a sure thing (although popular in the fandom for a long time). Scorbus is still a possibility.

- Scorpius is a great guy, Rose is cool, and Albus is decent.

- Hermione without Ron becomes Snape 2.0. Hermione with Ron becomes the MoM and a generally nice person.

- Ginny is very important to Harry, she is pretty much the only person who can confront Harry's stubbornness.

- Draco is fully redeemed. Astoria was a great person.

- Voldemort and Bellatrix had given birth to another psycho named Delphi, who grew up under Rowle's care.

- Cedric's death was 'good riddance', because he would turn out to be one of the most promising death eaters, killing Neville in the process.

So, who's your take on that?

No.

Just. No.

That's like making Neville a death eater. /Canon/ Neville, whose parents lie in the long term ward in Mungo's. There is /no conceivable reason/ for someone like Cedric to become something the exact opposite of what we know him to be, working for people the exact opposite of what he stands for.

**** Maybe, maybe not.

1. How much does canon really show of Cedric? Not a ton. He's described as likable, and he does a couple of nice things, but I don't think that anything we see is incompatible with someone who's pretending to be nicer and more stable than he really is. His father seems to be rather pushy when it comes to his son's success, and there's certainly a precedent for kids with such parents to snap or just have problems which they cover up.

2. What was the point of showing Anakin Skywalker as a sweet kid? To reinforce the point that no one is born evil, and that with the right push or right set of circumstances, even the nicest-seeming person can turn down a dark path.

Given how old he is, and thus how much of his personality should already be set, it's less plausible for Cedric to suddenly "go bad." However, some combination of inner demons, putting on an act for others, and the right sort of push could plausibly conspire to send him in a dark direction.

That said, "go in a dark direction" isn't quite the same as "join the Death Eaters." Neville's a good example of someone who could plausibly do the first, but certainly not the second. Cedric having a secret mean streak that he works to cover up is easier to believe than Cedric being a secret blood supremacist, so he'd have to have some sort of personal reason to help them, not an ideological one.

Really? As if they couldn't be more stereotypically evil. My biggest gripe is that it's literally the plot of Back to the Future 2. Time travel is just plain whacky. Multidimensional time travel even more so. It feels like Rowling read all the criticisms of the time turners, and went all the way to fix it. Only, it didn't need fixing.

I'm thinking most authors are just going to treat it as Marvel treats the multiverse: outside of the main continuum, and thus, safely ignored.

** Ultimately the plot points are complete garbage and you'd really have to see the play in person and be blown away by the production to like the ideas presented by it.

That's not really going to happen for a large part of the community who aren't even in the same country. The play wont have the same cultural impact as the books or movie simply because of distribution even before you consider it's quality.

Plus we have Fantastic Beast just around the corner, and I think Eddie Redmayne's going to inspire mountains of pairing fics. Can't you already imagine Hermione being thrown back in time for some reason just so she can pair with Newt in America?

I am admittedly bitter because I despise the eight movies already presented and their effects on fics.

** The story is quite bad to be honest, but I can't see how it will affect fanfics, maybe just fans of next generation(which I'm not). I don't really consider epilogue of 7 book as canon, it was super cheesy and stupid, so I'm not that interested in CC. I think that this is done in poor taste, with time travel, daughter of Voldemort(really?), nazi-like reality with Umbridge and so on. But I think it's not a serious project of Rowling, the story ends with the same reality as it begun with, yes they went back in time, screwed the timeline a couple of times, fixed everything, and that's it basically. It's cliche, it's stupid, it doesn't change the canon(only the daughter of Voldemort??), we can just dismiss it. I will personally forget about the daughter of Voldemort or the possibility of Bellamort, as well as I forgot about Albus Severus, James Sirius, Rose, Hugo, etc. Harry Potter is about adventure, friendship and love, it's not some soap opera with everybody paired up with all the details of kids pressed in one chapter. Harry Potter had very original plot, CC is just pathetic(exactly like "19 years later")
