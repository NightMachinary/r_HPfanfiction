** It's not exactly what you are looking for, but in this one Harry is raised by Voldemort because Wormtail kidnapped him instead of giving the location up. Has a really well constructed story and two sequels. linkffn(2913149)

  What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? A Dark Harry fanfic. AU Mild HG

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upsite down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** Linkffn(Harry Riddle), Lily had a son with Tom Riddle, and Riddle took Harry instead of trying to kill him. Harry and Draco are best friends and part of the "Trying to get Father's attention and failing" Club. The prophecy is still in play, and Harry and Voldemort have to fight Grindelwald's Horcrux.
