No Hufflepuff hate, just wondering.


** I'm not sure it would /actually/ change very much --- unless this is a whole AU, one imagines Harry would be disabused of this notion pretty quickly and distrust Slytherin anyway, because Malfoy, because Voldemort, and because they generally /look/ evil and untrustworthy.

But, of course, for a humor fic, you could certainly wring something fun out of that premise; say, Harry, primed to think that Hufflepuffs are untrustworthy, fixates on the notion that some random First-Year Hufflepuff is secretly possessed by the shade of the Dark Lord, or something.

(I'd write this, except I kinda already used both of these ideas, in different forms; ironic humor of Harry & Co. coming to completely the wrong conclusions as to what's going on with Voldemort in First-Year on the one hand; evil Hufflepuffs on the other, though in this case, the Hufflepuff /was/ actually evil. So if I tried to write it in my style, I fear it would feel rather stale. If someone else wants to try, though, I'd sure like to read it!...)

** So i dont think it would change much unless this also implies that Voldemort was in Hufflepuff too. So in that case instead of Voldemort highlight the negative side of slytherins it would be the negative side of Hufflepuff's.

Hufflepuff qualities are hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play so harder to make a villain that has these qualities instead of Slytherin ones. But most assholes in life don't set out to be assholes. So maybe the sense of fair play combined with lack of understanding on a matter but drive to act and follow through is what Voldemort would be. But I don't think the issue would be killing muggleborns. Maybe a way to handle them thats cruel without meaning to be.

** i'm currently writing a fic where a young Tom Riddle is Sorted into Hufflepuff, and canon-era folks know that as the "evil House" instead of Slytherin!
