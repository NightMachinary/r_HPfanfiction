:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Years ago there was a thread somewhere on reddit where people were recounting the most wtf fanfic moments, and someone mentioned there was a terrible fic where Harry went to Gringott's and managed to so offend a goblin there that the goblin killed Harry.

This sounds ridiculous and awful but it's stuck with me for years and I want to read that piece of trash just for some closure, but I never knew its name.


** I know it's not what your looking for but there's one where he calls every goblin he meets griphook

  Harry is always thrilled to see Griphook when he visits Gringott's. Unfortunately for Harry, things are not always as they seem... One-Shot.
