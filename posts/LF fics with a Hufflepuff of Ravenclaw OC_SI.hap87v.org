hopefully has their own story line and not just follows the trio's adventures


** linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff) is very good. My other recommendation may come too close to the main trio, but I personally don't feel like it does very much linkffn(Three Black Birds). The main character is Harry, but it's WBWL and he's very much an OC while his brother is much closer to canon!Harry

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.

** Short and likely abandoned, and a Slytherin rather than a Huff/Claw, But this one does what you're looking for quite nicely.

Linkffn(2581495)

â€‹

And a Claw OC involving himself with luna Lovegood. I found it a very nice little mystery when I read it. It doesn't seem to draw much enthusiasm when I rec it, but here you go.

  Dumbledore, despite his misgivings, offers an opportunity to a boy temporarily lost in the muggle world. There are some disquieting similarities to another student he remembers from before... [rating may increase later in the story.]

  If an average school life was all that Seymour Turner could have hoped for then he surely never planned on "Loony" Lovegood nor could he have ever foreseen the extraordinary events that seem to gravitate towards her on a daily basis.
