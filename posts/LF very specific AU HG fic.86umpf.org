In this story, James and Lily never died. Harry was a dick, and Sirius is a bad influence. The basic premise is Harry trying to win over Ginny, but since Harry has a dickish personality, she keeps rejecting him. The one specific detail is that they go at it in the Shreiking Shack. Cheers in advance.


** .. I opened this thinking it was about an AU Hermione Granger.. Do please use a nice / to separate the initials on pairings.

*** Right. I'll keep that in mind, but honestly I chose that because I thought most people called those H/Hr fics. But that would clear things up. Thanks for the feedback!

**** Yeah but not all fics are about pairings! There are fics with Hermione as the main character, or anyone else really.. :P
