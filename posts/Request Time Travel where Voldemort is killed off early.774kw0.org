Looking for any and all time travel stories where Voldemort is killed off sooner then he was in canon.

Any person can be a time traveler, not just Harry.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine

Am NOT fine with Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, no offense to anyone who likes those pairings I just don't, but any other pairing is okay.

Would rather not have character bashing, just don't like it.

A short, somewhat amusing, somewhat sad story that is pretty good

*** Is Harry/Hermione written believably at least? I tend not to like Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione because they aren't written believably enough for me.

** The Book Club has one killing Voldemort in record time (12 hours).

Some of the quickest Voldemort kills all have Harry/Hermione pairing.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455), is the ONLY Hermione time travel to Tom's era in which she killed him instead of shagging/raising him. The entire process lasted a few minutes. She then proceeded to kill every former Voldemort followers in horrific ways.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516), involves the whole Trio plus a 5 day old Rose going back to 1991. They needed exactly two months to win before returning to their original timeline.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998), is tentatively Harry/Bellatrix, and he spent about a couple months to defeat Voldemort.

*** Yeah I don't like Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione myself just because they tend not to be written believably enough.

Also thank goodness Hermione doesn't end up being in a relationship or raising him, I never understood time travel stories that had character A getting into a relationship or raising Riddle Jr. Just really odd to me.

Thanks, will check them out.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
