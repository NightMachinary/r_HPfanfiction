whenever i read a fic that contain the possibility of Harry and Gabrielle its her being more or less still a Minor. I would like to read fics with her becoming an adult and reaching maturity. Maybe she is the only (canonical) Veela that Harry gets affected of.

I would like, if its an adult fic. Erotic, teasing should be in it. And possibly smut.

Whether Harry goes for her visual appearance (unintentionally) or gets charmed by her allure, it doesnt matter.

I dont expect the fic to contain a Harry/Gabrielle pair, just that the two might have enjoy each other.

** I'm fond of [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/1__Beauxbatons/][Hope by Jeconais]], but I don't recall if there's any explicit smut in it. I /believe/ she's 17 in this fic.

You Meet in Paris is also quite good, but no smut. linkffn(13328397)

** The best two Harry / Gabrielle stories are both by [[/u/TE7]]: Vitam Paramus and Twelve Days. linkffn(13459233) and linkffn(9444529).

Neither story is smutty and neither bothers with any kind of Veela "allure" or anything like that. Vitam Paramus is a story of shared loss and two people healing each other. Twelve Days is a Christmas story that brims with love. Don't want to say much more than that to avoid spoilers.
