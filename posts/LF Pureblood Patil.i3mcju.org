Hi all,

I'm looking for fics that feature Padma, Parvati, or both Patil girls and the fact that they are Purebloods. I'd prefer fics set at Hogwarts/during Hogwarts year and, if I could be very picky, altercations with Malfoy would also be preferred.

But generally, just looking for Pureblood Patil fics!


** I don't know if you'll find many, honestly, because the people who write 'pureblood fics' mostly prefer their characters pasty and blonde.

*** Well, there's this assumption (because of one line in the first book) that the Patils are Pureblood and I'm interested in seeing how that works vs the white Purebloods that people write about. Oh, I should say, this is for a research project! I *know* I've read fics where either Padma or Parvati look down on Malfoy as a "new" Pureblood, whereas their family is much older but... I can't find any of them!
