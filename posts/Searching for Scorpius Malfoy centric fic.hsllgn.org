:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have a friend searching for a fic rn, he doesn't have a reddit account so I'm posting what he sent me on discord:

"I'm looking for a series, Scorpius Malfoy centric. I believe it's still ongoing, it's currently on Books seven or possibly eight. I don't remember much about it, just that in the first chapter of the first book it mentions something to do with an accident involving Scorpius a year or two ago. And I think his parents are discussing whether to send him to Hogwarts or not. I know that at some point in the series a war starts up. But there's not much more I can remember. Any help to find this series would be appreciated"

Hopefully this isn't too vague, thanks y'all


** That would mean we have to acknowledge that cursed child exists...
