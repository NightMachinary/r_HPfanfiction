LF fics where Harry actually does something cool with his life. Not interested in overly dramatic/ romantic stories, I can bear some of it, just no everlasting whiny monologues.

:)


** Assuming canon compliance until the end DH:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]], linkffn(8678567): Harry dimensional travelled and helped a good Tom Riddle against several conspiracies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327): The Trio and Ginny dimensional travelled and thrashed Voldemort and his gang a second time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]], linkffn(4889913): The Hallows were exerting very dangerous influences on both Harry and Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6049450/1/Harry-Potter-s-Reaction-to-the-Marriage-Law][Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law]], linkffn(6049450): Harry and his friends organized a mass exodus to fight back against a tyrannical marriage law. Their actions effectively destroyed Magical Britain. One shot only.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12503328/1/The-Day-the-Magic-Died][The Day the Magic Died]], linkffn(12503328): Muggleborns and Muggles had it finally enough. Harry organized the survivors and led an exodus to another dimension. One shot, although it could be the beginning of a crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12492790/1/The-Heinz-Dillema][The Heinz Dilemma]], linkffn(12492790): He and Ron intentionally blew the SoS, so that magic could benefit everyone in the world. It's more like a prologue to a full-length novel though. The author indicated he might write it out completely.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11564067/1/The-Last-Enemy][The Last Enemy]], linkffn(11564067): Harry became a serial killer in search for immortality. One shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971): Muggles broke through Anti-Muggle charms and launched a devastating first strike. Harry organized the survivors, built a spaceship, and colonized a remote planet. But their trouble was far from over. Great concepts, lousy execution, and the ending was rushed.

**** If you think Harry doing his magical CSI or Hermione pulling a House of Cards were not cool enough, then I have to find something far more edgy.

You know, postwar fics are littered with angst/comfort/fluff/hurt relationship dramas. Harry and his friends 'accomplishing great things' is quite rare.

****** I'll agree that your typical romance/angst fic takes way too long to get to the conclusion we all know is coming, but the prevalence of such post-war stories in general makes a lot of sense and probably is truer to canon. The original series is very much a macro battle of good vs evil where there isn't much time for introspection and relationship development because the world is at stake. After the war, the characters would still have battles to fight, but those battles would be largely internal or interpersonal. Honestly, I can find a good character-focused story as compelling as a more fantastical story.

******** Don't disagree but I think some PTSD is fine. I have no qualms with a Harry who is suffering for the first few weeks and then comes out of it. Do I think that's what canonically happened? Probably not. I think, if anything, Harry uses work as a distraction for all his issues.

But I'm cool with a fanfic that takes that route in the beginning.

********* Some PTSD is absolutely fine, and should be expected, but not in a debilitating fashion like so many writers wanted to happen.

Harry could be out for a few weeks, until Ginny finally dragged him out of it. Then he directed his energy, his focus, and his wrath toward fixing Magical Britain.

Hermione didn't have to choose between saying goodbye to Fred and finding her parents, something postwar fics often seem to have a field day with. There were plenty of reasons why she could put off finding them for a few weeks (at least):

- Saying goodbye to Fred was important and couldn't wait. Her parents were safe in Australia and a few more weeks wouldn't hurt.
- Britain immediately following Voldemort's defeat was hardly safe. Better observe somewhat before bringing her (defenseless) Muggle parents back.
- Booking international flights on a short notice was hideously expensive. Three weeks in advance were generally the norm, even in the late 1990s.
- Also, her parents might decide to stay there: weather better, new career and home, hate relocation, and worry about safety back in Britain.

********** Agreed. For me, the PTSD/angsty Harry stuff is appropriate right after the battle for a short period of time before he pulls himself together, or at a random time at a later date, like years later even. I think that is a more realistic portrayal of PTSD. I'm fine with it not being thrown in your face, but subtly shown through his interactions with others.

I'm torn about using PTSD for other characters. For example, everything we know about Ginny suggests she'd be really strong post-war. So one would think a traumatized Ginny makes no sense. Yet I have read a couple fics that show Ginny as really suffering from the war and it also sorta made sense.

An argument could be made that there is no such thing as OOC in a post-war wizarding world. By that, I don't mean that a writer who has Harry turn into a conceited jerk who loves the spotlight is not writing him OOC. But any character who is normally happy-go-lucky but is written as very dark and brooding theoretically could logically make sense.

*********** The Ministry Six should be the strongest, especially Luna who could still conjure powerful Patronus during the Battle even when the Trio had failed. Ginny escaped the worst of Hogwarts, and might feel guilty about it because it was her family going into hiding that triggered Voldemort's crackdown on Hogwarts.

The Weasleys should actually consider themselves lucky that they lost only one out of nine, considering families with far less involvement in the War were decimated or destroyed. It could have been a lot worse. George, however, might indeed become a basket case for years. His condition could be the key reason Ron quit Aurors and worked at his shop. I have never seen it done in any postwar fics, but I expect Molly to take a far more active public role postwar. Her reputation as the vanquisher of Voldemort's second-in-command could have major implications.

Some of their friends might indeed fall off the deep end. What Dennis Creevey did in "The Aurors" or the other guy in "Strangers" were definitely plausible.

Draco was very likely to drown himself years in depression and misery, until Astoria saved him eventually. Despite being a bad guy, I suspect he had actually suffered a lot more than the Trio at Voldemort's hand (especially after the Malfoy Manor fiasco). Then he found himself on the losing side, his entire life philosophy discredited or exposed as a murderous lie, his family fallen on disgrace and on top of remaining Death Eaters target. I mean it would be awfully difficult to pull out of his situation, and I think Draco's postwar experience could be very interesting.

************ I think it's quite possible that Harry and the Weasleys throw themselves into reforming the Ministry and rebuilding Hogwarts to mask and/or deal with their grief. I'd have to imagine they would also be quite famous and thus find themselves in positions to help society move forward. It's not even an intentional thing with them. Arthur probably did not seek out a high position within Kingsley's government, but Kingsley needed people he could trust and tapped Arthur for a position.

Ron definitely left the Aurors to help out George, which really says something about how messed up George really was.

I know you've mentioned that Hermione and Ginny went back to school in large part to recruit followers for the "new order." I don't think Rowling would intend for that to be the reason. I think both were probably very popular and people would support whatever they might have pushed. Hermione probably continued to push for house elf rights for those at hogwarts (she did go into magical creatures in the Ministry after graduating) but Ginny was probably a regular school girl for the most part. She was likely consumed with Quidditch and playing professionally.

Just watch what Emma Watson has been doing, and you can extrapolate that back to Hermione. JKR may not have intended to go all political and strategical, but it would make sense in their situation. If they were destined to make it to the top of that cesspool known as Magical Britain, they would have to become master politicians quickly.
