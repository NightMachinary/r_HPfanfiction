** Sounds like fun. I have no idea how to use thaumcraft, I've always been more of a machine guy, and I don't have a whole lot of spare time. But I'd love to do something like this.

*** I'm more of a vanilla Minecraft guy so I don't know either but if the people interested in playing want that mod (or another) to add to the roleplay I'm not against it.
