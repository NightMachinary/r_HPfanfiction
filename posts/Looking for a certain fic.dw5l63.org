:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The fanfiction that I am searching for involves Harry and Hermione married. They go to meet JK rowling to discuss Harry's life which she makes mistakes when greeting them. Like calling Hermione "Mrs. Weasley". The fic involves like JK getting her "facts" from Molly. It's like one of those where the Dursleys were actually just strict but nice.

I can't bloody find it no matter what I try! Help me. */HELP ME!!!!/* pls

(p.s. Sorry for the jumbled mess that I call writing. -_-)


** I have no idea what this fic is, seeing as I hate Hermione with a passion, but I have 2 advices that would make it easier for you to find it out.

FIrst, use the correct tag for specific search, the one 'What's that Fic'.

Second, very rarely will a person actually click on a post with a generic title 'help me find this' when there's no info, from characters and genre to specific scenes you might reminder.

The description is for you to expand on the title, its already obvious you want help to find a fic /when you use the correct tag./

Oh, sorry, I have another advice. Check Scryer, it has the best search engine for FFN, if its there.
