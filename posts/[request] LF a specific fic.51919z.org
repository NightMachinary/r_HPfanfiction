It was something of a wish-fulfilment story. It involved Harry giving blood to this female vampire that stayed with him then became the HoM teacher at Hogwarts. Voldemort was taken care of ridiculously easily with swords (or something like that).

It was on rn I think....

Pre-emptively, Thank You!

  Harry strikes a deal with a vampire and ends up getting far more than he had expected... (Canon compliant till the end of the fifth book but with a whole bunch of invented back story. How much do we know about Potterverse vampires, after all?) No slash, potential Dumbledore bashing, kickass vampire!
