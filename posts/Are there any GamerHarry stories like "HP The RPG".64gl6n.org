Aside from the weird romance/sex subplots, which are a fun addition to the sterile gamer atmosphere, this fic is also fast paced, and doesn't remain stuck in 'ID Dungeon create' mode like so many, many other gamer fics. Are there more fics like these? Note: I'm not looking for smut, though weird gamer-romances/gamer-sex is always welcome.

  After his self-sacrifice Harry is faced with a choice, stay in limbo or play a RPG game about himself. Enough to say that stories about a character that actually chose to stay in limbo would not be a popular one... Video-game fic.

*** This one appears to be a crossover, will I need to be familiar with the other fandom to enjoy this?

**** I don't believe so. They give a pretty decent overview of the other world since the crossover covers essentially it's entire storyline.

**** I just read this about a week ago and I would totally recommend it. It's very light on the HP content, but I watched the first five or so episodes of Katekyo Hitman Reborn! (which it's crossed with) and, okay, gave up and read a summary of the plot on the KHR wiki, and found the whole fic really fun and easy to follow.

**** Yes. You will need to be familiar with the anime for this series to make sense. It is a solid story, and does a fairly good job of explaining things, but a base knowledge (skiming the wiki would be enough) us helpful.

It us also heavy on spoilers if the anime interests you at all.
