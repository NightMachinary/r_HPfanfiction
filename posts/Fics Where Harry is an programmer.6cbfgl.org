** Well, it's somewhat close to what you asked for. Ish.

Wizards discovered internet and created their own network, Jarvis stumbled upon it. No harem, not complete, marvel crossover... Linkao3(1141722)

** *Harry Potter and Marvel Crossover*

Sirius sends Harry to Tony Stark's for the summer and in a freak accident Tony Stark's brain is copied to Harry's.

*Features:*

*~* independent!Harry

*~* smart!Harry

*~* Magic incorporated into technology

*~* Harry/OC ^{(female)} but relation ship doesn't last long

*~* Slight Dumbledore and hermione bashing

*~* Mentions of Slash ^{(no intimate scenes)}

*~* No direct programming but interacting with complicated AI computer

Sadly abandoned but a great fic none the less.

  Sirius pulls a favour and gets Tony Stark to look after Harry over the summer, where he finds what could be the power the dark lord knows not as in a freak accident Tony's knowledge was copied to Harry's brain.

** No romantic pairings for the moment, because it's just first year, but In The Tinkerer linkffn(12461030) Harry develops an early photoshop alternative for OS/2 and Win 3.0 that makes him pretty famous (and rich) in the mugged world, he also starts thinking of potions and magic as classes in programming.

  The Dusley family, who value normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard. They treated him not amazingly well, no. But they treated him as a human being, a family member who had some kind of value, even if they didn't want him. And in that environment of not-love but not-hate, Harry grew. A Harry Gets Things Done fic.
