Firstly, thanks for taking the time to give this post a look and attempting to help. The FF I'm looking for has one memorable scene that I vaguely remember. It features Harry walking into a Death Eater meeting or party and introducing himself as Voldemort!? Not sure if actually has any connection or is pretending. My guess is that it's a Dark/Gray FF and I vaguely remember him being friends with or raised by the Malfoys although that bit may be from something else. Sorry for the lack of information.
