I want to read something about the times of Tom Riddle's youth, or maybe his middle age. Well, present or future will do, too, on second thought.

But not about him per se, such fics usually aren't good (so he doesn't even have to have a real presence in the fic!), but about people around him that weren't very well explored in canon books. They weren't always called Death Eaters, of course, but I had to name this post somehow. :) So Knights Walpurgis, I guess, although I'd gladly read about time they weren't even Knights Walpurgis yet (like, how they were still going to school). So, people like Abraxas and\or Lucious Malfoy, Walburga Black and\or other Blacks, Lestranges, etc. I.e. people 1-2 generations removed from Harry and Co.

Bigger ones, please. :)

EDIT: Not Snape-centric, please! There are lots of fics about Snape, I don't want other fics to be burried beneath them...

  When Hermione is sent back in time with a spell, she decides to use this to her advantage and kill Tom Riddle before he becomes Lord Voldemort. What follows will challenge everything she knew about herself, and everything she thought she knew about him. Eventually dark. Postwar AU.

Can he change Voldemort prevent him from becoming the darkest wizard of all time? Or will he be caught in Tom's web? Slash TMR/HP?
