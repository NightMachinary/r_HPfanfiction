Hello all,

I've been motivated by the recent discussion of how the fandom has changed, a bunch of free time, and nostalgia for the early days of fandom, so I have gone looking for some older stories and figured if the seemed to age particularly well I would recommend them here. I've also noticed that this sub tends to recommend a lot of the same fic, which sometimes makes it hard to find new things to read (although everyone is very helpful).

So all that out of the way I'd like to recommend linkffn(A Keen Observer by DeepDownSlytherin). This fic is the story of the three Black Sisters and their Hogwarts Years as told by a reminiscing Andromeda Tonks. The first-person POV gives excellent insight on what it was like to grow up part of the Black family and gives Bellatrix and Narcissa depth that the Harry's POV cannon could not. Particularly impressive is the relationship between all three sisters and the excellent connections that are subtly made to latter cannon events. For those of you that think Slytherin gets the short end of the stick in cannon and/or fanfic this is a portrayal of them as ambitious and intelligent, and it shows that Andromeda's generation of Slytherins was a casualty of war just like those we see in canon.

Though published in 2005, this fic has aged well. Some minor details do not agree with some of what JKR released as it was planned and before the release of the Black Family Tree. The ages of the Blacks are off a bit, and all of the cousins are closer in age than in cannon. Honestly, I don't find this jarring at all unless you think about Nymphadora's age in relation to Remus. Since the fic didn't go that far in time, it did not really bother me. Other information such as minor characters' Hogwarts Houses are incorrect but again as I remember the time before we knew them they did not bother me. This fic is Ted/Andromeda with other cannon background pairings for that generation and background Sirius/Marlene Mckinnon.

I hope others will join me in rec'ing older, but still good fics.

Happy Reading!


** I always loved this one!

I honesty preferred the fanon construct that the Black cousins were all close in age to what Rowling later released as canon. I seem to recall that it stemmed from Sirius' comment in GOF that Snape ran around with the Lestranges in school... I kind of hated that Rowling later decided that Sirius wasn't a reliable narrator in that passage because the idea of all five cousins up in each other's business as teens is delightful.

*** Huh, I don't remember that, but I've always paid less attention to Rowling's add ons. I liked playing with the character's and didn't want my head cannons ruined. I like that they are close in age, although for Tonks to be as old as she is Andromeda needs to be older than Sirius. Still, I feel like that stuff is easy to handwave or ignore if the author puts a little thought into it.

**** I feel like the easiest way to deal with Tonks is to make Andromeda get pregnant very young, so she's only a couple of years older than Sirius. It makes sense, too, since she wanted to separate herself from her powerful family; what better way to “ruin” herself than to bear the child of a Muggle-born?

***** Or it could be what causes her to go down a different path. Highschool illicit romance resulting in an oopsie pregnancy. Rather than go home with a half blood baby, she marries Ted.

  Andromeda says little, but she sees everything. Through their years at Hogwarts, she watches her sisters as one falls in love and one falls into madness, and doesn't see as a muggleborn boy breaks into her sheltered life. Now Complete.
