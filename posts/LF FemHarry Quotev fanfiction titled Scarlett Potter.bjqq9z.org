:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
LF a fic which is one of the first fanfic I ever read. It was a quotev story where Fem Harry is named Scarlett and she is going through a romance thing with Severus. she cant decide whether she likes Severus bcause hes a teacher. It was labeled as Draco x Scarlet x Severus, because Draco was being a brat and just HAD TO HAVE THAT POTTER GIRL. A few things i remember is Severus being very protective and Draco being a very wholesome creep.

The one thing i vividly remember is because it kinda shocked me (I was new to fanfiction, very vanilla) is a scene between her and Draco. She was trying to get beck to the dorms after curfew, and Draco just comes out of nowhere like a creep and proceeds to practically molest her because shes playing 'hard to get' apparently, and she starts to cry. And Severus just swoops in out of nowhere and saves her, and threathens Draco. He takes her to his rooms and tucks her in and leaves. She then proceeds to sleep in his rooms for a few days because of the trauma, but doesnt want people to get the wrong idea.

It's like the only part I remember, please help if you know where I can find it.
