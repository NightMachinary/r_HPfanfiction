I've been trying to read this fic again. I think it might have been written by Araceil, if so then it is sadly deleted.

I've tried to use ff2ebook for it, but for whatever reason it doesn't agree with my computer, the file always coming up as corrupted somehow. Anyone know somewhere else I could find it?


** I don't have that story nor am I familiar with it and I don't know if araceil was the author but I do know that araceil deleted their entire FanFiction.Net account. They have some stories on ao3 and still actively post their. You could try and pm them to see if it was their story and if so see if they will send it to you. I know it's a long shot but that all I've got. Hope you find it

** Try the Wayback Machine, just google it and put in your search

*** huh, it's on there... [[https://web.archive.org/web/20181031132014/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5778267/1/Beyond-the-Pale]]

And just like 90% of fics only the first and last chapters were saved. ... Seriously, people...

*** It only had four chapters. Still doesn't matter as ff2ebook doesn't agree with my computer. That doesn't matter either as a pdf has been shared with me.
