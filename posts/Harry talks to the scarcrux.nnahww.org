I am look for fics where the soul shard becomes sentient or something and Harry has to actually deal with the having Voldemort in his head I would prefer this lead to then merging out of a desperation to survive but it's not a deal breaker

No slash no fem Harry no crack

  When Harry returns home to Privet Drive after the fiasco at the Department of Mysteries, he finds that Voldemort's possession released the Horcrux inside of him. In addition to the companionship of "Tom", Harry has his knowledge, and must learn to use it

  Loneliness was something that Harry Potter was accustomed to. He had learnt that there was none that cared for him, none that would rescue him from his misery and none that heard his pleas for help. Much to his surprise, however, Harry Potter had been wrong. Someone had been listening, had been there with him through it all. But, just who was 'Tom?
