  ‘I think you next wanted to know,' he pressed on, a little more loudly, for Bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting, ‘why I stood between the Dark Lord and the Philosopher's Stone. That is easily answered. He did not know whether he could trust me. He thought, like you, that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to Dumbledore's stooge. He was in a pitiable condition, very weak, sharing the body of a mediocre wizard. He did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to Dumbledore or the Ministry. I deeply regret that he did not trust me. He would have returned to power three years sooner. As it was, *I saw only greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the Stone* and, I admit, I did all I could to thwart him.'

Look at the phrasing, he says that he only *saw* Quirrell. At no point does he say that he felt or had the knowledge of Voldemort being there. He could've possibly had his Dark Mark react slighly, just like Harry's scar. Which is quite clever phrasing (if that is the case) because only Harry and Dumbledore saw Voldemort, so he's technically not lying.

I know it's probably not the best theory, but if Harry's scar could feel slight pain then I don't see why the Dark Mark also couldn't do the same for Snape.


** You can probably write a fic about this. But if Snape could feel Voldemort through his dark mark, then Voldemort would know Snape could feel him. Not because it's a link, but because other Death Eaters would have described the connection before the first fall of Voldemort. You could argue that because Voldemort isn't in his own body the connection is weakened. Therefore you could further argue that Snape might have felt the connection and just lied when he returned to Voldemort. Voldemort would justify it by that no other DE felt it or that Snape is just an inferior Wizard and couldn't feel the connection.

But I don't think there is a connection in general. We know Voldemort is excellent at magic, and with his superiority complex he wouldn't want a connection with any inferior wizard or witch. So he wouldn't have designed the Dark Mark like that. And if I recall correctly the Mark is a bit like the Protean Charm.

And generally there is no hints that Snape felt a connection in PS. I want to point you to the only interaction we see between Snape and Quirrel in Chapter 13 - Nicolas Flamel

“Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?' ‘B-b-but Severus, I --' ‘You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell,' said Snape, taking a step towards him. ‘I-I don-t know what you --' ‘You know perfectly well what I mean.' An owl hooted loudly and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, ‘-- your little bit of hocus pocus. I'm waiting.' ‘B-but I d-d-don't --' ‘Very well,' Snape cut in. ‘We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.”

Snape probably wouldn't have been so aggressive if he knew it was Voldemort. But then again you could argue that Snape is a spy and a great actor.
