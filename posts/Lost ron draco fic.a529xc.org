Basically everyone return to hogwarts to rebuild it Hermione's incharge of the whole thing...i cant remember if they also take 7th year classes or the school is closed maybe I'm mixing stories up? Idk?!?!. And she randomly chooses people and puts them in groups ron and draco end up being put in the same team hate eachother but realize they have more in common than they thought i.e they cant sleep someone has nightmares or they both get high on dracos bong or pipe or something. The whole school think theyre gay but they arnt actually its a total bromance (I thought i was reading slash for a while/shrugs/)becasue this stories actually romonie and whatever draco/astoria is called. So hermiones all jealous and confused because these to meet at like astronomy tower every night and sneak around also draco sends ron a pipe thing for Christmas. And the wall theyre group was supposed to rebuild is like turned into a memorial where they add vines on it and its a different color or something from the rest or the castle hermione get pissed over that. She was kind of odd in the story idk Can someone please help find it Pleaseeeeee?!?!?!?!
