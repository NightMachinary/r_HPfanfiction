By: Eternal Cosmos

Harry won the war against Voldemort but at a terrible price. Fawkes gives him another chance in a new world where he died as an infant and where Voldemort still lurks in the shadows...but not for long, because when one exists the other cannot survive. AU


** Here's one that's described as an AU of The World Without Me. It's only got six chapters so far (last updated in July), but I'm enjoying it. Dimension travel like this is my guilty pleasure: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24566074/chapters/59327893]]

*** You just recommended my own fic to me. üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Thank you for commenting, though! I've been working on a rewrite for the fic since some parts aren't the best and I'm a little past where I stopped off the previous chapter.
