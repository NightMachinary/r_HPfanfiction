:END:
I'm looking for a Harry Potter fanfiction where Harry is part basilisk and he can petrify people and he runs away from the dursleys after petrifying one of them, he runs to a magical inn, during his transformation into a part basilisk a strip of hair in the middle of his head falls out and grows back red and all his teeth fall out and grows back then all his nails fall off and grow back into claws and he has a friend that's a drow named Lionel I think


** It's Serpens Amarum you're looking for. It got taken down from pretty much everywhere awhile ago but you can still find it here: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20120418022947/http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4385420/1/Serpens_Armarum]]
