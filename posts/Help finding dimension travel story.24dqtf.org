I'm looking for a certain fic that I've read but can't seem to find anywhere. I know what it's about so I'm hoping someone will be willing to help me, here are the details. It's after the war and Harry is depressed after losing Ginny and decides to leave his dimension/universe and try to find a new place to live. In the new dimension/universe he goes to, Voldemort was defeated in 1981 along with the harry in that dimension. Lily is alive but James isn't after dying of a broom related accident. Lily works at Hogwarts. Ron and Ginny are Slytherin's and the tables in the great hall are set up by blood purity (pure-blood, half-blood and muggle-born) instead of by house. I hope this is enough information for you to regonize it, I thank you ahead of time for your help.
