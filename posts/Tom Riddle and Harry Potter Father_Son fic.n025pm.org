:END:
What's that fic where Harry makes a deal with Voldemort in the Sorcerer's Stone to take him away from his relatives? Tom ends up blood adopting and Harry ends up going be their Harrison Riddle or Hadrian Riddle (I think it was Harrison, though.) It had Dumbdore Bashing, Ron Bashing, and Molly Weasley Bashing. I think it is also a Drarry fanfiction with some Tom/Severus in it too.


** I remember this one. It was called Voldemort's Son, but it looks like it was taken down.

*** Yeah! That's why I was so confused one why I couldn't find it on my Wattpad. I wonder why they took it off there.
