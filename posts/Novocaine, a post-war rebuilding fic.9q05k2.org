** It's an interesting enough story and I've been casually following it.

I'd like for some /magic/ to actually happen at some point though... So far all we have is some tell no show about NEWT studying.

** It spends an entire chapter listing Harry's inheritances.

Just why?

** Halfway through chapter four and waiting for anything interesting to happen.

[[/u/monkeypoxy]] is dead right about the lack of magic. The only thing I can remember is a warming charm cast on some food. So far it's been all about setting up a company and a charity, managing inheritances, seats on the Wizengamot... When does the /fun/ start?

*** Sorry, I guess it's really not for everyone. Personally I like the character focus more than action or magic scenes. I love the progress they're making with their business and stuff. I know it's not in keeping with Harry Potter's theme, but I don't really care much for the magic in fanfictions. I care more about the characters and the interactions between them. So if that's not your cup of tea then you probably won't like this much because there's really no direct magic involved in it aside from mentions of potions and stuff. Besides, given the setting I think it's appropriate that there's mininal magic spells involved. They've moved into adulthood, and the war is over so they're mostly dealing with real-world adult stuff.

**** I'm sorry... I really don't want to jump all over your recommendation. Thank you for taking the time to suggest the story, but...

I like character focus too; it's one of the most important parts of any good story for me. But I read Harry Potter fanfiction because I enjoy the wizarding world and the magic in it. Without much effort you could turn this into a story about any almost other franchise.

And to be honest, the characters aren't that good. There's very little in the way of feelings described, apart from a tiny mention about Harry not being sure about Ginny, and Hermione about Ron. But that's it.

I'll give it a bit longer because the quality of the writing is above average, but that's probably not going to be enough to see me to the end.

***** Yeah, the dramatic stuff is on the newer chapters, but it's been built up from earlier chapters. The latest two chapters are what really wow'ed me.

This is common with fics that are written outside of Hogwarts. Most post-war/post-hogwarts that focus on romance and slice-of-life are like this. This novel is listed as romance/drama so in my opinion it's really par for the course.
