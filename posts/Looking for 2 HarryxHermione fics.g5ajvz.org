The first one has Harry dying in the war and Ron told the story of Harry and Hermiones relationship.

The second was of Harry and Hermione being in a secret relationship at Grimmauld place. I know thats now very specific but hopefully its enough.


** Can you give a few more details. Posting this on [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]] might help.

I think the first one might be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3461008/1/Survivor]]. It is told from Ron's PoV though Hermione is the one who dies and Harry follows after he kills her killers.

I have no idea about the second one. A few more details would help. Whose PoV was the story from and what was the general plot?

*** YES! Thats the one thank you. I honestly can't remember much about the second. I'm pretty sure there was alot of Weasley bashing in it.
