I've been participating in one over in [[/r/Frozen]] for awhile now, and I thought it might be fun to have one here.

--------------

Basic Rules:

Each Prompt would be about a week long, and the whole tournament might be 10 prompts.

Every Prompt, there would be a user who submits the Prompt and selects two judges out of a list of volunteers who judge submissions based on the following criterion:

Spelling/Grammar Follows The Prompt Writing Style Characters Originality Pacing Story General Effect

--------------

Each Prompt, eight Weekly Writing Prompt points will be up for grabs. One point will be granted to each of the volunteer judges who are selected by the week's prompter, and the three best stories as selected by the judges will get points on a 3-2-1 system. The redditor with the most points at the end of the tournament will win.

Basic Rules:

No multiple submissions. It is permissible to use the prompt more than once, but only one story can be submitted for judging.

One cannot submit and judge/prompt and submit/prompt and judge in the same week.

--------------

Basically, the prompt will go like this:

Week1: aRandomRedditor

Week 2: HPPrompter

Week 3 etc etc

--------------

Hopefully we'll be able to get volunteers for prompting and get a full list of ten prompters before we begin.

Once this happens, prompters will create a self post, in it, they will outline:

The Prompt itself:

Example: Percy Weasley discovers that Scabbers is Peter Pettigrew.

And the basic rules, and when the prompt ends (About a week after the prompt begins)

--------------

In the comments, people will volunteer to judge the week's prompt, two of which the Prompter will select for judging.

--------------

People will submit links to their stories for the prompt in the comments. Stories must be originally written, and must be clearly identified in the title as being part of the prompt (with some sort of tag such as [HPWWPI: Ratticus])

[Harry Potter Weekly Writing Prompt One: [Story Title: Ratticus]]

--------------

Comment if you're interested in doing this.

--------------

EDIT: I see your concerns and points. As I've never done this before I'd certainly be willing to hand the reins over to an expert or two who have had experience with such events before.

- I'm not sure about having a length requirement, as we will have a time requirement.

- Multiple submissions could work if it was uncompetitive.


** If this actually gets some momentum going I would love to participate in writing.

** I could imagine writing for this, though I'd probably do it through a different account and not my fake.

Some suggestions:

- There should be guidance on length.
- Consider not holding a competition (which in my experience inevitably lead to controversy and hard feelings over how stories are judged, followed by diminished participation), but rather seek to put together collections of stories based on a given prompt. That way everyone wins as there's more stories to read (no disqualifications arising from submitting a prompt or judging) and no need for judges (or delays as judging takes place).
- Consider opening an account on ff.net (sidebar-linked on the sub) where you post collections of stories written for each prompt. As an example of what I mean, here's one that was done for the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1328677/The-Reviews-Lounge][Reviews Lounge]].
- Open it up for multiple submissions. (Why not?)

*** All worthy points. I was a writer (never a judge or prompter) so I'm just getting the ball rolling here, and what works over in [[/r/Frozen]] might not work here.

--------------

Having said that, I do enjoy the competitive aspect of the prompt, but I'm certainly willing to participate in a uncompetitive version.

**** Perhaps this will be the exception, who knows?

My experience is with participating in writing competitions on various sites where the dynamics I described seemed to play out time and again. Even communities as homogeneous as SIYE or DLP saw the personal tastes of the small number of judges seeming to dominate outcomes more than the quality of the writing. Here, where there's a mix of highly polarizing elements (tolerance for canon pairings, slash, etc.), I think the chances are good that there'll be hard feelings.
