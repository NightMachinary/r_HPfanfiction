** linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The Carnivorous Muffin)

Fem!Harry (Lily) in this fic is very OP and casually breaks the laws of magic to the complete shock and confusion of everyone around her (Including the Voldemort horcrux in her head that she nicknamed Lenin). This fic is well written, but quite weird with lots of absurd humour and a unique writing style.

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

  Harry Potter finds himself, and his normal bi-polar luck, pulled out of a quiet retirement and into the limelight of the 23rd century. He finds a grand new stage upon which his 'saving-people-thing' can act, and before he can say no, is pulled into the middle of a galaxy-spanning conflict. Rated 'M' for bad words and ideas, re-worked and re-posted. Enjoy.

  A continuation of the story begun in Getting Too Old For This. Harry Potter is back, and he is determined to use that whole 'Winning the Reaper War' thing as an excuse to cause as much trouble as he reasonably can, while still winning the war of course. He does like living after all, which is a fortunate trait for a man that can't die. Rated 'M' for bad language and worse ideas.

It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)
