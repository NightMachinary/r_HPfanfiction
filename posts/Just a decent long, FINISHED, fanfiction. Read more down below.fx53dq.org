I just want to read a pretty long fanfiction that's finished. Ideal ship would either be Hinny (Harry x Ginny) or Drarry (Draco x Harry)

and it doesn't have to be a ship, just a nice fanfic.

Also it would be better if it's on Fanfiction.net or Wattpad.


** The Sacrifices Arc? It's quite long.

** There are a lot of good fics on ao3. I highly rec you to use the site. It's got a reputation for being only porn and slash - which isn't true - but even then you can filter everything out you don't like. Ao3 is really good in terms of finding exactly what you want because of the filters you can customize. Personally I find that ao3 has in general the highest quality of writing in comparison to other fic sites. Mainly wattpad. I am sorry. But wattpad is shitty.

That being said here are some good fics. All of them are complete.

Linkffn(The Order of Mercy) Very good fic. I love the portrayal of Fleur in this.

A good Draco Malfoy centric post-war, time loop fic. Drarry. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082]])

A funny drarry fic. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14010333]])

Post-war Drarry fic. Harry and Draco are Aurors. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20309395]])

Drarry. Amortentia fic. Harry is oblivious. (17k) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13818327]])

Drarry. Don't remember much about it tbh but I've got it bookmarked so I guess it's good. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15783759]])

A fun Drarry fic (Draco pov) post-war. Where Auror Harry gets deaged. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/391640]])

Check out this series. Three small soulmate fics. Very fluffy. One is Harry/Draco the other one is a Deanmus fic and this one is an Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint story. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334]])

These are fics with other ships but also very good.

This one is a crossover Marvel×HP fic. Very well written. Linkao3(Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136]])

Also this time travel fic. Harry and Hermione end up in the Marauders time. (Ships Sirius/Harry Hermione/Remus) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]])

Sherlock x HP crossover Linkao3(1134255) Harry interacts a lot with Mycroft in this, less with Sherlock but it's one of my favorite Crossovers

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

  “So, I was thinking---” Neville cut off, causing Harry to peer up curiously. Neville's eyes were narrowed on the flower, small frown marring his features. “Oh, how rude.” “What's rude? It's just a flower. Strange, since Malfoy sent it to me. Do you think he was cursed? I mean, it's not like him to be nice.” Neville snorted, mouth twitching rapidly. “No, it's not,” He agreed readily. “Malfoy sending this makes perfect sense though. The flower means, Beauty is your only attraction."- Or... the one where Harry and Draco have a flower war. Their tamest fight yet to date as they trade silent insults, cutting barbs and even a few compliments sprinkled in.

  “An astrological anomaly induced bond,” Harry repeats, deadpan, as the Head Healer of the Magical Malfunctions ward finishes announcing his prognosis.“Space magic,” says Draco, tapping long fingers irritably against the arm of his chair. “You're saying we've been zapped by space magic.” The Healer huffs. “That's rather simplifying things, gentlemen.”

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Weekly to biweekly updates on Fridays. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

  This is it. This is the end of it all.Draco Lucius Malfoy has survived the Second Wizarding War and has been miraculously kept from going to Azkaban. The Aurors have his wand while he's on parole, but at least he's a free man. Free to do whatever he wants, including go to Diagon Alley where people shun him at best and throw curses and slurs at worst.Draco made the wrong decisions. He doesn't belong in this world anymore, this world he helped to create. When he finds a way to go back to when it all began, he realizes this isn't the end.This is just the beginning.UPDATE : Vietnamese translation now available!! Thank you, ChunyuPink!!!

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** I've got a few long ones, let me just-

*reads the word FINISHED

Oh... Uh... That's tricky... most my favourites aren't finished yet.

I do have [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417][Saving Harry]] by The Seeker with 300k words.\\
Here's the summary:\\
* What if JKR had never intended the Harry Potter series to be for children? How would Harry's time at the Dursleys been written? This story focuses on the years Harry lived in the cupboard under the stairs at number four Privet Drive, as well as his first appearance at Hogwarts. The treatment he receives during his decade there is not described in fairy tale terms. The boy who initially develops is not the Harry Potter we know. The story is liberally AU, with different personality traits, events, and relationships used to reflect the changes in this very different Harry and the environment in which he grew up. In the end, through the assistance of a certain redheaded young lady, Harry ultimately finds the life he should have had and rediscovers the qualities he always had inside of him. While I am not a psychologist or child development expert, the symptoms, actions, and behaviors portrayed reflect the realities of child abuse.

If that doesn't pan out, there are /loads/ of Harry/Ginny fics on Sink Into Your Eyes that you can't find elsewhere.
