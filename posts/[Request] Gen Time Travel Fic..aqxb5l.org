What it says on the tin. Specifically post 1979-1981. No next gen time travel.

NO ROMANCE OR SHIPPING WHATSOEVER.

No founders/ marauder/Riddle/Gellert era time travel.

In addition, the following: - NO RAPE/NONCON - No good death eaters. - No antimuggle sentiment. - No pro-pureblood ideology. - No dark Harry. - NO Harry/Malfoy - NO Granger/Malfoy - NO Harry/Severus - NO Harry/Daphne - NO Harry/Fleur - NO Tom/Ginny - NO Harry/Bellatrix

In addition: - NO permanent name change of Harry. - NO First person POV.

However if you know a time travel fic that's really good despite the above (except rape), I would love it if you could explain why you love it.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688609/1/A-Little-More-Time][A Little More Time]], linkffn(3688609): Teddy Lupin saved his parents using a time turner, without creating a paradox.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die][Gryffindor Never Die]], linkffn(6452481): Harry and Ron were sent back to Halloween 1994 by higher powers. But first, they had to get back at Hermione.

Read the latter two.

I didn't really like Gryffindor never dies much.

Do you have any more Fudge time travel fics?

** Eden by Araceil - Dark story. Probably not what you want, since it talks about planning muggle genocide (albeit for good reason). Otherwise...

Geas of Gryffindor by Kirinin - This is the sequel to another story. It involved a friendship with Draco Malfoy, so basically an AU. I'm pretty sure there was no romance. Basically Ron and Draco are sent from an AU timeline into the canon Harry Potter timeline, right after Dumbledore dies. It's really good, although it's been a while since I last read it.

There was also another story I remember reading. Iirc, Harry went to another universe, where his parents never died. Harry assumed a new name. Lily Potter and Severus Snape (or maybe Lupin? Can't remember) were professors at Hogwarts and friends. That universe's Harry was kind of a big jerk. And I remember a scene where Harry was studying in the Grand Hall before most students woke up, and used a spell to play music. I think Harry was also really good at arithmancy or runes or something. If anybody knows what this story is, I would love to know (and maybe OP would too).
