**** /Bungle in the Jungle/ and sequel were good for their time, with many novel aspects that hadn't been seen elsewhere (spell chaining, a fresh take on the Animagus transformation, a far larger Harry Potter world, and many notable OCs), but I agree that like nearly all "Indy!Harry" tales from that era, they haven't aged well. Also, for all his interesting ideas, jbern was a decidedly less capable writer technically back when he wrote the stories.

I will say that I enjoyed them a lot more than I thought I would given the summary.

** One I like is "Spellcaster" by SGCbearcub.

The summary is intriguing, but doesn't tell you the characteristics of the story. Clearly, its about Hermione being strong and capable, but its also a Marriage Law Challenge that touches on Pureblood Culture/Politics, providing a more plausible reason why half-bloods were welcomed as Death Eaters.

It also solves two of the main problems with MLC fics: Hermione is 24 biological years old and her muggle course work in computers helps her understand the fabric of magic that compels people to obey this set of magical laws.

**** I actually think it contains all the relevant information. We know Lily and James are alive, we know Harry has a brother, we know he is not the BWL and that he will be a dark wizard, and that the story is about how and why he became one. I think that tells us far more about the story than any summary concentrating on Durmstrang (or whatever else you think the relevant part is) ever could.

***** The summary focuses in the similarities to the cliche genre of "wrong Boy-Who-Lived" instead of the differences, is what I'm saying. It's also only true for the first couple chapters of the story, Harry spends the vast majority of the time away from his family (he also spends most of the story not being a dark wizard and instead only trying to excel in a different school, but at least that's marginally more interesting).

You're probably not looking at it from the perspective of someone that hasn't read it. I'm not a writer myself, but if I had to write a summary I'd focus on how this Harry's personality is different from the usual, and not his initial circumstances. Something like "Harry Potter decides against his parents and brother's wishes that Hogwarts is not the place for him. Follow Harry as he attempts to tell friend from deadly foe in Durmstrang Institute's ruthless environment, and above all find a real challenge." That fits the character limit, I think.

***** I'm a huge fan of the story (and I rec it here so much that I probably annoy people), but it's definitely not without it's flaws.

The most glaring is how much I want to bash Harry's head in for /constantly/ doing the same old "sulk and hide things" or "evasive hiding emotions" thing through like 90% of the story.

Or how he never really grows out of the "no one can possibly understand what I'm going through" mentality.

And I can't forget the "I'm so rational but not really I make decisions that everyone else thinks are bat-shit insane" extended phase.

Lastly, dude Harry you're like 15. The "I'm damaged but don't need no parent" endless litany isn't fooling anyone. Harry manages to simultaneously be the most childish and most mature character I've ever read.

Also Lightning on the Wave really needed a hack and slash editor. That story suffered for not having someone to curtail needless introspection.
