And then willingly chose to have another piece of a man's soul hanging around his neck.

P.S. Nothing in the rules is against this joke.

******* Lord Voldemort has just finished killing young red-headed Lily Evans Potter. Like always Dark Magic, especially the Killing Curse, left him very /excited/.

As he unleashed the full might of the Killing Curse upon this innocent, pure, virgin one-year-old boy, he could no longer hold his /excitement/ in.

The full might of the Glorious Dark Lord Voldemort ejaculated upon that poor young Harry James Potter. A bit of the Grand Master of Darkness' /essence/ went very deep inside our precious child.

He was no longer Precious.

He was no longer Pure.

He was no longer a Virgin.

Should I post this on FFn/AO3?

See what their response is to my joke.
