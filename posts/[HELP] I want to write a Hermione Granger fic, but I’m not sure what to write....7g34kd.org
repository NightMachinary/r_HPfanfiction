I can't decide if I want to start looking into ideas for crossovers (Hermione in MCU, in Twilight, Sherlock, Merlin, Star Trek, X-Men...), which I love, or a very very very AU (time travel, Marauders Era, young Voldemort, Dark Hermione, etc).

So, what're you opinions? I'm trying to see what a potential audience would like, and see if I'd like writing it. Basically, I need help deciding. Right now I'm leaning towards crossover though.


** I'd really like a story where Hermione marries a muggle. This is because I still can't find that one shot/drabble I read years ago featuring that premise so I might as well request someone to write another one and make it more than a one shot.

From what I remember, Hermione and her muggle husband are both achievers in their respective fields, Hermione in the magical world and her husband in the muggle world. Both are fascinated about what each one is doing but because they work in different worlds, they don't meddle in each other's work affairs. This causes Hermione peace and contentment because they're both on the same level intellectually but she's come to the point where there isn't a need for her to "prove" herself to her husband; they just simply enjoy being with each other and respect each other.

** I think Hermione is quiet the interesting character, because she is complex.

I would love to see how she would end up if some things where different :

- What if she was sorted in Ravenclaw, accentuating her book-worm part ?
- What if she was deeply traumatized by the troll incident in first year, focusing on defending herself ?
- How her fierceness could reveal itself, before the 4th year, Edgecomb and DA's business ?
- What if she get her hands on the Jedusor book, instead of Ginny ?
- How her bossy+intelligent personnality could develop in another era ?

In my opinion, dark Hermione or such an AU is more interesting because it is plausible with the her character.

** Check [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]], a Magic-less AU, for a very good take on her.

Hermione is, according to JKR, "borderline genius". She also pretty much has the best moral compass of the characters - she is the only one who condemns slavery, for example. She wasn't the best with people in her early years, but she outgrew that. In 5th year, she organised the DA, and post-Hogwarts, she became the Minister for Magic. You don't achieve that if you don't know really well how to deal with people. She's also insecure about her looks, and has a temper. And she will do what she considers right no matter the resistance - fortunately, she usually knows what's right better than anyone else.

I'd like to read stories focusing on her, without turning her into some damsel in distress, or bashing her by validating the pureblood bigots. And certainly no drivel about house elf slavery being anything else but evil. Let her actually use her brain to wreck the canon plot, and change Britain.

*** Writing smart characters is actually not easy. Too many authors make the mistake of developing a supposedly genius character, only to dumbing him or her down to jam their plots through, resulting in the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot][idiot plot]] trope.

Please don't do that.

** Hermione is self-righteous, arrogant and completely lacking in social etiquette. She's also very clever, hard working and has a strong sense of loyalty combined with good intentions. People like me dislike her because not matter how well meaning she is I find her irritating. For me to read a Hermione story it would have to be a journey of self discovery.

For a voyage of self discovery wrapped under the guise of something else I'd recommend a morally grey world with characters just as clever as her. If you're simply looking to have a cheeky wank over how great she is then it won't be popular here but will probably get plenty of favourites on FFN. I want her little world view stripped away and for her to reflect that perhaps she was rash, that perhaps she didn't know all of the details and it had consequences. In the series too few of Hermione's bad or questionable actions have consequences.

Hermione is a gryffindor at heart. She leaps without looking. She does more looking that the others but throughout the series she's more than willing to dive in face first to find out what is happening. House-elves are an obvious example of where she immediately leap to a conclusion. Its an obvious one. Slavery is bad. There is an argument however that house-elf slavery is more nuanced but Hermione ignores that in her moral crusade. Is she right? Its never clear really but that doesn't stop her, she goes against the house-elves themselves because she believes she knows best. If she does or doesn't is irrelevant, its that part of her character that you can take away.

Stories are driven by conflict. Hermione creates conflict. As a person she's abrasive. She leaps to conclusions that hold up when presented with immediate evidence but she can overlook things that disagree with her. You could easily have a story where Hermione has to essentially get over herself to save the day. To realise that sometimes good people do bad things. She herself does plenty of morally questionable things in the series, kidnapping and extorting Rita Skeeter for example. Take Star Trek for example from the ones you've listed. She'd probably love the idea of star fleet, the federation and its ideals, but what about Section 31? Wouldn't they want to know more about her and her powers? Could she ever accept the necessity of Section 31 in the preservation of Starfleet? Could she ever go down that path to save star fleet at the cost of her soul? How would she react to the knowledge that they allow others to live in near Utopia? Would she campaign against their existence regardless of what they do for the good of star fleet simply because of their methods?

** Hermione traveling back through time to raise her honorary little brother Harry (she is nearly a year older and was stuck in a "protective big sister" role for most of the books) and spare him the Dursley abuse. Meanwhile, she goes Horcrux hunting (and Death Eaters as well) while doing her best to play matchmaker to get Harry together with his future wife (Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet, Cho Chang, Penelope Clearwater, any other non-mainstream choice) who was brutally murdered in front of Harry back in the future.

An indifference towards the Weasleys would work best for this because neither Weasley wank nor bashfest seems suitable.

Maybe she initially wanted to prevent James and Lily from dying but couldn't do it or was unable to find them in hiding.
