:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So a few weeks ago, I read this Harry/Voldemort fic where the entire thing started with Harry still getting visions from Voldemort. This particular vision that the fic started off with is that Harry saw Voldemort doing it with Snape during a vision he got in the summer. I think Harry sent some sort of message or letter to Voldemort telling him to control those visions or something so he doesnt get a repeat of it.

I thought I had bookmarked it but apparently I didnt. Does anyone know the title or author of this fic? Thank you in advance! (Please don't hate)


** Hey do you remember what website you read it on? If you do I might be able to find it because Ive read this one before but that was ages ago.
