** For one thing, did you ask the author's permission to rewrite the story? If you can show where the original author said it's fine, that might help. I know there's no hard and fast rule about it, but it's a real matter of respect.

For another, we can't see why it might be getting the short end of the stick without reading what you've done so far.
