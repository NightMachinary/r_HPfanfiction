Pretty much what it says on the box, who do you ship with Hermione? What draws you to that pairing? Can you include the fics that you love with that pairing? Hermione is one of my favourite characters and I'm looking for stuff with her I haven't seen yet. Thanks.

** Wasn't there just another thread about this topic? Anyway, preparing for downvotes but... Harry.

Now, hear me out. Realistically, Hermione is most likely going to end up with either Harry or Ron. I think Neville also would be a good match for her (I don't ship it but he's also someone who's struggled with self esteem issues but like Hermione has a passion for education later in his life) and honestly, I've never thought it right that Ron be The One for her. Them dating for a while is one thing, perfectly logical and even likely to happen, really, if Harry doesn't make any moves, but as others have pointed out they have nothing in common and the basis of their relationship is they are friends with the same guy and argue with one another frequently. That's not a good foundation for a long, happy partnership. Rowling herself said that they were put together due to wish fulfillment from her original idea before she even started the series, and that realistically the two of them would likely need counseling to be happy with one another, if at all.

Now, with that out of the way, why Harry? Simple. Because they fit. They're not each other's perfect, ideal partners, but I think they work out better for it. Ginny became a cookie cutter caricature for everything Harry could look for in a woman until that was all that was left of her. Harry and Hermione have plenty in common with a healthy amount of meaningful differences that can fuel a nice, reasonable, romantic dynamic. They were both raised as muggles. Both were bullied frequently before they came to Hogwarts, and both still suffered a bit of it even after they arrived. Hermione likes her schoolwork, and Harry does too, though it's often subverted by other things (it's not given much attention, but there are several passages in the books that show that Harry enjoyed his school books and would try to get summer homework done early). However, Hermione cares more about doing everything perfectly while a Harry is content with doing it well enough. Both are hard workers but with different goals. Hermione is passionate about social change while Harry is more likely to accept the norms, though he'll fight against what he thinks is unjust.

More than anything, though, I like them together because of who they are to each other. Hermione is the one person who has always been there for Harry, even when Ron wasn't. Likewise, Harry has always been there for Hermione. They're not each other's ideal partners and likely wouldn't ever associate with one another if the world wasn't the way it was, but because it is that way they've been through so much together, overcoming such obstacles and tribulations until they have become true partners. As Emma Watson said, they're equals. They get each other. There's several points in the books where Hermione is the only one who notices something going on with Harry, or is the only one to do anything about it. They've fought, but even in the one notable fight they had (before the DoM) it was still laden with an undercurrent of respect and concern for one another, unlike Hermione's fights with Ron which are usually just contradiction or insults.

There's also just so many moments in the books that, despite Rowling planning for them to be with other people, come out as easily more romantic and heartfelt than any of the actual romance-purposed scenes. (Im looking at you, wedding “I pronounce you bonded for life” scene). Hermione is the first one since his parents to show Harry signs of physical affection. She's his first hug, his first kiss on the cheek(!) and is always embracing him or in some instances holding his hand. Everyone around them thinks they already have something for one another, from Dumbledore to Cho and Viktor to even freaking Ron. Rowling herself said that she felt intense moments between Harry and Hermione when writing them in DH. It's my opinion that, we're it up to her muse and not her plans, Harry would have ended up with Hermione, and the two would be all the better for it.

** Harry.

I just can't see Ron growing up enough to be with Hermione. Because of their friendship I think that she could eventually forgive him for his abandonment during the Hunt, but I'm not sure their romance would last long because of all the arguing and the lack of anything in common. Seriously, what do they have in common? Harry seems to be the only answer. Hermione is a bookwork who loves to study and work hard and has a lot of ambition that she is willing to actually fight for. Ron is a quidditch obsessed, lazy boy who, though he has ambition, is unwilling to work hard. She's obscenely loyal, while he runs when the going gets tough. And outside of the first and sixth books (Troll incident and the DA) do we ever actually see Ron cast a spell? I'm not entirely sure he knows how.

Harry on the other hand makes a lot of sense. Though he's not studious, he can focus when he has to. He's loyal, though he did go along with Ron way too much. He and Hermione were together through most of the adventures where Ron sat on the sidelines (book 1 after the chess, book three time turner, book four she was the only one there to help in train, book seven where he ran off and she stayed and saved Harry's ass several times).

The only other from canon that I think would work is Neville. He's brave, is apparently studious in later years and becomes a powerful wizard who stands up for what he believes in. I see Neville and Harry being basically the same, so I think really either could work.

Draco doesn't work for me at all, even though most of the fandom seems to disagree with me. I don't see how he can be redeemed, and even if that's possible, how can Hermione forgive him for how he's treated her throughout the entire series.

*** IMO, Draco only works if several years later he became a truly good person trying to atone for his past. Even then, there's likely too much bad history between them for them to ever become more than friends, if even that.

I always saw Ron/Hermione as an awkward pairing. Sure, you sometimes hear "opposites attract", but I never really put much faith in that saying. I have no real opinion on Harmony -- I don't see it as implausible, though.

*** I'd argue that a Ron pairing would work out if they meet when they are 20. Ron gets his shit together for the most part (if you ignore the time he mind raped his driving instructor).

The issue with canon as it is that there would be simply too much water under the bridge, too many memories of Ron acting hurtful (because that's what he does for the first five and a half books, with one exception).

** Clearly, the correct answer here is Hermione/Cormac OTP.

On a more serious note, I see following matches as plausible:

- Harry (I find this much more plausible than any other pairing, actually -- the only 2 other pairings I've seen done well without anyone being OOC requires major canon divergence)
- Marauder-era OR post-war Severus (I see the pairing as implausible during the entire second war, even if it would last longer than it did, because the student/teacher relationship isn't the only issue here, but also his vow to protect Harry to honor Lily's memory. I can't see Severus willing to let anyone inside his personal space, and I can see him "fear" getting over Lily compromising his mission in the war. Once the war is over, this is no longer an issue, and he should be able to get closure to that point of his life)
- Marauder-era Remus (Without time displacement, Remus already has someone else which is arguably a better match -- Tonks)

I see these common matches as /implausible/:

- Ron (They have a tendency to bring out the worst in each other, and their personalities clashes a lot. Hell, I'd see this as outright incompatible, not just implausible, if not for the Golden Trio. Consider what would have happened if the Troll incident never took place)
- Draco (They spent the vast majority of the school years despising each other, Hermione seeing Draco as a bigoted narcissist, and Draco seeing Hermione as an annoying mudblood upstart. Even if he got better after Hogwarts, there's too much history there)

There's also Krum, but his character is almost a blank slate beyond "he goes to Durmstrang, he's a professional Quidditch player", so I can't really judge that pairing. That being said, my gut feeling says implausible, even if he happens to be a good match, due to the whole "different country" business.

** Hermione truly is the Little Black Dress of Harry Potter fandom; you could make an argument for just about anyone (except Ron, strangely, IMO 🤷‍♀️).

​

Hermione seems like the kind of girl that might initially like dating a guy that isn't at smart or ambitious as her so she could feel extra super great about herself but she'd get over it in the long run. Hence why neither Ron nor Neville would ever work (unless they changed a lot). I could see an argument for Harry in the later books, though I find the pairing a bit boring.

​

Percy/Hermione would be an insufferable power couple. They would bring out and support all of each others' worst qualities - bossy, priggish, etc. Actually, I think I'd like to read this now.

​

I admit, I like her with Snape (or Sirius or Lupin, I suppose). That girl likes a cause; I could see her being into intelligent but broken men. Not that it would necessarily be the healthiest relationship but I could see it working.

(Also, I fully admit, imaging Snape as Alan Rickman creeps me out. I can only imagine Snape as, like, an ugly Tom Hiddleston-playing-Loki. But then, basically every actor from the movie is not exactly lustworthy so that's a whole other issue (I mean, Kenneth Branagh at the heart throb of the Wizarding world? Really??)).

I realize I'm in the minority with these pairings. But then, I like reading slow-developing fiction involving moral relativism, gray areas, darker storylines, and emotional arcs that aren't clear cut or necessarily “right”.

​

For instance:

Hermione Granger and the Crystal of Time ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7948797/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Crystal-of-Time]])

Of Myth and Magic ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10822825/1/Of-Myth-and-Magic]])

Dark Gods in the Blood ([[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/hayseed/DGITB.html]])

The Bloody Stare of Mars ([[http://www.thechicagoloop.net/yahtzee/harrypotter/bsmindex.html]])

Self-Slain Gods on Strange Altars ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8869173/1/Self-Slain-Gods-on-Strange-Altars]])

*** In regards to Marauder-age HG pairings, why Sirius? I can see Hermione/Remus (if she can get past Remus' werewolf insecurity, allthough this is certainly the easier match) or Hermione/Severus (if she can get past his feelings for a certain redhead, or end up early enough before said feelings develop, and resist his cutting remarks enough until she gets past his prickly outer shields), but Sirius? Yeah, I can see Sirius flirt with Hermione... just like he does with everyone else, but nothing longterm. Not trying to flame you or anything, just genuinely curious. Perhaps I just haven't read fics that makes the pairing look feasible.

In any case, I only see them as plausible in first place if it happens several years after the war (Severus only), or if she is thrown into the past, to normalize the age difference (There's a 20-year difference here!). Yeah, over time as I see weird pairings in fanfics, age for me when reading them matter less and less, but objectively, a 20-year difference does not really help anyone in terms of plausible matches.

** I like Ron/Hermione's dynamic and development in the books - how they're opposites in some ways that balance each other out, and enjoy each other's company (once misunderstandings are cleared up).

I also like Harry/Ron/Hermione, since that dynamic is the core of the story.

I think Hermione/Luna is interesting, since their methods of thinking contrast so much, and there's benefits to Luna's open-mindedness and Hermione's logic. I've read some cute shorter fics (for example [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5016523][this]]), and would like to see development to what could make this pairing really work. Unfortunately, Luna is an incredibly hard character to write correctly.

** Snape Snape Severus Snape

I know.. Downvote me into oblivion. I love this pairing because they are usually a slow burn with Hermione being challenged intellectually.

They are both similar in intelligence, fierce loyalty to the people they care about, and a certain single-mindedness/bossy. I often wonder if Severus saw himself in Hermione (smart, bossy, victimized by purebloods,etc) when she was a student and that's why he disliked her.

I also think I see myself in Hermione quite a bit which makes me turned off of Harry and Ron who seem far too immature for her.

I know the age gap and Snape's previous motivations come into play, but for me that's what makes them a compelling read. I don't like people who are perfectly matched. I like characters that work together but not before doing some ground work. I think anything done when Hermione was younger than 18 however is gross.

But that's just me.

** Are we assuming this is 4th year and up Hermione?

First choice would be Ron. Not his fault Hermione put herself squarely in the friendzone and was struggling to get out of the hole she dug herself.

Second choice would be Harry, because honestly who's left that Hermione

Last choice would be OC. Because thats what Lucious, Draco, Snape, and Voldemort would turn out to be. And is very much the side effect of "Badboy syndrome, I can fix him" in the case of Draco and "Powerful, Dominant/Confidant Older man" in all the rest of the examples both of which is nauesating. Krum would fall into the latter as a mixture of both. Young enough to be considered a badboy and old enough to be seen as a powerful (as youngest proffesional seeker ever, IIRC).

Time travel shenanigans would include Remus, Sirius, James, Pettigrew, and Snape.

None of which work unless you want to turn Hermione into an expy of Lily. Which would work with James, probably intrigued by someone so similiar. Not at all with Sirius who that James was nutters with that infatuation in the first place. Remus has a werewolf problem, and, as a teenager has every right to not get into a romantic entanglement until said person is an animagus. Pettigrew is a coward and follower and Hermione has never liked weak guys in the first place considering who she hangs with on a day to day basis. Snape had too much of the wrong pride and would end any sort of relationship the same way he did Lily. Badly. And if you've read the books again at any point one would know that Hermione holds vicious grudges and doesn't forget.

So if Hr is the main love interest/protaganist/POV I read H/Hr or Ron/Hr and everything else gets skipped over.

** I'd like to see a good Hermione/Percy, set when she is in her early-twenties, or perhaps a bit older. The age gap of four years is not problematic then, and it could be closer to three and a half years because we know Hermione turned twelve soon after starting her first year at Hogwarts.

I think Percy could have a very interesting redemptive arc, and he and Hermione have many things in common. They'd fit together fairly well, and it would be interesting to see how their work at the Ministry could change from allies to opponents depending on the issue. Could make for some fascinating dramatic tension.
