A silent tear slipped down Voldermort's face as he saw her walk down the aisle. Bellatrix was always special to him, and he was sure her marriage wouldn't change the bond they shared, one bit. She looked beautiful, subdued for a change, the nervousness of her plunge into yet another attempt of matrimony, playing upon her features.

Later as he watched her dancing with her new husband, her hands on his strong, broad shoulders, Voldemort found himself yearning for a similar intimacy. He wanted to be caressed, to be swayed and to be held close and treasured. He had achieved immortality, but found it almost as good as worthless, without someone to share all that time with.

Born from a loveless marriage, he felt it was a curse he carried from conception. He was close to Bellatrix of course, and Nagini, but they were more confidantes to him, than lovers. He had poured out his innermost secrets, his soul, to both of them during that dark era of trying to achieve immortality. His faithful death eaters would give up their lives for him, he was sure, but none of them would be able to give him the intimacy he longed for. All he craved, was someone who would look beyond his physical odd looks, and see the yearning of wanting more, deep down in his now badly broken soul.

He acknowledged that his soul was damaged of his own doing. But he also knew, that the good that permeated the world, the same good he had tried to extinguish, meant that there was someone out there who might be willing to give him a chance. Someone who would be there for him, in moments like these, where sitting in the midst of a crowded wedding reception, he still felt lonely. Someone he could share a comfortable silence with, or a really bad joke with. Someone who he could communicate with, with just a twitch of his thin, pale lips, or a wink of his eyes.

The thought of eyes, brought a familiar vision to the forefront of his mind.. A pair of particularly vivid, green eyes to be precise. It had been decades since the boy with those eyes had conquered him, and not just in battlefield terms.

He had been conquered mind, body and soul. He thought about him day after day and night after sleepless night. Now watching Bellatrix, kiss her new husband, and brush away a lock of hair from his forehead, he imagined what it would be to kiss Harry and brush away his unruly hair...
