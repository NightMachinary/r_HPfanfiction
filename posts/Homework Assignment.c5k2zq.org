Unforgivable Curses

In magical Brittain as well as in many other magical nations throughout the world, three curses are held as "Unforgivable", and often carry the highest penalty for their region, life in prison, or death. What makes these three curses "Unforgivable"? In addition to the traditional aspects of dark magic which in and of itself is considered criminal, the three Unforgivable Curses go one step further by exerting a deliberate corrupting force on the caster. While any dark magic will have an addictive affect on the caster, in addition to its violation of the integrity of the targeted individuals "self", these three curses have an otherwise unheard of ability to corrupt and damage the caster.

The Killing Curse is associated with the development of psychopathy and megalomania, as it requires the caster to truly believe they are right to kill their target. It requires not only killing intent, but also the sense of superiority and self righteousness to believe the target deserves to die and that the caster has the right and authority to take that life.

The Torture Curse is associated with the development of sadism and sociopathy, wearing away at a person's ability to tell right from wrong and good from evil. The curse requires the caster to want to cause pain for the sake of pain either in hatred or out of enjoyment of the suffering of others, and is therefore considered ineffective for interrogation or punishment, unless the caster has already descended to a point of sadism that allows them to enjoy suffering to a degree of making other purposes secondary.

The Subordination Curse is associated with the development of narcissism and paranoia, as the curse subjugates the target's mind to the will of the caster, and over time the caster will feel that anyone not under their control means them harm.

In a historical context it should be noted that many scholars attribute the success and longevity of Grindlewald's reign of terror to his careful avoidance of these three curses. It is well known that despite his overwhelming power, Grindlewald considered his mind to be his greatest advantage, and took steps to prevent any damage to his intellect or sanity. One of his most valued subordinate rolls was his "Left Hand", whose purpose was to cast the Unforgivable Curses in his stead, until they lost their own sanity and were executed and replaced.


** Both the concept and the essay itself are very interesting. I'd love to see a story based off of that essay in particular.
