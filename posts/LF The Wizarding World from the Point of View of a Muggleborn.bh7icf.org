Basically, I was wondering if any fics emphasized how screwed Muggleborns, not Hermione, were, as:

1st Year: They have to leave home to go to a boarding school for various possible reasons, and then there, a fourth of the population is guaranteed to hate them due to the House System, various people throughout the school may hate them, and they may be taken as strange due to how they view magic and be ostracized by their peers due to that.

2nd Year: Basilisk petrifies them, setting them back on their schooling for quite a bit. Any advantage they gained over their fellow students by self-study is gone now although the Bigots are quick to dismiss anything they gained through self-study as a fluke due to this turn of events, and they get even more ostracized by their peers due to their rising status as an outsider. On the other hand, their Half-Blood and Pureblood counterparts get to study over the holidays.

3rd Year: The year after finding out about magical creatures like Basilisks living in the school, Dementors are moved into the school, and "They don't take excuses, so if you skip class, they will eat your soul." Hopefully the Wizarding World is terrifying enough by now to affect the Boggart lesson.

4th Year: Finally a normal year. Until at the end, Voldemort has obviously returned.

5th Year: Post is blocked at Hogwarts, and the Ministry is shown in all it's oppressive glory, with a Slytherin, Muggle-born hating Umbridge.

6th Year: Another normal year at Hogwarts, except Snape is the defense professor. Given that he has to show that he dislikes the Muggle-borns arguably now more than ever...

7th Year: Otherwise known as the year of "Hide or Run". Perhaps a loved one gets the Dementor's Kiss.

The Future: Now, well-declared an outsider, they either have to go to Hogwarts again, or try and get a job with the limited contacts and job skills they have. Naturally, they choose the second option. What exactly do they do? Besides that, it should be pointed out how many Pure-bloods like the Malfoys got off from participating in the War.

So yeah, Muggle-borns have quite a bit stacked against them. The truth is, people like Snape have nothing in terms of trauma compared to some of the stories that must have happened.

** This one seems to fit what you want.

Short and grim.

So You Want To Go To Hogwarts?

  Summary: So you want to go to Hogwarts? You've heard all the glorious stuff about magic, the wizarding world, fantastic beasts, wondrous sports and exciting adventures? Well, let me tell you how it is - introduce you to the things that don't make it into the brochure, the report they should send with the famous Hogwarts Letter, but sure as hell won't. Heck, if I were Deputy Headmistress MacGonagall, I wouldn't either!

This is literally how he saw it all too. He was riased thinking magic isn't real.

*** In some ways, yes. In others, I am not so sure. Yes, Harry was raised without magic, but the moment he arrived, he already had a place in the wizarding world, which nobody---not even Voldemort---questioned. What adversity he faced was about him personally, not about a class of people that he belonged to.

** I've got a great suggestion by this often overlooked writer called the Harry Potter series by JK Rowling. I think you'll really like it.
