I really enjoy books with kind of nihilistic protagonists. *The Stranger by Albert Camus*, *Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami*, that kind of things. Are there any Harry-centric, non-slash fics in which Harry is apathetic, doesn't have strong emotions and beliefs and just goes with the flow? Post-Hogwarts is preferred, but I take anything. I have already read *Blood Crest*.
