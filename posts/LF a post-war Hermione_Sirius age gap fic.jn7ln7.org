:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember that the chapters went back and forth in time, like one was what was happening, then the next was backstory, then pt. 2 of what was now happening, then the next bit of backstory, etc., etc.

Harry and Ron fake their deaths, leaving Hermione to live alone in the Apartment that they shared. I remember that Hermione came up with some ritual in the backstory that was a combination of the fidelious and silencio, where it was then impossible to tell each other's secrets.

Sirius lives, and stays in a secret room at Hogwarts for a while during 6th year. Draco shows up drunk on Hermione's doorstep at one point, and they become friends. Sirius later thinks they're dating and goes jealous mode.

It might have been taken down because there is mention of Sirius being infatuated with a 16 year old Hermione, which is why he leaves Hogwarts. I think it was on ffn tho.

I don't remember it being finished, so I wanted to see if maybe the author added something.

Thanks :)

*** No actually, it was an older fic. Though I have seen this post, and have encouraged the author to continue her work. I'm excited to see it.
