In many texts Dumbledore is the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot but I cannot see any power in his hands. He is neither the judge nor anything like that. He does not have any say in what laws are approved. He just reads the laws and asks people to vote. During trials he just interrogates and then asks the witches and wizards of the wizengamot to vote. So he has no judiciary power or any power or say in what the law is. So what is so special about the post of CW of the Wizengamot. According to most fanfic portrayals he has no power. So what is the use of staying in the post. I'm confusedðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”.


** I don't know, if you know about houses of parliament, but he is the magical equivalent of the speaker of the higher house. At least it seems so. Essentially like a mediator and tie breaker.

**** Let's be honest, it's Dumbledore, it would probably be more like [[https://youtu.be/BJcpajX7EdU][this]]

**** Probably more like one of the Lord Speakers of the House of Lords, or the Lord Chancellors back when they presided over the Lords. Much less of that kind of thing.

** Politicians by their nature tend to be very loud, gregarious, and dominant personalities - hence why every other 'debate' tends to devolve pretty quickly into people just shouting at each other rather than actually talking anything through. It's an unfortunate side-effect of modern democracy, it seems. We elect people in the same way we pick X-Factor winners, so the same qualities tend to be selected - popular with the people, content or wanting to be the centre of attention, very forceful about their opinions/talents and what they have to offer, etc. Thus, in order to get anything done, these people need to be moderated and told to get the fuck on with their actual jobs. This is where the Chief Warlock (the Muggle world has one too, but I can't currently recall the name we use in the UK) comes in. They'd moderate discussions and generally keep 'debate' from devolving too far into pointless bickering. So, I'd imagine that's why Dumbledore would stay in the role - to keep the Politicians from stagnating.

** The problem is that the books left out political parties and nature of elections. Which changes everything.

Even in a speaker role Dumbledore would have great power if he was representing one faction or block at the Wizengamot

*** Moreover, even if not evident in most fics, the chief could have tie-breaker vote in addition to deciding which cases to bring forward to the Wizengamot, which is a great power.

** Well, that is partially due to Dumbledore not exercising that power in full and because Rowling needed to have plot.

Basically, in the Parliament-like Wizengamot, Chief Warlock 'leads the proceedings'. That means he decides which cases are heard by the whole Wizengamot, and which relegated to be handled by Ministerial departments. He decides in which order they are presented. He speaks before and after each time someone presents a proposal.

â€‹

That means, he could shuffle the agendas to polarize the voters and for example place every 'traditionalist' motion next to an Umbridge motion, basically sinking it via "Your approval fills me with shame" association. He can delay or push forward with a motion depending on who is present in the chamber. He can silence a speaker, or question them.

â€‹

It's less a direct position of power, but more one that a charismatic leader can use to project the power they already have further. In other words... "I'm gonna ruin that man's whole career." is something that can be achieved with just a few words and good timing.

*** None of that is what the speakers of either house of the UK Parliament does or can do. Is there a different country you were thinking of when you said Parliament-like?
