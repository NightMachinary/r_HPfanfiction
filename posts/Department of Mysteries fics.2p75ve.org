I remember reading an abandoned fic a while back with Harry working in the DoM while training up a new Unspeakable.

I was wondering if there were any other fics with a focus on the inner workings of the DoM. They don't necessarily have to be from Harry's perspective, but that would be a bonus.

Thanks in advance.

  He was meant to be the perfect soldier, the ultimate sacrifice for peace. The Department of Mysteries had other plans.

101k words, last updated November 17, not abandoned as far as I know, but it seems that updates are slow in coming, about a chapter per month.
