:END:
LF A Harry x Hermione Fic That Starts Before Hogwarts, I Remember That One Part Has Harry Getting Beat Up Bad By Vernon Before Escaping, And Hermione Has A Nightmare/Vision About It, And I Remember One Of Her Parents (Her Dad, I Think?) Mentioning That The Last Time She Had A Dream Like That, Her Grandmother Had Died.
