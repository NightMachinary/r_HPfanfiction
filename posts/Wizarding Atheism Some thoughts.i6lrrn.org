First off, obviously the main reason we don't see overt displays of religiosity (aside from celebrating Christmas and Easter, which have been largely secularized anyway) or uses of profanity is because JKR didn't want to deal with that. I wanted to look at a more Watsonian explanation.

My proposal: Religiosity began to decline sharply among British wizards in response to the witch-hunts. After all, why subscribe to a belief system that many people seem to interpret as calling you and your entire family evil monsters that need to be killed?

Normally, one faith plummeting in popularity would lead to another rising to fill the void, but for wizards this didn't happen. Ghosts and other magical phenomena are (at least taken as) proof positive of the existence of an immortal human soul, so there's not nearly as much demand for a source of reassurance that your existence and those of the people you love won't simply end with bodily death.

Meanwhile, another factor came into play - hubris: Look at how arrogant and hubristic many of the blood-purists are, the absurd vanity of the Fountain of Magical Brethren. To worship a divinity would be to acknowledge that there's something greater and more powerful than a pureblooded British wix. Thus, they essentially turned to worshiping themselves and their lineages, pushing the narrative (whether true or false) that the divine figures of various faiths and mythologies were just powerful witches and wizards using their power to get Muggles to follow them.

Here's where we can pull in a trope that often comes up in Dumbledore-bashing - that he's pushing Muggle culture and religion in an attempt to stamp out the "Old Ways" - but twist it around. Rather than some "Old Ways" he's trying to get rid of, maybe he wants to reintroduce a bit of humility, or encourage better behavior among those that only seem to behave themselves when threatened with punishment. It could be portrayed as sort of a side-bet, an "I doubt this will do much, but might as well try at least" kind of thing, or as something more naiive ("They just need some proper moral guidance"). Or maybe it's none of those, and he just wants to close the cultural gap between the Magical and Muggle worlds a bit to make hiding/integration easier and reduce friction in their society.


** I read one fic where religion is just very private, which I kind of like. Harry doesn't know magic folk have religions because nobody mentions them.

They do stuff like "sweet Merlin and Morgana" instead of "OMG" so the idea that they respect or revere wizarding folk heroes is pretty strong.

I don't know about Dumbledore trying to convert wizards to christianity or whatever to teach them humility. Being religious does not make people humble or not-racist by a very long shot, as we all know from every crusade, religious war or theistic hate group in existence. Also, since Dumbedore wouldn't have been raised with any religion in your idea, why would he think religion is the answer to blood discrimination? Even if he could convert the wizarding world, the pureblood would just claim they're God's chosen etc. And nothing would improve.

** I always got the impression that most wizards are just kind of 'soft' Christians in the way many people in the real-world UK are. They're not going to get up in arms about obscure points of theology, but maybe they do go to a Christmas and Easter service, maybe they pray sometimes, maybe they just have a general idea that they're "a Christian". Some will choose to be atheists, some will be agnostic, some will choose to be religious - but most people don't really care and just do whatever. And nobody cares what anyone else believes, either.

Wizards seemed kind of that way to me. It doesn't make sense in my opinion for wizards to be completely separate from Muggle religions because for most of history (pre-Statute, so like everything pre-1680(?)) wizards were happily going along with the same sorts of things as the local Muggles. Wizards did jobs for Muggles and had roles in Muggle societies, because at that point, it was just 'society'. So they probably believed similar kinds of things to the local Muggles.

I mean I don't think Fudge got elected on a "Christianity first!" platform or anything like that. I just think wizards in general would be as religious, in more or less similar patterns, as Muggles are. It's like... in theory wizards could be following an unfathomably ancient paleolithic religion handed down from parent to child over the millennia that's completely separate from anything Muggles have since devised, but given that they celebrate Christmas and Easter and have Biblical themes and messages on their tombstones in graveyards that look right at home in Muggle Europe, they probably don't.

I imagine it as like ... "Christianity+".

** Something I like to think (and iirc I posted about this once, albeit I believe I'm developing it slightly more here) is that the blood purists have taken the (afaik) Ancient Egyptian concept that there's a second death once your name has been forgotten among the living as a seed for something similar to ancestor worship, wherein their children should in theory be receiving slivers of power from every magical ancestor they can name.

This would also be at least part of why they dislike muggleborns, as muggles don't tend to remember their ancestry and can't name even a dozen generations of their families, meaning that all but their most immediately deceased families (i.e. in most cases none further back than great great grandparents) have all suffered this second death (with very few exceptions among ancestry hobbyists/enthusiasts).

Blood traitors would then be purebloods who at some point chose to stop passing on their family trees, and being disinherited would have additional potential spiritual consequences as that would mean that if you died before having children who would remember you, then you will die knowing that your family will not pass on your name as part of their heritage, dooming you.

Oh, and the refusal to use Voldemort's assumed name could be a result of trying to wipe him from existence, ala Akhenaton, and might even hint that at least some of his followers want old Tommy Boy to suffer that 2nd death given that they also refuse to name him, referring to him as "the dark lord" instead of either his assumed title or his true name.

** Canonically, I think it's pretty clear that wizards are culturally Christian but mostly secular in their beliefs. So basically the same as Muggle Britain.

However, if I was going to create an AU religion for wizards to have followed historically, I think the way to go would be veneration of ancestors.

1. It feeds into the importance of a long magical line for pure-bloods and how Muggleborns are looked down upon. Like how Roman families would have their own house gods. Pure-bloods would have celebrated ancestors they venerated, but a Muggleborn would be a wizard without ancestors; a household without family gods.

2. Deities clash terribly with the tone of HP.

3. Given that wizards themselves have magical powers, they have no /need/ for any deities other than the preeminent individuals of their own kind.

So for example, you could say that the ancient Egyptian gods were wizards - and have wizards venerate them /in the full knowledge that they were wizards/, not deities.

I disagree about that part, while a Wizard has no reason to pray to deities for things like rain, love or health, since wizards can achieve those themselves, there would be very much need to worship to ensure themselves a nice afterlife, since wizards don't seem to have any knowledge of it beyond that it exists. Unless of course your proposed AU would have wizards know there to be a universal afterlife for all or have no confirmation of the afterlife whatsoever.

Though otherwise I think your ancestor veneration Idea works, we saw something like that in canon, for example Isolt Sayre(the founder of Illvermony) was nicknamed Morrigan, after her ancestor who is a famous witch, but considered a goddess in Irish mythology.

** I honestly doubt many wizards are of abrahamic faith, simply because magic is blanketly called capital-e Evil by those religions. The witch burnings, one of the major reasons for the statute of secrecy, were also motivated by christianity. Islam and Judaeism aren't much better in this area. There might be a magical splinter church with an altered doctrine that includes magic, but I doubt it's widely followed, simply because wizards have long memories and these things are only 400 years past.

I can see older religions being followed, like the pre-christian animism and animatism, as well as the various older gods that existed in that area. Durmstrang for instance seems advantageously placed to have a healthy presence of ancient norse beliefs.

dont take this the wrong way but they should probably have a religion closer to a strange form of judaism then christianity. it should be a very insular religion with its own customs and like in judaism you can't truthfully marry into it you have to be born into it. and as in judaism if you marry outside of the religion there's a chance your children will no longer be part of it and become like gentiles. an Ethno-religion if you will. with powerful wizards/witches of the ages being seen as closer to the gods as akin to prophets. it might explain the relevance for merlin and morgana specifically in the british isles.

** I'd assume that the magical world has a mix of believers and non-believers of various sects, just like the Muggle world. We know some Christian traditions made it in (Christmas, Easter), and that one of the Hogwarts ghosts was a Friar, for example. Its likely that at the very least, many Muggleborns and Half-bloods would bring Muggle faiths with them. Christianity, specifically the Church of England or magical offshoots of it, would probably predominate in Britain just by the numbers. You might also have some uniquely magical sects. However, official magical churches would likely be fairly few and small, just because they don't have the population to support a lot of large organizations.

One thing I wonder about is societies of magical creatures. Do they have their own faiths, distinct from any human religion? Do some adopt human religions, and vice versa?

** Quite frankly, Wizarding society destroys almost every aspect of most mainstream religions, especially the big three and their different sects. Compatibility is practically out the window, especially since Wizarding society has their own ideologies that have their own concepts, and no real figures of worship outside of small-scale cults of personality, and, as far as I know, wizards don't have an origin myth. The closest that comes would be the legend of the Peverells, which is proven true by the existence and power of the Deathly Hallows, though one wonders how a cloak that can hide from Death itself can't defeat Mad-Eye's...

- Moody and Albus are old friends

- Nobody else has an eye like that

- if the wand is required to see through the cloak then the eye would need to be on the level of the wand which is pretty lame cause the wand and the cloak would be supernatural artifacts in this hypothetical. So if the wand was used to make the eye then there was wand-level influence on its construction process which explains its power
