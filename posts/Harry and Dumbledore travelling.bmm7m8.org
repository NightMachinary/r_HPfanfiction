:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey guys, I'm going insane right now 'cause I can't seem to find the following fic:

Dumbledore mentors Harry and teaches him elemental magic on a grand scale like in Magicks of the Arcane, they travel the world and somehow end up in a brothel in Egypt, I think. In Egypt I remember a scene when they enter? a pyramide or grave and Dumbledore shows Harry how to see magic. They also go to China? and on their way battle some kind of giant ice monster (I think Dumbledore or Harry calls down a giant lightning strike) before arriving at a forcefully retired old chinese emperor who removes Harry's horcrux. In the epilogue, I think, Dumbledore is severely injured or comatose and they are somehow back in the brothel because Harry looks for a cure in Egypt, the fic ends there. This elemental magic somehow needs like a prayer to some god as an incantation, if I remember correctly.

Please help a guy out here, I NEED to read that fic again, It's driving me crazy!


** I'm pretty sure what you're describing IS that fic. Brothel location starts in chapter 14.

*** It is, thanks for the chapter number. I kind of dismissed it even though I had this in my mind 'cause I skipped through the last chapter in search of that last scene I had in mind. Silly me.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
