I'm planning out a crack fic where Ron competes in a good competition (think hotdog eating, spicy food challenge, amount of food eaten challenge) against Malfoy or one of his cronies. I have many of the basic beats but can not figure out the inciting incident. Any brainstorming would be appreciated. If this is the wrong place for this I apologize.


** The twins see a muggle-born wearing one of those t-shirts they give you at food competitions and ask where is it from and the muggle-born explains the concept of food competitions to them. The twins figure itÂ´s a good way to make money and enlist Ron in the competition.

** So in secondary school we had a fair in summer every year where our current year 10s would make stalls for things like bake sales/different games etc. Do that as a part of the triwizard or even a post-DH Battle of hogwarts victory anniversary celebration could work

** I expect Malfoy would decline, but Crabbe or Goyle would probably love it!
