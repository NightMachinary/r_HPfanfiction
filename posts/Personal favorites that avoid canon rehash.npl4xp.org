Been through seems like most of the best stuff, looking for anything you enjoy although I've read so many canon-with-slight-differences that I can't do any more. Don't mind romance, gen, slash or not. Prefer longer but always willing to read oneshots.

** If you're looking for a story that goes off the canon rails quickly, I'll suggest linkao3(Sing a requiem) where Hermione realises that Harry is a horcrux in 6th year, and horrified that he's so accepting of martyrdom, kidnaps him away from Hogwarts and Dumbledore with Ron's help.

Harry's journey from a groomed child martyr to finding self-love and discovering that life is worth living and fighting for, /that he's worth it/, his friends' horror and anger on his behalf is very very touching.

Especially in a fandom that fetishizes child soldiers and martyrdom and that what happened to Harry in canon was not only good but necessary, this story is a breath of fresh air.

  Harry is a Horcrux, isn't he? Hermione reads over what she has of her essay so far, ignoring the way her hands have started to shake. She circles some sentences here and there that she thinks might be stronger in a different part of the paper. Don't be silly. What a strange thought to have. Anyway.  Anyway.  During 6th year, Hermione has a realization that Harry is a Horcrux while doing some homework in the library. Things spiral out from there.

** linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) is just a few chapters away from being completed. It's definitely not a canon rehash; it's about Severus being sent back to when he's sixteen (but after Lily has already cut him off). He has a lot of /very slow/ character development. It's also interesting to read about a truly Slytherin hero.

#+begin_quote
  "I already know your question, Severus Snape. You ask if I chose correctly, placing you in Slytherin. My answer remains the same."

  "How?!" He rasped, suddenly too exhausted to take on a belligerent tone. "My ambitions are dust."

  "Your ambition is no longer so insidious, that part is true. But you are still shrewd. You are still cunning. You are still resourceful. Traits Salazar himself would have anointed."

  "Am I not brave?" Snape bellowed, unable to temper his emotions. "Am I not clever? Am I not /loyal/? Why am I still Slytherin?"

  Silence met his ears for the longest time, until finally that small voice returned. "Why is it, Severus Snape, that you think a Slytherin cannot be all of those?" After all his indignation he could not answer the hat. "Is it perhaps because of another thought that had wormed its way into your mind? But Severus Snape, you of all people should know this answer. Slytherin does not mean evil."

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

*** Thanks for your input! There doesn't seem to be any clear rule about how soon is too soon to make new posts, not about how different a request needs to be in order for it to warrant one. And to be honest, I think I'm serving everyone in the subreddit by making a request thread- I know I myself get most of my recommendations from other people's.

**** No, this subreddit is deluged by constant repeat of the same request ("the best story of all", "dark harry/hermione", "more PORN") again and again and again, because people are too lazy to ask smart questions, or perhaps they are just not enough smart for that. Your request will be most likely be ignored and it will just add to the amount of spam we get into our Reddit inboxes (and Reddit is a horrible tool for dealing with your inbox at the first place).

***** You do know that's how this sub works right. No one is being served personally. I write posts asking for story suggestions, and reply to other posts, rare as it is, my story suggestions. Not to mention that making a post means that instead of keeping multiple tabs open, or using the remind me bot, you actually get real time notifications of people suggesting stories to you. Also if you don't like how this system works, no one is forcing you to cooperate with it. It's not like i'm chaining people to their desks to answer me. I'm simply asking for people to share stories they know of, and/or enjoyed just like everyone else.

Basically, stop whining. If you don't like it, make a discussion post to maybe see about asking the moderators to make a "most popular requests post" that could be updated regularly with stories with everyone in the sub helping put them there.
