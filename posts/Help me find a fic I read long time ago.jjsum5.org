:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry has some sort of betting network in Hogwarts and has secrets of every character . Many character owe him favors .

But then something goes wrong and he is forced to abandon it because he is at threat of being expelled.

It was something along these lines. So guys does any body which fanfic it is . I think in it Harry was not chosen one.


** I think that happened in antithesis by Oceanbreeze7 but not 100% positive

*** Sounds about right. The one where he is a sociopath? And he just knows things due to magic?

**** I'm sorry have you actually read Antithesis? Both those statements are incorrect. Harry is very clearly capable of emotion, and a good portion of the story talks about his training even before Hogwarts.

***** Ok I am a complete idiot. I have indeed read antithesis and I have to admit it is one of the best fics I have ever read. I was getting confused with a different fic that I havent read in a very long time. I'm sorry for getting confused, my bad!

****** Haha you're good. I responded kinda strongly because it's also one of my favorites and I didn't want people to be put off reading it.

******* Ah cool. Yeah I realise now how confused i was. Still cant find the fic i was thinking of. At first i checked DLP and could only find Darkly Dreaming Harry. There is a fic where Harry just knows things. It starts during the dursleys and he is just innately feared by his peers bcos he knows things he shouldnt. That is what confused me - I was remembering his knowledge of secrets.

Anyway, for outsiders, antithesis is NOT a sociopath or godlike harry fic at all. It is extremely well written and arguably one of the best if not the best in its genre. I would highly recommend it though prepare for potential waterworks if I remember my reaction to the final few chapters. Definitely recommend it.
