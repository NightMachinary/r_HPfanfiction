I'm working on a fic and these are the lovely ladies Harry can (potentially) be romantically involved with. I'm doing a sort of 'Extras' story that will highlight all of the relationships but I'm curious as to who the "canon" pairing should be.

The options are: • Hermione Granger • Luna Lovegood • Sybil Trelawney • Susan Bones • Rosemary Rosmerta • Penelope Clearwater • Parvati Patil • Ginny Weasley • Nymphadora Tonks

** Penelope Clearwater or Sybil Trelawney, because I've never seen a fic with either of them paired with Harry.

** I guess Harry is the Wild Card.

Well I can't point to one before the story is written yet as I don't know his outlook or how he Interacts with each of them.

But from the list 4 stick out to me as Interesting Pairings for Harry either way

Rosmerta, Penelope Clearwater, Susan Bones, Tonks

I one hope they way they summon their Persona's is by casting Expecto Patronum into their own heads

*** Thanks for the feedback, I've really been meaning to put a Harry/Penelope story out there at some point and am glad there is at least a little interest in the idea. Even though I don't know if I want it here.

**** Objection: Yes.

Lavender deserves a lot more love than she gets from the fandom.

***** Objection: Noted, and dismissed. She plays a small part in the narrative but does not fit anywhere else. I considered having her replace Parvati (as their personalities are so similar) but it makes more sense for Parvati to be in the story than her. Sorry pal, still no.

*** It is a Persona/Harry Potter crossover taking place in Harry's sixth year after Voldemort died in the Department of Mysteries. I've assigned a bunch of characters to the Arcana (like in P5) and each of them have Social Links like the games, so they have their own individual side-stories. And cause that is where the romance options happen in the games I thought I'd include Harry romancing one of the female confidants.
