We know because of DH that Horcruxies can be reunified with the original soul if the person feels regret about the act (not sure if it is the creation of the Horcrux, seeking immortality in general or the murder), and we know that potions can be used to induce emotions (love potions, torture potion on HBP...), so shouldn't it be possible to dose Voldemort with enough potion that he does retreats the murders/hocrux making process? Or alternatively to make his eternal life so relish that he just regrets ever being born altogether?


** In the HP universe, magic is all about intent and in order to mend his soul, Voldemort would have to truly regret the actions he has done. Potions would not work because, to our knowledge, there are no "regret potion" in canon, and anyways potion cannot create a true emotion (as an example, Love Potion does not make someone feel love, but only fascination). As for making his life miserable, it would also not work because in that case, Voldemort would not truly regret what he did, only the consequences it brought.

Technically, it is not impossible for the heros to capture Voldemort, and then slowly try to make the errors of his way. But it would be an extremely long process, and the change would need to come from Voldemort himself (which is unlikely considering the characters).\\
It is also interesting to not that "Mending" his sould via regret is supposed to be "an extremely painfull experience, potentially fatal for the wizard". Since feeling regret is supposed to be very dangerous with lone Horcrux wizards, and that Voldemort made 6, it is not impossible that his soul is simply too damaged to heal.

*** And his first horcrux was destroyed before his resurrection.

*** While it is improbable for Voldemort ever regret his actions by themselves with enough suffering, some obliviates, many crucios and constant contact with dementors (now my mind did a little jump and I am wondering if there is any Voldemort/Dementors ship in the fandom) he eventually would come to regret making himself so hard to kill. I am still not sure if it would be enough as he would regret making Horcruxies or if he would have to regret the murders in which case it would be best to scrap the idea entirely in favor of a “I have no mouth and must scream” approach by locking him in a cursed coffin and send the coffin away (maybe the bottom of the seabed in the deepest abyssal region in the planet or even in space), eventually being immortal locked with only his thoughts in the dark should make him regret the murders (Infinity monkey theorem - if given enough repetitions all the possible results of an experiment will occur no matter how unlikely)

  or if he would have to regret the murders

In canon, the word used is "remorse", not "regret" so I would go with that explanation. Regretting the fact that you made yourself very hard to kill, because it's stopping you to put an end at your current suffering, does not mean you feel any remorse about the people you killed.\\
I have some doubt concerning a Cursed Coffin. It may work to contain his body, but what's stopping Voldemort from killing himself to escape as a wraith? Could the coffin contain his wraith? While I'm at it, could anything contain a wraith?

***** Cannon really didn't go deep into the whole wraith business, but assuming that he has to have his current body killed to escape and there is no way of making his body the Horcrux of his original soul (and so harder to get out of) maybe a body-bind or even a Basilisk petrification would work, or even do as in for the love of magic and use draught of the living dead (it supposedly kept sleeping beauty sleeping for years without food or water, so it would make sense if the victim didn't need it while under the effects -though as he would be sleeping there would be no chance for remorse and would mostly be a “out of sight, out of mind solution” rather than a way of killing him.

** Imo I think it would have to be true remorse for what he did. Just like a love potion doesnt create actual love(as saidnin HBP) a potion to induce regret wouldn't have any effect of the horcruxes

*** Yeah, probably. Cannon wasn't really that clear on the limits of potions (love potions can't create love while Felix Felicis makes the whole universe your bitch?!?!?!) so no way of knowing for sure if it is all emotions or specifically love.

**** I would say in this case it couldnt be artificial. Felix felicis was a weird one but its effects were gone into in depth. I believe it was less about luck and more about confidence. Closer to a placebo effect but not exactly. More like it would suppress your doubts in some way

***** Not really sure, though that one was barely touched at all (unlike pollyjuice) so it's more about how you interpret the events than anything else. The gate was already opened when Harry needed to leave the castle, Slughorn was in his path and he randomly decided to discard their previous plans to go visit Hagrid for no reason, confidence would be more like when Ron thought he had drank it and didn't feel nervous about the game, yeah he played well, but circunstâncias didn't conspire to make it easier for him. In short one makes you most likely to do your best while the other makes the universe give you an easier time, and then when you consider if it affects only the time for the potion's duration after drinking it or if it also affects the immediate past to make the drinker take it at the best moment (thus Harry drinking it just after Aragog died) it really becomes a mess.

** Even if what is apparently mostly consensus here is true, namely that potions cannot induce true emotions, I think your idea could still work.

It wouldn't be a remorse potion that would be used to make him feel remorse, because, as already said, it would be artificial and therefore wouldn't work.

BUT... What if we use some other potion to induce fake feelings/emotions which in turn will cause true emotions. Like a love potion to make Voldemort feel "love" for someone he killed (it was never stated in canon that love potions can only be used for living people, right?). He would only believe that he loved that person he killed, but he might feel genuine remorse. So... Maybe?

**** Just remembered something that might complicate things: I'm not sure what exactly you have to feel remorse about to repair your soul and thereby nullify the horcruxes' protection. It may be remorse about damaging your soul or about the murder(s) you committed to create the horcrux(es). If it's either of those, I'd guess it's the latter. Then you may have to have your hero identify the victims of Voldemort's horcrux-creating murders and make Voldemort "fall in love" with all of those. That would be... complicated, to say the least. If you already have Voldie captured, simply feeding him some Draught of the Living Death or throwing him through the Veil would seem much easier. But if you want to go the remorse route, a useable explanation could be that the horcruxes can do just as much damage as Voldemort himself can, if they are simply left alone wherever they are, so they must be taken care of - and maybe some of them are in locations even Voldie himself could not access - so a method of destroying them from afar would be needed.

** No, because Hermione puts it as “You need to really feel it. Really feel remorse for what you've done.” That implies it must be true, natural regret.
