[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/katling/HPATGOTN.html][Harry Potter and the Guild of the Night]] (and its sequel). I have read this fic several times in my life and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fic with the following attributes:

- 6th-7th year (diverges after OOTP), novel-length
- Good (in my opinion) character building and a touching H/G relationship
- A Harry who suffers a disability (I won't tell you which one, but maybe you can guess!) and who learns to cope with it, unlocking and understanding new types of magic.

I was incredibly surprised I've never seen this fic even mentioned on this sub (I did a search for it as well, no results). It kind of makes sense since many people here don't like Schnoogle, and HPATGOTN is hosted on Schnoogle, but I'm still a bit surprised.

Has anyone here read it and have any thoughts on it? :)


** Alright, I haven't opened it, so I'm going to guess on the disability. Based *completely* on the title, I'm going to say [[/spoiler][blindness]].

** I made it twelve chapters in before stopping. I might pick it back up. It had interesting stuff, but the writing kept taking me out of the story. It is old, so canon recaps probably weren't as aggravating to read back then as they are now, but that bothered me. Harry and Ginny get together kind of nonchalantly after no really sort of buildup.

So it didn't pull me in like a story is supposed to. If it did for you, that's great. Just didn't work for me. Really, I wanted to like it more.

** Ok I've just read the first chapter. Dunno I hope the author's writing really picks up. It's not good and would benefit from editing and taking out the repetitive stuff. I have to say I'm curious on how harry is going to overcome his disability though

*** Ah, to be fair I haven't read it in a few years so it's entirely possible the writing is... sub-excellent. I hope it picks up as well! :)
