linkffn(10537039)

Edit: Took the advice of [[/u/fflai]]

One: I enjoyed the aspect of Harry (or Hadrian) having a younger brother.

Two: I thoroughly liked the characterisation of the characters, albeit a select few.

Third: I enjoyed how well done the Slytherin aspect of the story was.


** Describe in three sentences what you liked about the fic, in my experience the responses get way better then.

** Well, linkffn(Dracula Rising) has a vampire!Harry who has a younger brother and in time gets along with him. The harry of this fic is dark and manipulative and the characters are definately interesting. Probably not the one you are looking for but it kinda sorta is.

  'Redo' of Heir of Dracula. Wrong BWL. Seven year old Harry Potter, born a vampire, runs away from home and stumbles upon Verona, one of Dracula's original mistresses. He is brought to Castle Dracula, where he unlocks the powers and memories of his ancestor... The mortals will tremble before Count Harold Dracula... Vampire!Godlike!Harry. M for Gore

** From the title I kinda expected it to be really bad, but I'm really enjoying it so far! Thanks for the recommendation, but I'm sorry I can't think of any similar fics right now.

*** Actually, take that back. Have you read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) ? It has several similarities, if you can get past the marmite-like first year. Some people find it too info-dumpy at the beginning, but I feel it's more like the upward clack clack part of a rollercoaster, myself.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  No one knows what went wrong with Hadrian James Potter-Black. Certainly not Heath Potter, the boy-who-lived. How could his own brother be a Slytherin? Be so Dark? Granted, Heath rarely interacted with Hadrian. But it's bad enough that he's fated to defeat the most powerful Dark Lord in centuries. But is fate really so cruel that he has to also fight against his own brother?
