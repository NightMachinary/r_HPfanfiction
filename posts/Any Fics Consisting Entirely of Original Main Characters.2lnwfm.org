I'm looking for fanfiction that features entirely new ensemble casts set in the Potterverse. This means no Harry, no Snape, no Malfoy, not even Oliver Wood or Ted Lupin. Something similar to the Alexandra Quick series - new characters, new relationships, new plots, new everything.

Is there anything out there for me? Preferably long fics (15k+ words) but I'll take anything.

What if Mary Sues actually existed in Harry Potter world?

** The Anguis series?

It takes place during the Harry Potter era with a cast of Slytherin OCs one year ahead of the trio.
