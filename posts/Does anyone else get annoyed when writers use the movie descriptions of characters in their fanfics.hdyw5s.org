I'm a bit of a book purist and did not enjoy the movies. I understand that a lot of people watch the movies only or saw them first before reading the books, but I still get annoyed when the books are not referred to in fanfics.

I'm mainly talking about their physical appearance. I was reading some fanfics where Harry is reborn and he always comments how he's "short again in his new life" and it just pulls me out of the story. In the books, Harry is described to be tall or at least above average in height. It seems that Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal makes everyone think Harry is short and he is not.

James is described as tall and that Harry is almost his father's height in several scenes. He went through several growth spurts and is only slightly shorter than Ron who is very tall.

The same goes for the descriptions of all the other characters too, they're all based on the movies rather than the books and it breaks the immersion for me. For some reason, this just irritates me more than is necessary, lol. Does anyone else get mad when the movies are used rather than the books as canon?

P.S.: any good fanfics where Harry is reborn/reincarnated into another dimension and is described physically as close to the books as possible?


** I tune out the physical descriptions of characters for the most part - the only thing that would genuinely /bug/ me is if Harry has any other color eyes than green (unless it's a consciously chosen thing, for example if a fem!Harry has her mother's red-haired looks but her father's eyes).

Honestly, the only reason I dislike over-reliance on film canon is the absolute character-assassination committed by the films. Hermione in the books isn't nearly as much of a Mary-Sue, Ron isn't as much of a prat, Ginny actually /exists/ in the books, Snape has some depth even before we get to see his memories...

Not all of it is bad though - /some/ of the changes for the film-verse, I actually /wish/ were book-canon.\\
The film's idea of poorly-matched wands having some kind of effect is actually pretty good if you downplay the destruction (see: Victoria Potter, which does a really good job incorporating it into how magic in general works).\\
The scene where Bellatrix carves "MUDBLOOD" into Hermione's arm makes sense for book-Bellatrix to have done as well.

**** I think in the books she has a slash on her neck where the knife cut her when it was held to her throat and during the conversation with Griphook she makes a point of saying "Mudblood and proud", which was a pretty big moment that they cut out, which is a shame. I agree carving mudblood had a pretty big impact though too, particularly the placement - lower forearm where the dark mark is. I kind of imagine in Bellatrix's mind it's to show she'll never have the "honour" of the dark mark because of her dirty blood.

*** I really hate the wand matching destruction in the movies. Good way to spice up what would otherwise be a boring scene, but so very, very overplayed. I can't imagine that happening in "real life" if we can use such an expression.

I skim through those scenes in fanfiction. The destruction is nonsense, and the "wandlore" is uninteresting. Doubly so if the ingredients are super-rare.

**** It /can/ be done in an interesting way, but I agree it makes little to no sense that every 11-year-old coming into the store causes massive property damage.

The fics I've seen that do it /really/ well, have the effects downplayed to not be destructive - the fic I already mentioned in the parent post has nothing more harmful than the wand just refusing to stay in her hand (and that's stated to be a /really/ bad match).

What I tend to imagine for the more destructive examples is that Ollivander specifically has a load of cheap knick-knacks and donated/conjured decorations to destroy, in order to keep anything /actually/ harmful from happening.

IRL, you have a company designing guitars that are /specifically/ made to be smashed onstage without the risk of splinters going anywhere harmful - kinda similar principle could apply here. Everything that happens /looks/ impressive because that's part of the wand-picking experience, but nothing actually happens that a wizard/witch can't fix in a jiffy.

** Honestly, I never bother too much with descriptions in general. When I read, I just go with how I imagine the characters in my head. I don't pay too much attention to descriptions unless they are gender-bent versions or sth like that.

When I write, I work the same way. I don't really describe already known characters like Harry, Ron, etc. Characters just mentioned once or twice like Sally-Anne, Megan Jones, etc., those I describe, but then I have kind of free reign with those.

** I think most of the problem with Harry's height comes from the fact that while Harry is not short, the Weasleys are overly tall compared to him. So even in the books he's described as shorter than Ron and later when he gets to his father's height(something like 6 feet and something), Ron, Fred, and George are still taller(and lankier) than him.

I don't even notice it, most fics get the basics, Green Eyes(and how some fics go on, and on and /on/ about his eyes), messy black hair and somewhat pale skin and soft features, that's it. It fits the books and Rowling's own description.

** Generally speaking, reference to anything that's only true in the movies but not the books drives me up a wall (I'm a gatekeeping book-purist, sue me), but I think the issue with Harry's height is also related to him having been described as "small and skinny" in the first few books.

MCU fans don't seem to focus on RDJ as Tony Stark even though Stark is supposed to be 6'1". Daniel Craig is the only Bond actor shorter than 6 feet tall and after Casino Royale that criticism has gone away even though Bond is supposed to be tall, criticisms of Craig's Bond tend to be that he's not suave enough and that his Bond is more assassin than spy.

** It's annoying when it's just a mix-up like Harry or Ron's height (or the twins' for that matter), but it's downright eye roll worthy when it's about, for me personally, Snape and Hermione.

Hermione is meant to plain leaning pretty, but without ever putting the effort into her looks because it's not something she values. Emma Watson is unfortunately incredibly beautiful and her perfect curls (along with in general overly perfect character in the movies) ruins an important element of Hermione.

Alan Rickman as Snape not only ruins several other characters because they had to age them up to match him (ruining the tragic nature of how young Harry's parents were when they died), but also made him much too likeable in the films. Snape is a greasy, thoroughly unpleasant man in the books- movie Snape is often comic relief (?!).

So I guess for those two it's about looks (beauty and age) as well as how they're represented as characters as a whole in the films that really gets my goat.

** The whole "Harry is as tall as his dad" thing is really stupid. Harry was malnourished and abused for his whole life, not to mention he lived in a cupboard. Malnourishment should have taken its toll, and even though he was fed well at Hogwarts and by the Weasleys, it doesn't take away 10 years of abuse.

Really, it's not like JK Rowling even searched up the after effects of the abuse Harry went through, so we don't really listen to Harry supposedly being "tall".

He should have been short, thin, and malnourished with more than likely wrongly healed bones and some scars from Dudley's "Harry Hunting", and maybe even some from Petunia and Vernon.

So, really, it doesn't make much sense that he's described as healthy-looking. Especially whenever he just left the Dursleys. When he just left them, he shouldn't have been able to eat much without getting sick, especially after their "diets". And he shouldn't have been able to get so many growth spurts. Children that are malnourished for long periods of time don't grow up too much without the proper care.

Also, how the fuck did Harry learn to swim in GoF? The Dursleys did not teach him that.

But I'm rambling, so I'll stop.

In conclusion, JK Rowling did not do her research when it comes to abuse, so fanfiction is doing it for her.

**** Go back through the chapters where Harry was with the Dursleys. You'll see that it was rare if he was even fed the scraps of what he cooked. He had to cook for them, you see. But there was never anything left for him to eat. And I highly doubt he was given what the Dursleys had at the shack. They mentioned that they had it, but they never would have given him a crumb.

And, during the summers, he was given food through a flap. It was most certainly not enough to be considered food.

I also remember a summer when he was only given a quarter of grapefruit per day.

So, really, the Dursleys barely fed Harry at all, JK Rowling never gave them enough mind, and Harry had no after effects.

But a trained medical professional like Pomfrey should have seen that Harry was abused.

So I can't help but feel that it was covered up.🤔 I'm not particularly surprised with the Dursleys treatment and the manipulative Dumbledore tropes in fanfiction because of this.

***** Obviously he didn't get enough during the summers. But before he went to Hogwarts, it was much different. On Dudley's birthday Harry was sitting at the table eating bacon. And he presumably had a plate because he was worried the table would be turned over.

At the shack it says the rations turned out to be a banana and a bag of chips EACH.

I'm not sure where you got the idea that he ate scraps.

****** It doesn't say that he lived on scraps, and yes, there are indications that he had the same meals as the rest of the family. However, there are several relevant and concerning statements.

- "Harry had always been small and skinny for his age", Philosopher's Stone chapter 2. This could, of course, be a simple matter of genetics, but it's rather suspicious. It's at least a strong indication that he was not eating as much as his cousin, even though Harry shows a good appetite when he reaches Hogwarts.

- "He had been given a week in his cupboard for this" after his hair regrew in a night. It's unclear how well he was fed during this time, but it would certainly encourage muscle atrophy, poor posture, etc. The context implies that extended cupboard time was a standard punishment (and indeed, a few paragraphs later, the 'appearing on the roof' incident saw him locked in the cupboard again).

- Harry was given Dudley's leftover icecream to finish on Dudley's birthday. This /might/ just be a matter of Dudley getting a special treat for his special day, but a) it really wouldn't be that hard to buy icecreams for both boys, especially since they did in fact order Dudley a second one after he complained about the size of the first, and b) Harry considered getting Dudley's leftovers to be an extraordinary privilege, such a stroke of good luck that he ought to have expected the day to go downhill. That doesn't bode well for his portion sizes at other times.

- "Go - cupboard - stay - no meals" after the boa constrictor incident. Harry then waits for the Dursleys to be asleep so that he can sneak food from the kitchen - and the casual way this is written implies that it's very much not the first time that regular meals have been withheld.

But I'd say that Vernon was out of it at the time---clearly---and that he probably only had a piece or two of bacon and not a full English breakfast that the Dursleys most likely had. But I do still stick to the fact that Harry wasn't fed enough.

Harry cooking for them is a movie thing: in the book Petunia is putting the food on the table, even for Harry. In the third book, when Dudley is on diet, she wanted all in the family eating the same thing of Dudley but she made the plate of Harry "slightly less" to make Dudley feel better about it.

The only time we see Harry eating scraps is in the book 2 after the Dobby fiasco.

  Also, how the fuck did Harry learn to swim in GoF? The Dursleys did not teach him that.
#+end_quote

To be fair, when I was at primary school in the UK in the late nineties we had swimming lessons through the school, so everyone in my class learned how to swim even if it wasn't from their parents or other caregivers. I don't know how universal that experience is or was, since I have met several people in my age cohort who can't swim, but it doesn't seem odd to me that Harry would be able to swim even if the Dursleys had never taught him.

There's only a few physical character traits that I consider 'essential'. Those include Harry's hair color, Harry's eye color, the fact that Harry looks like James, Hermione's bushy hair, the Weasleys' red hair, and Dumbledore's silver hair/beard.

Everything else can be changed, and even those essential traits can be changed if the author gives a specific reason for it.

** The only instance I found where this was unforgivable in a fanfic was when the author insisted on describing Harry's eyes as blue instead of green, and made quite a bit of effort to point out that detail whenever possible. It drove me absolutely bonkers because it's also been a thing throughout the books that Harry has his mother's green eyes! The author knew this and went out of her way to make a long AN about how she preferred the film look of Harry so she wanted to preserve his eye color too. I dropped the fic just for that reason alone - I was surprised by how furious it made me.

In other fics where Harry is described as short also tend to be fics that play up and overdramatize the abuse Harry is subjected to by the Dursley's. I always saw at as a way to play up the abuse and not a way to emulate the movies.

Also - THE HAIR. Harry's long girly hair in the 4th movie - some authors include this in their fics and it bothers me a lot but not enough to make me drop a fic just for that reason. I hated Harry's hair in that movie and in the later ones - I always felt his hair in the third movie most closely fit what I had imagined from the description in the books. Usually I just imagine him that way, but when fanfic writers go out of their way to tell me how his hair looks otherwise it removes me the story quickly.

** I'm rather contradictory because I default to the movie appearances but do consider the book to be "more canon" when it comes deviations outside of appearances between the two. This is so I can enjoy Felton Draco pwps. Unless the characters I'm interested in reading about need to be hotter than they are in the movie. Like Oldman!Sirius. Then I completely leap off into wildly inaccurate fantasy.

Also at the same time though, the character appearances in the books mostly made very little impression on me except for Harry's eyes, Hermione's hair, and Snapes nose.

Hence my confusion that Neville is blonde. I can't even picture Neville not being movie Neville. Narcissa and Lucius on the other hand get the same treatment as Sirius. Thewpin stays because Thewpin is visually attractive to me. I'm probably going to keep reading whatever HP fanfiction reinforces all of this.

To answer your question though - it doesn't bother me in regard to character descriptions. I generally mentally-edit out character description if it goes too weird. Generally stuff in the vein of "Harry took a potion and he suddenly became this gorgeous, muscled hunk with long flowing hair, perfect cheekbones, and sergio-esque chest hair that winked at all the ladies as they swooned past him" rather than Neville looking like the movie actor rather than the book character though.
