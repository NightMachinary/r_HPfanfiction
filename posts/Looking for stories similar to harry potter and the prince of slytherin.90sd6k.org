** Not sure what you're looking for exactly, but this might be worth a shot: linkao3(12608820)

It's a WBWL AU where Harry is Sorted into Slytherin. Writing is pretty good, and so far, the series is almost at the end of fourth year. Harry's Gryffindor brother, Jules, is a pretty big asshole, but it's not over-the-top. James is bashed too, but again, not over-the-top, Molly-Weasley-is-dosing-everyone-with-love-potions type of bashing.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** Not sure exactly what you're looking for, but my series, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn; The Chessmaster: White Knight; The Chessmaster: Black Bishop) has a similar political aspect, and a Slytherin Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Chessmaster Volume II. AU. Tensions continue to rise both inside and outside Hogwarts with the announcement of the International Scholastic Quidditch Tournament. As international influences begin to creep into British politics, Dumbledore isn't the only one worried for the future. Thomas Gaunt is concerned as well, but for very different reasons. Sequel now posted!
