I'm kinda new to fanfiction, so I'm looking for some decent DracoxHermione. I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]], and now I really want to find more. Problem is I'm terrible at searching for stuff. I'm not really choosy, but a lot of the ones I have looked into were either not in English or were mass walls of text.


** Check out [[http://www.dramione.org][Hawthorn and Vine]], a moderated site for Dramione stories. When you're there, I recommend stories by Captainraychill, to start with.

** in the Isolation vein

we learned the sea - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3144908/1/We-Learned-the-Sea]]

heavy lies the crown - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4797492/1/Heavy-Lies-the-Crown]] - i like this one better than isolation, i think.

RZZMG is a good (and majorly prolific) writer, check their favorites and pick through their stories - 'when and hate collide' is a good one.

i like anondracomalfoy too - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3156105/anondracomalfoy]]

** Have you tried [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=64][The Prank War]] by Crazygirl47? The author wrote one of my favorite fanfic of all time (another fandom though), and apparently this is a proto fic of sort for the other story. Unfinished unfortunately, the author left FF in 2010, returned for another chapter of the other fic then left again

** I am about 3/4 of the way through [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8982722/1/Cruel-and-Beautiful-World][this]] fic and I am really enjoying it.

It is called Cruel and Beautiful World and it is long (50 chapters!) but I've been reading it for three days and I really like the writer's character building.

All the fics that [[/u/speedheart]] posted are ones that I really enjoyed ( and have re-read each of them a number of times) totally recommend them as well.

** Other than Isolation, some of my favorites are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3732710/1/Silencio][Silencio]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2083937/1/Bad-Faith][Bad Faith]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4411159/1/Claiming-Hermione][Claiming Hermione]] (abandoned WIP but it's good), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6725154/1/I-Spy][I Spy]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5095119/1/The-Dragon-s-Bride][The Dragon's Bride]], [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/dmtabf/MTK.html][Meet the Kids]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5853767/1/Hunted][Hunted]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2603288/1/The-Nietzsche-Classes][The Nietzsche Classes]]. Currently, I am reading [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1][The Fallout]] (another fan fav). It's pretty angsty but interesting so far.

If you're not adverse to visiting another social media site, check out the [[http://dramioneficlists.tumblr.com/post/22690720812/dramione-fics-listed-by-themes-a-d][Dramione Fic List]] which is a great resource for finding fics.
