Just thought I should share, in case any of you lost hope. For those of you who aren't aware, Stunning Shifts is a fic where the Golden Trio plus Blaise, Draco, and Luna all end up in an AU where Voldemort is still active but much more subtle than canon. It's a fun work!

*** Yep, the story/writing was intriguing enough that when I first picked it up, I went through it in one go.

** Quarantine has been good for fanfiction as several writers have updated Fics that people were losing hope of them being updated. And other writers are able to update more frequently.

Unusual Inheritance by Knife Hand previous update 2017 now updated late November 2019

Are the two that immediately came to mind mainly because I did a quick check because of the potential issues with hpfanficarchive. I would have to go through my delete folder on my computer to identify others (maybe 4-6 others) because I immediately discard the old version.

I'm currently "following" roughly 268 stories which I consider "updateable" eg updated within 2 years. I basically check for updates once every other month or so.

I have another 382 stories that I consider abandoned updated more than 2 years ago. I typically check them once a year to see if they get updated.

#+begin_quote
  With the love of a good woman, Harry becomes more confident and learns to handle the embarrassment that comes from being a teenage boy as well as an unexpected animagus.  Set during the Tri-Wizard Tournament.  Severe Ron bashing ahead.  Rated M for crude language, even cruder humour, and sexual situations
