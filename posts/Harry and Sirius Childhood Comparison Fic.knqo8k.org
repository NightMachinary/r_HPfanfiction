:END:
So I read this fic on ffn like a week ago, and it basically compared Harry's and Sirius' childhoods with events that happened when they were a certain age. It was like a character analysis fic, exploring the characters through short stories.

I remember each part would start off with "When (Harry/Sirius)* was (7/11/13)**. I also remember it went AU and Sirius was exonerated, however there was no warning of AU previously.

/it would say either Harry or Sirius' name */those are the ages I remember and it would say either one of them. Also I dont remember if the numbers were in numerical or word form.
