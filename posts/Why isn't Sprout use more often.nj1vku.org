Why isn't Sprout use more often besides besides the Herbology teacher? Is it because she's a Puff? I feel like people could use her as a mentor to Harry that doesn't hate him or try to make him Jane's or Lily. I believe Mentor Sprout could help Harry if he wanted to be a healer or whatnot.


** Because she's a blank slate with, imo, the misfortune of being boring. There are other, more interesting characters to help Harry if he wants to become a healer.

  that doesn't hate him

Only when he's not competing against a member of her house.

** I think people overlook her because she doesn't get much characterization in canon. Popular characters in fanfic tend to be ones who are given more depth in canon (with some exception, e.g. Daphne Greengrass), or, sometimes, given more focus in the movies (the movies definitely popularized Snape and Malfoy). Sprout barely shows up in either. I don't think it's necessarily a Hufflepuff thing because, as far as I know, Flitwick doesn't get much attention in fanfic either.

**** Flitwick is a former dueling champion in canon which explains why he shows up more.

** While Sprout being a Hufflepuff probably plays a role in her lack of use (just like Canon, fanon usually gives a lot more of interest and "screen time" to Gryffindor and Slytherin compared to Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw), I think it is only a "minor" reason.

The main problem with Sprout, outside of the being really bland (I can only think of 3 or 4 scenes with her in Canon) is that she doesn't really have any reason to ever Mentor Harry. There isn't anything about her that an author could see and thinks "/I can use that as a justification to put her in a mentor role/".

No matter what Harry wants to learn, there is almost always another teacher who would not only be better suited to teach Harry, but would also have more reasons to do so:

- Dumbledore is the wise old man who know everything, he is also the only one who truly knows what's going on between Voldemort and Harry and can be of help with that (basically his canon role).
- McGonnagall is a Master of Transfiguration, which could be of help in combat. She is also his Head of House and taught his parents (personnal connection).
- Snape is a Master of Potion, as well as Dark Art and can even teach the Mind Arts. He is also the Head of Slytherin (a popular House for Harry in fanfics) and /was/ friend with his mother. Even the fact that he hated James can be used for drama (not to mention the whole prophecy with his responsability in it and his following betrayal of Voldemort).
- Flitwick is a Master of Charm, as well as an ancient Duelling Champion. I'm not sure if the following information is Canon, but fanon also often make him as some sort of mentor for Lily, who loved Charm.
- Pomfrey is a mediwitch, which makes her the best suited to teach Healing Spells. The fact that Harry often goes to the Infirmary also makes it easy to build a relation.

Sprout teachs Herbology which, while being pretty interesting, only has a limited uses in case of a Battle. I know some people will mention the Mandrakes, but it's not really something "advanced" (since Harry learnt about them in 2nd year), also there are some little limitations about them (like the fact that they kill /everyone/ who hear them) which would have made them pretty useless in almost every combat Harry got in Canon outside of the Battle of Hogwarts.

She could make a nice mentor in some kind of "Magical Plant" fic where the MC always has some obscur plant he can use to get out of any situation (like Magical beast does with . . . beast), but I don't think it's ever been done, and Neville would probably make a better MC for this kind of fic, judging by his clear interest in plant in Canon. But in most of the story we can currently read (where wand are heavily, if not almost exclusively used), Sprout has pretty much as many reason to be a mentor of Harry than another teacher like Sinistra.

** It's because the only thing people remember her as is this cold hearted bitch who looked at a kid who times and times again got dragged into unfortunate situations, and then decided to be as much of a bitch as legally acceptable because the kid in her own house now wasn't the only Hogwarts Champion.

** The sole reason I don't entertain the notion of a Mentor Sprout, is that she's petty. Mind you I have problems with most of the main teachers.

Snape's an arsehole and a deplorable human.

McGonagall tries but her advice more often than not does nothing. She's a bit old fashioned school mistress style.

Sprout is only one whose pettiness pissed me off. I don't care if you believe that a student is 'stealing your house's glory', you do not fucking treat a child differently because of that, and you lose my respect entirely.

Flitwick and Dumbledore are the only ones I don't have issues with. Dumbledore listens to Harry, and gives sound advice when needed, he's very understanding and never over-admonishes him. He has his flaws don't get me wrong though.

Flitwick is never explicitly mentioned as treating anyone differently and he's very well liked and he's a good teacher. Though I don't recall the scale of bullying for Luna, so I don't know if that could be construed as negligent.

*** I would say that McGonagall is also petty. She ignores the rules to make an eleven year old with no prior experience play a full contact sport with eighteen year olds for a better chance at a years worth of bragging rights for the quidditch cup. She gives Malfoy, Neville, Harry and Hermione a life-threatening detention and fifty points off, which it explicitly says makes the rest of Gryffindor hate them, just because Malfoy's whining annoyed her, and then presumably she felt she had to be 'fair' giving the others the same punishment for what must be a trivial offence.

Also she doesn't even try. She basically stops existing as a character until book 5 when she does nothing.

**** I had honestly not even thought about that, but it's true.I am honestly of the opinion that McGonagall doesn't deserve to be as beloved as she is, but it's also a bit like teachers you had. I had an English teacher who was also depute rector, who was exactly like McGonagall, yet we all left school with mostly fond memories of her, somehow. So I imagine people sort of fill in the blanks

Then there is the some form of false dichotomy, McGonagall might be presented fondly because at least she is not Snape.

I suppose Sprout's pettiness sticks out to me because it's really minor and has no material advantage to anyone. Some of the characters we meet from Hufflepuff are either really nice, or some absolute roasters.

Now I want to see a fic, where essentially McGonagall's laziness is the cause of supposed incompetent Dumbledore, but he's not, he's just busy and needs people to delegate to, and if those people don't do their job properly, the system falls apart.

** You're on to an interesting idea. But I think most people think of her as Neville's mentor. Her story arc is locked into that.

Oh. And as McGonnagal's intimate. “... a look of grim understanding....” Say no more.
