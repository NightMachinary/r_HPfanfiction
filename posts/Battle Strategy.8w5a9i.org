Hi,

I'm looking for fics with big battles that some actual battle strategy (like for example Harry using an antique strategy in some battle in the HP/SW crossover "Harry Potter: Lost Very Far Away" linkffn(12497548) ).

Too often the battles are focused on a particular combatant but not on an actual army or part of it with heavily strategy based battles. I don't mind crossovers obviously.

As always I prefer completed or ongoing (not abandoned) fics.

Thanks


** - linkffn(Emperor): the ultimate stragegist Harry, trained in the muggle world. Might as well have him quoting Hannibal and Sun Tzu.
- linkffn(The Firebird's Fury: Book 3 of the Firebird Trilogy): Harry becomes part of the armed forces working against both Voldemort and the Dark Coven lead Ministry. Involves multi-country battles and interspecies war.
- linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died): some great maneuvering by Dumbledore, Voldemort and even Lucius Malfoy of all people.
- linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): You see the Order being shown off more as an actual fighting force against the Death Eaters once the war kicks off, with small unit tactics and deployment across Britain.
- linkffn(Unspeakable Things): the DoM were the ultimate masters of magical warfare, and they utilized every resource available to take down their opponents (at one point they hit a giant with rocket launchers).

  They had a plan, formulated from before they were even born. That plan died. From its ashes rises a Harry Potter no longer willing, or able, to let others fight his battles for him. Outgunned, outclassed, outmatched, nonetheless Harry will take up the sword to change not only Britain, but the world.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
