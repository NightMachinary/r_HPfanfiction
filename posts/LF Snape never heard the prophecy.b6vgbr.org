For want of nail/point of divergence gen fics please.

Preferably where things still end up getting fucked either way. I don't want to read a story where everything is fixed.


** For me, Snape hearing the prophecy and then giving it to Voldemort is why I'll never buy into his redemption. The only reason he didn't hold them down whilst Voldemort AK'd them is because of his creepy obsession. His actions kill Harry's parents, and yet he still has the absolute gall to treat Harry like he does?

*** Agreed, I hate the fact that Snape played a pretty big role in getting Lily killed and Harry still has the gall to partially name one of his children after the man. Why would you name one of your children James sirius, why not James Remus Potter and then have your second child be Sirius Albus Potter for fucks sake.

*** He also left Sirius in Azkaban even though as a former Death Eater and spy for Dumbledore, he certainly knew that /Pettigrew was a Death Eater/ thus calling into question those eye witness testimonies.

I could go on and on but as far as I'm concerned, Snape was to be considered Harry's bitter enemy by the end of /Prisoner of Azkaban/.

**** He didn't necessarily know. Perhaps he never met Voldemort's informant and just heard that "one of Potter's friends" betrayed the family, without knowing if it was Sirius or Peter. For all we know, Snape was so obsessed with catching Sirius in the 3rd book because he was genuinely convinced he was pursuing Lily's murderer.

***** He */did/* know that Pettigrew was a Death Eater.

Sirius says that the *Death Eaters in Azkaban knew about Pettigrew* as they would mutter and scream about his part in Voldemort's downfall.

Now consider the fact that when Voldemort is resurrected and the DEs arrive in the graveyard, they silently and seamlessly form a single and specific circle. They know their exact positions, and leave places empty for those who are *imprisoned*, dead or have betrayed them. They know each other as Voldemort openly names them. When Pettigrew receives the silver hand, he joins *his place in the circle.* The same circle in which Snape stood (Voldemort references him too). These were Voldemort's inner circle, his marked Death Eaters.

Snape was a Death Eater since the time the prophecy was given and before the Potters went into hiding. There was no way he couldn't have known. /His testimony could've at least gotten Sirius a trial./

  I heard things in Azkaban, Peter. ... They all think you're dead, or you'd have to answer to them. ... I've heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds like they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went to the Potters' on your information ... and Voldemort met his downfall there. And not all Voldemort's support­ers ended up in Azkaban, did they?

He carried a schoolboy grudge. Lupin saw Sirius, Pettigrew, and the trio on the Map and ran after them forgetting the map and that he hadn't taken his potion. Snape comes in with the potion, sees the *same map* (almost certainly at the same page) and also runs after them but /leaves the potion behind./ /He/ certainly hadn't /forgotten/ the potion since the first thing he does there is taunt Lupin about it.

****** There's no way snape himself knew that wormtail was a death eater. He would have told dumbledore. And then dumbledore probably would have gotten sirius out of prison or at least a trial.

We know from deathly hallows in the memories chapter that snape is very beaten up about the potters dying dumbledore mentions "they put their trust in the wrong person" and everyone thinks sirius is the traitor. Snape is a huge asshole but if he already knew wormtail was the traitor then he would have easily put two and two together.

From sirius quote, it's possible that only a few of Voldemorts top followers knew about wormtail. It would only take one person such as bellatrix to know and then if she complains about it, Everyone else might here her since sirius overhead a lot while in prison.

We know that snape was not privy to who actually sold out the potters because otherwise he would have warned them. So if he doesnt know that then he didn't know wormtail was the traitor.

**** No I don't think it was the Promises trilogy, considering I've never read it.

My mind keeps going to AidanChase's series - but Snape tells Voldemort, it's Peter who regrets his decision to switch and dies protecting the Potters. Which is actually the plot you explained - he's a lot like James in the series. But Voldie still knows the prophecy and Harry is still famous though he grows up normal.

But I know I've read a story where the description was literally: what if Snape never overheard the prophecy? And the war just goes on. But even though Voldemort never marks him as his equal, Harry does grow up to be a hero and the Chosen One.

****** It's All the Wolves Cry. I was meshing AidanChase's Jily lives series with All the Wolves Cry (someone already linked it) in my mind. I read a bunch of Jily lives AUs around the same time - AWC is super depressing but so, so good and worth the read. Snape is a redeemable bastard too. It's a really brilliant piece of work and I cried like a baby at one point.

[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/1577144][Gryffindor Blood]] is the first Of AidanChase's epic Everyone Lives AU. In this Harry grows up as a pretty normal boy (he's very much like James and has a very strong bond with his parents) but he's still the Boy-Who-Lived. The main draw of the story is in the title - everyone lives and its a really interesting exploration of who Harry would be without death following him like a stalker.

I highly recommend both. But All the Wolves Cry is what you were looking for. Try some of the author's other works too. They are just as good.
