I'm looking for new things to read, so just give me your favourites, regardless of genre or length (although I do like long fics and Dark!Harry, so if you've also read something good like that, link it too!)


** linkffn(6892925)

This is my favorite. Some alternate dimension traveling, with some cool magic, and brutal(fight fire with fire kind)/crazy(say/do weird things) Harry and crew.

#+begin_quote
  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

It's an Addams Family crossover, divided into five or six one to three chapter long stories, but it's comedically dark.

** Linkffn(Circular Reasoning) for the oppressive, bleak outlook, corrupting Dark magic, the best grimdark in the fandom and great prose.

Linkffn(A Black Comedy) for the best humor in the fandom and being much cleverer than you'd expect from a fanfic that hits crack territory in a few places.

Linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) for an incredibly inventive reworking of the verse and the best Voldemort in the fandom.

Linkffn(Renegade Cause) for shit hitting the fan over and over, and intriguing, intricate plots.

Linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) for balls-to-the-wall fun and the Sorting Hat.

Linkffn(What You Leave Behind) for an interesting combination of base plot elements and the portrayal of magic.

Linkffn(The Last Enemy) for an incredibly interesting take on the Master of Death and knowing when to stop to keep it short and to the point.

Linkffn(Cauterize by Lady Altair) for the feels.

** I'll just list several recently completed/updated fics I like. Here are the completed ones, sorted by date of completion:

*Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue*, linkffn(11961978), finished last night, is the best 'muggle wank' fic I've read so far.

*Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water*, linkffn(12076771), is pretty much the only novel-length Harry/Hermione/Ron story. It's a great read for those interested in WW2 naval history.

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is 660k words long. I have written a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/54fral/sensible_harry/d81rgmq][lengthy description]] of this fic.

*The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(9863146), is a 700k words long, and the first part of a series that begins when Harry was 5. The second part, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076644/1/The-World-of-The-Accidental-Animagus][The World of The Accidental Animagus]], is an interlude about worldwide reactions to the events at the end of Year 4. I especially like this series for its excellent world building, smart characters (both good and bad guys), and logical plot developments. The good guys were significantly stronger than in canon Books, but Voldemort and his Death Eaters had powerful allies too.

*The Dark Lord Never Died*, linkffn(11773877), begins with Lucius Malfoy faking Voldemort's survival after the Halloween debacle and kicking Dumbledore out of Britain. Twenty years, Voldemort got his body back, and a three way war ensued between Lucius' British Ministry, exiled Order under Dumbledore, and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were initially caught on opposing sides of the conflict. This fic has one of the best final battles I've read.

--------------

Now WIPs:

*Divided and Entwined*, linkffn(11910994), is by far the best Muggleborn resistance/uprising story IMO. Dumbledore was cool, and Voldemort was cunning.

*The Stars Alone*, linkffn(12040341), is a HP/SG-1 crossover and sequel to *Broken Chains*, linkffn(7718942). I just binge read it and find it highly entertaining.

*Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw*, linkffn(11574569), contains lots of tropes I dislike, but it's so well written that it has become my favorite WIP at moment. It's the first time I actually enjoy Daphne Greengrass as the Ice Queen of Slytherin. Harry was extraordinarily powerful, and yet he still faced an uphill battle. The Potters abandoned and mistreated Harry, and yet they were not bad people and their actions believable. Dumbledore was evil, but not stupidly evil as depicted in so many Dumbledore bash fics. All 5 girls are well characterized and interesting in their own ways.

*Animagus at War*, linkffn(12088294), is the sequel to *The Accidental Animagus*, and that war appears to be epic.

*Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past*, linkffn(9932798), is the sequel to *Weasley Girl*, linkffn(8202739), where 'Ron' is a girl. Her characterization is done so well that this new 'Ron' has become my favorite OC. Needless to say, the plot will also progress quite differently.

** The stories written by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][Little0bird]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] on FFN are the two best canon-compliant HP expanded universes I have read.\\
Little0bird's story-line covers from the day after the Battle of Hogwarts until a little bit after the Potter kids' graduation from Hogwarts (currently), however there are some minor non-canon parings (Draco/Daphne & Lily (II) Potter/Scorpius Malfoy) making it slightly AU.\\
Northumbrian's continuity begins in the 6th century AD with the flight of Merlin's mother from the Roman Empire to the British Isles and Merlin's birth. The stories then touches down on the Marauders, some summer holiday/other character stories from the Golden trio's years at Hogwarts. Leaving a convenient gap where JK Rowling's books fits in to the story-line without breaking continuity or adding plotholes and then it covers from the summer after the battle until the 100th anniversary of the battle on the 2nd of May 2097.

** I've read so many good fanfictions but I'll link a couple of my favorites. Linkffn(The teacher's notebook). This one is a marauder era novel focusing evenly on the teachers and the marauders. It's laugh out loud funny. Linkffn(It's okay not to be okay). This one is a Harry/Ginny and it fixes so many things about the novels that upset me from end of third year on. It's the first of four. Linkffn(Living with danger). This is probably my favorite fanfiction ever. It is the first of 5 I think but it covers pre- Hogwarts through seventh year and it is done brillantly. The characters are well developed and you fall in love with them. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Gift from Death). This fic is one of those people Harry loves comes back from death after the war with a twist. It's pretty long and super good. It's one of three s far and is still being written.
