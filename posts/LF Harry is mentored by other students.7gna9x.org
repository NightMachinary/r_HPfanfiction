Hey guys (and girls) - long time, no see? ;)

Well, here I am with another request:

Give me any stories that have Harry being mentored by other students (the quidditch-team, students he asks for help, Fred and George, students who want to use his name/fame and offer something in return (from teaching him spells to helping him with his socials skills and dating) etc. etc.)!

Why? This always kind of bothered me because wouldn't you kind of show of to the younger years if you are good at certain magic and wouldn't younger students ask the older ones for help with certain tricky things?

As always:

- Het and Gen stories are fine
- please no slash (unless it's side-characters)

So, the stage is yours!

greetings LAX

** [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hogwarts_Dawn/index/][Hogwarts Dawn]] by Jeconais has this. Harry hires the twins at the beginning of the tournament and tells them to make get him to win and no cost is too high. They hire other students for alternative courses for him. Shows a lot of characters and OC from other schools in the story. I would say most of the characters in this story are OOC but I like them.
