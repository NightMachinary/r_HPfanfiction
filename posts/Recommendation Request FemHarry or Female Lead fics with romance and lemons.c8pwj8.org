** I honestly don't think fem!harry is the way to go to find out about what women think, especially sexually. Most fem! harry is paired with Draco or riddle, imo, it's what I see most of. Or Snape, maybe.

Regardless, I don't often see a lot of explicit fics in female!harry, but then, I find most are like, written by younger people? Maybe. Not sure.

In general romance and not so much... explicit, anything by tsume Yuki will be fem!harry and she writes like all sorts of pairings and crossovers etc. Mostly female main characters across the board.

I can't read Hermione as a main character so I'm no help there, but if you sort by explicit and kudos on ao3 you can pick whatever guy or girl you want to read her with and ao3 will probably have it. Draco, Ron, Fred, George...Fred and George... It'll be there.

Although honestly, in the opinion of a girl, there's not like one thing all women are into, some like t-rated fics, some like smut, some like kinky af stories... I mean, there's just so much out there to cater to everyone and anyone. I really think it's best just to please yourself, (or pose quesitons to the girls in this sub if you want to), because I've read some of the top fics in a lot of fandoms and they did absolutely nothing for me or made me cringe at the uh, euphemisms going on, but you know...

C'est la vie.

** I would highly recommend the later chapters of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15936890/chapters/37161587][Noticing by The Distant Dusk]] (POV is about 50% Harry, 50% Ginny basically just lusting after each other but not doing anything about it yet) and I would definitely recommend linkffn(buried treasure and transmogrify)

  Lily Evans has spent years despising James Potter. He has spent just as long worshiping her. When seventh year pairs them Head Boy and Girl, each comes to realize that their judgment isn't quite what they thought it was. This is the same story that was over on Checkmated, but I completed it here. Prequel to Heroes for Ghosts. Warning: this story is a strong M rating.
