*** Only if you're looking for Harry/something. There's literally not a single pairing besides that.

** You can use character searches on FFN or the relationship search on AO3, but there is not one that pulls from both AFAIK

Your best bet would be to find a site/group specific to the pairing and see what their most recommended fics are

** That's gonna be a pretty subjective list.

** The best bet is to look in the communities on FFN. For instance [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-Hermione-fics/41806/]] has a lot of Harmony. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Completed-Harry-and-Daphne-Fanfiction/126530/]] has a lot of Haphne. At least the more common pairings will have similar collections.

** Easiest on [[https://archiveofourown.org/]] by searching for Character1/Character2. Harder on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/]] -- you can key the filters to the 2 characters you want to ship, but generally speaking, /don't enable pairings/. The vast majority of fanfic authors seem to complately ignore that tag, so you miss out on several fics that way. Some pairings is screwed over a lot more than others from this. The reverse also applies -- when I felt like reading Sevitus, it was basically impossible to seperate it from Snarry (which uses the same chracter exclusions) with the filters alone.

** I would recommend using the scryer if you want to find fics easy. There are several ways you can sort fics with it.

It's also pretty easy to use.

** Not sure about other pairings, but there's a whole [[/r/HarryAndGinny][r/HarryAndGinny]] subreddit with a mega-thread.
