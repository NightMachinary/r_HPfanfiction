From what I remember, Harry got ripped across dimensions, taken into the black tower and tortured for some time. He escapes, not being able to use much magic, and begins to travel across Middle earth, meeting wizards, getting a cool semi-magic staff and occasionally becoming a folk tale to some humans. It's set in the silmarillion, and it'd be really great if I could find it. If you want more details I can see what I remember

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
