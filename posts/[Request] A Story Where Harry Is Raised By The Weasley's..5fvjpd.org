  "Good evening, Arthur." The patronus said, in Professor Dumbledore's voice. "I would greatly appreciate it if you and Molly were to meet me downstairs - I will be arriving shortly with someone I'd like you both meet." It was a little over twenty minutes later that the Weasley parents were introduced to a tiny five year old named Harry Potter.

  What if when Hagrid first took Harry to Diagon Alley he met someone who would change his life forever? Follow Harry as he learns about love, trust, friendship, and most importantly as he learns about himself. HP/CW Soul Bond Fic. Slash later on. Dumbles bashing. Past abuse. WIP. Open to suggestions. Enjoy!
