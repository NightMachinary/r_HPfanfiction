Cue a lesson where Professor Voldemort foams at the mouth for a half an hour about how Harry cheated in their final duel. My new headcanon is that the DADA curse was broken because ghost-voldy became a teacher, thus fulfilling the curse.

****** Peeves isn't a ghost, and events in the original heptalogy would suggest that your expectations are unfounded. Harry was able to successfully cast Langlock on Peeves in Book 6, and Lupin cast Waddiwasi on him in Book 3. While these were simple schoolyard jinxes, they clearly demonstrate that Peeves /can/ be affected by living beings and their magic.

Conversely, there's never been an example of Peeves being directly affected by the actions of a ghost. Sure, we're given secondhand knowledge that Peeves fears/respects the Bloody Baron, but we're never told why. We're told in Book 4 of a Council of Ghosts making a ruling on whether or not Peeves can attend the opening feast. Peeves's fear/respect may simply stem from the Baron's role on the council, being that he's one of the oldest ghosts in the castle.

******* Cool, but while there isn't any proof that ghosts can effect ghosts, there isn't evidence to suggest otherwise either. Peeves is scared of the Baron, and while the whole council of ghosts being the reason is an interesting theory, it's just that, a theory. So I can agree to disagree, but while ghosts can be affected by spells, they can't die to them exactly, can they. So there still isn't a real reason for Peeves to truly fear Voldemort, and he fears the Baron. So i'm still gonna have to say that it's more likely that the ghosts can still effect ghosts, even if Peeves isn't technically such.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?
