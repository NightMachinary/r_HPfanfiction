I'm looking for a fic where voldemort realizes harry is a horcrux early. He entombs him alive and awake in a glass coffin in the Artic. Snape finds him and fakes destroying the coffin and harry. He rescues Harry but in his sleep harry revisits his cupboard under the stairs where voldemorts soul is outside always calling to him unwilling to believe he is dead. Amazing fic and really hoping someone can help me find it

The series is currently going under a rewrite but I believe you can find the older version for download.

  Alphas and Omegas are a rare thing in Wizarding Britain, particularly after the casualties of war. Hermione suffers from heats, a quarterly occurrence in an Omega's life if she isn't already pregnant. With slim options of Alphas, who aren't married or horrible men, Hermione all but begs Draco Malfoy, of all people, to get her through this heat. What happens when years of animosity and misunderstanding crash around them mixed with urges and uncovered desires.HUGE Shoutout of Love to: gidgetmalfoy & lucefray27 for their amazing beta work To connect with me, and get extra information about this and other stories as well as chapter previews, please join my facebook group::: facebook(dot)com/groups/mrsaturtlesreaders

  What wouldn't I do

  To place my hand against your chest; to feel your heart beating strong

  Your breath is my soul,

  Your pulse is my song.   A story of obsession.
