Hi everyone,

I'm looking for a fanfic. The plot was along the lines of Harry going to another world and goes to school where he has to learn sword fighting, horse riding and magic. He gets ridiculed by everyone because he's human. He tries to kill himself and a dragon saves him and trains him and becomes his familiar. Everyone realizes how good he his in the final tests when he beats the professor who ridicules him. He then becomes a mage/dragon rider for the kingdom along with another person and comes back to fight Voldemort.

If anyone remembers this fanfic or has the link I would be grateful :-)

Thanks!
