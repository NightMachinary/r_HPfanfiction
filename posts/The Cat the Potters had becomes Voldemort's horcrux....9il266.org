** /Well/... it's possible, but in such a case I think the Voldebit would just have overpowered the cat's soul and possessed its body, then sought out a body for itself. Unless the cat's mother sacrificed herself for him to give it a special magical protection, but somehow /I doubt it/.

**** Possessed-Ginny and possessed-Ron suggest yes. It's ambiguous whether they'll remain linked to the object (stabbing the Diary did kill the materialized Diarymort, /but/ he wasn't /fully/ materialized yet...), but they definitely can at least project themselves into a real body.

**** His snake was a horcrux but his mind wasn't trapped inside the snake. A horcrux can anchor the soul to the mortal plane but his dark spirit can still roam freely.

***** The part of his soul that was in the snake /was/ trapped though, just like all the other horcruxes. The spirit that roamed free was the small part that was in his body when it was destroyed

***** I've never heard about it before and there is absolutely no support for the theory in canon.

Just because some fans thought it would be neat doesn't make it true
