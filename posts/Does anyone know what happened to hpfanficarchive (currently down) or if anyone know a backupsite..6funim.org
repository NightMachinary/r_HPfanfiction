** Mouse your way in (anonymouse, I mean, or anything else of that ilk), for the site works fine, it's just blocked in quite some places /for some unfathomable reason/.

**** I have no idea how much of that stuff is there, but I will note that at least the most popular site that there is has probably a similar quantity of it, just spread in a higher overall amount of content and /technically/ not allowed, so ... yeah.

While I'm grateful that this doesn't mean ff(dot)net got blocked too, the fact that the site got blocked but others didn't, and it usually works for anyone for the first time but not on any subsequent attempt, is in my opinion unfathomable because it can imply weird things.
