I read some crossover between HP and The Addams Family, then this dialogue (Between the Black Brothers) came to my mind.

"So you're saying that a random american rich guy, who was 'Cave diving', saw you drowing in a lake full of Inferi, took you to his house as a souvenir for his wife, then, when you woke up, you adopted yourself into their family, and only now, 14 years later, you come back here to not only do some secret mission against your old master but to also be a guardian to their future hogwarts student witch daughter ?"

"Yes"

"Bloody hell, Regulus."

** Lol, you could even throw Beetlejuice in. Just say he was Lydia's plus one to an Addams event and the ghost is recognized by Regulus as Betelgeuse Black, the one ancestral spirit not even Sirius had been mad enough to ever invoke during the lessons Mother used to give.

Oh, that could even be Regulus's reason for reaching back out to Sirius, but he's just too late as Harry accidentally on purpose summons the one Black ancestral spirit that scared the rest by saying his name thrice (he was just trying to do a mini-ritual to have the dead provide an answer about how to block Voldemort from his mind. He didn't know that there were Blacks so bad that they scared other Blacks. He thought Betelgeuse sounded like Sirius.)

A Regulus tempered by years with the Addams is Harry's only hope. Afterall, only an Addams, even just adopted, is enough to withstand and direct the insanity of Beetlejuice.

*** Also turns out that Regulus didn't die in the Inferi lake because he enslaved Death after a lost game of limbo where he cheated by making his pet rat enter Death's eyesockets.

*** That is a really nice ideia, especially Betelgeuse being a Black and being accidentally summoned by Harry.

** I can just picture Gomez, dressed for river fishing in very fashionable leather [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waders_(footwear][waders]]), casually whistling as he fishes for inferi with a steel fishing pole, a steel cable fishing line, and a hook the size of his fist, baited with bloody flesh of unclear origin.

Also, it would be refreshing to see an Addams Family crossover that /wasn't/ Harry-centric. On the other hand, Regulus has been an adult and a veteran terrorist at that point---so how would adopting him for 14 years work?

*** You see, it's not exactly adoption, only Sirius call it adoption.

Regulus' situation is basically him, after waking up, realizing that he doesn't really want to go back to Britain, since he was considered a traitor, for the DEs and a veteran terrorist, for the light. So he just... became a guest ? Also, Grandmama has seen worse than the dark mark, so she just send some letter and "vanishes" it.

All in all, he first was a souvenir for Morticia, then a guest in the Addams mansion, then he becomes part of the routine of everyone in there (?), then a day he has a portrait in one of the halls (Which is how i think you are truly validated as part of the familly) and that is that.

Sure, it doesn't erase his time as a DE, and it takes a while for him to transition from a mentality of war, pureblood supremacy and wizard culture to one of... an Addams, who is a really big family, with a bunch of people, with a bunch of different manifestations of magic.

(I don't know if it's clear, it almost 5AM )

*** It's not /really/ adoption, that just sounds better than absorption or voluntary kidnapping.

** It's the Addams family... Did they save him from drowning, or is he now undead?

*** From drowning, and, though he does becomes and Addams, he continues to also being a Black, so he is part of the family, but not exactly undead, but still more resistant to damage than your average wizard.

(Sorry if it's messy, its almost 3 AM)
