Disclaimer - This first part is mostly a joke, please don't take it too seriously. I'm positing a thing to ponder, nothing more.

This came from Witcher's recent thread on the pointlessness of sorting by personality at age eleven - because I'm an obsessive worldbuilder, my brain sort of went "So, what else could they sort by at eleven?" and came up with two questions to ask.

+strikethrough+

*Here's the worldbuilding idea* - what if the American schools had a sorting hat too? Only instead of houses based on personality traits, it was based on which of the High School Movie Clique Archetypes you best fit? The Jocks, The Band Kids, The Stoners, The Princesses, The Nerds, The Geeks, The Dropouts/Burnouts, etc. I'm genuinely curious - what kind of schooling experience do we think that would make? What kind of story would a Harry Potter-esque series tell? What would previous events would get them to that point, what future events would that point get them to?

You get the idea, but feel free to add whatever thoughts you want - those questions are just examples. As I'm British, I feel I'm not as qualified to build some of those answers as the Americans amongst us are. Anyone feel free to weigh in, though. I'm looking for any thoughts whatsoever.

*And regarding the Hogwarts hat*, are there any other generalised Archetypes that you could see Britain sorting by instead of the basic Loyalty-Cunning-Intelligence-Bravery ones the current houses use? What do you think those different archetypes would change about the series? What kind of schooling experience would they make for? What previous events would get them to that point, what future events would that point get them to?

I'm thinking something like the Morrowind introduction system with Socucius Ergalla. For those who haven't played the game (and I highly recommend you do, it's the best Elder Scrolls world for sheer interesting-ness, IMO), he essentially asks several hypothetical situation questions and moderates based on how you answer - this then determines your class for the game depending on what level of combat-magic-stealth type answers you give.

If you have any fics exploring non-singular-personality-trait sorting, do feel free to link. As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** I think maybe instead of the high school stereotypes, you could have them sorted by learning type? Like, kinesthetic learners vs auditory learners vs visual learners. That would make it easier to teach them effectively, too; just shove a class of kids who learn in similar ways together and you don't have to worry too much about other learning styles in a classroom.

Of course, this is just me. Do whatever boats your float, my guy!

*** Like I said, I wasn't actually planning to do any of this, it's just an idea I was floating to consider. Armchair Worldbuilding, I guess. :D

Though for the record, learning types are about as valid as high school stereotypes. They've been debunked and remodified and changed about so many times, but there's still bugger all valid or reliable evidence to support them actually contributing or detracting from learning in any significant way and lots to suggest the evidence that people cite supporting them isn't as methodologically sound as we'd need it to be.
