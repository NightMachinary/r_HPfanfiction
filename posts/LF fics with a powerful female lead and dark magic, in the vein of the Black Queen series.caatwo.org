I was looking for dark!Hermione fics, but the majority I came across portrayed fluffy Hermione that occasionally had to murder someone, or they were classified as dark!Hermione but actually weren't. To me, a dark character is someone that is ruthless and often malicious. They use everything within their reach, from money to magic, to achieve their goals (mostly power).

I'd like to read about a dark!fem lead (fem!Harry, Hermione, Lily, etc) that kicks ass.

Hopefully I've flaired this correctly!


** I know what you mean. It's very hard to find a Slytherin!Hermione or a Dark!Hermione fic that doesn't cop out or turn into a romance with a Slytherin in Leather Pants.

- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) is a classic, of course.
- linkffn(New Blood by artemisgirl) seems to be going in that direction.
- linkffn(Darkest Witch of Her Age by darkrose0510) also fits the bill, I think.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...
