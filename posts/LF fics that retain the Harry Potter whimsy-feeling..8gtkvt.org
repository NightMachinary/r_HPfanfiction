I always considered that the whimsiness that was always in Harry Potter is one of the main reasons why it is so loved. You know how odd stuff is casually mentioned? And yet it still has this feeling of realness. I don't know how to explain it. That magical sensation is hard to find in fanfiction, which makes me quite sad.

Are there any fanfictions that still retain the charm of the Harry Potter books?

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

This one is an oldie, and unfortunately unfinished, as most whimsical stuff are, but it is an exquisite gem. linkffn(9744608)

  Here's an interesting fact that I just made up. In a strange universe slightly disconnected from this one, Harry Potter was born premature on the 31st of July 1980. In this story, he wasn't. Born 27th of September 1980 this is a Harry Potter with no scar, new classmates, a sinister looking wand, and somehow he's got a strange diary belonging to T. M. Riddle.

A bit different, but still fun. More cracky, yet still retains that whimsical feel. Like Harry thinks that the Hufflepuffs have a secret society conspiracy. Just read it, okay? It starts badly, but quickly goes into magic and fantasy.

PS. Sorry for the long reply.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances.

  Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.
