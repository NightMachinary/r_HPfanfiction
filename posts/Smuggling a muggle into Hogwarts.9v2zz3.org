Just curious if anyone has seen a fic doing this. If so, share! The most obvious candidate is Lily and/or the Marauders smuggling Petunia in (Maybe James heard Lily was missing her and tried to do a good deed and it implodes), since that can easily be used to help justify her hate of magic. But it would also be fun if done in the canon timeline, maybe with an OC or Hermione's parents or something.

The one thing I'm not looking for? Death Eaters smuggling a muggle in for their reasons. I'm not into torture porn, thx.

  littlebastardreviews posted the collected facts from the 2014 UK Editions of Harry Potter: and this fact caught my eye. 'Only one non-magical person has ever managed to get as far as the Hogwarts Sorting Hat before being exposed as a Squib.' But, gosh it just makes me want a story where a squib did make it through. So here's a drabble about a squib with a quick mind and a hand-me-down wand, who refuses to be denied her birthright. -- when the hat drops over her eyes it asks, 'well what do we have here?' she's got a forged hogwarts letter with penmanship that's perfect down to the ink splatter; she's got a complicated string of owls, only half of them forged, from parents to administration to ministry that's so complicated her name ended up on the first year roll call anyway. she's got ten arguments, four pleas, and one smothered threat on the tip of her mental tongue for why the house that comes out of this hat's brim better not be 'squib' she's got a lighter up her sleeve and an eight and a half inch wand in her belt that will never, ever work for her. 'well,' says the hat, 'better be slytherin then'

  It was Mrs. Figg who suspected first. She noticed many things, sitting on her side of her fence with her cats chasing butterflies and nuzzling her ankles, Mundungus and the other watchers dropping by for tea now and then. Mrs. Figg noticed that Petunia was a nosy bit of work with insecurities hanging from her every harsh angle. She noticed when Dudley learned the word MINE-- the whole neighborhood noticed that one. She noticed that Vernon glared at owls.She noticed that when Petunia gave Harry a truly horrendous haircut one year, it grew back in at a normal rate. Harry was uneven and weird-looking for ages, hiding under beanies when he could. When Mrs. Figg had Harry over for carefully miserable afternoons of babysitting, she noticed nothing moved that shouldn't. He didn't accidentally make flowers out of fallen leaves, or levitate anything during tantrums, or turn toys funny colors. Mrs. Figg called up her mother, interrupting the wizarding bridge game she was winning against the nursing home staff, and asked her how she had known, decades back, that her youngest daughter was a squib.

** Well, they always say you can't spell "smuggle" without "muggle"!

There's a bit of a flaw in this, though, given that Hogwarts has enchantments on it that (A) cause it to appear as ruins to Muggles and (B) cause them to forget what they were doing if they attempt to approach it. So I'm not sure how to do this while still sticking to canon.

*** Impossible has never stopped the twins. I recall A little girl shall lead them handling that pretty well (but there was no smuggling in that one). And the cannon rules only apply to approach, not if anyone actually made it past the barriers.

Plus I never said the attempt had to be successful. A determined set of Weasley twins, the wards of Hogwarts, and an ever increasingly confused muggle bystander would be a great cast for 'twins repeatedly try and comedically fail at pulling off a prank'

Harry smuggles his OC love interest into Hogwarts. It's not really a big part of the story though.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
