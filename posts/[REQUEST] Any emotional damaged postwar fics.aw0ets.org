** Okay so, doesn't quite fit until later but if you want to read about really struggling people and the effects of war Linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb) and the sequels are absolutely brilliant, I'd definitely recommend having a read of them.

** Okay so Linkffn(Novocaine) kinda fits this. It does deal with Post war healing and Harry does have an aweful backstory, but its not Ginny/Harry but rather Daphne/Harry, its more about society healing than individuals. It does contain individual healing but it is not quite the primary factor that drives the story. Maybe it fits your needs

** linkffn(Betrayed by kateydidnt) may look like a angsty bash fest, but its actually fairly similar to what you asked for a few reasons (it is a post-war, Harry's a dad, he does shit that makes her daughter scared, sad and dislike him because of things out of his control, temporarily.) and its really really emotional at times.

Another one is linkffn(You and I by emilyherself) with a divorced Harry (no bashing, the love just ran out, there may have been a bit of cheating, I don't remember, but Ginny and Harry are fairly civil) and its about his life as a divorced father taking care of 3 children (he has custody, she gets them sometimes) while trying to fix his life. Not the best of fics, but serviceable.

The BEST fic postwar about family though is linkffn(Grow Young with me) so you may have read it before, and it was just updated last week, after 11 months of waiting ( it was never at risk of being abandoned, the author is a lovely lady that has a tumblr where she updates us all both about the percentage and her life/work, while also giving snnipets of the past, present or future of the fic, called Random Fact of the Week. just check it out, its taliesin-19 on tumblr)

  Post- DH/ AU. Healer Sadie Lewis never knew that fixing Al Potter's broken leg would lead to such a profound romance with his father. Harry/OC, Ginny/Dean, all other canon intact. Rated M for later chapters. All reviews appreciated!

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
