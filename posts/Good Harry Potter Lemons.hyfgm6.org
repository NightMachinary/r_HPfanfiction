I've been trying to find a good lemon that doesn't involve Harry being paired up with any guys or one of the girls he has really no logical business being with (I.e. Fleur, Daphne Greengrass), but all the ones fitting that description are super clunky and the writing sounds really awkward or just downright awful.

Does anyone have any legitimately good suggestions for lemons with Harry?

  After the Death Eater attack at the Quidditch world cup sends Harry into an overworked panic trying to get stronger, Hermione resorts to desperate measures to get him to relax. Namely, secret nightly visits to help him let off some steam, but Harry's not quite as sleepy as he lets on, and Hermione is in for a while slew of surprises to come. Commission for Lord of Bones.
