Hi guys, I'm new to the group, my name is Bruno i am from Brazil and I've been an illustrator since i was droped from my work in October 2020, since then a lot has changed in my life and now I feel much more satisfied with what I do. I'm passing by to offer my character design services (paintings or drawings), scenes or even to make an interesting cover for your fanfic . Please forgive me if this type of post is not allowed in this group, I just thought it might be a good proposal for you

*With my illustrations you can:*

1. Stand out with a profile photo for your fic to use in social networks.
2. catch a glimpse of your OCs with a full body or portrait illustration.
3. Prepare a unique illustration depicting the climax of your story.
4. have a prominent cover for your fanfic

I will only needs a quick briefing and and i will make you aware of my entire creation process and you can participate in it too if you want to propose ideas

*what I would love to do:*

- Portraits of your favorites characters.
- creatures.
- Original characters.

you will receive as default .png files with geometrical background (for portraits) or full background (for a full illustration) in the size you chose and all rights over art.
