I have a finished fan fic with nothing but good reviews. However, it ends with Harry sacrificing himself to save everyone. I asked if anyone would like a sequel and I got to responses for yes but there have been no other comments on it. It continues to get likes and is being read...so the question is do I post a sequel, or keep it with my original ending of Harry dying to save everyone, or do I just wait for more feedback? Thanks for any advice.


** There are way too few fics that have killed off Harry. So I highly recommend that you stick with your original decision. Do you have a link?

** Finish the story as you originally planned.

For a sequel you can retcon, horcrux, have a higher power restore him, or figure out something new. Edit: or branch from a just before he dies to make an new au.

** I agree with the others- keep the integrity of your original work and create something new for the next story. What of the original story can't be included easily in the new one? Alternately you can make an 'AU' of your earlier work if there are some elements that are too specifically tied to it.

** Keep the integrity of the original work, and then try something new for the sequel.

What are the effects of Harry's legacy? Forget the established characters. Skip a generation. What happens to those who know of Harry Potter, but didn't know Harry Potter.
