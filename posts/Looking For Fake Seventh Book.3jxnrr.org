No it isn't The seventh horcrux. There was some other fake seventh book I managed to find on either bearshare or limewire on the day before the real seventh book came out.

If memory serves, Neville Longbottom dies when Bellatrix Lestrange uses some strange creatures to attack Hogwarts. Harry's depression as a result of this loss somehow causes him to cheat on Ginny with some random gypsy. I can't remember if she was actually a gypsy or not or if that was just the impression I got. Further Snape would show up randomly on occasion, bind Harry up so he couldn't attack Snape, and then teach him for a bit before disappearing as randomly as he came.

I know it isn't a very good fic, but I'm just curious how the rest of it goes or if it was ever finished, as the copy that was used in lieu of the seventh book ended quite abruptly. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
