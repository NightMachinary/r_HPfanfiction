** It is good ao far as you can ignore the obvious child abuse vibes. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, children can be shockingly obtuse about that stuff but having Lupin smile paints him in such bad light. And Harry, canon Harry, would be somewhat sympathetic after his experiences with Dursleys.

*** Dracos boggart taking the appearance of his father doesn't mean that he is specificly afraid of his father. Hermiones boggart is McGonagall but her worst fear is failure. Draco. Depending of what Boggart Lucius says, Dracos worst fear could be to disappoint his father, that they are not truly Pure Blood or even that his father loves something Muggle (just from the top of my head). The child abuse idea is just one among many others.

*** i understand where you're coming from. however, with the amount of rubbish the golden trio had to deal with from malfoy i doubt they would have much sympathy for him, especially with his whole Mudblood obsession. i was hoping to make it a bit light hearted. but thanks for the honesty i really appreciate it :)

**** I think if you were to extend it you could explore Harry and Malfoy coming to an understanding of sorts through their shared experience, definately not friends, but maybe Malfoy eases back a bit.

*** Definitely disappointed in Lupin here.

If a child's worst fear is one of their parents, you know that things are not right at home.

** Yeah I just felt bad for Malfoy. Being so scared of your father that a boggart picks it up? And then everyone laughs at the obvious child abuse going down behind the scenes? Then Harry laughs at it like he wasn't abused by the Dursley's. I'd like to think Harry isn't a mini James and would feel fucking awful and would offer Malfoy help/support even if Malfoy will split in his face.

** It's funny. I imagined it as it being his father, but a bit differently

--------------

A simulacrum of Draco's father flowed out of the cabinet. 'Lucius' smiled at Draco. "Ah, Draco. I have signed a marriage contract for you.. When you come of age, you will wed the smartest girl of your year, Hermione Granger. Her brains and our bloodline will produce exceptional Malfoys."

Draco stared in abject horror.

** I'm sorry, but I can't possibly laugh at this. It's like if a kid said that their father hits them and then everyone burst laughing.

Do you find it funny that children get abused? Do you understand how bad of a picture this paints for every single person in that room bar Malfoy? Harry himself was fucking abused, for fucks sake.

Do you realise that many bullies simply act that way because of how their parents treated them? Make abused children can grow up to be abusers themselves.

The children /may/ laugh because children are fucking stupid but /Lupin/? /US?!/

** Hi everyone i just wanted to thank everyone for the comments and i wanted to say i hear your concerns. when writing this, i was inspired by something online, and wanted to pursue it in a lighthearted way. however, i didn't realise the child abuse aspects of it. i will keep this post up, but in the future i will post a new version with an ending that's more serious. i will be taking any suggestions. thank you for the feedback!
