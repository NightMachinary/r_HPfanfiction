I read a story a while ago, pretty sure it was a haphne story where harry is in Slytherin and Draco gets a pet snake because he wasn't socially powerful or something in Slytherin. but it turns out the snake actually liked harry better and turns out to be a basilisk.

It was erased a while ago, luckily I finished it before it was erased.
