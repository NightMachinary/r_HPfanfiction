So ever since I first saw the movies I've been severely underwhelmed with the canon quidditch uniforms and sort of had a vague picture in my head of them but never really bothered to flesh it out.

Recently I thought I would add some of it to one of my stories and realised I really needed to sit down and think about what my idea was, you know, because writing ‘quilted linen robe' when the proper term is apparently ‘gambison' is not helpful for the reader; and when I check out whether others had also done that I found exactly squat all, which is honestly really weird, as we tend to enjoy playing with things.

Perhaps it's because of Joanne's iron grip on the aesthetics/merchandising of HP that has meant people didn't really mess with it?

anyway, I wanted to check in here, wondering if others had thought about it and what you picture when peeps are riding brooms around the place.

It's an interesting problem, because you're flying so you want any gear to be lightweight as possible, but they have bloody balls of iron flying at them all the time, so I just can't see them not wearing protective gear at all?

So in my mind they have a uniform traditionally based on armour (because robes and medieval vibes/an excuse to keep the noble family's armorers in work), and there's a bit of pomp and circumstance because pureblood parents want to be able to parade their talented children around.

I have some different school uniform traditions too, so I sort of launched from that.

Is this interesting to anyone else?

PS/I'm sorry if this post is a mess, my brain is not being very good to me today, but I wondered if others think about the costuming and fashion trends, because I studied both art and fashion and have Opinions about Joanne's aesthetics that I don't want to just cram into a fic (though it will always of course bleed into them).


** So I feel you always have to compromise aesthetics and logic for your story with those things. Because principally, everyone could wear a simple shirt for everything, and the different functions (protective, warming, supporting ...) would be achieved with magic. However, it's extraordinarily boring if you do that.

On the other hand, you also don't want to go into /too/ much functional garments. It just makes no sense that wizards have to bother with countless layers to keep warm, or bulky protective gear that's a hassle to wear, when they could simply use magic.

So the bottom line is that I'd keep an eye on style -- fluttering cape-like things just look /good/ when flying, or leather looks sufficiently martial -- and symbolic items like gloves that without magic wouldn't be protecting at all, and with magic not strictly needed, but make conceptual sense, the way magic in HP is conceptual: E.g. for "gloves", they help with "grip", and magic worked into it makes it so.

*** Yes, exactly!

The fluttering thing is actually a big thing. There are rules, like you need to have at least 45% coverage of the team colours, but then other things like I envisage that a lot of the old families have different armour Wes, and so there are different family traditions of styles of ‘armour'.

And then there are things like there is a certain amount of dramatic flair expected; showmanship. In my mind the Holyhead Harpies for instance have uniforms a little like the Amazons of Themyscira in the first Wonder Woman movie with the leather skirts that show off quite a lot of their body but also look badass with the kind of movements that are involved on a broom, and quidditch witches who are hoping to be scouted for that team will have that kind of accent on their uniform. Others might have capes or half capes, so that the audience can enjoy the show.

** Bear in mind that professional players probably wear very different gear to children, who may have very little money and grow quickly, so will need a lot of replacements. Unless you are making magically enhanced objects/clothing completely ubiquitous, probably Quidditch gear for Harry or the Weasleys would be mostly mundane (although the likes of Malfoy could be another matter).

I would assume that the primary consideration would be the fact that the Quidditch season runs through winter in the Scottish Highlands and they are explicitly stated to practice/play through storms, so they will need to be very weatherproof. Also different positions may wear different things (e.g. extra keeper padding, shock absorbing gloved for beaters). Maybe they are quite modular (you can strip off layers as you warm up or if they are soaked through). Finally you might consider referencing styles or enhancements that are banned, making yourself too buldgerproof maybe or too grippy gloves.

*** Also bright colours. Half the time at Hogwarts they must be literally playing in the dark.
