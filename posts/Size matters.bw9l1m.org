Any fics where the size difference (3-4 orders of magnitude) between the magical and the muggle worlds plays an important role?

Examples: Very little mass production in the magical world, books more expensive because even a magical bestseller is way less profitable than a completely unsuccessful muggle book, even large multinational corporations like Nimbus have just a few dozen employees, how do they even run the ministry on taxes when they employ a significant percentage of the population, how much research gets done with just a few dozen unspeakables instead of millions of scientists, etc


** So you're asking an in depth look at the economics of the magical world, but without thinking about how magic would change the costs of a family and businesses. Living costs are gonna be tiny for a magical family, no utility, no car insurance or fees, who needs to rent when you can expand a tent to the size of a small house. Businesses don't have to pay for raw materials when you can create or massively multiply what you already have and magic makes for incredible small scale automation. The wizarding world could exist easily on the idea that people work jobs because they're bored and find them fulfilling rather than due to a need for money to live.

I totally agree.

I think irl a lot of the earlier scientists were basically bored rich people who studied the world around them as a hobby.

Wizards would have even less need for money than they did, so it's even more plausible for them.

** Agreeing entirely with [[/u/Ironworkshop][u/Ironworkshop]] here. If we consider your argument on how magical books can't be mass-produced, this is easily circumvented by the existence of the Geminio charm and quills that can automatically write such as Rita Skeeter's quill. If there exists a quill that can actually add that much flair to events without input from a witch or wizard, surely there exists a dictation quill (I know fandom employs the idea of Dictation Quills liberally, but as far as I know that's fanon, not canon).

*** I think books could be mass produced, but at a much smaller scale than in the muggle world, so authors get much less.

Let's take the Daily Prophet, probably the best selling product in wizarding Britain.

Assuming ~100 students in a normal year that didn't have lower birthrates due to war and an average lifespan of 100 years, we get a population of 10k.

If half of those have a Prophet subscription (very optimistic since most households will only have one), then given the price of 5 knuts (Harry's first interaction with a post owl in PS) we get a daily income of 25k knuts or 50 galleons.

Even with no costs for printing and distribution (even though keeping thousands of owls would certainly cost something) that's only 50 galleons a day to run the entire newspaper organization.

So it's no big surprise that the quality of journalism isn't the best (Skeeter) and it's easily bribed. Or that the Quibbler which is run by a single guy can become serious competition.

Or let's take Lockhart: One of the most successful authors, and yet he's desperate to teach even though he isn't qualified and risks exposing his incompetence, because the stunt sells all 7 of his books to ~5% of the entire national population, which probably doubled his fortune.

Or Bathilda Bagshot: She literally wrote the history books that generations of students (not just 7 years like Lockhart) use, and yet she only makes enough for an average life in Godrics Hollow.

Authors just don't make much when the audience is 1000 times smaller.

Result: Low quality books and journalism.

There's also very little mass production with potions, instead of large corporations making thousands of bottles and selling them like in the muggle world, many brew their own potions a bottle at a time.

Or research: How many unspeakables, spellcrafters, potion developers, enchanters are there? Compared to how many scientists and engineers? How many new inventions get created in the wizarding world?

All these things cause serious differences between the two worlds, it's not just "this world has magic and the other not".

What you are missing is the vast differences in purchasing power. The biggest problem is you are thinking like a muggle. Wizarding economy fundamently differs from our own. Muggle economy is based on supply and demand. This economy would fail for the wizarding world because they have infinite supply and limited demand. Wizarding economy funcions on a convienence basis. They have money because its convienent. For example, if I wanted to get some bread, I have no choice except to buy or to wait months to make it. A Wizard finds a pebble and makes it into a rock. Remember, non-permanant tranfiguration is fanon. If I want to build a house can I? No. I would need to hire many workers to build it for me and wait for a long time. Wizard only needs to tranfigure a pebble into a dog house and expand it either literally or just the inside. Why money then? Like I said, convenience. A wizard could apparate to the forbidden forest and go hunt for unicorns for potions or wand or they could just be lazy and have someone else do it for them. There is very little a wizard cannot do himself. Even complex magical items like brooms are easy to make. You dublicate it. Why pay then? Geminio charm has one slight downside. The copies decay more quickly. You could keep making copies, or for convienience sake you buy the broom. Lets return to the purchasing power shall we? How much can say two galleons buy? Well, two galleons are enough money to buy school supplies for five children going to Hogwarts. Including Lockhart's books. I legit could go on.

#+end_quote

My previous reply will apply here too. Do note that even in our world journalism is garbage. Wizarding world has one Skeeter. Us Muggles have many journalists like that. Possibly worse even. Lets look at CNN. They are fond not only of making lies(3 years Russian hoax and doubling down after being proven wrong about it, but they are also fond of blackmailing civilians. You said something we don't like? You better change your mind or we will expose all of your private data to the world. Some news companies don't even threaten. They just doxx. Dailybeast for example.)

Prove it. Prove that that is his reasoning. What would be more logical conclusion? He just liked showing off. He just liked fame. Going to teach at school full of people who worship your books is a good way to achieve that and get the ego boost he craves. Plus, it makes you look good in public. "Monster slayer gives some of his valuable time to teach children". That sounds pretty good. More ego boost. Alternativly, he is simply incompatent with anything other than memory charms so he couldn't make a living

One, do you have any proof of that? Two, why wouldn't they? It prevents such mess like the US healthcare. It removes greed from the equasion. You make what you need. Potions are not that useful in day to day either way. And you can just make a bunch of them and keep them for emergencies. You know what would happen if Muggles got hold of a way to make arms regrow in a day or two? They would charge millions. Wizards don't need to deal with that shit. Why would you deal with that shit of it wasn't absolutely neccesary? "Maam I broke my arm, can you get me the instafix potion? Sure, that will be 1000 galleons please."

***** A convenience based economy would mean that money would matter very little and that isn't the case with Malfoy being important and the Weasleys being poor. Money still matters.

The wizard's economy still has supply and demand, but it's mostly services instead of goods.

Magic allows you to conjure anything you want, but it still takes work and, if you want decent quality, skill. Which not everyone has. So you'd still have people pay each other for services so that everyone can do the thing that they are good at.

Just because you can theoretically transfigure yourself a house, doesn't mean that it'd automatically be a liveable one, or that it'd have all these magical features like floo connections. You'd still have to employ specialists since you can't learn to be amazing at everything.

Magic doesn't write you a book. A quick quotes quill makes it easier, but the quality is lacking, so writing a good book can still take years of work. That's not free and with a tiny target audience it's actually quite problematic.

You still need people to work hard for certain things. Teaching, writing, selling, managing, paperwork, producing goods (even with magic making it easier it still takes some work, especially for complicated unique items), research, arresting dark wizards, enforcing secrecy, guarding Azkaban (why would anyone do that if money didn't matter?), operating magical machinery (driving the knight bus), etc

The wizard economy is much more service oriented than the muggle one, and the profitability of many services scales with the amount of people using it, which is why the tiny size of the population is so important.

It legit doesn't. Malfoys are rich, sure, but that proves nothing. Your argument is flawed. Malfoys aren't important because they are rich. They are important for their social status. Long lines of purebloods, wizengamot seats, not being muggle lovers, not being blood traitors. Furthermore, whilst Weasleys are rich, they have pretty high standart of living. Way better than a normal muggle. Infinite food? Yup. Huge house? Yup? Big family but no one is suffering from food problems, living space, clothing? Yup. Can they do their hobbies? Yup. Look at Arthurs Car tinkering and enchanting and Molly's sweater making.

You only pay for convienence. You can do everything yourself. You only pay if you want to, not if you need to. In our economy, we pay because we need to. Because we cant do it ourselves and if we could it would not be as easy or as good.

You can easily learn to be good in everything. We need to spend years to learn how to build houses or how to grow things correctly or how to do medicine. They only need to pass the school everyone gets enrolled in. 7 years to learn to be good at everything you'll need in day to day life.

I never said it doesn't matter. Feel free to quote me and prove me wrong. But it has little value because fundementally you can literally do everything yourself. Wizards do jobs that they are intrested in and want to do. And their society has formed around that. If a government collapsed, nothing would really change. Everyone can take care of themselves. And Aurors are not that needed. They are only needed in wartimes. Hell, even if the statue of secrecy collapsed, nothing would happen. Within an hour the muggles would be serving the wizards.

Sure, their healthcare is better than the pile of shit in the US, but that's hardly a high bar. They can heal broken bones instantly, but they can't heal the Longbottoms, or regrow Moody's leg, or cure Remus, or fix Harry's eyesight.

Sure, they can apparate. But that's restricted in many places, kids can't do it, elderly probably also can't do it. There's the Floo Network, or the Knight Bus, but guess what? Both cost money.

Very slowly tho. That is due to lack of need for progression in their minds.

That's false. Wizards and magic are logical. Suprisingly an 11 year old girl declaring that the entire Wizarding race is illogical should not be taken serously. Wizards and magic follow their own unique logic. If a muggle decides to break a wall, he needs to calculate the force required to do so before attempting it. A wizard can just wave his wand and decide he wants the wall gone. Magical animals and flowers, trees, ect, have their own qualities. So wizards decided to use that to boost their own powers via wands.

Technically there could be a difference since time of day could affect the temperature of the experiment, but yeah. But is it really a limitation? The logic is still follawable and they can do a lot more.

**** Lockhart: I think it's more likely that considering his ego, he flattered himself into thinking he was doing the world a great favour by teaching the younger generation. For Lockhart, I don't think profits actually entered his mind as well; he was driven by a desire for status, rather than a desire for profit - either way, there's no canon reference to back up either of our arguments, other than how we choose to interpret Lockhart's character and actions.

But really, I agree with your points; they are quite valid takes on what the wizarding world is like due to having a smaller economy with limited human resources. Fewer researchers mean fewer steps toward progress. It's a simple matter of math. The thing is though, a lot of it is reflected in canon. The wizarding world is obviously behind in terms of technology, and it's also suggested that it's relatively stagnant or slow with progress. This makes sense because, as you said, they have a smaller population - not only that, because their economy is convenience-based, as [[/u/Lakas1236547][u/Lakas1236547]] argued, they aren't driven to profit in the same way as the real-world economy, where multinational corporations and scientists are driven to progress in order to profit. This comes with its own can of worms - for one, the real-world economy's mass production and astronomical numbers of profit come at a direct cost to the environment.

Essentially, I agree that there will be massive differences (like the ones you've outlined) between the Muggle and the magical world due to the differences in their economy. However, the kind of differences you want to focus on is somewhat problematic to me. You're asking for a fic that highlights on all the things that the real-world, capitalist economy has given us (profit, convenience, progress, information), but not really considering all the downsides that come with it, which is really where I disagree with you. If you want a proper, nuanced exploration of the differences between the magical and the real-world economies, you have to consider the cost of progress and the cost of our economy.

Not necessarily everything. They're behind Muggles in things like phones and computers. During a time when Muggles were using typewriters to create neater, quicker work, wizards and witches were still using quills and parchment. Auto-writing Quills would surely help, but I think typing is still faster. They're not necessarily big things, but the gap could potentially widen if they do remain stagnant, especially considering electronics go haywire around magic. There is the advent of the Internet to consider too, though I'll concede these are mostly future concerns and therefore not really relevant if we assume OP is looking for fics set during the canon era.

They never needed phones. We needed phones because of insta communication. They can teleport and have a talk whenever they want. Alternativly they can just steal muggle phones if needed.

The only thing about a computer that would be useful is the internet. As far as we know they didn't have it from 1991 until Harry ended school. From there we had a massive time skip. They could have gotten it then. I mean they have radios, so I'm sure they can pull it off.

#+begin_quote

False. I quote it from the book:

"All those substitutes for magic Muggles use - electricity, computers, and radar, and all those things - they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there's too much magic in the air"

Only around Hogwarts. Nowhere else it is stated to do so. Remember if that was a thing, everything near Leaky Couldron that qualifies as a sub for magic would stop working.

Anyway, I feel like it's a fair trade. Muggles have a computer, Wizards can bring back the dead, repare bones quick, conjure pretty much anything out of thin air, ect.

Note, I was being dramatic with the "bring back the dead" although, Horcruxes, Inferi, Ressurection stone do exist.

And, honestly, anything muggles can make, so can wizards. Or at the very least use it. Wizards are just muggles that also have magic

#+begin_quote
  I think a good author might be able to work it in nicely enough
#+end_quote

The bigest problem is trying to remain impartial. Many authors love to Muggle-ise wizarding world, or Muggle-wank. A great author could do it well, but I'm not sure if anyone would want to make one.

You end up getting fics where tech surpasses magic, which ruins the fantasy element.
