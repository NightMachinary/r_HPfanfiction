As the title says I'm looking for smut of straight pairings as long as it is not Draco/Anything I will appreciate any answers. Thanks


** Every one of my stories is Smut-with-Plot, I'm quite surprised it wasn't taken down on fanfiction.net when the Purge happened.

I have it hosted elsewhere as well as keeping a copy locally, so if they do ever get rid of my stuff it will live on.

*** Wow, you know I'm actually really enjoying your /Hogwarts Shuffle/ fic quite a bit to my surprise. Most of these style fics are pretty terrible. I watched /Shuffle!/ a long time ago, and it reads quite a bit like a anime harem style HP fic done right. Well written and very fun, definitely better than the vast majority of harem fics out there (I'm only 4 chapters in, so I don't know if it turns into harem or not). It's really cool to see the concept actually working in a HP fic!

Do you update often? I hope so, can't wait to move on to your other fics!

**** I am trying to update once a week, but I took several months off last year...

My motivation is back though, and my cousin is Beta'ing for me and bouncing ideas.

I'm glad you are enjoying it though!

** You should try 'A Boy and his Cloak' which was just recommended, as well as the author's other story 'It could only happen to Harry'.

In more general terms, here's a list of links for the erotic fiction sites that might offer better than average writing:

** /Ron/Hermione/

Post-DH. Very good Hermione/Ron first time fic. [[http://www.checkmated.com/story.php?story=10759]]

Post-DH. Hermione finds that her marriage with Ron is in a rut, and with Ginny's help she comes up with a plan to bring it back to life. [[http://www.checkmated.com/story.php?story=9777]]

/Harry/Ginny/

Post-DH, rated R. Ginny wants to be more than just the hero's girlfriend. Not really smut, but there are sexual situations; included because I really like this one. [[http://femmenerd.livejournal.com/293159.html]]

Post-Hogwarts (maybe OotP compliant?). Ginny has a bet with the twins and she has to seduce Harry. [[http://community.livejournal.com/hpgw_ficafest/15315.html]]

Post-DH. Harry and Ginny work through their problems in Fred & George's back room. NC-17 [[http://community.livejournal.com/catchmysnitch/63840.html?view=592224#t592224]]

/Remus/Tonks/

Remus/Tonks, rated R. Interesting how the colour of her hair changes as their relationship does. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/135668]]

Remus/Tonks. Not pure smut, it's actually a chaptered story about their relationship during OotP, but there are some smutty scenes. Really good. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1516647/14/Werewolf-and-Metamorph]]

Wow, looking through all my saved fanfic links, I didn't realise how much of the smut was either slash or Draco/Hermione...
