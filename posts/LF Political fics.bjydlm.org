I'm looking for fics that involve politics, speeches, propaganda, the reactions from the pureblood elite and the common people, politicians trying to outmaneuver each other, preferably with Hermione managing to install a proper democracy in the end.

I've just read Democracy by Starfox5 and loved it. The protagonist having different views created a very interesting perspective.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13001252/1/Annals-of-Arithmancy][Annals of Arithmancy]], linkffn(13001252), is the only I know of apart from Starfox5 fics, and you need to read its two prequels.

--------------

As for other political fics, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), gets my top vote. Blood status is no longer an issue here, Wizengamot is totally defunct, and the major players are playing for much bigger stakes. Unfortunately, your favorite character Hermione plays only a minor role.

*** I liked the entire Arithmancy series but it doesn't really have a big political aspect, it focuses almost entirely on the spellcrafting. When it comes to politics I feel like the Accidental Animagus does a much better job.

  Part 3 of The Arithmancer Series. Hermione won the war, but her career as the world's greatest arithmancer is just beginning. Now, she has places to go, spells to invent, and a family to start. Oh, and a whole lot of dementors to kill.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  Chessmaster Volume I. AU. Harry discovers that cleverness is the best way to outwit Dudley and his gang, which leads to a very different Sorting. While Harry and his friends try to unravel Hogwarts' various mysteries, the political tension in the Wizengamot reaches new heights as each faction conspires to control the fate of Wizarding Britain. Sequel complete.

**** I'm currently writing the fourth one, but the first three are complete. I've outlined everything, so it's just a matter of chugging away at actually writing.
