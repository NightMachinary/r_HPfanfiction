There's an incident (something something cunfoundus) and Teddy Lupin realizes that his magical guardian, The Man-who-conquered, Harry James Potter, Head Auror has been secretly manipulating him.

He realizes that Harry orchestrated the deaths of his parents, that he's been hiding his finances from him (Teddy loses a bank statement from Gringotts).

Teddy is actually the Heir to the Most Great and Ancient and Noble House of Lupin, and that Harry has convinced his family to dose him with amortentia keyed to Victoire Weasley (The boy has brain damage) to keep the boy under control forever!

So now, along with his muggleborn friend, Teddy Lupin must find a way to escape the clutches of the Dark Lord Potter and reclaim his rightful place as king of the werewolves.

** I can imagine this with Teddy being like 5-8 years old when he decides this and Harry isn't evil or dark but just goes along with it along with the rest of the family.
