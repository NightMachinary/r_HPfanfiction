As much as I love them, I haven't read much second generation. Do you guys have any recommendations? I like romance, but it's certainly not a requirement. I've read [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=240987][Delicate]] (and the sequel [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260113][Still Delicate]]), the first two of the [[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/muggle_index.html][James Potter]] series, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=283722][Starving Artists]], and most (but not all) of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3954448/1/Questions-and-Answers][Questions and Answers]].

Canon-Compliant please, with special preferences toward Teddy, Rose, Scorpius, and Albus.


** I recommend this one, with Teddy as the main character:

Hogwarts Houses Divided By: Inverarity The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy? Rated: Fiction T - English - Fantasy/Adventure - Teddy L., OC - Chapters: 32 - Words: 205,083 - Reviews: 730 - Favs: 782 - Follows: 177 - Updated: Apr 22, 2008 - Published: Dec 30, 2007 - Status: Complete

** Did you like Starving Artists? That's my kind of humor and I can rec similar. The author's a great friend of mine! If you liked it, the rest of her fics are of similar style and quality. SA was influenced by [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=272808][Al Potter and His Very Epic Plan]], which you might like if you like young Albus and Scorpius.

Are you open to OCs?

*** Yep, as long as they are written well! Tell your friend I enjoyed that story. It's been awhile since I read it, but it definitely made me laugh.

**** I have a big post of next gen recs [[http://oddhour.tumblr.com/post/42049412559/hey-recommend-other-hpff-fics-like-with-awesome][here]], mostly humorous slice-of-life type stories with light romance. Most are OC but [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]] features Rose and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293736][It's Called Adventure]] features Hugo, Scorpius and Neville. From a different rec post, I'd also rec [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=309592][All The Abstract Nouns]] for a great gen Molly II and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=296549][One and Only]] is probably my all-time favorite romance, also with Molly II.

Abandoned fics but perfectly all right despite that fact: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=268282][The Morning Waffle]] is great ensemble humor with Fred, James, and co. leading a radio show. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=286886][After Hours]] is one of my ensemble rom-coms of choice, featuring the Weasley girls.

I also write next-gen! You might like [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][And Capers Ensue]] - it's an ensemble adventure-comedy with heists and sugar and a body count. SA was a big influence for me when I started this!

If you like any of the above fics, PM me or something; I talk to quite a few of those authors and I'd love to pass it on! :)

** Here are some. They are completed unless I say otherwise.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4260581/1/Lessons-Learned][Lessons Learned]], a slightly depressing Rose/Scropius fic complete with prequel and sequel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4493053/1/Getting-it-Right][Getting It Right]], a high quality, fun and upbeat Rose/Scorpius.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6259077/1/Compliments][Compliments]], another Rose/Scorpius. Good but not memorable enough for me to remember specifics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7247394/1/Thicker-Than-Blood][Thicker Than Blood]], general next-gen fic that hasn't been updated in six months.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8255131/1/Ignite][Ignite]], a Rose/Scorpius romance-adventure with a sequel currently being updated at a good rate.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5724013/1/The-Magic-Word-Is-Sorry-Not-Please][The Magic Word is Sorry, Not Please]], a general, drama filled, incredibly crafted fic. My favorite next-gen fic. Deals with the whole Weasley-Potter family.

*** I second "Ignite" and its sequel - it's got an engaging and original (which is harder and harder to find, these days) plot, and the characters are dimensional and interesting to read about. :) Slide also has a superb writing style. :)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374597/respitechristopher][Respitechristopher's]] Mercury Chronicles series is very good. The first in his series was written as an authorized sequel to Lady Altair's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]], arguably the best one-shot in the fandom.

*** Really great story, at least the first time I read it. Rebel Malfoy is rather boring, within 10 chapters his whole first 2 years and beginning of 3rd year is happening so it can skip to when Lily is around. Slytherin's Potter is best when her siblings are around, so summers and her first 4 years or so. Lily is extremely overpowered though.
