So many stories have stories where the Death Eaters are actually good guys and just misunderstood. Like, Harry/Daphne seems to be a surprisingly popular pairing from this sub, which is pretty baffling (imo).

So, I was wondering if there was any stories where we see Death Eater kids, or Death Eater kids in training actually hate Muggleborns, Squibs and creatures, actually think that Dumbledore is crazy and that I don't know, Harry Potter is annoying. (Not just Draco; though that's always a plus as well).

No Harry/Hermione, definitely no Draco/Hermione

No super powerful Harry or super Smart Harry, Harry more powerful or more smarter then he was in canon is fine, but make it believable!

I'd actually love a story where the author isn't afraid to show the Death Eater kids/Death Eater kids in training kill some good guys, take it to that extra level.

No Seer Luna

No Weasley bashing please! As I really love that family.

Can be as canon or as AU as possible


** I don't have any recs for you but can I ask what LF means? I'm new to this sub Reddit and can't figure it out lol
