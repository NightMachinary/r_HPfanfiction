** They are like siblings. Also: where do you get that hate for Hermione from?

** Why have you copied and pasted a post from DLP that I very much suspect does not belong to you?

** I'd say that it's the likeliest postwar scenario. Not because Ron is a moron or Ginny a cheating slut (or whatever is the bashing favor of the month), but because they cannot really relate to what Harry and Hermione had been through. Even in the darkest hour, the Weasleys had each other to fall back to. Ron leaves the hunt? Guess he'll hang out at his brother's place. Neither Harry nor Hermione had that option. For a couple of months it was them vs the rest of the world. No one else can relate to that. The DA had at least a dozen members, the Order still at least five, the Weasleys at least a dozen and so on. But there were just two people camping in the wild, cut off from everybody else.

Not that it'd be a whirlwind romance or anything. More one born out of the need for comfort and the knowledge that they have gone through hell and back together and came out victorious. It wouldn't be grand gestures but blurred lines, touches being too long to be platonic, hugs to frequent to count as friendly and so on.

*** It's always funny to watch someone who's so full of hate like you spreading such a nonsense, LOL.

**** Where do you see hate in this statement? I am mocking bashing, not supporting it.

** They're good friends with all ups and downs good friends have. However, I can't find a single indication in the books that there could be anything romantic between the two of them.\\

*** I'd say that they are the most likely option for each other because everyone else has more cons. Ron ran away, and knowing that it was the Horcrux doesn't repair broken trust (because it is not steered by rational thought). Ginny cannot relate to Harry because she wasn't there during the hunt. 99% of the magical society was content to sit at the sidelines ("and where have you been during the battle of Hogwarts? ").

I cannot see Ron/Hermione work out long term due to his Horcrux induced flight because if anything, Hermione is one to overthink stuff and once the seeds of doubt are sowed, a successful relationship is highly unlikely.
