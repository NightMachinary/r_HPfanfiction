I read a fan fiction likely around 2011(I started reading HP in 2010). The only thing I remember is that Harry and Ginny have sex in the Room of Requirement because they were hiding in there for an extended period of time. I also remember that there's some dialogue with them and Ron and Hermione and HP and Ginny tell them they had sex and Ron/Herm reply that they did too. I think it takes place around years 5 and up. As you can tell, I don't remember much since it's been 7ish years. I believe it's on the, Sink Into Your Eyes, site because I thought that was the name of it all these years.


** I'm not sure which one you are talking about, but try asking on [[/r/HarryandGinny]].
