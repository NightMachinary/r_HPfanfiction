It doesn't have to be the main theme but I can't really imagine only one of them going bad. Rather that they would take turns leading and pushing each other in a direction that eventually leads them to go dark.


** I'd like to read one in which the horcrux is as strong as the One ring from LOTR and they all get turned against each other and kill each other until one has their precious.

** Depends on your definition of "Dark". I can easily, very easily, see them starting to kill any enemies on sight after all the torture and trauma they endured.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
