** That would work as a R-rated HBO/Netflix series, but would bomb as Children's literature.

Despite some problems with the HP Books, I personally enjoyed it far more than A Song of Ice & Fire.

There are simply no likable characters for me in ASoIF. They could all die and I wouldn't give a damn about them. But if certain HP characters are killed off, I will be very very pissed.

*** I just finished season 5 last night. So far the only adult characters I don't completely despise are Bronn and Tyrion Lannister. I mourned the Lannister daughter and the Baratheon daughter that were needlessly killed, however I realize that life in that universe is nasty, brutish, short, and cruel.

**** That world was more similar to our own history, which was generally brutal and depressing. I don't necessarily want to read a fiction to satisfy my needs for dark and edgy stuffs, Edward Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' would serve that purpose even better.

*** Well, I kind of like that ASoIF doesn't have many likable characters, since most of them will probably die at some point, you get the unexpected WTF of a well written, well established character dying without all the emotional turmoil. If they killed off Hermione or Minerva, I'd rage.

** TIL due to looking it up: A Game of Thrones was published a year before the first Harry Potter Book. So yeah the last point is pretty true.

At least the people that Rowling killed stayed dead. Looking at you Mance, Brienne, Cat, Jon, Gregor, Sandor, and Davos.

I agree with InquisitorCOC, ASoIaF, has grown a bit tedious. His vaunted willingness to 'kill Main characters' is overblown. In Feast and Dance none die, well except Jon, and the only shocking thing would be if Jon was actually dead. I'm pretty sure none die in Clash of Kings, either. Eddard Stark and the Red Wedding stick out.

ASoIaF is one of the very rare instances where the video version has actually transcended the books, in my opinion at least. Both aren't without their faults mind you, but the show does quite a few things a lot better than the books. See: Hardhome.

I will never forget or forgive the whole Dorne travesty. It was illogical, inconsistent and contributed nothing to the plot. It also had some of the cringiest lines of the series so far.

*** To be fair, a lot of those deaths come from unreliable narrators and happen off screen. Only two of those actually come from Deus Ex Machina type plot-devices, and you couldn't even really say that Catelyn Stark is alive after what she turned into after the Red Wedding. And we can only speculate what will happen to Jon in the books based on the show.

*** I agree, if you're going to kill people off, do it properly, and let their deaths have an impact. In Worm, the author rolled dice to see who would survive including the protagonist, and the dead stayed dead. IMO the first couple of seasons are better than the books, but then later even the show began to get stale.

** Not sure how Martin would deal with Urban Fantasy, but I'll take a crack at it. Harry will likely be prodigious and powerful at magic but constantly filled with anger and a need for revenge due to the death of his father, and the death (and probably rape) of his mother. Knowing Martin, Pettigrew would have been the one to kill James, while Voldemort attempted to kill Lily and Harry. The cottage exploding would have disfigured Pettigrew's face or something, and Harry scar would be on a more significant place, like his chest. Book one would be partially the same, although the Troll incident would involve a lot more bloodshed. For plot's sake, Hermione would survive, but Ron would be a bloody smear on the wall as Dumbledore comes in to save the day. Harry would be overcome with depression, as he would feel that he let Ron die, despite not being able to do anything about it, he would train up his magic, likely getting involved in super dangerous shit, illegal, whatever you name it. Using magic like a drug of sorts. On edge wouldn't be the word to describe Harry, I doubt Snape would be capable of handling a Jon-like Harry. Fast forward a bit through POVs of unnecessary politics with Dumbledore, ominous research with an anti-social Hermione, then we go back to the Harry POV. Hermione tells Harry that she crossed a few T's and dotted a few I's, whatever, whatever, blah blah blah. Harry-Hermione underage sex scene.jpg

Harry goes to take the stone so he can destroy it because immortality didn't seem like much of a prize in this world. He easily passes through the Puzzles, which likely got ten times as dangerous and thirty times as advanced.

He sees Qurriel standing in front of the Mirror.

Duel happens, Harry gets stomped. Not before he destroys the mirror of erised and Quirrel kills him in a Killing Curse fueled rage.

Book 2 will be quite boring, more Dumbledore politics, a secret project he working on with Flamel will be hinted at. And several mentions to the hospital wing will be thrown around through his mind. Hermione would be confused the whole year, trying to find out what happened to Harry, etc... The attacks from the Basilisk start happening again, this time people die, it's easy to spot that it's a Basilisk due to the Killing-Curselike state they're in. But no one can find out where it's coming from. At almost the end of the book, Harry is revived through the previous mentions of the Nicholas project. Harry goes down into the Chamber and mutilates the Basilisk to the point of it being unrecognisable. He goes to Gryffindor common room, queue underage sex between Hermione and freshly revived Harry.

** I went and read that comment and then realized it was by [[/u/luna_lovewell]], no wonder it was well thought out. If you're not familiar, she does some great writing in [[/r/WritingPrompts]] and also has her own subreddit of her work at [[/r/Luna_Lovewell]]. Obviously, she is a fellow Potter-fan and a good deal of her writing could be considered HPfanfiction. :)

** In some way, I think it could've been great, more consistency and hinting at stuff from the very start, more side-character development (it always kind of bothered me that pretty much every Death Eater is a blank slate), different POVs, less clear-cut light and dark, and such.

*** So true. Harry Potter, in the end is a children's book. There is a dichotomy between light and dark, good and evil and no clear explanations about so many things.

One of the reasons i love Fanfictions that build the HP world, there is so much missing in what we know from canon. Practically begging to be added to.
