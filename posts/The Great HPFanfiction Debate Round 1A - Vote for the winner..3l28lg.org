**** Perhaps before the next debate we could have a poll on what people think and the same poll after, and declare the winner based on the difference of the two polls. I feel that many people are going to vote for whichever side they support regardless of the argument since they will find themselves more compelled to listen to the evidence of their side.

***** I might do that for a comparison but using that to determine the winner just means that whoever goes with the unpopular one is at a quantifiable disadvantage.

** One thing to think about for future topics is how the wording affects the difficulty of effectively arguing a point. For example, I think 'Ron and Hermione are fundamentally incompatible' is a pretty absolute statement that's harder to argue convincingly than 'Ron and Hermione are not fundamentally incompatible'. The first is trying to prove a negative, "there is no possible way a relationship between Ron and Hermione could work", whereas the latter only has to show that there exists /some/ way in which it could work. I don't know how easy it will be to avoid this, but something to think about.

**** I might also suggest you assign people a PRO and CON sides beforehand.

I'm not exactly sure how it was done this time around, but in a normal debate, you are given a side to defend.

** In the end, I didn't draw any conclusions from the arguments. The point of a debate being to convince others of an argument, I'd have to say there's no winner. Unfortunately there's not an option for "No Winner" or similar in the poll, so I'm going to abstain from voting.

 

Fun concept though.

*** It doesn't overtly involve fan fic, but it is present in a more subtle way. Part of the love we have for HP, I think, is the range of possibilities we're able to explore. In exploring possibilities, we also explore canon deeper. So, one could argue that by examining the canon more deeply, we are also able to discover new aspects in fan fic that we may not have appreciated before. I can't really separate canon from fic for this reason because one helps illuminate the other so well.
