What if Tom Riddle was born in a different time What if Tom Riddle was in Marauding era What if Tom Riddle Meets snape or James or other How would the story change


** Wow. So there would be a dramatic difference in a number of things. First of course would be the difference between 1930's orphanages and the end of government run orphanages in the 1960's. I don't know enough about what the situation for orphans was in the 60's to say exactly /how/ that would affect Tom's upbringing, but it certainly would.

Then there is the question of how a different introduction to the wizarding world would effect Tom. With someone other than Dumbledore doing the introduction it's less likely that his first interaction with another magical being would be having all his worldly possessions being lit on fire and being called out for stealing.

1960's would certainly make it far easier to figure out who his parents were as well, which would certainly change things.

All together there would be a lot of fundamental changes to Tom's upbringing and motivations before he really learned about magic.

** An idea I saw on DLP once and liked. Still do.

No BWL and Harry's in his mid 20s during the 1st war. If you're trying to make him the MC he's led an entirely different life.

Snape is an original inner circle member and TMR probably has a personal reason to hate James and Sirius lol.

** I'd be more interested seeing how Lily Evans would respond to another Muggleborn, tbh, and consequently, Snape too.

On one hand, Lucius Malfoy prince of Slytherin is a prince. On the other hand, Sirius Black and James Potter are two insufferable rich bullies who like tho pretend they're heroes

and then we have three poor kids who are blisteringly intelligent and resourceful, two of whom are charming and good looking and a third whose personality could be mistaken for a chimera

And, you know, the war isn't such a pressing concern, and the person who came to tell Tom about magic probably didn't burn the shit out of all of his worldly belongings (or pretend to) either

** I think there could be quite a few changes tbh. the likelihood of him creating a horcrux would be less and his circumstances would differ.

** I would think the events would be pushed by one generation. Tom Riddle would be busy collecting Horcruxes so he'd never have spies planted on Dumbledore to hear the prophecy. In any case the final battle would be a little more realistic since by the time Voldemort would start rising to power Harry would have had enough time to become an accomplished wizard himself.

Also it would be interesting if Harry wasn't Lily's son since Lily would be the Muggleborn girl killed by the basilisk when Tom opens the Chamber of Secrets. Snape would take it upon himself to avenge her from earlier on and could possibly become the mentor of the child who is meant to kill Voldemort because he'd have no allegiance other than Lily's memory by then and he could still accidentally overhear the prophecy when trying to apply for a position at Hogwarts.

*** The biggest thing is that he wouldn't have heard about Horcruxes from Slughorn. He also wouldn't have blamed Hagrid for the Chamber of secrets incident. These two things alone would have changed a lot. His upbringing being different as well, could mean he wouldn't become a dark lord, because he would have a lot of different influences. There probably wouldn't even be a prophecy

**** Also thought of this later but according to Dumbledore in HBP, Tom Riddle did not find about Horcruxes because of Slughorn. In fact, it's heavily hinted that he created at least one prior to that. Slughorn's memory was only relevant to gauge an idea of how many he made. I think that if he didn't go to Slughorn to ask him about them, it would also be much more difficult for Harry to figure out how many he created. So every time he destroyed a Horcrux, he'd have to attempt to kill Voldemort only for him to survive.

Also Hagrid was a collateral victim in CoS but what's not to say that he would find a different scapegoat when the school threatened to close? In fact considering how resourceful Tom was, I'd expect him to figure out Lupin's secret and expose him as a werewolf, while pinning the blame on him.
