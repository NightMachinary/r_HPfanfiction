Oblivious or otherwise. For crack or h/c or whatever is all good. Just read "Kid" by evansentranced linkffn(Kid by evansentranced) and it got me interested in the idea. I remember reading a similar fic years ago where all of Harry's classmates took turns being changed into a kid, and they had to pair up to take care of them, and it was fun. There was also another one, I think, where both Harry and Voldemort was changed into toddlers, and the Order members and Death Eaters had to work together to look after the two.

So, any similar recommendations? Slash or otherwise is good. Thanks a ton!


** No, I don't know of any fics where Harry becomes a [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kid#Etymology_1][goat]] animagus. They'd all be Aberforth/Harry 'ships, anyway.

  A Potion's "accident" turns Harry into an eight year old, and Draco Malfoy intends to kidnap him. But Harry's a passive-aggressive, revenge-obsessed little bastard. Maybe Draco will wait on that whole Dark Lord thing. POVDraco, pretty AU.

** This one: linkao3(1823242). Though it's technically Harry/Snape, it's pre-slash at best. Gorgeous story and one of my all-time favourites.
