**** Well what the hell is it gonna do? Be very silent? Take Harry's form and shout "Oh no I've gone deaf as well as blind" in his own voice? That sounds more like slapstick comedy than anything scary.

It might be more scary to the rest of the class, because the Boggart is working off the mental images of a blind person to shape its body.

** Similar to Blindness, I believe once he is blind his days at Dursleys would be relatively better, and he can totally develop a sonar of sorts.

Also, it'd be rather that Dumbledore or someone else would think of a magical eye/s as soon as they find out he is blind.

Lot of things will change, with Harry seeing Voldemort on the back of Quirrel's head. But let's say Voldemort keeps a low profile and does not emerge out till the end.

In second year, yeah the eye/s will help with the basilisk. Third year pretty much the same.

Fourth year, maybe he can try to connect with 'moody' due to similar experiences and realize he's not who he seems to be?

Not much change really if he gets a magical eye.

** In the first year he does not get made a seeker and Hermione has to turn her back so that Ron doesn't feel intimidated by people seeing him attempting to catch the flying key.

In his second year, he is, as you said, immune to the eyes of the basilisk, however he'd have to rely on his other senses in order to defeat it. Also he would only learn about the diary towards the end because earlier on he wouldn't pay attention to something that he cannot see or read.

In his third year, he cannot see the boggart so might have a harder time to learn the Patronus (actually that would make it quite an interesting story since the Patronus relies so heavily on visualizing your happiest memory). He would also not see his future self and confuse himself with his father, so he might act faster during the Dementor attack.

In his fourth year, Crouch-Moody might indeed allow Harry to use his eye-piece to give him an unfair advantage in the Triwizard Tournament. Harry would also use it look through Cho's robes.

In his fifth year, I wonder whether he could see through Voldemort's eyes. If he couldn't, he would be unable to save Mr. Weasley, but on the brighter side, he would not see the fake vision of Sirius getting tortured in the Hall of Prophecies so probably Voldemort would have to go by himself and risk exposure or find another way to lure Harry in. Also no Occlumency lessons with Snape. Also the Ministry would make fun of him because he could not technically say he saw Voldemort return.

In his sixth year he would have quite some trouble reading the Prince's instructions to worm his way into Slughorn's heart and win the Felix Felicis. So it would be more difficult convincing him to share his Horcrux memory.

In the seventh book, it would give Snape a harder time guiding Harry to the Sword of Gryffindor and, assuming that Dumbledore chose earlier to familiarize Harry with his and Voldemort's past verbally instead of taking him into the Pensieve, Snape would need to find another way to communicate to Harry that he's the final Horcrux. Also it would be rather sad that he never gets to see his parents.

*** There's a little cycle in books 1-6.

1 and 4: Voldemort is trying to regain a body in a convoluted way involving a minion at Hogwarts. Harry survives due to rare magic that Dumbledore explains at the end. There's dragons in both, and Harry sees an illusion of his parents.

2 and 5: Harry is ostracized by the wizarding world, a Horcrux is causing all sorts of problems for Harry, there's a real big snake, and Harry comes face to face with Voldemort - only surviving due to Dumbledore's intervention.

3 and 6: we learn a lot about past events that will shape the current war, Voldemort never makes an actual appearance in the book, there's a werewolf involved in the climax confrontation, and there's a big twist at the end that changes how we view a character.

Just something I noticed that I think is neat.

*** Ah yes, the dementor arc. Doesn't advance the voldemort storyline and instead spends the whole book playing around with Harry's dad's school mates, adding more faces to fit into the confusing prequel scene in book 1.

Not to mention, the three new characters are kind of a mixed bag as well. Remus Lupin is kind of bland and so retires easily into a background character. Sirius is off the map until his own little arc comes around in book 5 which ends with his death (what?)

Peter Pettigrew's reveal as a villain, a set up that actually paid off, seems like the only /really/ plot-revelant stuff going on.

I think anyone who has POA as their favourite book probably watched the anime first

**** While Book 3 is not my favorite in the series, I do think it plays a significant role because it kind of sets up the events for the rest of the series. I always thought Books 1 and 2 can be read as standalones (and if I recall correctly JK said that that was the intent in case the books were unsuccessful), but from Book 3 on, the whole series ties together.

I agree that there are some irrelevant plots to the overall story such as the Buckbeak arc or Lupin or even Trelawney (yeah she made the prophecies but otherwise she's as relevant to the plot as Bob Ogden, Mrs. Cole or Hepzibah Smith). However it gives some background to Harry's family, it introduces Sirius who plays a major part later on in showing Harry's acceptance of death and the first glimpse of why Harry's love overpowered Voldemort and the fact that Harry's greatest fear are Dementors is a good indirect characterization of his personality.

Edit: on the same note, you can argue that the lessons with Dumbledore were nothing but a plot device to give some background to Voldemort's past because the only relevant memories to the plot were Hockey's and Slughorn's in order to find out what the Horcruxes looked like and their number.
