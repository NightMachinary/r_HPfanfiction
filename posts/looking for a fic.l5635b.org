:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
hey guys. looking for a fic I read a few years ago. its a hp avengers crossover where harry goes to avengers universe. eventually ends up on shields radar and meets black widow. ends up in a relationship with her and she doesn't know that he knows she's a agent of shield until the last chapter that it was updated to back then. dont know if it was updated after or not. wasn't a harem fic, so dont give me those. I think it was about 5 chapters but over 60k words.


** The only story that I have read that even comes close to what you want is called Harry Potter: Deathly Avenger by stargatesg1fan1. It is a Harry/Natasha story in the Avengers universe. At the site I found it at It's 3 "books" 1st - 3 chapters 19K+ words, 2nd - 1 chapter 10K+ words, 3rd - 2 chapters 17K+ words.
