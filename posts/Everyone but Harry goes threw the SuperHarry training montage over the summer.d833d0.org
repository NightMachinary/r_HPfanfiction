** Honestly, if this was written as a proper parody of the Super!Harry genre, 10/10 would read.

**** Can you explain the relevance of this story to the parent comment? I don't see anything about space warping in the first two chapters.

***** Yeah rereading the idea of space warping this doesn't fit exactly but there is a time/space singularity event where both collapse into an event where the threads of space time are broken due to magical events and can be utilized more in the time aspect. This is more of a “living Hogwarts” and Hermione focus fic in all. Sorry I couldn't get spoiler tags working mobile or I'd go into more detail - but one of my favorites ever. The follow up “Bouquet of Asphodel” is really good too so far.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*
