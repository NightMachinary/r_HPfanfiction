I think it was Just a case of Accidental magical that stuck, like oneday a magical Child was attacked by a Snake and their Accidental magic manifested as the abilty to speak what would one say be know as Parseltongue.

As for why there are so Few Parselmouth's in the UK in Canon I think it is a case of "Use it or Lose it". There is Just so few Snakes in the UK that there was no need for the Ability so it faded away till only the Guants who used the Ability to communicate with each other daily life kept the abilty kept passing the abilty on to there children.


** We know Parseltongue is hereditary with the Slytherin line passing it on. Harry gains it from his encounter with Voldemort and the resulting Horcrux in his scar (also proof of some sort of hereditary power). The earliest Parseltongue we know is Herpo the Foul, who also created the first Basilisk.

The question of course is if he created the Basilisk because he was a Parselmouth, or that he became a Parselmouth due to creating the Basilisk. It might indeed be some sort of side effect, either from magical experiments or accidental magic or some sort of evolution or mutation. I suspect it's similar to for instance metamorphs (also hereditary).

*** About Metamorphmagi, I actually have a pretty neat theory of where the ability came from, if you care to hear it. Unless you'r reading /Parselmouth of Gryffindor/, because I will be revealing it later there, and so it would constitute spoilers you may not want to see now...

***** Well, in the early versions of Arthurian legends, Merlin was mostly known as a Seer, but his other main magical attribute was that he could take on any shape he liked, any man, any beast. And there's one legend where he takes on an especially horrid, monstrous shape to deliver a particularly scary prophecy, because he's awesome like that.

Separately, there's this notion (though when it dates back to is unclear; certainly there was no such concept in the very earliest records of Myrddin) that Merlin was sired by a shapeshifted demon, hence his sort-of-immortality and his great powers.

My theory is that Merlin was actually a half-human whose father was a /Boggart/ (which is definitely the sort of critter that Muggle legends would record as a "demon"), hence his ability to change his appearance at will. Metamorphmagi are all distant descendants either of Merlin, or (if the same thing ever happened before or since, which is perhaps somewhat doubtful) of other Half-Boggarts. Past the first generation, the gift was diluted somewhat (think Flitwick, who is still Goblin-sized but lacks any overt Goblin physical traits), but never went away completely; such that modern Metamorphmagi can innately turn into any people they like but have great difficulty with wholly nonhuman forms.

(Fun fact: no, the Blacks aren't descended from Merlin, don't you think they'd brag about it all the time if they were? Tonks got it from Ted, who is the great-great-etc.-great-grandson of Merlin's Squib daughter.)

******* Well, I was imagining one of those clever Boggarts who learn to take on a single form of their choice rather than constantly change based on who's looking at them. For example, Pottermore mentions a particular Boggart who haunted an alleyway as a fictitious human serial killer, for several years.

(Alternatively, if you want to be grimdark about it... what about a woman whose worst fear is being raped?)

** I believe that the Gift of Parseltongue is an artificial creation --- there are, no doubt, magical ways to implant knowledge of languages into people's minds, or Barty Crouch Sr. couldn't speak 200 languages; my theory has always been that after learning snake language the hard way, someone (possibly Herpo, possibly someone even further back) found a way not only to transfer this knowledge artificially, but for this transfer to become automatic to all of their descendants.

As for there being so few Parselmouths, I don't think it's a matter of the gift disappearing; there's just not that many descendants of Herpo the Foul around. I have little doubts that Salazar Slytherin (who, going by his first name, has continental roots) was the first Parselmouth to step foot in Britain. And considering the Wizarding World's small population size /combined/ with blood-purists' pickiness when it comes to who they can marry, there's nothing weird about there only being a handful of Slytherin descendants in the present day.

*** I am not a fan of being a Descendent of one of the Founders of Hogawrs as being some special thing, I like to think that Practically all Purebloods in the UK are Descendent of at least two Founders.

But that might be because of a story I read were Harry Finds out he Is the Decedent of Gryffindor and gets a Little Certificate and is told by The Golbins that he is not that special and the Decedent's of Gryffindor have a Club were they meet monthly or something like that. ( I forget how often or were they meet but I definitely remember a sarcastic Goblin Giving him the Certificate)

** My theory is magic is not inherent in b=human genes. Witches and wizards all are descendant from magical creatures (thing Fleur and Hagrid but several generations removed). This means that you can get abilities that pass down in bloodlines due to creature ancestry. For example, Hagrid's descendants (if he has any) have some natural immunity to minor spells, while Fleur's descendants are great at fire spells. Parselmouths have naga or lamia ancestors.

All this is an often used trope that I like.

** I think the weird magical gifts were bonded to a bloodline using magic that has since been outlawed and/or forgotten. I want to use this idea as a sticking point in the muggleborn/pureblood debates: purebloods are like we need to keep these gifts alive and adding muggleborns won't help (although this clearly isn't true: see Tonks); muggleborns are like, how are we supposed to start magical bloodline gifts when you've forbidden all of the relevant magic?

** Yeah that would make sense! I always figured like the way some ppl seemed to be born with a magical affinity or something (for an area of magic) magical gifts acted similarly. like very occasionally someone's magic is compatible with talking to snakes and it's more a random mutation/adaptation that keeps going down a bloodline.

I've seen a few fics feature a similar idea that there are so few recorded in UK history bc there aren't many snakes in the UK, and other countries with larger populations of snakes have far more parselmouths.

Maybe it was a common mutation in a country with plenty snakes, and its presence elsewhere is due to immigration from those countries across the world and their descendants.
