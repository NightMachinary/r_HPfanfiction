Its set in the future. Far enough in the future that Ron is dead, Harry was killed by Voldemort. And Hermione runs Beauxbatons. The Main Character has been born and raised in a concentration camp type of town, it is run by death eaters. The main character finds out she can do magic, and is summoned to a new school of magic (of which i forget the name). She is put into a house that trains spies, and is extremely adept at occlumens/legilemency. (sorry if spelling is terrible. im in a rush)
