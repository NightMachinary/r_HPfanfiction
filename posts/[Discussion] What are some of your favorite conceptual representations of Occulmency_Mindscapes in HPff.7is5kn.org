Title says it all, I'm writing my own fic and need some inspiration for how I should represent occlumency.


** I don't think I've come across a single fic that does Occlumency/Legilimency in a way I like. The thing with Occlumency is that people are wrong about what the end goal looks like. It's not a "kick everyone out of your mind" branch of magic. It's not a "construct a memory palace" dealio either. The end goal of Occlumency is to control what the Legilimens would see/read/whatever /without the Legilimens being aware that they are being manipulated or lied to./ Seriously, if Snape was kicking Voldemort out of his mind constantly, or trying to trick Voldemort with a mental construct, Voldemort was going to figure out that Snape was a spy.

Occlumency is about being utterly two-faced, showing one thing while hiding the truth. The ultimate form of lying.

So why were Snape's Occlumency Lessons focused on having Harry kick Snape out of Harry's mind? Because recognizing intrusion is the first step to true Occlumency. Kicking the intruder out is merely the first step to controlling what they see. Normally, I suspect, the budding Occlumens^{1} probably would only try to use their Occlumency with the Legilimens teaching them, because the point is /not having people know you know Occlumency/. But when the situation is *keep Voldemort from mind-whammying Harry*, focusing on just keeping Voldemort out is a hard enough goal.

^{1} I /really/ hate calling people who use Occlumency and Legilimency Occlumens and Legilimens, respectively. Partly because of Legilimens being the incantation for Legilimency, and because I frankly find them poor names. I personally prefer Occlumancer and Legilimancer and if I would ever write a fic, that's probably what I would go with.

*** "Occlumens" is canon though.

*Edit: Legilimens, too, now that I've checked. Snape says this to Bellatrix in HBP:

** I feel like opinions on Occlumency done through Mindscapes can be somewhat divisive. Personally I think that the larger part Occlumency plays in the plot, the more detailed it's representation should be.

Occlumency is just a minor tool? "Clear your mind, control your emotions." Is good enough.

Occlumency is a major plot point for one person? Mindscapes can be great, but keep it proportional. Don't describe the defenses built into the Mindscape if your are not going to show them being used. If the Mindscape is going to have benefits other than defense against Legillimancy, then go ahead and add them as long as they are used.

I personally enjoy Mindscape Occlumency where multiple characters Mindscapes are mentioned and described and they all are a little different and fit the personality of the character. Such as Hermione having a library or Harry having Hogwarts.

*** Ah, yes, mindscapes. I like how it was done in linkffn(11574569). Very cool, but maybe too useful and unrealistic, though I might be remembering wrong.

** Occlumency should really only take a few paragraphs at most, and definitely not use anything remotely close to a mindscape. Otherwise you're entering the zone of futility. No one wants to read that.

** I think that there is no wrong way to do Occlumency it all comes down to what the Occlumenes thinks works sort of an all roads lead to Rome sort of thing. Occlumency to is nothing more and nothing less than the mastery of your own mind.

** There is only one fic that featured an occlumency mindscape that I liked. The author needed a mindscape for a mental discussion between Harry Potter and Voldemort, so they made a mindscape. If they'd merely needed occlumency, they wouldn't have needed a mindscape.

You know what I'd generally prefer? An actual magical barrier that you place around your head. No mindscape, no visions, no building a copy of Hogwarts out of your own memories brick by brick. Maybe you learn to shove your magic into a sticky tarpit around yourself to trap Legilimens. Maybe you build it up like scale armor. Maybe you start off with a clumsy, overly heavy wrapping that exhausts you in seconds and you have to learn to thin it out to the point where you can sustain it. Maybe it's a series of blocks that rotate around you to intercept Legilimency attempts and the better you are the more blocks you have. Maybe it's a barrier that's more like a mesh at first and practice shrinks the holes down to the point where you can reliably block stuff. Maybe you take a lie and imbue it with your magic and put that in front of your brain. Getting better means having a larger stock of prepared lies and getting faster at preparing new lies.

Maybe Have Harry Turn up The"gravity" in his mind after all he would be about the right age to have seen the dragonball Z gravity chamber.

nothing like having a Legilimens get yamcha'd when they are suddenly trying to move threw the mental equivalent of 500X gravity.

** I liked the way Loten did it in Chasing the Sun. It's the only fic I've read where the whole Occlumency mindscape thing didn't come off as cheesy. Snape and Hermione both have these detailed, in-character mental protections, and it's intricate without being boring. linkffn(7413926)

Honestly it's tough to pull off. If it's not central to your plot, I'd keep the descriptions to a minimum.

** Author hathanhate did it well in his story Teeth, where Harry's occlumency doesn't immediately go well, but we see it build and continue to grow. Also it plays a major role in the story where it helps Harry with meditation and anger management. I like how it was portrayed in this story and I think you'll like it too.

** Linkffn(Core Threads) why? Two words...Vampire Ducks. To be honest though, while somewhat tropey, it does have some unique ideas behind it, and his mindscape eventually becomes more REAL, as in (if I remember correctly) it kind of becomes it's own dimension. It's confusing, but I enjoyed it.

Thanks,
