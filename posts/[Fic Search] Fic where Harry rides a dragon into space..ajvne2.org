** Wait, I remember this fic! Harry is in charge of hogwarts for the final battle (don't remember why, but its with dumbledores cooperation) and he's recruited all sorts of things for the battle. I think he's somehow in charge of the werewolves, alpha maybe? Anyway, he goes to ask the dragons for help and finds this ancient dragon that remembers when wizards (or maybe just one) rode dragons. That dragon takes harry up to the edge of space with harry casting air/bubblehead and warming charms to survive. I believe all the dragons use their fire at once to take out dementors in the battle.

At the end he writes this letter to everyone giving up his temporary authority. For the life of me I just can't remember the rest of the story enough to locate it.

Hopefully this triggers someone elses memory!

  Forced to compete and abandoned by his friends, he steps from the tent with only one goal in mind, suicide. Instead Harry awakens a power that spans time and space and starts a war between the worlds.
