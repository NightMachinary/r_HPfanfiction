It's 6th year, there's an accident in potion classes with a bad brewed Felix Felicis. It ends with the opposite effect happening, the drinker experiments his very worst luck in one day. Let's say Draco drinks it by accident (because let's be honest, trio or Voldemort or Snape drinking it would mean Voldemort wins and the story ends).


** My attempt.

As soon as Draco Malfoy stepped out of the Hospital Wing after an attack of debilitating stomach cramps, he was instantly accosted by the blood traitor, Saint Pottah and his pet mudblood.

"Well, well, well. If it isn't Saint Pottah hanging out with his band of filth again?" He sneers, and draws his wand, only to drop it. The mudblood then flicked out her wand and gave Draco a pig's snout. Weasel walked forwards, intent on punching Draco, and ended up stomping on Draco's 100 galleon, Acromantula silk robes, smearing mud all over the hem, before giving Draco a knuckle sandwich to the face. Somehow, there were no witnesses, and Pottah leads his misfits to Charms. Draco goes back into the Hospital Wing, only for the matron to be collecting herbs from the Herbology professor, so he stomps out, only to be late for Charms.

At charms, the half goblin was going over the colour changing charm. Then Draco was used as a test subject, while he still had his pig snout! His hair was changed an unflattering shade of purple, and all efforts to turn his hair back to the original shade just made it frizzy and turned his hair into an Afro.
