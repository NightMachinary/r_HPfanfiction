AKA magic is dying, Muggle's globalization is slowly erasing Magic "influence" and several influxes of muggleborn generation destroyed Magic Traditions and rituals simply by them not doing them or believing in it, accelerating the process. Tom Riddle's plan was madness because he is a sociopath / psychopath but at least he was trying.

In the same way "For the love of magic" if you manage to pass the author's opinions and Smutfest of the fiction, have an dramatic Idea where an immortal and immoral? Harry provokes a massive collapse of civilization to save the planet and magic in the same time.

So I am looking for stories with the same or similar concept where magic is at risk, I don't really care about the pairing or slash or the time period.

Thank!

Edit: I failed to copy paste the full name of the fic in my title post its "The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles".


** The only other fix that I've seen do something similar is “Your Name on my Heart.”
