Like, he's scary powerful, godly even, but he's either afraid of what he could do, or has done something to warrant him not wanting to fight, and so he becomes a healer.

In a way, he'd be like Dumbledore, but instead of becoming a teacher, he becomes a healer.

Anything like that?


** Linkffn(basilisk born) feels like a good fit. Give it through chapter 7 or so before you bail, it can take a bit to get there

  What if the Dementor attack in 5th year had ended with Harry losing? What if someone had stepped in to save him? And what if Harry ended up in the past with a chance to be more than he ever was before? A story about a forcibly time travelled Harry and its consequences... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

**** Can you spoil me a bit this fix? Is Harry too OP too soon? I am bored of stories where the MC is far too OP and breezes by all challenges.

About healing, how important is it to the story? Do we see Harry healing others in Hogwarts for example?

If parselmagic is used, for what purposes? Healing, combat, a bit of both, or another deus ex machine power for Harry?

***** Harry is powerful yes, but we see him earn this power.

Yes healing is important to harry, we see him heal multiple people and atleast one huffelpuff in hogwarts.

Parselmagic is not used as far as I can remember

** The one that comes to mind is linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16471847/chapters/38575427]])

Harry is a healer who ends up back in time with Teddy and starts working as a healer for Gringotts. It's not complete but was really interesting.

  Harry Potter didn't want to be a warrior after the war; if they wanted a savior he would only take the title as a healer. Things changed suddenly and rapidly, so he finds himself running from the wizarding world with Teddy. With the help of Death he manages to escape, but still finds himself facing challenges and conflict. And an opportunity at happiness...but only if he lets himself.
