Silence fell over the room - nobody understood what just happened. Not only was Malfoy too young to take part in the Triwizard Tournament, but on top of that he was the last person the majority of students would consider worthy or skilled enough to represent Hogwarts.

[aka. Barty Crouch Jr decided to do his own bidding during Harry's fourth year, and on top of putting Harry in the tournament, per Dark Lord instructions, get some revenge on Lucius for avoiding Azkaban and send his only son on a suicide mission.]


** Like the coward he is, he doesn't even show up to the first task. Lucius Malfoy is fined heavily for Draco's failure to comply with the tournament's contract.

The real tournament is between Crabbe and Goyle who compete to become Draco's most precious for the second task, in which Draco is going to participate because of his father's orders.

*** Why do I get the feeling that Pansy would then seek to publicly play tonsil hockey with Harry after the Second Task?

*** Seriously, this would be an excellent crack!fic crabbe and goyle competing to be Draco's precious in the 2nd task, being judged by their conniving friends (I'm seeing zabini, pansy and bulstrode there) one of them throwing a tantrum over loosing... and then McGonagall picks someone else.
