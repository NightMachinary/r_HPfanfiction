I keep finding AU fics like this, and they all keep ending as abandoned after a few chapters when I've just gotten excited. Help? I don't even care if it's abandoned. Does anyone know any that get past the initial chapters that jus build the setting?

â€‹

For example, the two that have left me hanging: One was where all four of them were triwizard champs (harry being the abnormal fourth drawn). Except it never got that far...:(... Another was where 30-something-year-old dumbledore did some ritual to summon powerful wizards like him. This took place shortly after his fallout with Grindelwald, and he was bummed about having noone interesting to relate to. Enter 30-something-year-old Riddle who had just been rejected by his Dumbledore for the DA position. Enter 30-something-year-old Harry, defeater of Voldemort and finally knows more about the situation than Dumbledore.


** I remember one where a MOD harry, Gellert and Riddle, all with their canonical memories attend Hogwarts as first years, with Albus as Headmaster. If I can find it again, I will post it.

Gellert played guitar for some reason.

  Tom Riddle was fully expecting to stay in hell forever. But the brat-who-lived and friend has, of course, come along with an offer too tempting to refuse. Albus Dumbledore was fully expecting Harry Potter's name down for the next year at Hogwarts. He just wasn't expecting two Dark-Lords to be enrolling as well. Time-travel -sort of- and FemHarry

  Young Albus Dumbledore, in desperate need of a proper friend, devises a spell to bring powerful wizards to him---only, he just might have been a tad overzealous. Result: the temporal displacement of Harry Potter and Tom Riddle to the year 1912.
