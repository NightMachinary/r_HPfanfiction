After reading too much about when Harry or some other significant character getting their wands, I wondered what everyone thought.

Would it be good to stick with that character's canon wand? Or would it have been much more interesting for them to get a different wand? Since there are AUs where a character was so different from their canon personality. Wouldn't their personality change so much that their canon wands would've rejected them because of lack of similarity?

For example: Would a level-headed, trust-no-one, Slytherin Harry still receive a Holly wood wand? Holly wands are for protecting and works most happily with people who may need help overcoming a tendency for anger. While 'protecting' is good for the 'trust-no-one' part, wouldn't this Holly wand be a bit turned off when it encounters a level-headed Harry?

What do you guys think? Don't stick to canon wand? Hate the idea of change? Don't really care? Give me your thoughts.


** Am I the only one who LIKES the extra stuff on Pottermore? I think it's really cool!

When it comes to wandlore, I find it an interesting characterization quirk, and adhering to it a sign that the author has bothered to think a bit more about different wands other than "this wand is so Super Special Awesome POWERFUL, you getting it means you're clearly a Super Special Awesome POWERFUL wizard!"

*** This is additionally amazing because it explains a lot. People will say Ron isn't very good at magic, but he nonverbally cast a slug-vomiting jinx in his second year. Come to find out on Pottermore, the wand that chose him the next year was a willow wand, which is said to enable advanced, nonverbal magic. You can say whatever you like about her writing skills, but JK Rowling is one of the greatest world/lore builders I've ever come across.

Not complaining because the lack of information spurred fanfic which is one of my biggest hobbies but I have to call that statement out.

Her being great at fleshing out a world is a stretch, she has had many years with no pressure of any kind to do so. The books themselves contain impressively few details on the wizarding world.

***** True enough. There's also areas that she falls short, like economics, as seen from the unstable Wizarding economy, that really take away from the world she's built. But I see pottermore as a treasure that explains a lot of things she never elaborated on within the books, especially coming from Harry's perspective.

** My fic features Hermione as Salazar Slytherin reincarnated, and I included the Ollivander spiel for her canon wand because it suited her new personality ridiculously well.

I don't think it matters, but I think canon wands are a great way of highlighting the similarities between the AU personality and the original personality. In the case of the level-headed trust-no-one Slytherin Harry, maybe he doesn't get close to people easily, but at his core he'll still defend the few people he really care about with his life? Maybe his calm demeanor takes a lot of effort and self-control to maintain, and inside he's actually raging at the injustice/threat to him and his?

Besides, you can always spin the wand description so that it still works out (i.e. emphasize traits that fit, leave out details that don't. Not very scientific but this is fiction after all...)

*** On a random note, holly wands are supposed to be suited for people whose lives are most defined by some kind of spiritual quest, people who are fairly close to capital-D Destiny. That's a rather heavy thing to get through, and while I can understand when a writer takes a look at it and decides that for some reason some other wood suits him better, most of the time it seems that the decision to change is directed not by Harry being changed but by his usual wand being seen as not hax enough and not dark enough by the writer in question.

It's kind of sad, really.

**** I agree. I am writing a story where Harry looses the Horcrux in his scar earlier (fourth year) and then the holly wand is not working properly anymore. Therefore he needs a new wand; one that will NOT be some overpowered bundle of ten substances (might go with a different maker though).

****** Harry watched as a grin spread across Mr Poole's face. "I have a Holly and Phoenix feather wand."

It was a plain utilitarian wand, without an apparent direction to hold. Significantly, insignificant, in the plainness of a wood traditionally used for decoration. A tool without the need of additional refinement, or perhaps awaiting the decoration to come. Future adornment to be added. Perhaps by the ravages of time, use and adventure. Space for each scratch, scuff and mark to tell the story of the wand and its wielder.

And the core, a feather from a juvenile phoenix. The feather itself already frayed. Worn around the edges from the journey it had already traveled. "It was given to me by a friend." Mr Poole explained. "Traded for the repair on an antique chair he wished to use. He inherited from his grandfather, who had been given it in part of a trade for ships clock of the coast of Africa. His grandfather claimed that the ship had been given the feather in lieu of the gold and gems typically used in the spice trade. Old already then."

Harry examined the wand in his hand. He felt a warmth. Not the coil of energy he had once felt with his Ollivander made wand.

Mr Poole continued."Yes, I liked the juxtaposition. A blemished feather from a young phoenix, and an unblemished frame from an old wood."

Harry felt Mr Poole's hand touch his shoulder and tuned to face him.

With stern eyes Mr Poole gave some advice. "Harry, a wand it a tool. Sometimes a tool breaks, or becomes different. We may simply grow taller and need a more appropriate item. People grow and adapt and our wands requirements may change. I can use a blunted saw, the job will still be done, but a sharp saw is a wonder to work with and makes my craft easier."

Harry smiled.

"Now give the yonder target a spell, see how it feels. Ollivander gets to be all mystic with the firsties, but I build the reinforced wands for the Aurors."

** I think there can be good reason to change a character's wand, but it needs to be well-explored, and wands need to fundamentally 'behave' in a certain way.

For instance, in /Circular Reasoning/, Harry is a mildly-deranged, extremely violent and irrational person, and it seems that through embracing his darker nature to the point that he enjoys killing and the Dark Arts (or at least did for a time), the Holly wand stops working for him almost entirely. I really enjoyed the way Swimdraconian examined the way that wands /feel/ to the characters, and in a way gives the wands personality.

If a wand is just treated as a focus, a means to project magic, that doesn't have any deeper characteristics, then there's bugger all reason to change it.

However, to counter that point, sometimes the stakes in a story can be raised by the main character's wand being snapped or otherwise destroyed, and examining how they then have to learn and adapt to a new wand, or a stolen one, or without one at all (like escaping capture whilst unarmed, for example).

If you feel that wands have deeper personalities /a la Pottermore/, then by all means, you can have a wand reflect its owner's personality, and through those means deviate from the canon allocations.

If you really need Harry to have an unusual wand core, how hard is it to have him buy his wand elsewhere?

** Different wands are fine as long as there's a reason which is explained and the resulting wand still follows the standard pattern of one core and one wood. Exotic woods are fine but ridiculous cores (manticore hair coated in basilisk venom and Phoenix ashes) just seem like a cheap powerwank.

**** Nothing in itself. However, when at least some of the stuff has a “hmm, I see you have theories, I will now write it so that they are all incorrect just because I can” feel to it and at the same time Madame Rowling wasn't above declaring Cursed Child to be canon when it went against some of the information the was on Pottermore at the time of its release, not to mention the general feel that Cursed Child causes ... well, that's that.

You can probably see why some people feel a distaste at that kind of approach, and consequently at Pottermore itself and anything placed there.

** It just doesn't matter if it isn't some core part of your story. Its just not important. The only importance of wands would come if you delve deeper into the lore and make it important for your story.

As everything in HP, its all about the symbolism. Holly and Phoenix and Yew and Phoenix. Holly is a tree and wood used for protection, while Yew often symbolises immortality or death. Both character who wield famous phoenix feather wands are ressurected - defeat death in one way or another.

Frankly, wand lore makes for a great bit of unexplored worldbuilding, but its just not important for any story that doesn't deal with its implications.
