Think it's HP 6th year. It was a long time ago, but all I can remember is that there end of the year mission took them to Egypt and had to go into a pyramid. I think that there was mummies involved. After they found what they where looking for they return to HW and Voldemort was in the Hall. Then it was reveals that Dumbledore was actually Voldemort s master all along. If someone knows this fic please can you give me the link... thanks so much
