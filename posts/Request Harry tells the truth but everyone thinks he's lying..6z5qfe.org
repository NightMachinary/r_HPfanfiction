Looking for a story I read a while ago, can't think of the name. Harry was cursed into telling the truth, but everyone who hears him thinks he's lying. Draco Malfoy helps him out.


** We all read that story before. It's called Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secret. Honorable mention to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire as well as Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.

*** Basically almost every books in canon. In philosopher's stone, McGonagall didn't believe him. In HBP, none believe him about Malfoy.

*** Yes that's it! Thank you. Read it a good while ago, never saved it. Thank you. I think I just started on the sequel when I didn't save it.
