A lot of fics on MoD!Harry shows Harry going dark or insane when he realises he's the Master of Death and he can't die.

But I want a fic on MoD!Harry who just lives on forever, gradually assuming a mass of identities while he waits for his friends to be reincarnated. He sees the soul of Colin Creevey in a dyslexic boy, so he becomes the old librarian across the street and tutors Colin until he graduates. He sees Cedric Diggory in a rising football star, so he does whatever he can to get him a place on his favourite team.

He sees the souls of everyone he couldn't save, and tries his hardest to make their next life as comfortable as possible.

** It is a truth very rarely acknowledged that there is more than one kind of "unfinished business." Certainly, ghosts are evidence that you aren't quite done with this life - but what of the others? What about those who weren't afraid to move on, but still had so much more to give before they really /could/? That's where Harry came in. Souls stuck in a never-ending cycle of death and rebirth couldn't move on until they "got it right" . It is the job of the Master of Death to gently prompt and arrange things so that a soul may finally meet Death as an old friend, this time.

Harry, immortal and never changing, got used to seeing old friends in new faces. The first time it happened, he could have died of a heart attack! He saw the angry, bitter expression of Severus Snape on the face a small South Asian girl that was staring at the Sorting Hat as though she would dearly love to set it on fire. The expression deepened as she was sorted into Gryffindor.

As Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Harry was ideally situated to interfere in this particular case. (Although he had to laugh, after all of those cursed years, Hogwarts finally had a teacher it couldn't get rid of. Assigning group work with a mixture of cheerful souls and hard-working "parent friend" types had given young Sevitri a group of friends for life very early on in First Year. In Fifth Year, Harry had taken her aside to discuss careers and gently suggested that she consider the Department of Mysteries and not teaching. Her talent for research and innovation had carried on into her present life and, frankly, Harry wanted those old bastards to be shaken up a bit.

Many years later, Harry reaped her soul from her deathbed and watched as Sevitri/Severus' eyes widened in recognition.

"Potter... No, Professor Potter."

"Severus. Or Sevitri, as you like."

"What... Oh. I'm dead again. Aren't I?"

"Well-observed. I have a question for you: Do you have any regrets?"

"I have achieved all I wished to, professionally. It's only polite to leave some mysteries for the next generation to explore." They waved their hand imperiously.

"And personally?" Harry persisted.

Sevitri/Severus looked over at the sobbing figure of their green-eyed wife:

"How could I?" They said softly. "I had her."

As Harry escorted them to meet Death, he privately vowed to never, ever reveal that Sevitri's wife contained the spark of life that once animated Petunia Dursley.

*** PART TWO

Some assignments were easier than others. Who would have thought that Draco Malfoy would be happier running his own bistro in Montpellier and making his own way in the world? Harry was very sorry when he eventually died and moved on; his treacle tart was heaven on a plate. Sirius had been happy just to live long enough to grow old, even if he always had a love of open skies that he couldn't quite explain.

Hagrid had been simultaneously incredibly easy and difficult. Seeing him at all had thrown Harry for a loop. He'd always assumed that Hagrid had been very happy in himself - he seemed content with how his life had turned out. But then it occured to Harry: How many adults relied on eleven year-olds for company? Did Hagrid even have friends outside of the student body? The teachers and the other members of the Order seemed to treat him like some kind of simpleton, and the less said about his brief on/off dalliance with Olympe Maxime the better. On top of all this, no-one had apologised when it was revealed that Hagrid should never have been expelled. No-one gave him a new wand and offered to teach him. Harry felt like a horrible friend.

Somehow it hadn't surprised Harry that the new Hagrid was almost exactly like the old one: "Big-boned", fiercely loyal and Gryffindor. What did surprise him was how hard it was to constantly prevent him from getting expelled. If he wasn't sneaking into the Forest, he was trying to sneak the Forest into Hogwarts. An acromantula, again? Really, Hagrid! A brief word in Hagrid's Fifth Year to Professor Weasley (a grandson of Percy's) and Hogwarts suddenly had it's first ever student TA. He was only allowed to assist with younger years, but it seemed to teach him restraint and lesson-planning in a way that he'd never quite managed as a teacher.

Harry had been called to the Dragon Sanctuary on Skye in time to witness Hagrid breathe his last. He was a literal bloody mess, but he had a smile on his face.

"'Arry! What are you doin' here?! They're gonna do summat horrid to Daisy!"

"Hello old friend. Is Daisy the dragon that just eviscerated you, by any chance?" Harry was bemused.

"She were only playin'..." Hagrid grumbled. "She don't know her own strength. Don't deserve to be killed for that..."

"Hagrid. This is a dragon reserve. They know that better than anyone!"

"Fair enough. Anyway, how are you?"

They chatted amiably as Harry guided his first friend into the light.

If Harry had thought that Rubeus Hagrid was a challenge, it was only because he hadn't known Cedric Diggory was yet to come.

**** FINAL PART

"Really?! Bloody really?! What was wrong /this/ time?" Harry felt a vein throbbing in his temple.

A spectral Cedric looked at him sheepishly over his latest body.

"Sorry Harry, it was nice and all... But I guess it turns out the Quidditch life wasn't for me. Sorry." He shrugged.

In his latest life, Cedric had been Ganymede Harper - star Seeker of the Irish team and the Wellington Boots. He was talented, handsome, roguish and dedicated his spare time to saving the non-magical Kiwi bird. He had a wide circle of friends and family, and the occasional meaningful relationship; he was on good terms with /all/ of his exes, for heaven's sake! He was perfection! Until he took a Bludger to the head and his neck snapped.

"Help me out here, Ced. /What is for you?/" Harry rubbed at his scar aggressively for the first time in decades. "You've been an Auror, a Charms teacher, a Quidditch player and even /Minister for Bleeding Magic/ once!"

"I'm honestly not sure, Harry. It's been all been enjoyable, but honestly this time was a bit... Grand. Honestly, I don't know how you can stand it. Stood it. You're not still famous, are you?" Cedric asked.

"Eh. Kinda? I think I'm just a fact of life right now. "The sky is blue, you can't conjure food from nothing and Harry Potter is still alive." That kind of thing. God bless wizards and their total acceptance of the bizarre with only a few questions." Harry smiled indulgently in a way that immediately reminded himself of the way Mr Weasley regarded muggles. "The Department of Mysteries occasionally tries to capture me in a summoning circle, but they haven't done that in a looong time." Not since he'd sent them a reincarnation of Seamus Finnegan to wreak incendiary chaos. (How was Harry meant to know that Heliopaths were real)?

"Wow. That seems rude." Cedric frowned.

"You get used to it. Now onto you. Hmm... "Too grand" eh? Let's try something new." With a wave of a hand, Harry banished Cedric into the void to be re-born, focusing desperately on the word "humble."

Of course that was the mistake Harry had kept making. He'd forgotten that Cedric was a Hufflepuff, through and through. He'd spent so long focusing on what Cedric could have been, he had forgotten who he was. A kind, fair person who thought that there ought to have been a re-match in his third year, and had shown him nothing but decency in his fourth - even when no-one else had. No. Glory was never his aim.

Harry sighed. He really, really missed Dobby. He wanted a cup of tea and simple non-existential conversation. Sadly, Dobby had died happy the first time and moved on.

He kept a metaphorical ear out for Cedric, and carried on with life as per usual. Lavender Brown surfaced as a Centaur and was living her best life without his help. He marked essays between comforting students who experienced death for the first time. That was always heartbreaking, but at least most of them appreciated his explanation - even if they hated that he refused to tell them what lay beyond. He even managed to convince Professor Binns that it was time to move on while he waited. (It turns out that he really just needed to deliver a lecture on the treaties that concluded the last great Goblin War. With the unit finally done, he felt he could move on).

One day, he got a "ping" on his spiritual radar and found himself in a maternity ward in London. Two muggles cooed over a healthy baby boy that had Cedric's hazel eyes. There wasn't a single spark of magic about the child. Huh. Now wasn't that intriguing?

--------------

Teon Stone had a good life. His parents loved him to bits, he had Aunties and Uncles for streets around - he was even related to a few of them - and friends to play football with. He loved a kickabout in people's back gardens, and he liked the huge matches that they played with a tennis ball across the tarmac at school. As long as he had a friend and a ball, he was happy as Larry. He didn't even mind it when he was inevitably called in for tea.

Harry surreptitiously slipped a leaflet for a summer school at West Ham United's grounds through the letterbox. Teon's Mum hadn't needed much persuading; Harry had enchanted the word "free" to stand out to her. So off he went to the summer school, which lead to him eventually joining the junior side and making a lot more friends along the way.

Harry watched as Teon grew to love football, but loved teaching the younger kids more. He turned down a place on the Under 17 side to focus on his exams. He didn't want any more pressure in his life. Somehow, wherever he went he saw and heard ads telling extolling the virtues of teaching - as if by magic!

By the time he died, Teon had lived an excellent life. He had become a Primary School teacher and coached football in a park next where he grew up every Saturday. He had become a "pillar of the community" in his own way. He'd married and had three children who he loved with all his heart - not necessarily in that order. Harry knew that Teon Stone would be mourned even more than Cedric Diggory had been. The years to come would be filled with wistful talk of "Mr Stone" - tales of full of comforted children and encouraged potential, of smiling at people he met on the street and of the best goat curry since their Nan's. He would be missed.

"How's it going?" Harry eyed Cedric smugly as he lead him away from the mourning Stone family.

"You know what? That was just right." His smile was calm and gentle.

"No regrets?"

"Not this time."

"I am so glad." They walked towards the light in silence.

Suddenly Cedric stopped.

"Harry... Do you... Are you alone?"

"Huh?" The question short-circuited Harry's brain briefly. " I mean... I do all of /this/ alone and I have friendships, I mean they all die sooner or later..." He trailed off. "It's okay. I'm fine."

"It is /not/ okay!" Cedric frowned. "You do all of this for everyone else and look after everyone else, who looks after you?"

"I do, Cedric. Always have, always will." It's not like the Dursleys had coddled him.

Cedric threw his hands up in the air. "That's it. I'm officially unsatisfied! I'm not leaving a being of near infinite power to go gaga on his own, just because he doesn't know how to share a burden!"

A retort died on Harry's lips. An image of Dumbledore, alone in his machinations and gradually losing sight of the humanity of his chess pieces as he confides only what he has to to who he has to. It was sharing the burden that got them through the Second Wizarding War, after all.

"I don't know if anyone can." He confides quietly. "Me becoming Master of Death was a very unique set of circumstances." He felt a hand on his shoulder.

"Well, it's a good thing that I don't want your job. I just want to help." Cedric spoke softly and smiled moreso.

"Is this where we kiss? Buy me dinner first and then we'll talk about eternity together." Harry quipped.

Cedric rolled his eyes:

"You wish, Potter. C'mon, we have Death to convince."

Harry chuckled and they walked side by side into the light. Wait until he saw that Luna Lovegood had taken upon the mantle of Death herself...

****** Hi! I know this comment is like a month old, but I stumbled on this post today and the premise reminded me greatly of a novel called Reincarnation Blues. The main character is more like this story's Cedric than Harry, but if you liked the general premise- reincarnating over and over again until having lived the 'right' life, including mildly exasperated Death- definitely give it a shot.

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war.

** My favorit mod! Harry is actually a crossover with sherlock holmes. Im not sure if it counts though... This is still his first life 🙈 (or is it his only life? Might be immortal in this one 🤔 can't remember)

** Warning: HP/LV, but it's on way more equal footing and interesting circumstances than most fics of its type. The plot is pretty unique, I recommend giving it a try.

*** I read that one too! I'm kind of a sucker for Mod!Harry. Try reading Full circle By tesurashian it has a fairly similar plot to His Twenty-Eighth Life (reincarnation and all that jazz)

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
