** Yeah, I wonder about this. Kids are Transfiguring things into living creatures, and they're definitely not learning the anatomy of all the things they're creating. So I imagine you wouldn't have to know how a nuke works to make it. Which also brings up the question of antimatter, which could be more destructive than even a thousand nukes.

*** My approach is generally just to say that the Muggle chemical theory of elements is incorrect and that wizards have an entirely different theory of matter which takes magic into account.

Combine this with the idea that you have to understand the magical theory behind a spell for that spell to work and you have a solution: if you tried to use Muggle understanding of matter to support a transfiguration it wouldn't work, because you're essentially trying to cast magic supported by an incorrect concept of matter.

**** My headcanon says that muggles are missing one of the Fundamental Particles, and that it's the bridge between Relativity and String theory, and the missing piece to the Theory of Everything. The muggles know about 16, but the 17th is the M√°na, or magic if you will. M√°na is the fundamental particle (or wave) thats reactions form magic, and it exists in the fourth dimension of space, which explains why muggles haven't noticed it yet.

Also, portkeys and aparation take the user through the fourth spacial dimension, which just so happens to cover shorter distances to the same places than the three standard ones take. It explains expanded space, if you've got a fourth dimension to work with, and the m√°na reacts with EM, which is why electricity messes with magic.

Also, 17 is a Prime Number, which fanon says makes it magical. It's not as nice as 19 though, which is 9+7+3, four 3s for stability and one 7 for power, three 3s can become a 9 leaving behind three total parts. But 9+7+1 is fine too, or a 9 for power (stablized as three 3s) and four 2s as a base, two 4s or one 8. I like the former more, but what can you doü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Unless there's more yet to be discovered than just magic.. or maybe dark light and grey magic each have a particle. Idk. That's too rabbit-hole-y

** linkffn(The Arithmancer) has a side plot of Hermione essentially doing magical nuclear physics research to prove that it's impossible (what wizards have already suspected) but later on in the sequel she's not that sure any more, and there's an ongoing plot of convincing the ICW to do something to prevent wizards from making nukes.

There's also the problem of magical grey goo nanobots and antimatter but to do antimatter research they have to sneak into CERN so it's not progressing very quickly.

** Hell, you can transfigure a magnetic bottle containing antimatter, and set the bottle to transfigure first... much more efficient (as the mass needed to transfigure is much smaller), and easier too - the mechanism of a nuke is really complicated, and you'd need to get everything right, compared to a magnetic containment system set to fail via magic.

Fics I know of that at least reference this:

HPMOR and (some) derivative fics The Arithmancer and Lady Archimedes, but there is an ongoing plot point of trying to prove that this is impossible (in that AU)

**** Sure! Warning: physics nerd.

So quarks, you may know, are what make up neutrons and protons. Both have 3 quarks - a proton is 2 up 1 down, and a neutron is 2 down 1 up. An up quark has an electric charge of 2/3s (where 1 is the charge of a proton or electron), and a down quark is -1/3 - from here you can see why a proton is +1 and a neutron is 0.

Now, quarks have /extremely/ little mass. Most of the mass of a proton isn't in the 3 quarks - it's in the energy binding them together (via e=mc^{2).} So an unbound set of 3 quarks has even less mass than a proton, but if they're all up quarks it has double the charge of one.

Let's assume that this particular transfiguration keeps total mass stable - this gets even weirder if its volume that is somehow stable - and see how much charge we get. Let's say we transfigure a one kilogram weight into pure, unbound upquarks. Some googling and wolfram-alphaing gives us 2.244*10^{29} upquarks in a kilogram.

This means our little kilogram has a net charge of ~2.4 * 10^{10} coulombs. Using coulombs law, we can calculate the force this much charge would exert on another charge - for fun, lets look at a single electron on the moon.

We pull this electron with 2.476√ó10^{-16} newtons of force, which doesn't sound like a lot until you remember how small an electron is. This accelerates the electron at... 2.718√ó10^{14} m/s^{2.} The electron (and all other electrons in the moon) hits relativistic speed in a few nanoseconds, obliterating the moon on a chemical and physical level. Of course, it's much worse for the earth itself.

And of course, transfiguration doesn't keep mass constant, if anything it seems to create specific imagined volumes. What the hell does, say, a cubic centimeter of pure up quark do? I have no idea how you'd even define it, but it would be very bad.

**** Well, perhaps the difference is that a nuclear weapon is manmade chemistry. You'd need elements - assuming that magic cannot simply create complex chemicals. If so, why does potions exist? If they could simply magic them into existence?

Why not transfigure complex potions instead of brewing them?

Also, if you consider that the breakdown of a nuclear weapon are isotopes of chemicals(mainly plutonium and uranium).

I guess the question here would be HOW does transfiguration work? Does it pull from the surroundings to create whatever it is you are transfiguring? If it is complex does it require MORE power or complexity or both? As far as I know, most spells of any kind, hexes, charms, transfiguration, etc all have incantations - which means there was some research of some kind to find not only the most aligned wand movements but also incantation to assist the magic create that which the castor intended.

That would also imply, that SOMEBODY probably had to know how a nuclear bomb functions to be able to produce the most sound incantation and wand movements. Because god knows messing up something like that could be disastrous. It's not like it matters if your match to needle is quite right, it won't kill you.

It DOES matter if you don't get every little thing correct when transfiguring something as volatile as nuclear weapons. I feel like nobody would really be willing to research this as, mostly likely, they'd die before getting it right.
