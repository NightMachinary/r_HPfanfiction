Edit: Please forgive the shame of saying "fic" instead of post in the title.

Published, unpublished, finished or still in the early stages, doesn't matter. Let's get narsissistic up in here. Context not required. I'll start.

#+begin_quote
  "I can't stop thinking about them! About everyone! Ev-every day I thi-think about how I fai-failed them all once! I'm tr-trying but I can-can't stop hating myself! I can't stop the guilt!"

  "You mustn't forget the memories, my boy. As painful as they are, as toxic as the regret is, without it, we will stray. We will turn from our goals. No, you mustn't forget, but you must honor. Remember the dead and remember their impact in your life. Remember the good. You were given a chance no one believes possible, a chance to do it all right. Honor the dead, both now and in the future that will never happen."

** It's between two, both from Chapter 3 of The One He Feared.

One

#+begin_quote
  "Already on it," said Mad-Eye, and he pulled a roll of parchment from his robes. He shoved it at Harry, who unrolled it to find a complex list of passcodes and secret challenges. "From now on, you're going to confirm your identity every time you meet an Order member, you understand?" Harry nodded and Moody took the chair opposite. "There's a snowball's chance in hell I'm leaving that parchment lying around, so we're going to practice them now till you can remember them all."

  It was an annoyance, but not unreasonable.

  "All right Potter, let's try this out," said Moody, taking another bite of his toast. "It's the night before the full moon. I say: 'Did you see the Puddlemere game last night?' What's your reply?"

  Harry scanned the parchment before peering at Moody over the top of his glasses. The grizzled Auror showed no sign of amusement. "No," Harry read from the paper, suppressing a smile, "I was polishing my wand all night."

  Ron sniggered.

  "Good," continued Mad-Eye, still completely straight faced. "Another. The second Sunday of the month. I say: 'How about Fleur, eh?' Your reply?"

  Once more Harry found the answer. His eyes met Moody's. He might have imagined it, but he was sure the man's lips twitched. Harry sighed, before reading the reply. "I prefer wizards, myself."

  As Ron burst out laughing, Harry couldn't help but feel it was going to be a long morning.

#+begin_quote
  "So Harry," Hermione interrupted, speaking loudly. "What were you doing all alone with Ginny?"

  Though about as subtle as a niffler in a Gringotts' vault, Hermione's attempt to steer the conversation was a huge success: both Tonks and Remus stopped mid-sentence and swiveled to face Harry, the glint of curiosity in their eyes.

  "Yes, Harry," said Fred, who had apparently been listening. "What exactly were you doing with our sister?"

  "Not besmirching her virtue, I hope," said George, coming to rest his hands on the back of Harry's chair. Harry's cheeks tinged pink and he glared daggers at Hermione, who at least had the grace to look vaguely apologetic.

  Tonks cackled. Apparently it ran in the Black family. "Getting a special birthday present, Harry?" she asked, grinning widely.

  "Now, now," said Remus, his own mirth barely hidden. "I'm sure they were just talking."

  "About what?" said Hermione, "the colour of Ginny's underwear?"

  "All right," said Harry, trying to calm them, "I think that's-"

  "Ginny!" cried Fred, just as she emerged from the stairs. He waved a doughy spoon in the air like a wand. "What've you been doing to poor Harry?"

  George laid a protective hand on Harry's shoulder. "Not been besmirching his virtue, have you?"

  Remus snorted; Harry had to resist the urge to obliviate everyone, instead giving Ginny a look that he hoped said "help me!"

  Ginny smirked. "Only a little," she said, sending Tonks off laughing again. "And he wasn't complaining much." Harry began to feel ganged up on.

  "Only a little?" said George, looking shocked. "Don't tell me you left him hanging?"

  "How many times have we told you?" added Fred, who was clearly enjoying himself. "Once you Wingardium-"

  "-you better leviosa," completed George.

#+begin_quote
  Tonks yelled in frustration, throwing up her hands. "I'm going to report in. Because /some/ of us actually work."

  Tonks stormed out, stomping loudly until her footsteps were cut by the sound of apparition. Sirius snorted into his drink.

  "No clever retort this time?" Harry asked, fighting a smile of his own. It wouldn't be fair to Tonks.

  "I'm rich," said Sirius with an air of superiority. "Work is beneath me."

  "Weren't you an Auror or something?"

  "Foolishness of youth," Sirius replied. "I've learned from my mistakes."

  "You have an answer for everything, don't you?"

  Sirius made a nasal sound. "I'm /incredibly/ witty."

** It's not particularly good, but I wrote this at my happiest during a rather dark period:

#+begin_quote
  'But it doesn't make any sense, Moony!' James cried. 'You must have some sort of crazy theory, at least. You always do.'

  Remus ran a quivering hand through his hair. 'Merlin... ' he murmured, looking up at James through weary but desperate eyes.

  'Okay - so you remember how Boggarts can also assume a form by eating body parts?' asked Remus.

  James nodded.

  'Right,' he continued, 'well you can find those shape-shifting properties in their entrails too. So what I'm thinking is that Sirius ate the entrails, and ate so many of them that he was scared the result would- '

  ' "Feel like labour",' James mouthed. Lily's hearing was unreal. 'But surely he'd need to be pregnant with someone else's, you know... '

  'For something like a Boggart,' Remus rasped, 'anything would do. Dead skin, hair- '

  'Which Sirius has a fuckload of.'

  Remus gulped. 'Exactly. Right in the spaghetti and down the hatch.'

  'Prongs?' whimpered Sirius. 'I'm scared, mate... '

  'It's- ' started James, his voice faltering as he also knelt beside the sobbing wizard. 'It's gonna be all right, mate! W- we'll get you to Mungo's... it's... '

  The sound of giant exploding raspberries broke the ensuing silence. Peter giggled in the distance.

  'I think my water just broke,' grunted Sirius.

  Ron winced. "I think the pressure's getting to me."

  Harry and Ron nodded in tandem while staring at the dead House-elf on the floor.

  Harry sighed and clapped Ron on the shoulder one more time. "But if he hadn't have died, I would have thought it was funny, too."

** Had to think about this for a while, but think it's these two quotes from my story Out of the Dark and Into the Green:

Chapter 2

#+begin_quote
  Sometimes they prepared the meat over open fire and sat outside till late in the night. Harry liked those times. In the glow of the campfire, Al opened up. He told Harry amazing stories about speaking rabbits, hopping pots, and goblin rebellions, about a magical castle called Hogwarts where ghosts roamed the halls and suits of armour came to life.

  After evenings like that, Harry had to forcibly remind himself that none of it was real. It was all to easy to lose sight of reality when living in the woods with a man like Al, far away from civilisation. Harry would love nothing more than to believe in Al's stories of dragons and wizards, but he had learned early on, lying in his dark cupboard, wishing for a knight in shining armour to save him, that life just didn't work like that.
#+end_quote

Chapter 7

#+begin_quote
  Barty hated muggle transportation. It was so... undignified. Herded like cattle. He could smell his neighbour, a fat man who was sweating like he'd just won a Quidditch match.

  The woman opposite him was once again blowing her nose.

  Merlin.

  He just wanted to grab his wand and hex the stupid thing off.

  But he couldn't. No, no, no. He had to behave unassumingly. Couldn't have anyone becoming suspicious.

  The fat man took a bite of some sort of sandwich (muggle sandwich, surely disgusting) and chewed open mouthed, behaving like the animal he was.

  If his Lord could see him now, see what his most devoted, most faithful follower was enduring for him... oooh... he would shower him in praise, reward him for his endurance.

  Muggles. Simply disgusting. He would love to blow up the train, a little brain matter here, a few intestines there... that was art, that was all they were good for.

  He sniggered, and the disgusting, coughing, wheezing woman shot him a disturbed glance.

  Oh if she knew, if only she knew...

  "Drom!" Sirius says again as he comes towards them, and he hugs her tightly before he looks to Ted. "And you must be the husband who saved her from that family of hers!"

  "My knight in argyle socks," Drom agrees fondly, and Sirius shakes Ted's hand, patting his shoulder.

** Well, for one liners there is only one text I can refer to. Choosing the best one is a littler harder.

#+begin_quote
  John Solart had seen his death approaching quite a few times. Most of the times it had been old age or a well-placed curse from some pissed wand-waver. A couple of times he'd finished himself off just to get it over with. Then there was that memorable time when a man dressed up as Bugs Bunny had sliced his neck. He'd never seen it coming and to this day had no idea why it had happened.
#+end_quote

Another from the same chapter:

#+begin_quote
  Sooner or later they'd wear him down. John pondered briefly if publicly comparing the current Dark Lord -hopeful to a troll ballerina with a homoerotic passion for dresses had been a bad idea in the end.

  ... "Oh, lovely, the ballerina is here! I've been waiting!" John yelled, sending a blindingly powerful spell at the new arrival. The spell sapped nearly all of his remaining power but was well worth it. The Dark Lord was wholly incapable of casting a shield strong enough to hold the spell. As the spell hit his midsection the Dark Lord's eyes went wide from fear of being blasted to orbit and then even wider from surprise when his outfit transfigured to a pink tutu, complete with matching ballet shoes.

** /“Sometimes, sacrifices have to be made.”/

For those who want context:

Original story, a natural-born mage gets his power sealed and then is given a replacement by someone who does not want the guy powerless. He awakens the new magic he has in a fight against someone who is trying to push him to his limits to see if what he has is a specific kind of magic that's ... well, bad. It actually is that very thing, and it reacts very badly with the magic he already has (think matter--antimatter but for magic), leaving him basically a tickling time bomb that's producing smaller explosions occasionally and at one point will make a bigger one and devastate everything around it.

He abandons his companions in a fairly cowardly way, and tries to get through the frontier that's a distance away to a place where there are only enemies so that his death would at least mean something, as the only people who might have the potential to save him he no longer trusts. One of his companions catches up to him and tries to convince him to go back, and those are the words he says to said companion once he runs out of real arguments.

  "I'm sorry I kissed you," he frowned, "No I'm not. But I am. Because we WERE really drunk. And I wanted to kiss you for ages. Years. And I didn't want to be drunk when I did." He refused to look at her, instead confessing this to her kettle.

** It's from a novel I'm working on... cheating, I know. :)

Alexander paused mid-step and sighed, his grey eyes locked onto his brother's bright blue eyes. “I was 7 and Patty was 8,” he said as he shifted towards the bed, dropping onto it with all of his weight, which wasn't much. “Mum took us to a small restaurant with a few of her work friends and I really needed to pee, but she wouldn't let me go -- I was always a fidgety child, I guess. She assumed I was having one of my moments and held me there.

“I tried to hold it, but I couldn't. The moment I felt the warmth I started to cry out and stop it, but it was far too late... it just kept coming,” he paused and refused to meet his brother's eyes. “Worst day of my life, I reckon. Everyone laughed when they realised I had wet my pants, but I tried to brave face it until I could get away. Didn't take long.”

“You pissed your pants?”

“As I was saying,” muttered Alex. “I ran off to the bathroom and Patrick followed. He was... shocked, I guess. He didn't even hesitate or laugh, he just unbuckled my belt and took off my trousers, ignoring the urine that was going slowly down my leg. He grabbed a handful of loo paper, dabbed it in water, and began wiping my legs. He did this and then took of my pants and did the same action.”

Alex clenched his eyes shut. “He picked them up and threw them in his brand-new school bag and gave me the tightest hug he could give. He took of his shoes and socks and then his shorts and put them on me. The git actually walked out into the restaurant in nothing but his pants, grasping my hand, an expression on his face just daring anyone to laugh.

Tears slowly dripped down Alex's cheeks, despite his eyes being clenched shut. “He was always there for me. Whenever I was hungry he'd always have a treat stashed away. If I didn't want to eat my carrots he'd sneak them from my plate and then give me his potatoes. When I was scared he'd lift his blanket and invite me into his bed. There was so many things that he did because he really loved me.”

“After he... left, I had to sleep and look at his bed every night. I had to be strong because there was no more Patty to protect me and that destroyed me. For the longest time I slipped into his bed and if I closed my eyes and prayed hard enough, I could feel him there. Mum never got rid of his stuff... I was thankful for that, but dad wanted to because he said I needed to move on. Dad always gave into mum's word, though. Never did he argue with her. Only Patty could stand his ground and get mum to do what he needed...”

Small context: Alexander's brother, Patrick, died when Alexander was eight. Alex's very closed up about it and he sits down and shares a memory with his adoptive brother, who is a lot like Patrick in many aspects, just a little more jokey about life instead of serious. I think it's a very powerful scene and it's probably the best thing I have ever written. (ignore the errors, it's a rough draft).

#+end_quote

and this:

#+begin_quote
  She does not have eyes or ears as you or I would understand them, yet she sees and hears. She cannot interfere, she can only observe - and she has indeed observed much over the last century and three-quarters. She does not remember, but nor does she forget. She does not follow the passage of time, yet knows it is on a day at the very end of June, that Sirius Black comes home, riding a hippogriff like a wizarding Lone Ranger. Beneath his torn and dirty robe he wears the pallor of incarceration, grief and fear. There is a bounty on his head and he has run out of places to hide. He knows he will be safe here, but he also knows that the price of safety is high, and all it buys is time.

#+begin_quote
  As they rose to exit, the door opened in front of them. Harry pulled Luna behind the open door and they both held back a gasp when two men entered the room wearing black cloaks and white masks.

  The two Death Eaters took a look around the room, but Harry and Luna had applied their Notice-Me-Nots by then. Thus the squat man closed the door they were hiding behind without giving them a glance.

  After a moment, the taller man said, "He's not here, either. Guess this kid don't care so much for Black as we thought, eh?"

  The other one replied, "Cor, bloody well right, eh? Remind us never to expect the young relatives to rush to help, if we're 'avin' a crisis. This latest generation can't be arsed! 'Oh, me bruvvers hanging over a chasm? I'd best wash behind me ears and shine me boots so I'll looks extra special when I goes to save him!' You know he's a poufter, besides."

  Seeing him lurch forward, Luna tapped Harry with her wand, wrapping a conjured towel around his mouth.

  The taller cloaked figure replied, "Hang on. You're saying that this Potter digs in the boy's garden?"

  The squat one nodded, adding, "Heard his dates all end up in tears. How do you suppose that happens?"

  Luna followed up with a binding spell- silken ropes wrapped around Harry's arms, forcing his wand away from aiming at the shorter masked man.

  The tall Death Eater continued to stroll on, as oblivious as his companion to Harry and Luna's presence. He shook his head and said, "Blimey. I never knew."

  "It's a sad, sad state of affairs, chum. Erases all doubt as to who deserves to run this clockworks though, dunnit?"

  "Strewth."

  Finally, Luna hit Harry with a leg-locker curse, and then grabbed hold of the binding ropes before he could topple forward.

  She waited until the two men had crossed to exit the room and sealed the door behind them before cancelling Harry's bindings.

  Harry whirled to face Luna, his skin flushed with anger. He pointed an accusing finger toward her. "Yoooouuuuuu!"

  Undaunted, Luna said, "Harry, are we here to save Sirius and Hermione or your pride?"

  He spat out a counter-question; "If I said 'my pride', what would you do?"

  "Oh, I would still try to help. I just thought that you had different goals in mind."

  “But not on the street,” Hermione said. Her future wouldn't be planned while dodging inebriated wizards.

** From chapter 3 of my humour fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9121877/1/Midnight-Blues][Midnight Blues]]:

#+begin_quote
  ...But nothing can truly prepare you for a situation like this. As I find myself subjected to the highly personal and deeply scarring recording of my two best friends shagging on what was apparently supposed to be a videotape of a /holocaust/ film, I am forced to admit two things. One: I will never, /ever/ be clean again. Two: Hermione has a really nice arse.
#+end_quote

And from my HP/Witcher crossover fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11804414/1/The-Lesser-Kindness][The Lesser Kindness]]:

#+begin_quote
  "It is really quite an amazing thing when you think about it. Anything you wish for, granted. Just like that," the soldier was remarking. "I always thought djinn were just stories my grandmum told me."

  "It's precisely for that reason why they're so dangerous," reminded Hermione, "the wrong kind of wish can topple nations."

  Harry barked out a laugh, reminded of his adventure with Ron, the Wolf School witcher, and the unlucky dryad who ardently wished for the fall of Cintra. As if sensing his master's glee, Sleipnir whickered softly, in a way that sounded oddly reminiscent of a chuckle. Unlike his steed, all three of Harry's companions stared at him with varying degrees of confusion, from a squint of the eyes to a quirk of the eyebrows, and everything in between.

  "My personal experience with wishes," Harry replied, providing explanation for his outburst, "is that it tends to be a sword that only cuts the user."

  "Another reason to be careful," agreed Hermione. "Djinn tend to deal in absolutes: if you don't tell them exactly what you want, exactly the way you want it, then expect a prank that goes anywhere from mildly mischievous, to practically lethal."

  "Still, the lure of getting anything you wish for... it's a hell of a lure."

  Hermione smiled knowingly. "Why, you seem rather wistful, Longbottom. Is there any particular wish you'd like to have granted?"

  "Oh, what? I don't... I'm not... hrmm..." Neville stumbled over his words, and quickly petered out to silence.

  Hermione shrugged carelessly. "You simply keep mentioning it; what are we supposed to think?"

  "Well, I mean I /have/ wishes. Don't we all?"

  "Of course," said Hermione, "but I didn't ask you if you had wishes, I asked you if you had a wish in particular."

  "I... well, I..." said the soldier meekly, and Harry had to stifle his laughter at the sheer absurdity of the situation. This man was a hardened soldier, one who had seen a lot of combat to have been appointed to the Redanian Special Task Force, and here he was, being made to act like a bashful schoolchild by a slip of a woman, and an elf to boot.

  "Fine. Master Witcher?"

  "Yes, Madame Sorceress?"

  "Have you anything to wish for?"

  "A pair of socks that always stay dry, and boots that never wear," Harry replied, ever the picture of ultimate practicality.

  He faced a blank stare from the sorceress. "Really. Socks and boots. That's what you'd spend your wishes on," she repeated dully.

** Alright, well. It's not the usual type of fic you see on this sub, but I'm proud of it, so here.

  “Research methods, right?”

  Pansy frowned, blinked, reminded herself that she was a /Parkinson/ for gods sakes and she did not gawk or stutter. “Yeah, actually. Are you... are you in that class?”

  “Mm, no, but a good friend is.” The woman paused, seemingly deciding if she was going to say more. “Harry? Messy black hair, glasses, ridiculous scar-”

  “Oh my god he is such a-” Pansy paused, watching the frown crease over the other girl's forehead, and decided to change course. “I don't really know him.” She decided instead. In fact, she /did/ know Harry “look at how /stunning/ I am” Potter. The asshole from the lacrosse team who everyone adored with some orphan sob-story that related to the scar that covered half his forehead. He had made quick enemies with her on-again, off-again boyfriend -- or whatever you call someone who you sleep with when you're both drunk and pent up - and if she had to listen to one more goddamn word about “fucking Potter he thinks he's so great just because he's fast and Pansy did you see the atrocious jeans he was wearing at that party and can you /believe/ he drinks /Pabst/ like some common barbarian-” she was probably going to shoot someone.

  Modern, non-magical, university AU. Pansy Parkinson is just fine, thank you very much, finishing up her degree with her best friend and mostly-boyfriend and no, she is not thinking about a certain pair of dark brown eyes and making a total fool of herself in the process. Unfortunately, Pansy Parkinson's year is about to go wildly off course.

  Instead of Durmstrang Academy, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was invited to take part in the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. When Ilvermorny arrives at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore is shocked to see the long-thought-dead Harry and Lily Potter appear, as well as the missing Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. This has certainly thrown a wrench in his plans!
