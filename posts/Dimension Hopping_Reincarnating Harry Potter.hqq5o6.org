I've always liked these kinds of fics, where harry ends up in another universe with his old memories intact. Crossover or no. I haven't been able to find a good one in a while, and implore the good members of this subreddit to share their favorites.


** There's The Lone Traveler by The Professional, later adopted by Dunuelos, which features a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter traveling to alternate dimensions and shifting their paths. It starts out in the /Harry Potter/ universe, but branches out into other continuities such as /Babylon 5/, /Buffy the Vampire Slayer/, and even /The Belgariad/ and /Elenium/.

  After spending half his life trying to rid the world of Voldemort, Harry Potter finally succeeds. However, the price has been high. Too high. Unfortunately, when Harry risks his life to go back and ‘do things right', something goes wrong...

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

  He was slipping, as easily as water over rocks...Thirteen-year-old Harry enters an alternate universe that is both his dream come true and his worst nightmare. He's traded souls, and another boy--another Harry--is living his life. Two lives have now become intertwined with the lives of two Potions masters. The Potions masters are most displeased.

** There's linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13034223/1/A-Discordant-Note]]), where an immortal Dark!Harry with a harem is in either A Song Of Ice And Fire, or Game Of Thrones; I never got the difference..

And there's linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains]]), in which Harry spends a few years as a Sith Lord before coming back to the HP-verse with no time having passed. It takes place mostly in the HP-verse, but has a continuation fic that takes place in Stargate SG1.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire][A Song Of Ice And Fire]] is the name of the /series/. A Game of Thrones is the name of the first book of the series (there are 5 books total atm) and also is the name of the TV series adaptation.

  It only takes a single disharmonious element to throw off the entire composition. Fifty years before Robert Baratheon was to ascend the Iron Throne, Westeros receives one hell of a bad musician. Harry never did care about any player other than himself.
