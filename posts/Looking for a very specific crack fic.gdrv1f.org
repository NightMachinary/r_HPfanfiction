:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This is going to sound strange but I can only remember specific details of the fic, I'm not exactly sure where I read it, but here are the things I remember: Harry doesn't cry, he oozes slime Once moved from his cupboard he misses it When the troll was attacking Harry was playing his own version of magic Mario kart and killed the troll without realizing it was a big deal Oh, wandless magic use, but Harry doesn't realize it's a big deal? He's friends with Fred and George, and they rescue him summer of second year I don't recall him being friends with any other people Like I said, very weird but it was a really funny fic


** I think it's called Core Thread? I do remember Harry's slime being used as a cleaning agent by Flich though

** I remember in the Problem With Potions they invented sencient cleaning blobs, but that wasn't really cracky.
