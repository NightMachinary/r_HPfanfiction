**** Well, it kinda lost a lot of momentum when Trisha (simons_flower) died. A couple regulars kept it up in her honor, but really the site traffic more than halved between 2009 and 2010 and has regularly been slipping. It's been five years since then, I'm actually amazed it lasted as long as it did.
