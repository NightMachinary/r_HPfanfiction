:END:
Searching for a story, which I read, where i remember that as Harry arrives at grimmaul place at his 5th year, he starts to completly rages at Ron and Hermione, not just the litle bit lik ein the Canon. Also in his absolute unhappy mood, he is still the only one to remember its Ginnys bday.

Thanks in advance


** Firstly, like [[/u/JWBails][u/JWBails]] pointed out, this happens in a lot of fics and thus, we need more info. Secondly, the flair should be 'What's that Fic'
