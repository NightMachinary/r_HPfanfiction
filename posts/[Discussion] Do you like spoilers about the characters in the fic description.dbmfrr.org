On one hand I hate spoilers, on the other I do like the warning if I'm going to have to deal with unsavory elements such as bashing.

****** Well, you could fairly easily do so as long as you firmly establish that it's an AU.

Trying to argue that you're staying in canon while making Dumbledore actively malicious (rather than just overly secretive and sometimes incompetent or prone to overlooking important elements of a problem - see Dumbledore flying to the Ministry in Book 1 rather than Flooing, Apparating, using Fawkes or Portkeying) is very difficult because in the end, for all his flaws, he died without complaint and did so to put plans into motion that ended up working as intended and saving everyone.

That's such a fundamentally opposed action to a villainous motivation that unless you totally abandon it and unapologetically write an AU fic, you're just going to look dumb.

  "Gryffindor," said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. "Mum and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin."

  "That's the house Vol---, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?"

** I like plot-relevant pairings to be labeled in the summary, thanks. I hate it when I read a fic and suddenly it's Snape/Harry out of nowhere, untagged because the author didn't want to "ruin the twist".

Thanks, Swung By Serafim linkao3(9821300). I will never rec this fic as a "must read" in this sub for that reason, even if the writing and worldbuilding is well done. Not only is the Surprise Snarry a thing, their relationship is just plain awkwardly written (as expected for a teenage boy and his high school headmaster) and ruins the whole ending sequence.

**** Lmao, she tops my list of worst OC's in HP fanfic. I disliked the role the story gave her (Mugglewank expert) and her personality was just quirks on top of quirks. Also her dialogue was an atrocious lesson on why you shouldn't give characters full phonetic accents.

***** Yeah that right there is what made me delete the fic and get angry at myself for wasting time on it, and the author for fucking up such a good start and good concept.

I literally didn't read any page that had her name on past the third page of her dialogue, and after realising she wasn't just going to be a side character and I couldn't cherrypick the pages without her, that was it. So I never saw or realised she was a Mugglewank character.

Thank Merlin for small mercies.

**** If you read the Fanficbot summary, it markets the fic as a "For want of a nail" canon divergence, not a romance. I read it, expecting a canon divergence AU fic.

What the fic actually turned into, by the end, was Snarry-flavored mugglewank. The summary was misleading and that left a bad taste in my mouth that would not have been there had I gone into the fic knowing what it was about.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.
