I can understand rehash stories if there are major differences to them. For instance say the abuse Harry goes through with the Dursley's is worse and Dumbledore decides to take Harry away from the Dursley's despite the blood wards being there.

Or maybe Sirius escapes Azkaban sooner then canon. Or something that goes differently. Or Harry tells someone that he can hear voices through the walls, not understanding that he can speak parseltongue.

Or what if Luna got the diary? Or Hermione? Or Ron? Or whoever. Making it different from canon.

There are ways of doing the rehash stories to make them more interesting, but people rarely do it. Most stories deal with Harry's life with the Dursley's for the Summer. Yes okay we get it, the Dursley's are horrible care givers. What else is new? I don't want to read something that I've read in different ways a bunch of times.

Sorry if it seems like I'm being rude, I'm not trying to be; I wouldn't mind a rehash story if it actually changed major things. For instance what if Harry befriended Neville before befriending Ron? Or what if he befriended say I don't know Susan Bones or Tracey Davies or whoever before he befriended Hermione. We know that Harry will befriend Ron and Hermione, and if it's not Ron then it's likely going to be Draco that he befriends; because nine times out of ten he still befriends Hermione no matter what; I mean don't get me wrong Hermione's great, I love her character and everything but it gets boring when you pretty much know who Harry will befriend.

Big whoop, we've seen that before countless of times. Why not have him befriend Blaise or Theo if you want him to befriend a Slytherin. Instead of it being Draco. I mean I love Draco, well at least fanon Draco, but he was a right jerk to everyone. Have Harry befriend someone like Blaise or Theo where you don't really know where their true intentions lie.

Remember when Harry realized that he was getting headaches in Defence and sometimes in the Great Hall because of Quirrell? Well what if he actually told someone or someone forced him to tell someone, changes like that could lead to interesting things.

And the Tri-Wizard Tournament. We know what the obstacles are, why not change them up? Create new ones instead of the same old same old.

Just stuff like that would refresh the rehash ideas. But even so I truly wonder why rehash stories are so popular? I've gotten so annoyed at them that I just tend to read stories where the characters are seventeen or older just because it would be something new.

Thoughts?


** Some are just uncreative writers, some are too lazy to develop their own plot, and others have an excessive attachment to canon plot.

However, if you look up those fics with the highest Favorites/Follows, hardly any of them is a rehash. Even the very frustrating BWP eventually diverges massively.

** A lot of writers enter fan fiction not aiming to write an original piece set in the Harry another world, they aim to write a better Harry Potter. They aim to 'fix' what they perceive as flaws in the series. Its a rehash because they don't want something new, they want Harry Potter done right. Some are just lazy, some are poor writes, some lack an original thought but I suspect the number of fix-it-fics that are rehashes suggests that they want a better Harry Potter, though I suspect very few know what it is they want.

*** I'd add to this that some writers will break their own plots to stick with canon. Super OP Harry can't beat Umbridge if he just stops Voldemort from rising the previous year, so guess he just comes back anyway!

** There's something comfortable about them. Perhaps it's the innate knowledge of myself knowing that I cannot write a better set of tasks for the triwizard tournament, but that doesn't mean I can't explore the world in depth a bit more and expand upon some of the characters. It's all about shifting the focus of the story.

** Because rehash stories are easy and don't require a lot of thought or effort. It means that the writer doesn't have to worry about creating a new plot or make with new worldbuilding; they can just focus on the few changes they did make. Which is usually making Harry "better" in some way: Making him richer, more independent, more powerful, more or "better" friends, you name it. Pure wish-fulfillment stuff.

*** Why would you make Harry richer? The boy is loaded. Even a 10/10/10 pile of Galleons (assuming a Galleon = 1 ounce of gold) would be worth 150,000 Pound Sterling in 1991 and Harry has far more + another pile of silver.

**** That's not enough for some of these authors. They want to make him richer than Malfoy, preferably the richest person in the wizarding world. Oh, and let's make him a Lord of an "Ancient and Noble House" (which is totally an official title and not just Sirius being sarcastic about his family, which he detested) while we're at it.

***** I thought that was the official title of the Blacks. Who knows how long they are around, they might have picked it up in the sixteenth century and everyone else just stopped caring about them. Remember, titel â‰  political power. It could be a simple honorific.

****** Nobody ever referred to the Blacks as the "Most Ancient and Noble House" except Sirius that one time. It's possible that they might have referred to themselves by that, but there's no indication that it was ever an official title.

In fact, I'll argue that it isn't because if it HAD been an official title, you can bet that the Malfoys would have shared it, or had a title of equal pomposity. The Malfoys have been in Britain at least as long as the Blacks, they used to hobnob it with royalty and the Muggle gentry before the Statute of Secrecy, and they are definitely richer (despite what certain fanfics seem to think). The Malfoys are also part of the "Sacred Twenty-Eight" on the same level as the Blacks.

And yet the Malfoys have no title, nobody ever calls them "the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy" even though you KNOW that if that had been an official title and they had any claim to it, they would have used it at any given opportunity.

No... I really do not think it's an official title. It's just Sirius being sarcastic.
