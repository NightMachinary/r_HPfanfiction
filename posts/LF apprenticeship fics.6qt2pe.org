Any character is fine I just read a harry being snapes potion apprentice and I'm in the mood to binge read this type of fic. I just request that it be 50k words plus.


** A personal favorite of mine where Harry is an apprentice healer to Poppy Pomphrey. Currently over half a million words and still updating. linkffn(Whispers in the Night by Jean11089)

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

** linkffn(Dagger and Rose by Perspicacity)

This is an absolutely outstanding fic, and one of the best Dumbledores in fanfiction. The writing is stellar and the apprenticeship is done masterfully.

  The blood wards hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.
