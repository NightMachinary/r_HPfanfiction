The more I think about it, the more Tonks appears to be the perfect Mary Sue. She's got;

- A unique name (that she hates)

- A unique and very powerful talent (almost) no one has (being a metamorphmagus an all)

- Beautiful, yet plain

- Is clumsy to the core (big one)

- Though super clumsy, still a very talented Auror

- In love with the one man she can't have

- Still proceeds to win over the one man she can't have

- Dies an heroic death

​

Don't get me wrong, I don't hate her character, but she does seem to tick all of the boxes. What's your opinion on this?

​

Conclusion after discussion: from the intel I gathered I have now learnt that there is more to a Mary Sue than simply characteristics, and that her relevance (or rather, irrelevance) to the story actually doesn't make her a /real/ Mary Sue. Big thanks to the people who have pointed that out to me. As someone in the comment section mentioned, Tonks really is a bit of a missed opportunity within the story, as her ability to morph could've been applied in many interesting ways.


** The single factor that makes her not a Mary Sue is that she just... isn't important. At all. She doesn't change anything. The series would be exactly the same if she never existed. That is the ultimate decider of a Mary Sue - you can be one without any of the things you listed, and you can have all of those things without being one. Tonks is a case of the latter.

- Her wolf patronus is used to foreshadow the importance of Snape's doe, in that patronuses can change under specific circumstances.

- She stops morphing after Lupin rejects her, foreshadowing the possibility of losing magic when heartbroken, which happened to and resulted in Merope's death.

- She and Lupin die so that the last Marauder can bite it, and so Teddy can be an orphan and continue the cycle of HP's +hero+ orphan journey.

***** JKR has a longstanding habit of using women characters as backstory, motivations, plot devices, or accessories to the male characters, instead of standing as characters in their own right. Lily is equally as guilty as Tonks for being considered a Mary Sue, since she's constantly praised as beautiful, charming, vivacious, talented, loving, and used as the motivation and backstory for both Harry and Snape. And like Tonks, she's also saved from the Sue pile by her lack of onscreen presence.

If you've seen Crimes of Grindelwald, the "accessory to the male lead" effect applies to Leta and Nagini. Leta is the fiancee of Theseus Scamander, the half-sister of Kama, the possible sister of Credence, and the former love interest of Newt Scamander. Much of her character is developed around her relationship to men.

Nagini, now revealed as an Asian snake lady, was Voldemort's minion/soul vessel and decapitated by Neville Longbottom in what is supposed to be his greatest moment of triumph. In CoG, she literally only gets two lines of dialogue and does nothing for the plot.

It's surprising to me that JKR would do this when she's always been so vocal about social issues and representation.

****** I haven't seen Crimes of Grindelwald for a few reasons, such as it breaking the timeline, being a money grab, and including the now-suspect Johnny Depp (I'm not saying people shouldn't see things with actors who've been accused of violence, but it gave me enough mixed feelings that, along with other things, weighted me toward not seeing it). I might see it eventually but nothing I hear makes me want to. It would mostly be just for reference in conversation.

That is pretty creepy that Nagini was a human...wtf mate.

I think JKR cares about social issues but also lives in her own bubble, as we all do. In some ways her bubble might be more insular due to the effects of her fame. I started reading "Harry, a History," and it talks about her avoiding reading anything about the series online for a long time. Which would mean being pretty out of the loop!

******* JKR said that she'd planned Nagini to be a human for 20 years, according to [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1044579634581401600?lang=en][her Twitter post here.]]

#+begin_quote
  Q: How long have you been holding the Nagini secret?

  A: Only for around twenty years.
#+end_quote

Nagini's identity was possibly foreshadowed by Dumbledore in the books:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    "I don't think so," said Dumbledore. "I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behaviour of the snake, Nagini?"
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

...

I think the real issue is that JKR, having known that Nagini was an human woman all along, chose to dehumanise her in the story and use her as a plot device. Treated as a disposable McGuffin by Dumbledore and the heroes, her death by Neville applauded, and even in her backstory she's a victim, abused by the circus owner she works for. Nagini has no character or personality outside of being a tool or accessory for other characters.

********** Harry surviving actually has nothing to do with Lily's sacrificial protection, other than it was the motivation which cased the real protection.

Voldemort, attempting to circumvent Lily's protection, used Harry's blood in a ritiual to bring himself back to life. That blood connection tethered Harry to life, allowing the Horcrux to pass on when Harry was hit with the Killing Curse, but allowing Harry to choose to come back to the land of the living.

Or, at least, that's how I interpreted it all.

This connection created via the ritual is why Dumbledore gets an uncharacteristically (for the siutation) 'Triumphiant' look on his face when Harry tells him about it. He had just confirmed, to himself, that Harry would be able to survive the removal of the Horcrux, under very specific circumstances which he then put into action.

Firstly she said this after people complained that Hermione possibly be black, secondly she only ever said that Hermione could be black, not that she was black in canon. Its not a retcon if she didn't even change anything. She didn't just suddenly say Hermione is black in the books.

However, i have seen and read about the "femist" stance on this.

Just as you weren't responding to me specifically, i wasn't really talking about the Johnny Depp case. He is a famous actor with fans that will probably never abandon him, in the grand scheme of things this will not affect him at all.

But, we need to keep a critical stance regarding all cases of violence. Just because there are a lot of cases where there is violence, that doesn't mean that we can afford to assume that all potential cases are true. After all, the presumption of innocence is central to the justice system of a free country.

Emotional responces to potentialy baseless (or true) accusations will hamper the distribution of justice (see "The Green Mile"). I simply wanted to point out how easy it is for someone to provoke such emotional responces using unproven accusations.

People like yap about how Snape is a very interesting character, how he affects the war, but he's just as replaceable as anyone else in the series.

*** I agree with you for the most part, except about Snape. I'd argue he has a huge impact on everything. I mean, he's the reason Voldemort even wants to kill Harry in the first place. He's the reason Harry survives the killing curse, both times. The first time, Harry survives because Lily sacrificed herself. The only reason her sacrifice mattered, while Jame's didn't, is because she had a choice to live. Why did she have a choice? Because Voldemort wasn't planning to kill her, because Snape had asked her to be spared.

The second time, obviously, Harry lives because he chose to sacrifice himself, and because he was the master of the elder wand. Why did he sacrifice himself? Because Snape gave him the information. Why was he master of the elder wand/why didn't Voldemort realize what had happened? Because Snape chose to give mercy to the one person in the whole world who knew his true allegiance, thereby alienating himself from everyone and working for the wizard who had killed the one he loved.

I'd argue that Snape has the most influence on the plot of any character, save Harry and Dumbledore.

You do realise that just about anyone in the Order could have been entrusted with the specific memory, don't you? Dumbledore could have given the memory to Harry himself, with the specific instruction to not view it until Voldemort was left with just one horcrux remaining or something - HP is such a good little drone that he'd have followed that instruction to the letter.

As for the Elder Wand's allegiance, Dumbledore could have simply destroyed the wand himself and used his own wand if he was so afraid of the wand's power falling to Voldemort's hands. The inheritance of the wand's power is some of the most convoluted and coincidental plot mechanics I've ever read.

She'd be able to infiltrate really effectively, and one on one she can kill you in a situation where she appears to have no weapons.

** Tonks is a huge missed opportunity of a character in my opinion. As one of the few female members of the Order of the Phoenix, she deserved more of a voice.

Lupin and Tonks are my all time favourite fictional couple, but I really hate how Tonks just gets completely subsumed into their romantic subplot. She is a trained Auror but we never see her do any badass duelling. She is a metamorphmagus but it's only ever put to comedic use. She goes through hell with Remus in DH but we never see her reaction to any of it.\\
And don't even get me started on her last words! Personally, I think the only reason she would have left Teddy and gone to fight would have been out of a belief that having just one more person on the side of good could be enough to make the difference between Voldemort's victory or defeat (and so the life or death of her baby, husband, mother - everyone!) and because she feels duty-bound as an Auror and Order member. Not because she can't help but traipse after Remus everywhere he goes (and don't get me wrong, I love Remus despite - or maybe because of - all his flaws). Even tiny things like the fact that she wasn't on Potterwatch radio annoy me. But hey, all this frustration is good for my creativity as I now write fanfic about her!

Anyway, to answer your question, no I don't think she's a Mary Sue (though if she was, at least she'd get more page time!) Cheers for the interesting post.

** Like others have said, she was fairly unimportant and things could've happened in the book with or without her. Personally, I agree with you. I didn't like her character in the books or the movies. And I didnt like how she got together with Lupin, their whole relationship didnt make much sense to me

** u/BobVosh:
#+begin_quote

  - A unique and very powerful talent (almost) no one has (being a metamorphmagus an all)
  - Beautiful, yet plane
  - Is clumsy to the core (big one)
#+end_quote

The second one is her choice, the third one is fanonly her powers fault of alternative leg sizes. Although for all I know JK tweeted on this.

Regardless she isn't important, like the others said, and Hermione is far closer to being a Mary Sue imo. Or, rather, [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonSue][canon Sue]]

*** What I'd love to know is who the hell thought "Nymphadora" would be a good name. It's a bad name, and if you look to the Greek it comes from ("nymphos" = bride, "dora" = give), it makes no sense at all.

Can you blame her father for calling her Dora? At least that sounds OK.

**** Keep in mind that in Greek mythology Nymphs were the beautiful spirits of the rivers, the seas and the nature in general. Also "dora" does not mean give, it means gift. As such "Nymphadora" is translated to "Gift of the Nymphs" and as Nymphs are heavily tied to the many gods of the Greek pantheon it can also mean indirectly "Gift of the Gods".

** My thoughts on it are: "Mary Sue is a useless category that conflates multiple storytelling problems and blames them on a character instead of the writing, and we should all collectively get over that term and move on to deeper critiques of stories instead."

The reason that "Mary Sue" as a term arose, putting aside the historical shit with Star Trek fanfics, is that /some people/, at /some times/ were writing /escapist fiction for themselves/ where the protagonist did not really have anything at stake.

The supposed "great perfection" of a Mary Sue is not /a problem/. The problem is that "oh, this character can just magically do X, and that means that Y conflict is no longer relevant.". Special abilities are not a problem, the problem is that the focus on it is designed to make those who identify with the character /feel good/, not to make the story interesting. Weird names are not a problem. The problem is that it is a superficial marker of "specialness" that helps those who identify with the character feel good without /actually providing depth/ to the character.

Literally millions of characters in millions of stories check all the boxes and are /fine/. Because it isn't a problem with the character, it is a problem with the story, and the writing. The /same/ character can be "written as a Mary Sue" or not, WITHOUT CHANGING ANYTHING ABOUT THEM, just by changing whether their environment is a properly responsive world filled with characters whose lives are ultimately about themselves and not about whoever the protagonist is.

So if you want to ask "Is Tonks A Mary Sue?", you would have to answer "no" to the following questions: "are the stakes of her story separate from the stakes of other characters' enough that it is not the case that everyone is obsessed with her?"

The answer is yes.

"Does she struggle to do certain things, instead of it all coming easy to her?"

The answer is yes.

"Does the greater world have enough depth that her presence or absence, though it would cause ripples, would not completely destroy it?"

The answer is yes.

Etc.

Tonks /is not a Mary Sue/, because a "Mary Sue" is not a type of character with specific traits. It is a position a character can be placed in /through poor writing/, where the problems are a function of how much more effort the writer put into highlighting that character, and how much less effort they put into providing depth to the rest.

Through that lens, you can have a magical girl with three eye-colours, twelve rare names, five million talents, who is great at everything she does and who is beloved by all... And if she is a secondary character who doesn't even have that much screentime? /She is not a Mary Sue/.

Characters do not exist in a vacuum. They are products of their writing and their in-world environment. They are frustrating, if the writer did not intend it, usually because the world around them is reacting in an incongruous manner that we recognize as inconsistent with human nature. To say "this character is a Mary Sue" is to misdiagnose the problem.

It is not the character. It is how they, and those around them, are written to behave. Superficial traits about a character tell you basically nothing until you evaluate how they are written, and so the critique of "X is a Mary Sue" should be replaced with "the writing around X is unnecessarily contrived and turns surrounding characters into plot devices instead of their own people with their own goals".
