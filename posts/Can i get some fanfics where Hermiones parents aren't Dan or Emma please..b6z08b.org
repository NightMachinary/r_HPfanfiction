I am getting really tired of reading a story and getting invested only for dan and emma to bust in and be like "SUP we're expies of The stars of the movies love us" can i get some recommendations where these two aren't a thing please


** ¬®shrug¬® I don't entirely see what you're talking about. Most of the times the names are used, it's /just/ easter-egg names --- I haven't noticed that any consistent characterization (or, indeed, physical appearance) comes with it. You could have parents called Dan and Emma who are nothing like whatever you're referring to, and you could have parents named Nathaniel and Iolanthe who have precisely the characterization you hate.

I have encountered some stories which use the name Thomas and Helen, and I personally use Daniel and Sally. But again, what difference does it make?

I wouldn't say so. I've never seen it as more than an easter-egg, and a pretty discreet one at that --- I didn't realize what the significance of the names was until the third or fourth time I encountered them, I think; and I've seen other posts on the sub to the same effect. It's just a character being named after a real-world figure of thematic significance to the author; how is it different from the thousand other "meaningful names" scattered about the Wizarding World by Rowling herself? Is ‚ÄúDan Granger‚Äù really that much more distracting than ‚ÄúEmmeline Vance‚Äù?

I can see the reasoning better there, but White Squirrel's reasoning on this matter, for example, proves that "sluggish uncreativity" isn't the only reason to use the fanon names. In Squirrel's case, they think the way the fandom can agree thusly on unstated aspects of the /HP/ universe is actually beautiful and inspiring, and I can see their point. Watching ‚ÄúDan & Emma‚Äù and ‚Äúwards‚Äù and ‚Äúinheritance tests‚Äù seep throughout the fanfiction community is essentially watching a mythology being born. It's pretty neat when you think about it.

And again, unlike most fanon tropes which are annoying /plot elements/, an element of background worldbuilding like this isn't a danger to the worth of the story. Mr Granger could just as well be called John or Abraham or Gandalf-Hyeronyminus III, for all the difference it make; what matters is his characterization.

** In linkao3(Presque Toujours Pur) Hermione's real parents are Regulus Black and I think McKinnon (sorry, my brain is blanking and it's stuck on Kate McKinnon). It was a conventual relationship, but Disney rules.

Obviously you should always name the Granger's Emanuel "Em" Granger and Danielle "Danny" Granger. If only as a test of how much attention your readers are paying.
