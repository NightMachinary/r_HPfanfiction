Have either of these been done:

Idea 1: Voldemort was successful in the Chamber and came back to life. Harry kills the basilisk but Voldy escapes to build up his support. In my thinking books 3 and 4 are still canon(ish), but starting in 5 there's a diary!voldy vs cauldron!voldy vs harry hate triangle going. D!voldy and C!voldy are trying to kill each other and harry. Harry has to get rid of both of them. This would have Ginny losing the diary sometime in the first half of the year and it being picked up by Daphne, Tracey, or some other character I don't care about.

Idea 2: The Dursley's refused to allow Harry to go to Hogwarts, and Harry disappeared when he turned 17. Ginny, Hermione, Neville, and Daphne Greengrass are a sort of ops team in the Order and are sent by Dumbledore to find him and bring him to the wizarding world when he's 20. They'll have to figure out the whole horcrux thing and how to get rid of them. Ginny and team don't completely trust Dumbledore. I see Harry as more jaded and sarcastic after an additional 6 years with the Dursleys.

Any ships would be at the very least H/G but any other pairings are up for grab.

Would either of these be interesting to anyone except me?


** I've wanted a good story with Diary!Tom ever since Black Comedy brought up the idea. As for who picks it up, a Slytherin wouldn't work, but someone in Hufflepuff might. Maybe Susan, only because I'd also like to see a fic where Amelia goes batshit crazy and/or super saiyan on Dumbledore/Voldemort after something happens to Susan. Though, as you mentioned, Sally-Anne Perks or Lockhart would be a good scapegoat as well

Over all they're pretty neat ideas.

** Another idea is that the diary works and Tom Riddle comes back to life, but stays in the school, he can then perhaps kill and impersonate a teacher each year?

Idea 2 has been done, though is a Snape/Harry fic. I quite enjoyed it, nonetheless ;) - I forget the name though, Harry is a submissive type and Snape has seen him before in a BDSM club or something.

** I like it, quite original. I'm curious how you'd pull off H/G for Idea 1 though, as that scenario would mean Ginny dies in the chamber?

*** That's probably what he meant by having Ginny lose the diary, only for someone else to pick it up.

For what it's worth, OP, you might have an easier time convincing readers to invest in Idea 2, though you would really have to give both divergences some deep thought.

With Idea 1, why would Ginny lose the diary, and when? If you do it earlier, say in Diagon Alley, then anyone could pick it up. If you wait until Hogwarts, then Ginny might have already grown attached to Tom.

As for the second idea, the Dursleys were shown to be pretty helpless when it came to stopping him from going to Hogwarts, but having the Order look for a older Harry does sound like it would be more popular. Mostly because of the Indy!Harry vibe, especially since you'll be writing him as a little more sarcastic than canon.

As for ships, shippers will scream for H/Hr in Idea 2, most likely. There's no real reason not to keep it canon, though, should you wish to.

**** I've come up with three scenarios for why Ginny doesn't have the diary at the end of CoS:

Scenario 1: Ginny drops it somewhere accidentally and it's picked up by someone else. Maybe this could explain what happened to Sally-Ann Perks. The diary finds whoever it is more willing to go along with it's plans to unleash the basilisk.

Scenario 2: Ginny is caught writing in it during class when she's supposed to be doing something practical and it's confiscated. I can't think of any teacher that would do that other than Snape or Lockhart (because he's upset she's not paying attention to him). I'm not totally satisfied with this one, but it gets it out of her hands.

Scenario 3: Lucius fails to get it into her cauldron in Diagon Alley, so he gives it to Draco and tells him to slip it to her. Draco starts writing in it and the diary finds him easy to manipulate. Draco dies at the end. I kind of like that because I hate Draco and it would really impact Lucius. He'd work even harder to get rid of Dumbledore from the school and have more ammo to do it with.

I'm thinking that most of the story until Cauldron Voldy is reborn would be from Tom M. Riddle's POV as he's finding out what happened to his other self and recruiting a new set of Death Eaters. The old ones, like Lucius, wouldn't take him that seriously because he's a 16 year old and while he's powerful they've got a lot more experience. So he's going to have to find others that are sympathetic to his cause.

That's about as far as I got thinking about this one.

Idea 2 is kind of less formed. I thought that they'd find Harry in the first chapter, but I kind of like the idea of having a longer search now that you say something about it. In my head there are a lot more divergences with this one. Ginny is the only Gryffindor on the team. Hermione was a Ravenclaw in school, Neville was in Hufflepuff, and Daphne in Slytherin. They work well because they're mixed and their strengths complement each other. I don't think the Dursleys would have any real problem keeping Harry from going to Hogwarts. It was brushed over pretty easily in canon, but they are his guardians and get to decide what happens to him until he reaches adulthood (I assume that's 18 in the UK). Dumbles said he needs to go, they said no, they argue about it but he decides it's their decision. Ultimately, he only wants Harry as a sacrificial lamb anyway, so getting him trained up as a wizard isn't really a priority for him.

***** If we assume that there's a compulsion charm to write in the diary, Lockhart taking it from Ginny is a perfectly acceptable way for the DADA curse to off that year's professor. Instead of self obliviation, Lockhart dies in the chamber birthing Diary!Tom.

** Idea 1 sounds like it could be terrifying or hilarious, depending on how it's written. The dynamic could be fascinating, since the two Voldemorts are, effectively, mutual horcruxes, Harry is a horcrux for both of them, and C!Voldemort is a horcrux for Harry.

Idea 2 raises some questions. For example, why are they even looking for Harry? At that point, he is just an untrained 20-year-old wizard whose best years for learning new things are behind him, so he can hardly be expected to be anything but prophecy-identified bait for Voldemort. I guess if you take the Manipulative!Dumbledore tack, it could be to kill him to destroy the horcrux in his scar...

*** it's definitely a Manipulative!Dumbledore situation. He doesn't see Harry in Idea 2 as anything more than some sadly necessary cannon fodder. He's a little sorry he has to do it, but it's for "the greater good."

I was fortunate enough to read HP as an adult and thought some of Dumble's choices were strange. Reading fanfic has only reinforced the idea that he is not really a force for good. At best he's a force for grey.

**** Never really liked that tack. Dumbledore's decisions may have been suboptimal in places, but they were mostly justifiable, even rational. (For example, training Harry from birth to be a killing machine would not have helped him defeat Voldemort; it would have made it so that he could not.)

You don't give a reason for Harry's disappearance, but the most plausible one given what you wrote is that Voldemort had gotten to him the moment he turned 17 and lost his mother's protection, because that would be the most logical thing for Voldemort to do. How would Harry even survive, without a wand or any training? (Unless, he is actually dead. Then, I guess it's up to the others to find the horcruxes and discorporate Voldemort one last time.)

  Fudge probably wouldn't believe Dumbledore and Tom Riddle would have exemplary school record and quite up to the task.

You'd have to explain how he somehow missed several decades without aging, though.
