had this idea earlier and don't have the writing skills to do such a thing justice on my own; stereotypes often exist for a reason. one of the biggest witch/wizard stereotypes is that they have familiar bonds with cats. the familiar bond is often described as being a give and take type thing, the witch gives something to the familiar, the familiar gives something back. so, the prompt is as such, wizarding society has created such a close bond with cats as a race, that they have begun to exhibit catlike behavior simply by virtue of being a witch or wizard, examples would be taking fairly regular naps, being drawn to movement of shiny objects, tassels, the normal stuff we find hilarious in cats. though some deus ex machina, harry becomes immune to such things and begins to see it for what it is, something hilarious and easy to exploit. (as I thought of this, I thought of a full squad of aurors freaking out about a laser pointer dot on a wall, for example)


** Well, it's not exactly a familiar bond - but in my story "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief", the animagus transformation has the animal influence the wizard, in both forms. Of course, Hermione thinks she can handle it, and doesn't realise how she is starting to take on cat-like habits - sleeping in, napping in the sun, fussing about dust on her robes, defending her territory, being too curious (and prideful) for her own good, and so on. Sirius, on the other hand, is a dog - and they often act like cats and dogs.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
