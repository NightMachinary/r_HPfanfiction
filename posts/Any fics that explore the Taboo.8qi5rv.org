Couldn't sleep last night as my brain came up with a concept where Harry, enraged by the rampant bullying of his friend, puts a taboo on the word 'Loony' and would hunt down and beat up perpetrators..

Literally anything goes pairing wise etc, just keen to see some different takes on the magic.


** When I read the title, the first thing that came to my mind is 'forbidden sex'.

** Honestly, I have no idea what prompted JK to invent this Taboo. If it was that easy, why didn't Voldemort use it on the word, 'Harry'. Could have given him a clue as to where he was hiding.

*** Because by using the word “Voldemort” he was pretty much guaranteed to not only find Harry but also the members of the order of the Phoenix. Also if he put a taboo on the word “Harry” they would be notified about anyone saying the word Harry, that would be quite a lot of people as he is not the only Harry and lots of people would want to talk about the boy who lived.

*** It's heavily implied that it's a Ministry power, hence Voldemort taking it over in the first place without completely dismantling it.

*** Also, possibly a way of explaining the practically unbelievable fear of his name: if you said his name it marked you for capture or death.

** I used it in my fic the Aurors, but for good. If the Aurors knew they were going into a dangerous situation where they might need back up, or were otherwise vulnerable, they could have the taboo placed on them. Freshly inspired by the handmaids tale, I made the word 'mayday'. They could either yell it or subtly slip it into conversation.
