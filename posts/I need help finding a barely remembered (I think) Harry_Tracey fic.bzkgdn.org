:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It could have been Harry/Daphne but I remember the fic for the Harry/Tracey antics. The part I remember is that Harry ran into Tracey poorly spying on Daphne having a date with Malfoy. He was bored and alone so first he goes over to kinda screw with her and then to help. They follow the unhappy couple around all day. Then they end up at the three broomsticks and had a flirty conversation I believe. I really wish I was sure about more of this but I'd appreciate if anyone can point me in the right direction.


** Its The Merging by Shaydrall, bit of an odd fic but entertaining and at least has some new ideas.
