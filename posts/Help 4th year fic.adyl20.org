I have this memory of reading a fanfiction set in 4th year where Harry sees a younger year crying in the hall and he comforts her. Turns out her friends were making fun of her because she had a crush. Harry talks to her, telling her to be brave and ask her crush to the yule ball. Turns out her crush was him. He didn't have a date yet and had just given her all this advice so he says yes, despite her being a slytherin. I think he says something about her looking familiar, and it turns out she was Snape's niece?

That's literally ALL I remember. I feel like I read this years ago, so it was probably on ffn.net... but I can't find it (although, not surprising given all I remember is this ONE scene. I don't even know if it was a good story! But it is driving me /insane/.)
