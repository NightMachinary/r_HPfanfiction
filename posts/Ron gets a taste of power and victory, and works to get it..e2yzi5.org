I imagine let's say Ron was a bit better at chess, and when he was younger, before the sorting he goes to a chess tournament. Beats Malfoy etc, and get a small taste of power and victory. This Ron though, instead of falling back into his lazy habits, works for more money, victory, etc. I don't care how he does, he just does.

Preferably slytherin Ron

no deatheather slash

no "Lord Slytherin/Weasley/Merlin/Universe"

proper names, no "Hadrians"


** My series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) features a very similar Ron to what you've described. However, there is also a heavy emphasis on politics and worldbuilding, particularly in the Wizengamot which is loosely based on 17th to 19th century English politics.

So, tldr Ron in my series is a main character similar to what you've described, but there also is stuff in my series that could be described as "Lord XYZ"

*** I guess i phrased it wrong; i meant one person holding 1890251 ancient titles.

Also, i know about your series and plan to read it, though only when i know it's complete. I started it some time ago and got tired of waiting for updates, so i just kind of wait.

** Fate by TheTrueSpartan - Really big on Character Development and has everything you mentioned and avoids all the stupid lord weasley stuff. The plot is great , though you'll have to power through at the middle portion for a chapter or two , has a hint of mystery and is absolutely huge at 93 chapter with 1.8 million words with the story in 3rd year right now. It's gets really interesting and really good by the current releases.
