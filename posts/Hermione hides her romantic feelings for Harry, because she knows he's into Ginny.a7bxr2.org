I think it's very possible that Hermione could have been in love with Harry but he never realised it, so I'm curious if there are fics like this. Ideally from her point of view, but not a requirement. It doesn't have to have end with Harmony, though it can.


** ...because she knows he's into /Luna./ (FTFY)

Think about it: it would make her internal drama so much more delicious: Hermione has to confront her unrequited love by realizing that Harry is falling for her polar opposite.

*** I feel bad saying this, because Luna's great. I can't picture Harry falling for her. There are certainly elements to their relationship that make them good together, but Harry never really seems to get her. He never gains an understanding of her passions and I feel like unless he did grow to understand, he'd never gain feelings for her. That's partially why Harry ending up with Hermione feels like the most natural and realistic of outcomes.

And that's why you have scenes like them laughing together in HBP over the thought of Filch and Pince having an affair. In DH, they end up sharing a couple of the most romantic moments of the series (Hermione beaming at Harry during the end of Bill and Fleur's wedding vows).

** Honestly what annoys me is the idea that Hermione is some kind of social guru. In the books, she immediately catches on to everybody's crushes. Her interactions with Ron often have a "I know we like each other but he's so immature vibe."

When in reality, Hermione is a big ole nerd! Her only friends are Ron and Harry! She doesn't have any giggling girlfriends, and there's no reason she should have any particular insight into teen romance.

If Hermione had been a Muggle, she'd be really into hentai and wouldn't date anybody until college.

*** Really? Hermione is by far the most well adjusted socially of the trio, at least by the time we get midway through the series. She basically coaches Harry through his short-lived date with Cho, and she has no problem recruiting, organizing, and helping to run a sizable student club (the DA). At the very least, that takes connections.

Like, she's no social butterfly, but if I had to put her as socially awkward or competent I'd go with the latter. "Not date anyone until college?" Did you somehow forget the Ball in 4th year? Where she dated probably the most famous Quidditch player of her time...?

Yeah, that's what I was complaining about, partly. It's an issue even in canon. Hermione is even less social than Harry and Ron- while their free time is spent on Quidditch and games, hers is in the library.

There's no way she should be able to effectively "coach" Harry on a date. My headcanon is that she took all her stuff from a YA romance series she once read.

As for the Ball... listen, Krum's a nice kid. But /he/ asked out /Hermione,/ they took a couple walks, had a nice night, and that was basically it. It was a nice short romance, but it does not make Hermione a master of the seductive arts.

We don't see her with friends. She has zero interest in guys (the Krum thing happened completely without her action, she thought he was just some weird guy hanging around)

Yes, there's the DA, but they just kind of... show up?

So what I'm saying is that canon has all these situations in which Hermione has all these socialite "effects," but the books never show anything leading up to that.

The DA is actually quite a good example. Until then, there had been zero mention of Hermione having contacts with other houses, and even less of them seeing her as a leader figure.

Yes, she has the highest grades in the school, but she is never shown being social with anyone but Ron and Harry.

She doesn't have friends, other than Ron and Harry (and they have some outside friends they do stuff with like games and Quidditch. Her spare time is in the library).

She, unlike Harry and Ron, has almost nothing in common with her dormmates.

She has no romantic experience beyond her fling with Krum. While that puts her ahead of Harry and Ron, it means she has very little experience with "high school romance"- flirting, crushes, dates, etc.

All in all, she does not have the social life of a "normal" Hogwarts teenager.

And yet, as you say- she gives dating advice, observes crushes, conjures up the DA, and so forth. THAT'S what I'm complaining about. (What I was complaining even more about was fics that take this tendency to the extreme- as [[/u/galathielaltheral]] said, giving her /~mysterious girl powers~/)

What part of that shouts "socially awkward nerdlinger" to you?

I could understand this argument that she "should be" socially deficient if you were applying it to Harry "Cupboard under the Stairs" Potter, but Hermione does not have that kind of freakishly horrific upbringing.

No wonder you dismiss every point in my favor I try to bring up: you are so attached to the idea that Hermione *must* be a socially awkward loser that you are deaf to evidence that shows otherwise. She has no dating experience if you ignore the existence of Krum. She has no points of interest with her classmates if you ignore the massive school club she recruited them all for.

******** There is quite a bit of evidence against Hermione as a social butterfly, even in her latter years.

First there is the entire failed SPEW campaign which is just incredibly awkward and shows that Hermione doesn't really know how to motivate people for something they don't already care about, or even recognize the fact that her campaigning has very little chance of success.

However, even more indicative is her treatment of Harry after the deaths of Cedric and Sirius. It's pretty clear that while she probably read up on the stages of grief, as well as general psychology somewhere, she also has no idea of how to actually connect with Harry and instead just keeps adding to his grief and unintentionally pushes him to avoid her.

I'm not saying she's socially inept, her social capabilities are far above the typical nerrrrd cliche, but she's definitely no social guru either.

Having one successful short relationship (which was initiated by the other party) does not turn someone into a relationship expert, and follow Hermione on the whole DA thing because they trust that when it comes to school stuff she knows what's she's talking about, not because of her charisma or large sphere of influence.

Failing to console someone after death hardly makes her a blithering social idiot. Trained psychologists have trouble with that at times. It's a pretty damned hard thing to do, doubly so if the one suffering is a moody teenager.

What the OP is claiming is that she is abnormally socially deficient. Here's a quote:

In these long comment chains it sometimes gets hard to tell what exactly a particular comment is arguing for because everything is a response to a response to a response to a response.

[[https://youtu.be/wfOHnt4PMFo][Here's a really neat talk from Professor Attwood]]

-Has primarily boy friends because they're easier to work out than girls.

-Has really socially inappropriate interaction skills without appreciating what it is she's doing that people don't like. (Trouble reading the subtle cues kids use to tell each other they're being weird or annoying)

-Tells people what they're doing wrong all the time / comes off bossy. (Aspies function by intellectually working out what they're 'supposed to do' and will inform other kids when they're doing it wrong, without understanding that the other kids know full well they're not ‘supposed to' and don't care.)

-Very intellectual but socially inept in early years. Through intellect and learned mimicry, is able to learn better social skills and appear generally normal in later years.

-Spends a ton of time/escapes to the library

-Reads to understand people

-Gets super into certain subjects or causes that other people don't get or care about.

Think of the DA. She knows who people are so she could invite them. However, it turned out that the only reason they turned up was to hear Harry. She just annoys people with SPEW. She doesn't hang out with anyone when Ron and Harry are mad at her. Her only other friend is Ron's sister, who she would have been thrown into close proximity with at the Burrow. (The DA feels connected, but they don't casually hang out.) She had no idea Krum kept popping up in the library when she was there and casting glances her way because he wanted to talk to her. Remember "why can't he read on his stupid ship?" She knows about the feelings shared with Ron, but their relationship becomes filled with anger and misunderstandings because they both handle it badly.

Hermione one of those people who give good advice because the know the logical and right thing to do, but is sense when it comes to themselves. Those people certainly exist.

** Like half of portkey? (The half that is not affair!fics or just not bothering to explain...)

It is pretty much the stock Harmony plot these days, at least those that attempt to not radically change the personalities. Hermione depicted as 'setting' for Ron due to Harry not showing interest, and Harry not persuing Hermione due to her and Ron apparently being interested in each other.

For a non-Harmony instance, it is strongly implied this is what was happening in Grains of Sand in the Hourglass, before Tonks took her timestream dive

*** Doesn't that author hint at a Harry/Hermione/Tonks pairing in the sequel they're planning?

**** Yep. If he ever breaks away from his incest fic to write a sequel. Hopefully eventually :)

****** He is a good enough writer that I read even the fics that would normally be an instant no. I have actually been enjoying his twinscest fic and his Joan of Arc fic. But I am waiting patiently for him to return to Does and friends anyway. (I normally am not interested in Haram or incest fics, but he writes them very well)

** Honestly, it is more plausible that it is the other way around and that while Hermione liked Harry and crushed on Ron, she knew Ginny crushed on Harry and Hermione and Ginny were noted to be particular friends, so if Hermione liked Harry romantically in any capacity, then if she hid her feelings from Harry it would have been to prevent ruining her friendship with Ginny, as well as Harry. Seriously, Hermione dating Harry could have lead to a Hermione losing Ginny as a friend and Harry losing Ron as a friend in sequence, and that rift could have lead to Harry and Hermione breaking up due to the stress, which would have lead to nobody being friends within that friend group.

I vaguely remember a fanfiction that had an alternate Hermione that overthinked most of the events in the book by making a "simulation" that was always wrong before showing the canon version of events, such as Harry falling off his broom after Draco stole Neville's Rememberal.

** I'm partway through reading Harry Potter and the Lady Thief, which seems to be headed in that direction. It's a great, long story, anyway. Hermione is framed, expelled from Hogwarts, and apprentices to Mundungus Fletcher to lead a life of crime.
