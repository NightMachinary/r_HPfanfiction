I've read many a fic that made me exhale happily through my nose because some mundane saying was appropriated into something more wizarding. Examples I've seen include:

#+begin_quote
  "as fast as wizardly possible"

  "the bludger is on your side of the pitch"
#+end_quote

I think colloquialisms in general are /stellar/. They're a staple of any language, showcasing the culture of the general public rather than a cut-and-dry, slow-changing official representation. They're a subtle form of worldbuilding, for sure, but attention to detail differentiates a good fic from a great one.

More than sayings, even, it could just be that maybe the culture of wizarding Britain dictated that the old "so mote it be" used to cinch serious deals and ritual spells over time became more casual until it took the form of a verbal-farewell-handshake or some such thing rather than the mundane 'God be with you' transitioning to 'goodbye' as we know it.

I know a few of you cringe at 'so mote it be', though. Do you have any neat examples or ideas of these? I'd love to hear them!

*** Oh, definitely. George R.R. Martin is a master of his craft in this regard. I think this might be why I like high fantasy as much as I do - there are so many ways for development to occur. Some read for character development, some for plot, and others to experience the myriad of lore information.

As there are obviously a lot of things that vary between cultures, it's also interesting to slip between the lines there and see similarities instead. We all grow from one place. /It's all just so cool./

*** Great post. Though I'd like to add that the wizarding world isn't completely separate from the muggle, mostly due to the influx of muggleborn. So while there would be significant differences we should also expect a few newer muggle sayings to have slipped in occasionally or at least have been appropriated or merely understood if not actually used.

#+end_quote

I agree, but I think the number would be pretty small. There is significant discrimination against things that are "Muggle" and this is reflected in the political and economic institutions of Wizarding Britain.

If Rowling was a linguist (which she clearly isn't lol but if she was) then we'd expect to see Pureblodd speech diverge significantly from Muggle speech. Additionally, most Muggleborns would end up becoming bilingual between "Muggle speech" and "Wizard Speech", as the inability to speak "Wizard Speech" would signal that someone was overly Muggle.

This is what happens pretty much anytime there is institutional discrimination or significant economic power behind a small subset of a culture, from black people in the US (African American English vs Standard English), to the Chinese Languages (Wu vs Mandarin), to Swahili (Kenyan Swahili vs Tanzanian Swahili). This is one of the key reasons prejudice is so hard to overcome; people literally speak a different language than their oppressors.

Obviously Rowling didn't want this to happen (a combination of wanting the Wizarding World to feel familiar, her not deciding blood purism would be significant until later on in the series, a lack of linguistic knowledge, and simply because it would overcomplicate the plot), but in doing so she sacrifices a significant amount of realism. But hey, it's a young adult story about magic wands lol. Realism can be sacrificed.

And here are some I'm sure I've seen in fics or else am just making up:

-Boy who cried werewolf

-Beating a dead hippogriff

-It's all Mermish/Gobbledegook to me

-Taste of your own potion

-A Nundu can't change his spots

-A drop in the cauldron

-He's got his wand up his arse

-Falling arse over wand

-Falling arse over cauldron

-Don't count your dragons before they're hatched

-The quill is mightier than the wand

-Gringotts wasn't built in a day

-Dung-for-brains

-Wear your heart on your robes

*** I kind of disagree. The reason so many people use blatant reworks of muggle idioms is because JK Rowling does that a ton in canon. It's part of the humor and whimsy of the series- we get the references, and they are made glaringly apparent by their differences to what we expect, which makes us realize how strange the idioms we use really are.

Plus the origins of many English idioms are so old that it is plausible they would share a common ancestor with the wizarding versions, before the Statute of Secrecy.

*** Agreed. Wizards wouldn't be taking the muggle version and adapting it to themselves, I wouldn't think. They'd create and develop their own over time. Just like some English phrases don't make sense to non-native speakers. In my college Spanish class we discussed this and it was mentioned that something as simple as "I'll pick you up at five." just doesn't translate to Spanish if you do a literal translation. My teacher was from Spain and he said you would be telling someone that you would /physically/ pick someone up at five, because English has more than one meaning for "pick up" and Spanish does not. And there were examples that went the other way around, Spanish phrases that did not have an exact English translation.

So why wouldn't there be things like that with wizards?

Like wizards know what cats are. If they still say "the cats out of the bag" that indicates that this idiom has been passed down for hundreds of years.
