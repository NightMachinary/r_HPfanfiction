** I don't generally like Draco, but he can sometimes be written as a fun character. Like in linkffn(7659033)

Just noticed the summary says nothing about the story, lol. This a slytherin!Harry story - the second best of the bunch (the first being On The Way To Greatness). Very good characterization.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

** You could try the Cunning and Ambition series. The author wrote a story for every school year but abandoned the series in year 6.

It features Slytherin!Harry, some Snape mentoring and the new trio includes Draco. I don't remember if I read the entire series but I read the first story and I remember the plot was almost a straight canon retell. But if you want a canon retell with Draco as part of the trio instead of Ron, then this is for you. Also, I believe the later stories will feature slash but there's definitely no slash whatsoever in the first story if you're curious about the story but slash isn't your thing.

  One small gesture and one simple sentence change lives, and through it, history. A Slytherin!Harry AU.

Another series you could try is the Leo Inter Serpentes series.

This one is similar to Cunning and Ambition where it is a canon rewrite with Slytherin!Harry, some Snape mentoring and Draco is part of the trio but this series is slightly more original than Cunning and Ambition. Leo Inter Serpentes' plot heavily follows the events of canon BUT some things play out a bit differently than in the book. This isn't true all of the time though, as events play out much more differently in some stories than others. This is also abandoned after the 5th year. Harry and Draco have a relationship by the 4th book.

  Just one conversation between two eleven year old boys goes slightly differently, and the world changes. Just how much will be different with Harry being sorted into Slytherin, and how much will stay the same?

** This is the only one I can think of off the top of my head, but HPMOR seems to fit most of your criteria.

If you aren't familiar with it, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) is a pretty well known fic where Harry's Aunt married a biochemist instead of Vernon and so Harry was raised as a scientist. Harry is friends with Draco and Hermione (with H and D having a rivalry/friendship going on) and there's no yaoi except for jokes that others make about them. Harry's not really dark but not really good either, I'd say he's Chaotic Neutral. The universe in general was also changed a bit and more explanation is given to a lot of background elements.

If you ask around here, you'll get some people who love it (me) and some who hate it with a passion.

The only criteria it doesn't meet is that Harry is the obvious main focus (not sure if that's an issue) and it not taking place from years 1-7, but it is a complete story and has a good length. There are a few unofficial sequels to it and Significant Digits is the best imo and even surpasses HPMOR as a serious story.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
