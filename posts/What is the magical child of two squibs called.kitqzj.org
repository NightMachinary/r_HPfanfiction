The magical child of two muggles is a muggleborn. The child of two muggleborns is a half-blood. The child of a half blood and a muggleborn is a half blood. A child of pureblood and a muggleborn is a half blood. A child of two half bloods is a pureblood. A child of a half blood and a pureblood is a pureblood. A child of two purebloods is a pureblood. So what is the magical child of two squibs called? A muggleborn, a half blood or a pureblood.


** I don't think it's canon, but I've seen it being based on grandparents: if you have any magical grandparents you're a half-blood, and if you have at least 3 (?) magical grandparents you're a pureblood.

*** There's some disagreement between different institutions and nations about the strictness of the definition in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series. Particularly in the fourth book, where the "True Triwizard Tournament" is turned into a blood status competition, and they have to choose a particular definition for categorising the champions.

(Harry herself is half-blood by all regular definitions, but no-one can know that.)

To be honest I think they see squibs even worse. The Weasleys - who are open about muggels more than any other pureblood family - still don't talk about their squib cousin with exception from one mentioning at the Hogwarts train in year one. The ministry doesn't know anything about Arabella Figg - or squibs in general - they don't even know if they can see dementors.

*** Well, you've got to have two sets of magical grandparents and two sets of magical parents to be seen as a pureblood.

To be seen as a half-blood, you have to have one magical parent and one non-magical or Muggleborn parent. Meaning, you've got to have at least one magical grandparent and one magical parent to be seen as a half-blood, the rest can be Muggles.

A Squib's parents must be comprised of at least one magical parent. Meaning, a Muggleborn and a Muggle, a Muggleborn and a Muggleborn, a half-blood and a Muggle, a half-blood and a Muggleborn, a half-blood and a half-blood, a half-blood and a pureblood, a pureblood and a Muggle, a pureblood and a Muggleborn, and a pureblood and a pureblood could have a Squib child.

Now, a Squib is the opposite of a Muggleborn. A Muggleborn is a magical child born into a nonmagical family (with no magical grandparents on either family side) while a Squib is a nonmagical person with at least one magical parent.

So, two Squibs having a magical child would mean that the magical child has at least two magical grandparents. As I said before, a half-blood is a person with one magical parent and one non-magical or Muggleparent. That means that the half-blood would have either three magical grandparents, two magical grandparents, or one magical grandparent. The Squib's magical child would have either four magical grandparents, three magical grandparents, two magical grandparents, or one magical grandparent. So while their parents aren't magical, their grandparents are, making them a half-blood.

The four magical grandparents would be if the Squib's parents are two purebloods or a pureblood and a half-blood (with a wizard and muggleborn parent), the three grandparents would be if the Squib's parents are a half-blood (

Squibs are actually seen as lower than Muggleborns since they don't have any magic of their own, but it really depends on the person. The Weasleys, seen as "blood traitors" because they like Muggles and Muggleborn and see nothing wrong with including them into their world, are at least slightly prejudiced against Squibs.

#+begin_quote
  "Are all your family wizards?"

  "Er---yes, I think so. I think Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him."
#+end_quote

While it's not explicitly said that Molly's second cousin is a Squib, it can be surmised that he probably is. Ron says that he /thinks/ all of his family are wizards, but he doesn't actually know whether or not his mother's cousin is a wizard since they never talk about it.

Many old pureblood families remove Squibs from their families, while others send them to nonmagical school, so the prejudice varies from person to person.

**** A longwinded and comprehensive explanation... i've yet to see this many repetitions of the word grandparent.

But i see your game and call you the next one. So it technically could be possible that though squibs arent looked over by the Ministry of Magic, they could be looked after by themselves. It'd theoretically possible that a squib might want to marry another squib,because their cultural experience is the same.

And we don't actually know how many squibs are born in the halfblood families around the world, we know that purebloods don't have too many of them, but there might be quite a few faintly magical people walking around.

What i'm getting as is lets say that two sets of pureblood squibs get hitched and have babies.

It's possible for these two new children to be magical, but dang luck squibs again, and then they grow up to have a child together. Who turns out to be magical!

So you could have two sets of squibs behind you.

And what i'm thinking about is this, lets say this two squib generation before her witch, goes before Umbridge to defend her blood status. Wwwhat is she?

Her parents are squibs, her grandparents are squibs, her great grandparents were purebloods.

If we go by pureblood logic she's an mudblood abomination. But if we go by normal wizard logic...

She's not halfblood. There isnt an ounce of muggle blood in her. But would she still officially be mugblooded?

Someone with four pureblood grabdparents might argue they're a pureblood even though squib born.

But could our hypothetical witch argue the same?

***** So you said that two Squibs get together an have a nonmagical child. I would call that child a Muggle. And then there are two other sets of Squib parents that also have a nonmagical child, another Muggle. And then you said those two Muggle children get together and have their own child, but this time, that child is magical. I would say that since there are three generations of no magic, that that child would be a Muggleborn.

However, if even one of that child's grandparents (the original set of Squibs) happened to be a Muggleborn, half-blood, or Pureblood, I would call them a half-blood.

A "Muggleborn" is merely a magical child born to nonmagical people. That's what Muggles are. Nonmagical people. A Squib is a nonmagical person born to a magical person or family. They are, for all intents and purposes, a Muggle.

Now let's say that first-generation Muggle marries another Muggle. This Muggle has Muggle parents and Muggle grandparents. They are not a Squib. Now, these two Squibs have children. Their children would either be a Muggle or a half-blood.

Now, I say a half-blood because while their child's parents don't have magic, at least one of their grandparents did.

****** Mmhmm.

But then, is there a clear divide between muggle and squib?

A muggle is nonmagical yes, they can't see hogwarts, nor dementors, nor leaky cauldron. Are born to nonmagical parents most cases.

Petunia weasley is a muggle by all deffinitions. So were her parents.

Mrs. Figg tells us that she's not any moragical than a teabag.

Yet Filch, a squib, interacts with poltergheists and ghosts, deals with magical messes all the time, presumable can see the dementors around hogwarts?

He's not 100% non magical, taken that he is in hogwarts and deals with magic every day.

So my question is: is there some magical difference between a squib and a muggle, other than their blood heritage?

I'd argue magical ability is more of a sliding scale. From Filch to Neville to Dumbledor for example.

You could have squibs that see the leaky caldron for example. Or the potter menorial in godricks hollow, yet be unable to cast a spell with a wand no mater how they tried.

To me a squib is born of magical ancestry, and grown up in said culture too. They have knowlege of owlpost for example, and the Ministry, without need or ability to participate in much of it.

Whereas muggle is a nonmagical person, born of a nonmagical heritage, participating in the muggle world, without any knowlege of anything magical.

** I think Hermione mentioned above is right. Just forget it.

First, all those definitions are uncertain: there are those who agree with you on the definition of pureblood, but for some there must be couple of generations of wizards to get a pureblood child, or perhaps purebloods are like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred][thoroughbreds]], where a child has to have only pureblood ancestors to be pureblood.

** This depends entirely on whether the child is magical or not. Squib is quite unlike the word muggleborn because it doesn't imply blood status other than the fact that the squib was born to at least 1 magical parent.

If the squib-child is magical and has 4 muggleborn grandparents, and two half-blood squibs for parents, the child is technically a pure blood already.

If the squib-child isn't magical it is a second generation squib, and I don't know whether they are even allowed to be in the know about magic.

It could be entirely fanon, but I always got the impression that magic was a dominant gene. That it's supposed to resurface.

Edit: no matter what they are called, even if they have magic they will probably be treated as lepers because the idea of spawning with someone that might not produce magical children seems to be the very worst within the Harry Potter universe.

** Actually, according to JK, depends on your parents and grandparents. If more than half of them are Muggles, you're Muggleborn. If it's less than half, you're halfblood. If all of them are wizards, you're pureblood.

** Well, you've got to have two sets of magical grandparents and two sets of magical parents to be seen as a pureblood.

To be seen as a half-blood, you have to have one magical parent and one non-magical or Muggleborn parent. Meaning, you've got to have at least one magical grandparent and one magical parent to be seen as a half-blood, the rest can be Muggles.

A Squib's parents must be comprised of at least one magical parent. Meaning, a Muggleborn and a Muggle, a Muggleborn and a Muggleborn, a half-blood and a Muggle, a half-blood and a Muggleborn, a half-blood and a half-blood, a half-blood and a pureblood, a pureblood and a Muggle, a pureblood and a Muggleborn, and a pureblood and a pureblood could have a Squib child.

Now, a Squib is the opposite of a Muggleborn. A Muggleborn is a magical child born into a nonmagical family (with no magical grandparents on either family side) while a Squib is a nonmagical person with at least one magical parent.

So, two Squibs having a magical child would mean that the magical child has at least two magical grandparents. As I said before, a half-blood is a person with one magical parent and one non-magical or Muggleparent. That means that the half-blood would have either three magical grandparents, two magical grandparents, or one magical grandparent. The Squib's magical child would have either four magical grandparents, three magical grandparents, two magical grandparents, or one magical grandparent.

So while their parents aren't magical, their grandparents are, making them a half-blood.

** I don't know if my information is completely accurate but,

Blood status is dependent on the grandparents rather than parents, so if you have one of maternal and paternal grandparents that is magical you are a pureblood if your parents are magical too, harry is half-blood but his kids would be pureblood if the mother was Ginny who is a pureblood, or if the mother was Hermione (like many of us hoped) they will be half-blood. Now if the parents were squib then the child would be pureblood too, because squibs, while not wizard or witch can see and feel magic.

** Considering those labels are almost exclusively used by purebloods to undermine non-purebloods, I'd imagine the magical child of two squibs would be called a squib as an insult. They don't really fit into any category, and I think people who care about blood purity would be surprised that two squibs could have a magical child, so the child would be as marginalised as a muggleborn.

** Typically half-blood if one of the squibs has muggle parentage or grand-parentage, since muggleborn technically only applies to those of muggle parentage on both sides. Squibs are non-magical, but they're not /technically/ muggles. However, if the squib parents were both purebloods with no muggle in their (traceable) family tree, technically the magical child would be a pureblood, too. /Technically/.

However, they'd probably be the type of half-bloods that'd be looked down on by those who believe in blood purism as shit on said purists' shoes, basically. And pureblood-from-squibs? Probably would depend on social class, et cetera.

** The magical child of two squibs is a squiblet. The squib child of a pair of squiblets is a squab. Squab is also the culinary term for the meat of a young pigeon. Therefore, squiblets should not squab unless they are cannibals.

** As I always thought of it. You look at the 6 people ahead of you in the tree. 2 parents+4 grandparents. If all of them are not non magical (I.e squibs or wizards/witches) you are a pure blood. If all of em are muggles you are muggleborn. Maybe if only one grandparent is a squab youre still muggleborn, all in between is a half blood.

I do think squibs are more than muggles born to wizards. They can see hogwarts, floo, brew basic potions..

So they have a little magic which they might pass on. A squib can give birth to a wizard, to another squib or to a full muggle
