  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

  If this were a detective story, Ginny would write it up with the title "The Adventure of the Quidditch Player". Harry says that's a stupidly generic title for a detective story.

**** I've read The Aurors and Strangers at Drakeshaugh and can vouch that both are fantastically written.

The Aurors was actually just updated a little while ago, although I feel like its more based on Harry being an auror.

Strangers is really good, its more of Harry and Ginny's life from an outsider's perspective of their new muffle neighbors.

All of Northumbrian's works are actually one giant post-war canon compliant story. If you check out his profile you can find them. They range from directly after the battle to when their children are all in Hogwarts. I've read them all multiple times and cannot recommend them enough, they're basically the go to post-war fics to read.

Can't agree any more with this. Northumbrian is what got me into fanfiction, and the Ginny/Harry relationship is developed well in Northumbrian's universe.

As always, I strongly recommend my favorite one shot of all time: linkffn(The Mind of Arthur Weasley)

** I'm in the long process of reading pretty much any Harry/Ginny post war fic that is generally canon compliant and at least 60k words. So far I've read 40 fics. Some are your typical, grieve after the battle but then they get together and live life, some are "they break up but then get back together a while later."

The funny thing is after reading 40 so far, the two best are still little0bird and northumbrian, which are the first two authors I read. Now if northumbrian would just complete all his longer stories...

I'll post as soon as I'm done.
