Hi! I'm looking for any fanfic that has the same concept as The Darkness Within Trilogy by Kurinoone([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within]]). Looking for a dark and powerful Harry. He doesn't have to turn to the light though. Thanks in advance!


** I can point you to the original fic from which Kurinoone got the idea. It is called 'A Shattered Prophecy'.

Warning: it has been a while, so if I remember correctly, it is worse than 'The Darkness Within'. It is also unbetaed and riddled with mistakes. However, the author has great ideas - plus as I said, the concept is actually his/hers.

  A twist of Fate... an opened window... a cradle robbed... two frantic parents... a lost hope, along with a shattered Prophecy. Moved to 'M' for future violence. Extending take down until July 1, 2012, so I have time respond to everyone and its gives people time to finish reading.

*** Yea I read this fic originally. It had a lot of mistakes within it, but I was looking for a different series that would be similar.

  What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? A Dark Harry fanfic. AU Mild HG

** I haven't read this because I saw it was being rewritten. Is the whole series being redone or only the first book?

*** I'm not sure, but the first book is being redone, but I think she might redo the entire series. Not sure....
