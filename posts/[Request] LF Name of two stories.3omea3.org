Hey! Basically, I've decided to start reading through some Lily and James fanfiction again after a long break from Harry Potter. Only problem is I can't remember two of the names!!

I'm sorry for not being able to supply more information but I remember a little detail that maybe stands out a bit.

The first one involved an attack on a first year girl by Narcissa Black as part of "proving herself" to the Death Eaters at Hogwarts. Lily and James find the girl confused and not knowing what happened and they take her to the hospital wing.

Narcissa is then forced to kill the girl when Dumbledore begins to try and break through the memory charm. The end of the chapter where the girl dies is basically how she is afraid in the hospital wing and as the clock finishs chiming, there was only silence there.

The second, the only thing I remember is that Lily and James attend Petunia's wedding towards the end of the fic and decide to get married at midnight that night.
