I have way to much to do irl, but also, I'm a procrastinator when it comes to my schooling. Which means that I actually have way too much free time to write. I do prefer to only write MxM pairings, but that doesn't mean I don't sometimes dabble in hetero or lesbian pairings (or things in between). What are some stories /plots/any kind of thing that you want to see in a fic?


** I really like courtship stories. The kind where there are several people courting a person and it's sort of like The Bachelor.
