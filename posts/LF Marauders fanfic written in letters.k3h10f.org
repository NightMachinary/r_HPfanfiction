In it, they discuss music and pranks. Peter is not a coward but a regular boy, and I seem to recall a Boggart!Sirius in a nonletter bit. In it, Remus goes into a cellar and discovers Sirius (or thinks he does until he realizes its a boggart, and I think he remembers the letters or something?

In one of the letters Sirius jokes that he wrote in a mistake just to give Remus something to do, and later they all meet at Remus' house, and maybe Peter's as well? They also write to him about the music James' dad likes, which apparently is a lot like Remus' taste.
