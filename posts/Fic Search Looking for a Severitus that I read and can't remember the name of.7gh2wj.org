It's set pre-Hogwarts, and I think Harry is around four or five. Severus becomes Harry's guardian for some reason, and he finds out very quickly that Harry was abused. Later on, Severus finds out that Harry hasn't been sleeping in his bed. (He was sleeping in the wardrobe?)

Severus shows Harry his potion cupboard and offers to let him sleep there. (He emphasizes "cold, dark cupboard" and "warm comfy bed".) Severus does this as a test of sorts, and he wants Harry to make the right choice, which is the bed. Harry chooses the bed which makes Severus really happy. That's all I can remember from the story. Please tell me if this sounds familiar!

  When Harry is taken from the Dursleys by Child Protective Services, Snape is sent to adopt him. Mentions of abuse, but no details. No slash.

**** All right. Details I can remember are:

This was set at Hogwarts, Snape's chambers, where he had a potion's cupboard. I'm fairly sure at one point in time Harry sleeps in the cupboard under a shelf and hits his head, and Snape starts becoming more and more devious about getting him to not sleep in there because he's afraid that some potion might break over Harry.

He also used to sleep on the couch before Snape made a room for him. Pretty sure.

Now I'm gonna search my bookmarks. I'm fairly sure I've got this one, but I need to figure out which Severitus it is.

EDIT:

I went through all my bookmarks for Fanfiction.net and even potionsandsnitches. Don't have it bookmarked anywhere. Very frustrating, wish I could remember more to it than just a Severitus fic. But I know for sure that it is complete, because I rarely read a fic that isn't complete. If I do stumble across, I'll post it, but I think I've got to give up. Sorry.

** I only know of one fic that follows the pre-hogwarts severitus trope, but I never finished reading it so no idea if it's the one you're looking for.

  Mrs Figg has enough. 7-year-old Harry Potter cannot stay with the Dursleys any more. Severus Snape thinks everyone is better suited to raise the future Saviour of the Wizarding World. Harry dreams of being taken away by a tall man who scares even Dudley.
