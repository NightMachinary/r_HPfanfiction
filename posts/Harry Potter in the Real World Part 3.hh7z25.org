“Is everything alright I heard a crash,” asked Hermione coming out of my room with the family in tow.

“Yeah, everything is alright, your buddy Luscious here decided to pay us a visit,” I said grabbing a chair then turning to Katy, “Katy, can you go to the garage and get me a rope and some duct tape.”

“Sure,” Katy said running to the garage.

I grabbed Luscios's body and put him on the chair and Katy came back with the rope and duct tape. Tying the body against the chair and gagging the mouth, Arthur came up to me.

“Excuse me sir, but what are you doing?” he asked.

“You guys want to know why you are here, well we can get answers from him,” I replied.

“What if he escapes?” asked Harry.

“He won't trust me on it,” I said. I went to the garage to get a blow torch and when I came back,

I woke Luscious up by taking the duct tape off of his mouth. “Wakey, wakey bitch.”

“What, what happened?” Mr. Malfoy said.

“Well let us just say that we are going to play a game. I see you like tattoos, judging from the dark mark. Well, here is the game, for every question I asked, if you answer wrong, you will be cooked a bit. If you answer correctly, I will let you go. Easy as that. Deal?” I said as I was sitting on the chair opposite him.

“You think I will tell you anything muggle. I am not afraid of you. You hear, all of you will be dead!” yelled Mr. Malfoy.

“I was afraid you would say something like that,” I said lighting the blowtorch, “Let me be honest here Mr. Malfoy, unlike a rich snob like you, I have been through hell. I risk my life during the Gulf Wars back in the 90s. I have seen friends getting shot, blown up, stab, and killed. I have seen some of my brothers' upper torso. Most of them crying out for their mother and father, lying there bleeding out to death. The war changed me and trust me, you never want to go up against a United States Marine, especially a veteran. So I am going to ask you this, why are you guys here. What are you guys planning to do?

“You think what you said will scare me, you, muggles are all the same. I am not afraid of you guys. I have friends in high places. I will not tell you anything.” said Mr. Malfoy.

“Well then, I did warn you,” I said calmly.

I went up to Mr. Malfoy with the blowtorch lit and put it between his legs. Mr. Malfoy let out a scream of pain.

“You ready to talk?” I asked.

“Fuck you,” Mr. Malfoy said.

“Suit yourself,” I said placing the blowtorch towards his stomach. He screams again trying to look away.

“Enough Donnie, you are hurting him!” yelled Harry walking towards me while step away from Mr. Malfoy, “there is got be another way."

“There is no other way, Harry. If you want the answer, you have to get it from him one way or another,” I explain.

“But not like this Donnie. If you are doing this then you are no better then him,” explained Harry.

“Look, Harry, I know you and your friends dealt with them more times in your world. But the rules are different here. There is no magic. The magic in you guys is draining and the longer you stay here the more you become nonmagical.”

“That is not true,” said Ginny, “Look, /wingardium leviosa./” She was pointing at the couch with her wand, but nothing happened. “What, what is going on?” Ginny asked terrified.

“As I said, magic is draining from you guys. If it happened to Mr. Malfoy here, then it probably happened to Voldemort. But you are right, we are not going anywhere with torturing Mr. Malfoy here.” I said walking to a drawer near my TV. I pulled out a handgun. I pointed the gun to Mr. Malfoy's head, “I know you have a kid and a wife back home Mr. Malfoy, so I am going to ask you one more time and if you don't answer me, I will introduce you to the magic of gunpowder and it ain't pretty.” I threaten.

“Fine, I will tell you. The dark lord has come here, to this world to find immortality. He heard about the legend of the fountain of youth. He heard that if you drink from it, he will become invincible and young.” said Mr. Malfoy.

I dropped my gun in a moment of shock. “Donny, are you good?” asked Katy.

“This can't be happening,” I said to myself stumbling backward.

“Donny, what happened?” asked Katy coming up towards me.

“We need to get going now,” I said trying to get to my room to pack.

“Donny Maricino, what the hell is going on?” demanded Katy.

“Voldemort came to this world in search of the fountain of youth. If he drinks from that...”

“He will live forever,” said Hermione.

“Exactly, which is why we need to start packing now, Florida is three-day travel from here,” I explained.

I went into my room and started packing Katie's and mine clothes in a suitcase. I also packed my shotgun, my rifle, and my knife. Harry, Hermione, and the Weasley's also got ready.

“Hey, Katy can you take them to the car. I will be out in a minute?” I asked.

“Sure,” Katie said taking the family to the car.

I walk towards to Mr. Malfoy with a kitchen knife.

“I did promise I won't kill you and I am a man who keeps his promise,” I said placing the knife across him, “So I am going to give you a choice of escape. Once I leave, you can try and grab the knife and cut the rope. After that, you can do whatever the fuck you want to do, but I warn you this, if you and I ever cross again, I won't hesitate to kill you.” I said.

I left the house and went inside the car and drove off to a dangerous journey.
