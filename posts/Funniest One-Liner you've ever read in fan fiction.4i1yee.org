Mine was Harry saying "Why don't you go and wank off over a report about cauldron bottoms or something?" to Percy.

After being accused of being a parseltongue

"I'm not a parseltongue. I'm a parselmouth. The language I can speak and understand is parseltongue. And if you've ever seen an anaconda you can understand why I sometimes get called a parselcrotch."

A Black Comedy is filled with great dialogue and one liners.

** Not a one liner but this one made me laugh and sorta stuck in my head:

Harry reached his son and dragged him to the nearest open door, but little Albus whirled around before they reached it and looked at him expectantly.

"Dad?" he asked. "What if I am in Hufflepuff?"

"Albus Severus Aberforth Sirius Godric Dudley," Harry said quietly, so that nobody else could hear them. "You were named after a bunch of guys I once knew, of whom no one was ever in Hufflepuff, but whose names, once combined and given to a single person, give reason enough to commit suicide."

His son looked at him rather agitated.

"Well..." Harry said, clearing his throat, "One of them was a really great man who loved my mom so much I can't even describe it with words. They just don't do it justice, you know? He gave everything for her. He lived and ultimately died for her. She was his reason to breath."

"That sounds like true love," said the little boy impressed.

"Yes," answered Harry. "Yes, it really was. Much more than what your mom and I share, which is really nothing more than sexual tension. Now that I think about it, that seems to be the foundation of every relationship I've seen in my life. Makes me wonder about my parents, too. We live in a strange world, son."

Harry was silent for a moment, deep in thought, not noticing the reaction of his youngest son.

"Let me tell you something life taught me: when you finally get to know some girls, the one you share everything with; you have that special connection, that deep inseparable bond with; the one you care about most and the one who's always there for you, never leaving your side -- she'll be like a sister to you. The one you want to have sex with -- that will be your wife. So, don't listen to your heart, my son, but always listen to that little chestburster of yours."

His son, completely deranged by now, started crying.

"Well, let's just get on the train then, shall we?" said Harry and hastily scurried his son towards the door, closing it behind him.

  19 years after Hogwarts, the world is perfect. The only selfish, power-crazed person that ever existed was defeated, all the deaths the whole affair brought about quickly forgotten and the happy, naturally developed couples were eager to get started on making babies and giving them awful names.

**** This means war.

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/1__Surprise_Snog/reviews/]]

It's a fic where Ginny figures out that harry doesn't have a normal wizard's view of what's possible with magic or not and so (with the right encouragement) can do pretty much anything. Harry becomes hilariously op in short order. I followed to the end because of a nice device the author used which allowed wizards and witches to mmail (email).

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

Albus turned to Harry. “That's true. I gave up trying to tell her what to do in the sixties. Things were much calmer around here after that.”

“Sir, there was a /war/,” Harry reminded.

“I think you underestimate how much misery an unhappy witch can cause.”

** My alltime favourite has to be from Coldmirror's HP parody series (not exactly fanfiction, but close enough).

Remember the scene from the first movie (I assume it was also in the books, but who knows), Harry wakes up in the hospital wing after the fight with Quirrelmort, and soon after Dumbledore comes in? He explains why it was so painful for Quirrel to touch him, it was because he was marked, not by the scar, but a greater force that marked him all over, deep into his skin. Harry asks what this force was, which Dumbledore answers with the short answer of “Love Harry. Love.“

Well, coldmirror kept the exact quote, but had changed the context so much, it suddenly had a very different meaning:

Harry wakes up, Dumbledore comes in, steals all his candy, sits down on the side of the bed, congratulates Harry for an awesome battle and comes closer and closer. Harry simply says “that's fine and all, but could you please take your hand off my knee, that's sexual harassmemt.“\\
Dumbledore: “Oh Harry, if I received a sickle everytime someone said this to me, I'd be rich by now.“\\
Harry, now audibly nervous: “w-what do you want sir?“\\
Dumbledore leans in really closely: “Love Harry. Love.“

** Not a one liner, but I enjoyed this exchange:

'Does your father allow you to speak like that?/If I were your father I wouldn't let you speak like that to a teacher' (can't remember the exact wording)

'If you were my father, I wouldn't piss in your pumpkin juice, I'd poison it!'

'If you were my son, I'd drink it.'

For context, it's from some fanfic where Sirius goes forward in time after the veil incident, and the kid is Teddy (but neither of them know)...I think the author said they adapted the exchange from some movie or other book.
