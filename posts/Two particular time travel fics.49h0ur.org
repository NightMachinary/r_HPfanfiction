In the first one is James/Hermione. Harry dies in Godric's Hollow and Hermione in a panic accidentally travesl back to Halloween 1981. She ends up saving James but not Lily. I think she swears an unbreakable vow to Sirius that she will protect Harry with her life.

The other Harry and Ginny travel back to 1980ish. I don't remember that much about this one. I think Regulus is still alive and Sirius's mom is not actually a crazy racist but Bellatrix starts to poison her.


** The first one is linkffn(storm of yesterday by shayalonnie) like 99.9% sure.

  Hunted by Voldemort, Hermione and Harry make a last stand in Godric's Hollow. When the Boy-Who-Lived lives no more, Hermione is thrown back in time into another battle where she has a chance to save not only Harry, but another Potter. --- Begins Mid Deathly Hallows, AU going forward. Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. (James/Hermione) *Art by colour me luna*

**** I really did too, I waited until it was all posted before going and reading it (while trying to dodge spoilers on Tumblr since I follow here LOL). Definitely had some emotional moments, but totally worth the ride.
