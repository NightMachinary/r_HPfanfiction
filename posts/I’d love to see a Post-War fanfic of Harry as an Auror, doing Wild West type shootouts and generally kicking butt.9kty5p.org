As the title says, a badass Harry doing cool shit as basically the special forces of the wizarding world. It's an interesting concept and one that I haven't seen very much of outside of perhaps a few one-shots. Also relating to a post made earlier today, Harry could totally have a rocking beard.


** Harry is a very impressive auror in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097). He (and Ron) already won multiple shootouts with criminals, rioters, and surviving Death Eaters; but he had yet to face his greatest challenge. The latest chapter showed his awesome deductive reasoning skill.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
