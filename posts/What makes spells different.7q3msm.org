Lets assume that the amount of knowledge available to wizards gets normalized. Now every magical has the exact same level of knowledge than everyone else, they all know the exact same magics (and they are all willing to use all of their spells available, so no dark and light morals). What makes them different? More powerful? If in this case, Voldemort fights Ron Weasley, would they have an even chance to win?

Or in a different scenario, if everyone knows the same as everyone else, would there be any differences regarding spell power? If they used, lets say bombarda on a wall, are the effects the same? (Assuming no spell core shenaningans)

Short version:

If you gave everyone the same knowledge it would close the "magic gap" significantly but would not result in homogeneity. For that you would have to:

1. Have everyone not only possess the knowledge but understand it at an intuitive level.

2. Also homogenise all the other personal traits which impact magical performance: instincts, insight, willpower, emotional control, focus, confidence, intelligence, mindset/world view, beliefs and magical philosophy, values, preferences, social position, etc. Basically your entire identity as a person/character.

** So if they all possess the knowledge of every spell and let´s say that equates to proficiency in every known spell, and magic in general, there wouldn´t be power difference, then every fight will be decided by non-magical skills, physical fitness, strategic capabilities, instinct, battle experience, maybe creative application of spells. In that scenario, I´d argue Voldemort would win, but it wouldn´t be easy, heck let´s say this change happened suddenly and they fight, and let´s say it´s book 7 Ron is experienced in fighting opponents that can easily outmatch in raw skill, because most of his enemies are twice his age, if you then pit him against someone, that for decades just overpowered his enemies, who only had one opponent strong enough to stand against him, someone for whom most battles are just a formality, no matter how smart or gifted as duelist, if they´re barely utilized they deteriorate and he could probably be caught off guard and killed. Long story short under this circumstances Ron has a shot.

*** Canon has no objective way of measure said difference in power, right? No way to know how many Ron Weasleys equals one Voldemort.

**** Well let´s say Ron is capable of casting Avada Kedavra, considering he is on about Harry´s level, this wouldn´t be that farfetched, you probably need only a dozen or so, 11 to suicide rush one to hide and strike, when Voldemort is occupied with killing the rest. But again that logic is a bit flawed, because you cannot say how many Ron´s you need for certain, can Voldemort effectively keep track of 12 Ron´s to not let himself be ambushed? What are the battlefield conditions, is there are proper way to hide out of sight(for simplicity´s sake Nagini is not with him and he can´t call in reinforcements), is a number of Ron´s necessary to set up an ambush already big enough that they would win in a direct battle and Voldemort would just flee, provided he can flee. What if he can´t flee, let´s say apparition is blocked and him flying is impractical, because they´re trapped in a room, what is if he cannot flee because of an unbreakable vow that forces him to fight, how lenient is it, can he just kill a few and rest for a day or so and then go at it again, or does he have to singlemindedly fight them until either he or the Ron´s are dead? Let´s say the former is the case, could it be that He might get careless after the 300th or so Ron and get´s hit, by a Ron that adapted a strategy preying on eventual carelessness, or is Ron´s win condition that Voldemort eventually dies of old age? Or does he have to fight non-stop until the Ron´s are dead? Let´s say that Ron can´t touch him at all no matter how many are fighting against Voldemort, how many Ron´s would be necessary to stall him until Voldemort dies of thirst, if he can die of thirst, then measure this you need to know how many Ron´s a minute Voldemort can kill. Then there´s time travel, what is if Ron, went back in time at what age would Riddle be to strong for him to handle, or to battle savvy to get killed in an ambush, does Ron need to wait until he calls himself Voldemort, that we can accurately say how many Ron´s are enough to kill him, or how long does Ron need to train and study Voldemort´s way of fighting, can Ron in his lifetime accumulate enough skill and knowledge to beat Voldemort in his prime, does it still count if he manages to exploit character flaws and the lack of experience with fighting people on his own level. Would knowledge of who a 40-100 year old wizard just coming out of nowhere help or hinder Voldemort, would he let his guard down if he knows that his opponent is a time traveling Ron Weasley, would he be more vary than a mysterious person he doesn´t recognize. It is really hard to determine, we are talking here about 1 to several million Ron´s necessary to kill Voldemort, we just don´t have enough data, someone should just ask J. K. Rowling on twitter and hope she answers.

***** Other than Voldie's duel with Dumbledore, do we see him performing feats of strength worthy of a Dark Lord? He pretty much uses unforgivables only (as far as I remember)

Maybe he'd have /some/ trouble against someone who think way outside the box?

****** Voldemort kinda is like that kid that burns ants to death with a magnifying glass, compared to most other wizards, I guess he really would be vulnerable to unconventional strategies, especially if he´s in a position where raw power doesn´t solve his problems, not because he necessary lacks the intelligence, but because, he lacks the practice, at least when it comes to combat.
