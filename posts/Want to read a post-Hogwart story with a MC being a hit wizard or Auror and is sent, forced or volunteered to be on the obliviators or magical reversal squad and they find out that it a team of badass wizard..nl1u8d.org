The main character doesn't really matter. It could be Harry Potter, Ron Wesley, Draco Malfoy Neville Longbottom, Pansy Parkinson, or anyone really. The main point is that the main character is an Auror or Hit Wizard and eventually they are forced out of their job. Maybe by making mistakes or being too reckless or bullshit politics for whatever reason. Instead of being fired they are being moved to another position in the ministry under the obliviators or the magical reversal squad. It could be a temporary move or permanent one.

Of course to them it seems like a demotion and everyone in the ministry believes that it's a shitty positions and the position is not as hardcore as hit wizards and Aurors. People make fun of obliviators and magical reversal squads and call them lame names like the babysitter squad or tell them they have easy cushy job where they don't do anything important. So the main character is ashamed or thinks they are too good to work their new position.

But the Obliviators and the magical reversal squad knows that their job is the hardest and can require more brain than brawn. They deal with the craziest kind of magic like kids accidental magic (which is of course can be powerful magic) or magic gone wrong when people experiment and also they get the most heart wrenching cases abused kids, neglectful parents, bad Muggleborns that they can't do anything about. The burnout in these positions is high in part because it can have a high emotional toll and also maybe the ministry doesn't give them enough support. (Though I also like the idea of the, getting a really high budget to work with because they protect the Statute of secrecy so they always have the most up to date magical tech). It could also be a feeder position into the Department of Mysteries because being able to reverse unknown Magic's displays good problem solving and the ability to work in high stress situations. So throughout the story they eventually learn to like their job.

This could be a fun plot or even subplot to play around with.


** Hell. Yes. Muggle area magic reversal squad is the way to go. They deal with things that aren't considered criminal acts, but are frequently in danger. The obliviators would have to be a literal clean-up crew. Still could be awesome though, just in a less kicking down the door way. They could be in charge of collecting muggle testimony, or be part of a larger scene response team. Or there could be multiple obliviator departments for law enforcement and unrelated pieces.
