Looking for HP stories where it's old rituals celebrating samheim or yule are important in wizarding society. Like where the muggleborns are basically destroying the old way and harry finds out and likes the old way and follows it. Not like self enhancement rituals but like where Sirius drops his blood into a basin and becomes lord black and stuff. Basically the old ways are the good ways and the rituals help boost there magic because they worship the old gods and what not.

i dont want where harry is lord potter black more names than dumbledore. The mauraders plan was good but more into rituals than that fanfic.

I dont know if I'm making much sense at all but if you get what I'm saying that would awesome.

** I remember 1 or 2 fanfics with this, but I think both were incomplete.

1) Narcissa is some sort of priestess and tries to bring back the old ways into public (wizarding) knowledge. I think she even adopts some muggleborn girls into her circle to train them. The idea is that the newcomers to their society don't realize that there is ancient magics passed down along ritual lines. Once Narcissa (and maybe some others?) realize this, they start to help the muggleborns integrate better and learn why the old ways exist.

2) I only remember one scene - Draco and Harry do a memorial service involving flame (turns blue) and fruit on one of the wiccan days, in remembrance and as offerings to their ancestors. Draco was a bit scared but happy that Harry was showing interest and so invited Harry to his own yearly observance. Dumbles and the Ministry had made such ceremonies illegal or "dark" I think.

*** When you think about it the muggleborns aren't the minority. There is reason to assume that purebloods are outnumbered, but because they have been in the wizarding world long enough they know all the ins and outs. Most purebloods have one or two children(unless you include the weasleys) an heir and a spare for whatever reason. Yes, muggleborns are the minority in power and influence, but with dumbledore who, is very powerful and very influential tries to gain more power and make muggleborns more included the old ways go to the side to make them feel more comfortable. It would also make sense as samheim and yule are wiccan/pagan and most of England is catholic and frown at wiccans/pagans and believe them to be evil. It's just that most muggleborns are probably catholic/protestant/Methodist and the idea of witches and wizards scare them. Add in rituals to celebrate it would be a complete freak out. Dumbledore trying to integrate muggleborns better bans said rituals to celebrate and uses catholic holidays such as Christmas and halloween.

It's a smart move on dumbledores part if you think of him in the mind set of trying to include the muggleborns but pissing off the purebloods and changing what's been done for years.

It's just an opinion. I've read alot of fanfiction through the years and it just made sense when I thought about it. I am probably wrong and that's okay but...yeah.

**** I don't have any recommendations to hand, I'm afraid, but I think I've got some bookmarked somewhere. I'll see if I can find them. I remember one where a Slytherin Harry has a pet Basilisk, if that helps anyone else. The only other one I remember gets suddenly ridiculously homophobic halfway through so I've purged that from my memory (Harry starts talking to Hermione about how being gay makes you lose your magic or some such).

Actually, most of us in England would be Church of England (aka Anglican/Protestants). The number of CoE is about double that of Catholicism and has been for a long time, last I checked, and even then we're mostly cultural high-holiday Catholics rather than the bible-thumpers of the US. We're also way less bothered by Witchery nowadays. I can't say for certain how things would've been in the early 19th century, given that I wasn't alive then, but given that we abolished the hunting of witches in the 1700s and generally focused on more Romasindi-Gypsy-type fortune telling vagrancy laws after that, I'd say we'd probably be pretty meh about the Pagans by that point. We killed about 500 witches between 1540-something when it was originally criminalised and the 1700s when it was abolished. It pops up now and again these days - a man killed in 1945 with a pitchfork was reportedly seen as a wizard by the locals - but for the most part we're culturally meh. We even close up Stonehenge on the regular so the Druids can do their thing. Probably more bothered by Nazis, Americans, and the French by the time Dumbledore was alive and active, anyway. If you're English and your experience is different, do tell. I'm a Northerner, so it might have been different in the South for all I know.

I'm definitely going to look that up and delve more into the history.(no I'm not a ravenclaw. Perfectly a slytherpuff lol) And you have a valid point of about being bothered by the french, nazis and Americans. I just thinking the purebloods were probably scarred by the witch hunt experience and pretty much everything else. I love discussing stuff like this. I dont really have anyone to do it with as nobody else I know reads fanfic to the extent I do(my fiance calls it my unhealthy obsession).

Sure. Always happy to talk about things like this. I'm a bit of a culture nerd myself - both for fun/interest and for inspiration for D&D game settings.

******** Okay, so, for ritual fic recommendations I have: The Power of Love by Philosophize - this one is femHarry-Hermione and features a lot of weirdly orgiastic Veela-ritual celebrations of various things. I don't remember it being terribly porny, but sex is definitely mentioned and I think they have to walk through that orgy-ritual at one point. Weird, but decent enough story.

Blessed Be by Flitterflutterfly - kind of a semi-holiday fic approach to it. Interesting enough, even if it is a bit short.

A fanfiction dot net author called Ellory has a few different stories on Pureblood ritual celebrations and culture.

The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville has some rituals in and among its cultural stuff.

If you google 'Harry Potter fanfic beltane' or 'Harry Potter fanfic rituals' with 'site:archiveofourown.org' or 'site:fanfiction.net' or 'site:reddit.com' at the end, there's a wide variety of things there that I unfortunately haven't read. Lot of Draco-Harry fics, best I can tell.

There's also a Slytherin Harry one where he befriends the Malfoys (and possibly Voldemort) where he talks about the same opinions you have (Dumbledore banning rituals to make the incoming Muggleborns more comfortable) almost word-for-word, but I can't for the life of me find it or remember the title beyond that. I'd suggest you make a 'What's that fic' post if you haven't read it already.

For witchy-history books I've got: Accused: English Witches throughout History by Willow Winsham - this is a book of case studies in the UK of accused witches. It's pretty detailed and good at describing the cultural background to each case and outcome with actual evidence.

The European Witch-Hunt by Julian Goodare - this is one of the more recent additions to my collection, and I'd say one of the better ones. It gives a more grass-roots explanation for why the witch hunts started and why they stopped. Not very focused on England specifically, unfortunately, but it does have mentions.

A Treasury of British Folklore: Maypoles, Mandrakes & Mistletoe by Dee Dee Chainey - this one isn't specifically about witches, instead covering a massive variety of British cultural superstitions throughout time (including those about witches in a couple of places).

The Witch: A History of Fear, from Ancient Times to the Present by Ronald Hutton - this is another 'why do we hate witches' book, but it's probably my preferred of the two. It doesn't cover case studies, rather the wider cultural views of witches across the world and how the various societies got there and contributed to later fearful beliefs.

Folk Witchcraft: A Guide to Lore, Land, and the Familiar Spirit for the Solitary Practitioner by Roger J. Horne - This is one is essentially a generalised witches handbook. It's not got any history, but if you're interested to know what some witches actually did in a way that's written for a modern mind to consume, this is a good one.

The Last Witchfinder by James Morrow - this is fiction, but it's relatively accurate historical fiction. If you want a good story that gives you a pretty decent idea of what witch-hunting was actually like, this is it.

Religion and the Decline of Magic: Studies in Popular Beliefs in Sixteenth and Seventeenth-Century England by Keith Thomas - this is another general one, looking at the decline of magical beliefs as a whole rather than witchery in particular, though IIRC witches are mentioned and discussed several times throughout.

The Oxford Handbook of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America by Brian Levack - this is an actual textbook from a Uni Course, but it has entire sections on why the Witch hunts occurred in England and America and why they stopped/slowed.

The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe by Brian Levack - this is a similar book, in case you can't find the Oxford Handbook one.

Witchcraft in Europe 1100-1700: A Documentary History, edited by Alan C. Kors and Edward Peters - this one is a classic of the field.

And finally: Thinking with Demons: The Idea of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe by Stuart Clark - this is probably my favourite on the list. It doesn't so much deal with cultural views on Witchcraft as intellectual ideological views on it and how it fit with the beginning scientific fields. It wasn't just religious lunacy motivating the hunts, but actual 'scientists' who believed wholeheartedly in demons that fitted into their natural views of the world.

Jeez. I have way more books on witches than I thought. And far less on English witchcraft than I thought. Anyways. Enjoy this long, long list. :D

**** I like to explain it as Magical Britain and Britain beimg as different as America and South America. SA is not just America in the south with the same cultures and traditions so why should Magical Britain be just Britain but with Magic. Muggleborns are coming into an entirely new world that is different from there own and it is their responsibility to learn about this new place and respect its culture. Muggleborns refusing to adapt and embrace the new culture and force their own into the magical world is destroying the old magics.

***** I.e. Hermione Granger and S.P.E.W.

Hermione sees it as slavery which we dont know really much about house elves and let's be honest Ron explains it very very poorly. I'd like to think that house leaves when in a good environment thrive and that there magic actually helps. I do love a good fanfiction where hermione gets a smack down for SPEW.

Dobby had a shit life with the Malfoy family because well Lucius Malfoy is a horrid person. Winky well let's be honest Crouch was an asshole but he was trying to protect his son as his dying wifes last wish. Winky had no control over Crouch Jr which caused the dark mark in the sky. She disobeyed him. It's kind of like a child who disobeys his parent. It's probably a bad metaphor but the most accurate that I can see. I guess I see the house elves needing to be bonded to a wizard because they need the magic to survive. Dobby was just a really weird elf.

****** I see it as Hermione wanting house elves to get wages and days off because that's what she wants. The house elves feed off their masters magic which includes the magic of their estate which are placed over magic rich areas. They do not need normal food and minimal sleep, the magic keeps them healthy until they die. House elves aren't brought like slaves but instead remain with a family for centuries and to be freed is the equivalent of being disowned. This is why only the rich and ild families have house elves. Some are abused like Dobby, I think Crouch wasn't really a major ass but he was emotional from losing his son amd made a mistake, still not a very good person but no worse than Snape ever was. The relationship is a mutual benifit and most are happy but Hermione doesn't see this only that they work and don't get gold so it's slave labour and she should trick them into being freed.

*** There are some stories where the actual anti-ritual, -whatever person is Dumbledore. He's so progressive, so inclusive of Muggleborns that he suppresses Wizarding traditions at Hogwarts (Halloween instead of Samhain rites, Christmas instead of Yule, no rites on the equinoxes, etc.).

Children grow up spending all but about 4 months of the year at Hogwarts. The only holiday that they can spend at home is Christmas/Yule. If Hogwarts, the cradle of British magical culture, doesn't think that these things are important, how are students to grow up respecting them?

There's also a story where Bill follows "the old ways" or something and is kind of shunned by his family (devout Dumbledorians, natch). He advises Harry to be circumspect when he discovers ye olden ways and to be careful who he, honestly, is honest with. I haven't actually read it so I don't know anything more about it. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8342163/1/Discovering-Magic]])
