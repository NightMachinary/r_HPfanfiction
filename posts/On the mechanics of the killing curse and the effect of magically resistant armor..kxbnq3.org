Here's my understanding of the killing curse. Given that it leaves no mark and has no observable effect on the body, it can be surmized that it interacts with a non-physical element of life. That's pretty much canon, what isn't canon is exactly what non-physical part it does interact with. Despite not being canon info, we can reasonably surmise that the killing curse interacts with the soul.

This can be ascertained by a variety of means, the first of which is the killing curse's status as an unforgivable, thus implying that it is more than just a spell that kills. Given that there are other spells that boil blood and incinerate people alive, it makes little sense that a spell that merely causes instant, painless death would be so heinous, unless it functions in some particularly violating way. Given that soul magic, or at least examples of it, are considered to be of particularly foul and vile temperament, we can surmise that soul magic is commonly considered an abomination. This makes sense, as meddling in, or interacting with, the fundamental core of a sentient being seems like a poorly conceived idea. Given, again, that the killing curse leaves no physical mark, that it is considered an abomination, and that soul magic is known to share these characteristics, we can deduce with an acceptable degree of error that the killing curse functions on a basis of soul magic.

We have established that the killing curse functions via soul magic, but the exact mechanics have yet to be established. I believe that the curse functions by severing the connection between soul and physical vessel, this is not a novel concept but it has valuable implications.

It had been implied that some creatures and beings are more resistant to magic than others, with such notable examples as Giants, Dragons, and Quintapeds. It is also explicitly stated that the kiling curse requires, "a fair bit of magic behind it". This seems to imply that the effect of the killing curse is relative to the power behind it.

We know that spells require several elements, the first and most basic is magical power, a poorly quantified but easily understood element; the second is the form of the spell, this would be the incantation, wand motions, etc; the third element is the emotive content such as the happy memory for the patronus charm, or the sadistic desire for the cruciatus curse.

This section is pure speculation, but I believe that the formation of a spell happens in three stages. The first is the emotive stage, if you cannot summon the necessary belief and desire, as well as specific emotions in rare cases, then you cannot form the spell. After the emotive content is the form, this is what refines the spell and ensures it comes out in a controlled and expected way. An example of poor form would be Seamus Finnegan's levitation charm in his first lesson, in which his poor form led to an exploding feather. The third stage is the power, the emotiove content deives the spell, and the form, well, forms it, but the power out into the spell is what determines the effectiveness. Consider it like a valve, the valve is formed by the form of the spell, the water is activated by the emotive content, and then the power of the spell determines the rate at which the water is forced through the valve.

Back to the killing curse, when Moody says that it needs, "a fair bit of magic behind it", I believe that he meant that, in order to kill a human, a more than ordinary level of power must be put into the spell in addition to the proper form and emotive content. Returning to the magcial resistance of various creatures, it is known that wizards and witches are in fact magical beings. Their magic grants them longer lives and more effective immune systems at the very least when compared to ordinary humans. Using the extreme examples put forth by dragons and the like, we know that spells must be more powerful in order to overcome the magical resistance of various creatures. I believe that the reason why Moody says that the curse needs powerful magic is to overcome the natural resistance that humans have. Given how inextricably connected the soul is with the body, I surmise that it takes an abnormally large amount of magical power to sever the connection. This is compunded by the magical resistance of the creature being subjected to the killing curse. This would mean that the more magically resistant a creature is the more power is needed to kill them with the curse. As such a creature like a fieldmouse would need no more than the proper form and emotive content to kill, but a sentient being with a will to live would need far more magic. A muggle would need less magic to kill than a wizard, but both would be roughly comparable.

Lastly, the effect of magically resistant armor. A magically resistent material would drain the power of the curse as it passes through, but not effect the potency of the form or emotive content in any way. As such, if the armor is magically resistant enough to drain the spell of enough power to lower it to a degree at which it can no longer sever the soul from the body, then the armor would effectively stop the curse. However, if the armor fails to drain the curse to that level then it would be entirely innefectual.

If a killing curse is cast with 300% of the magical power necessary to kill a human, and a piece of magical armor drains it of 100% of the power needed to kill a human, then the spell still has 200% of the necessary power and will still kill. If the armor drains the curse of 201% percent, then the curse will have 99% of the power it needs and will fail.


** My headcanon is that the power required to kill with the Killing Curse rises with both the target's magic resistance /and/ with the target's body mass and/or "life energy" (for lack of a better word). An elephant would thus take more power than a human (assuming comparable resistance, though you make an interesting point regarding souls), but less than a magic-resistant creature of similar size and vitality.

Also, a point regarding armor: Sufficiently pure gold seems to reflect the Killing Curse; when Dumbledore uses one of the gold statues to block Voldemort's AK in the Ministry Atrium, the curse actually bounces off and causes the wand-check desk to burst into flames. I would assert that this is an interaction specific to gold and the Killing Curse, one that Dumbledore in particular would know a lot about because it's based on (real-life) alchemical principles. I've posted about this before, but can explain the alchemy involved if desired.

*** Hmm, I forgot about the pure gold. Not something particularly useful in combat given that it can't be simply conjured, but incredibly fascinating.

** I once read a fanfic where the reason that the Killing Curse requires a genuine willingness to commit murder is because the curse works by overpowering the will of the person's soul to survive. Your will to kill the person must be stronger than a person's natural instinct to live, which is why emotion and intent are needed.

The Imperius curse is an overpowering of the mind, the crutiatus curse is an overpowering of the body and the killing curse is an overpowering of the soul. In the fic this was the reason why all 3 were categorised together as Unforgivables. I thought it was a neat little theory.

** The best explanation of the mechanism for casting I've heard is that the spell requires a higher level of power, as well as the intent to kill. As in, you can't accidentally cast it. It requires you to understand that you're killing someone and be fine with that.

I'm pretty sure that physical objects of sufficient density would stop the killing curse, like a rock or a statue. How about just sticking your characters in perfectly mundane plate carriers? They'd stop the killing curse better than a bullet because there wouldn't be as much force to dissipate. You'd only get one surefire use out of one, but that's the best you can get out of a plate when being shot at as well.

** Well written interpretation of the killing curse. Not one I personally find canon compatible or preferable, but certainly well thought out.

I don't think that magically resistant armor should be a defense against the killing curse. Which is explicitly written as unblockable. I also don't think it should be dodgeable as I don't agree with the flying glowstick or green lightning interpretations of the spell. In my interpretation, the spell relies on eye contact the way Quirrel's first jinx did, in that as long as you can see your victim in front of you, you can kill them with the curse. Breaking line of sight before the spell is cast can save you, but once the spell is cast there is no defense, no dodging, no blocking, no shielding, just instantaneous death.

As for the difficulty of casting, I prefer technical difficulties in casting to ambiguous "power" requirement. The patronus is difficult magic not because it requires 300% go juice, but because it requires ensuring proper wand movement and pronunciation, while also maintaining an adequately happy memory in the face of the thing that destroys happy memories. And not only that, it requires some sort of slightly unteachable feeling of infusing the happiness of the memory into the spell, rather than just thinking about it while casting.

As such, the fair bit of magic I see required for the Killing Curse is that the spell builds off of a desire to murder and an apathy for the other persons life such that no one can cast the Curse in self defense, as the casting itself requires an unforgiveable mindset.

*** I would disagree on which of our interpretations of the curse is canon compatible, the curse is very explicitly described as a "jet of green light" which, when compared to descriptions of other spells and curses, is consistent with the "magical projectile" as described for spells such as the stunning spell. Additionally, killing curses are explicitly shown in the books as being capable of missing their target, this would not be possible if the curse was instantaneous. Additionally, the curse cannot require eye contect as there are examples of wizards being cursed in the back, or else through fog or other visual obstruction.

As for your objection regarding the formation of the spell being more than just magical power and requiring properly formed wand movements as well as adequately focused emotion/intent, I agree, and I have already taken that into account as can be found in paragraph 6. The metaphor I used of a valve was meant to convey that the "magical power" does not affect the shape, effect, or formation of the spell in any way. That is down to the shape of the valve and the contents being pushed through it, (the form and emotive content respectively), rather that it only effects the hypothetical pressure or speed at which the spell emerges from the valve, and thus the power available to the spell to penetrate defenses and deliver it's effect. The effect is the same either way, and the "power" of the spell serves only to determine whether the spell can overcome the magical resistance of the target to deliver the effect. This is in line with the canon descriptions of magical beings such as dragons needing many stunners to incapacitate, as well as descriptions of Hagrid being completely unaffected by anything below a certain strength of spellfire. Critically, Hargid is not /partially/ affected, but comepltely unnaffected by certain "weaker" spells.

**** Fair enough on the "jet" of light argument. I would say that that is due to a shift in JK Rowlings writing as in all early writing, the spell is described as instant and a "flash" of green light, not a jet. The jet description began being used in the books sporadically (flash was still used regularly) only after production began on the first film and likely coincided with Rowling beginning to think ahead regarding the visuals of the more intense battles of later books. It can be hard to agree on a set canon when canon itself shifts over the course of years. Even when dodging the curse became a thing its often described as in the Deathly Hallows, where "Ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light."

Almost all successful castings of the killing curse we see described are shown as the instant kill, flash of green light. Its only when Rowling wants to keep stakes high while protecting characters with plot armor that the spell is described as a dodgeable jet.

As such I choose to believe that the flash is the Watsonian canon, the one that makes sense and is magically consistent with how afraid people are of it. While the jet is Doylist canon, which let Rowling write more visually appealing and high stakes fights that her characters could survive.

When it comes to writing up magical theory I prefer to use in universe watsonian explanations as my basis. That doesn't mean you aren't supported by canon too.

Also, as per my second objection, you misunderstand me. Eye contact like Quirrel on Harry's broom, not eye on eye contact. If you can see the victim you can kill them.

And for the last you misunderstand me again. I'm not saying the spell is formed from "more than magical power" I'm saying magical power isn't a thing. There is no dial that can be cranked or magical core that can be tested. No numerical assignation of magical strength. A powerful spell is one cast perfectly and with strong levels of visualization, willpower, and any other requirement of the spell (like memory for a patronus), not one where the wizard forces more magical go-juice through the valves.

Once again, I don't think there is anything wrong with your interpretation. This is fanfiction and part of the whole purpose is playing with the world to make it fit our preferences better. Your interpretation doesn't fit my preferences the same way mine might not fit yours or anyone elses. Neither is correct outright because they were written by us and not Rowling.
