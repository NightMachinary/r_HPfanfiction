I have re-read The Marriage Stone By Josephine Darcy so many times. I attempted to read Lynne's continuation of the story but she seems to turn it jnto a Hermione centered fic. Does it continue like that through out or does it eventually go back to Harry and Snape without Hermione and Pertunia being inserted into everything? How is Yengirls version? I haven't touched it.

I am not sure what flair to add, so I just picked discussion. Hope its correct.
