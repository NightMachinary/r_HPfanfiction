How different is the Wizarding World in America? Or how similar is it?

For me I think the Witches and Wizards are more accepting to Muggles, Muggleborns, Squibs and Werewolves and other creatures.

I also think that they would be able to dress like a Muggle more then someone in Britain.

Britain seems to be behind the times a bit, but I like to think that the Wizarding World in America is a bit closer to the times, maybe not exactly there but closer then Britain Witches and Wizards.

I also think that there would be a lot more Wizarding areas in America then there likely are in Britain since America is such a huge place.

And likewise I personally don't believe that IIvermorny is the only Wizarding school in America either, I would imagine there to be at least two.

Also what about the money? Would they use galleons or the Muggle money? Or something else entirely?

What does everyone else think? Agree, disagree and what do you agree or disagree with and why?


** Fantastic Beasts so far showed that Magical America was an even worse place than Magical Britain. Its police chief could order executions right away, without any trial. It also prohibited any marriages with No-Majs, which meant any No-Maj-borns would be abducted from their families and their existence wiped from No-Maj world.

** Apart from the /Alexandra Quick/ series, there was another fic that had Harry moving to the U.S. It was like 400k words, with an entire hand-crafted community... unfortunately the author deleted it. If someone has a link, do post.

**** Even post-FB I come across new stories with a utopia or at least more progressive American wizarding world.

***** Of course, things could always dramatically change, given how badly Grindelwald had shaken up the Magical World.

It could be possible that Magical America did a 180 degree just like its Muggle counterpart with Isolationism in face of WW2. Since Grindelwald cheated like hell and was on the verge of victory, Magical America had no choice but to join its European allies in fighting.

After the War, Magical America continued to work closely with the US government to keep the SoS and further their common interests. Magical Russia had a similar arrangements with the USSR. However, other European Ministries decided to mostly stop interfering in Muggle affairs.

--------------

Under this scenario, Magical America and Russia were preparing to interfere in Magical Britain, should Voldemort win and consolidate his power there. Taking control of UK's nuclear weapons would probably be a first step. But Voldemort surprisingly fell from power after only 10 months, so all plans for a military intervention were scrapped.

****** It is possible, but detailed backgrounds with reasons for changes to the American wizarding world are usually not given. The fics I've read are just another excuse to portray America as great without any nuance. They're mostly Avengers x HP crossovers, and thankfully the look into the American wizarding world is often minimal.

There was a good one pre-FB though that created a new wizarding school on the west coast that combined wizarding and muggle school subjects.

** For a first, comparing any other magical region with magical Britain isn't entirely fair. Britain had 3 wars in one century. Compare that to some other countries on this planet and you'll see that the rule, not the exception, is that the country will be "backwards" compared to nations with longer peacetime.

We already saw comments talking about the tyrannical hellhole magical America was in Fantastic Beasts. Immediate executions without trial, extreme separation between muggle and magical,...

Modern magical USA may be a completely different case. I would imagine that the american magicals would enter a similar sort of upswing after the Grindelwald Wars and benefit from an exodus of muggleborn and halfbloods from the first Blood War out of the UK. I see no reason why the Americans should lay off their extreme separation between muggle and magical. It seemed to work fine for them - or at least good enough. However, I would think that something akin to a "magical Silicon Valley" would be interesting.

But in any case, you can swing it however you want. Just keep in mind that every culture /ever/, had its problems and hurdles to overcome. A society without problems and darker sides is boring and mostly annoying. The term 'murica-wank was coined because of it. Nobody wants to read about the perfect american utopia where all wizards, centaurs, wendigos, whatever are free and everybody likes and respects each other and also the schools are way better. No. Thats boring, annoying and for a lot of people a good reason to stop reading.

** I figure most of the anti muggle sentiment was anchored on the east coast and as you move west it lightened, maybe not legally but socially. I also think their would be a lot more magicals as we see blood purism still practiced in the HP books so it was probably much worst even a few decades ago so in my head canon U.S. was a haven of sorts for muggle borns or half-bloods fleeing Europe and with this probably came more wizarding areas presumably most of the native american tribes and southern/central american empires had access to magic who probably have their own school where surviving practitioners teach and Hawaii would probably have their own separate school, maybe a big Polynesian one? They probably use the galleon, I figure that Gringotts is the central bank for most of magical Europe and the Americas I also would like to believe that magical Americans could dress a bit more like muggles, but I don't really think so. You know the stereotype of American tourists just being extremely stupid? I imagine something similar with magicals trying to dress as muggles, it may not always be true, but for the majority I believe it
