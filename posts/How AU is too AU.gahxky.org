Where do you draw the line?

Is it still Harry Potter when the main trio are in Slytherin? Is it too much for you if Hogwarts is a school for people with superpowers? What if Hogwarts worked the same way as the school from RWBY?


** Honestly, as long as your main character is named Harry and the world it is set in has magic, that's close enough for me. I'm not a huge fan of HP fics that are non-magical AUs as I typically read that in other fandoms and come here to get my magic fix.

** No magic is too far.

The main trio being all Slytherin is light work and elemental Harry was all the rave about six years ago. I'm unfamiliar with the last one.

** Honestly so long as its Harry, and we are pulling references to the HP world I am happy. Of course I am wack as I enjoy my crossovers. Though I find muggle AU's to be a bit dry cause it seems to make the characters lose something that made them, them.

** AU and OOC.

Just one or the other is fine, but both is original fiction with names from Harry Potter.

** There is such an odd mix of acceptable AUs for me. I love "Grow Young With Me" which obviously keeps the canon of the books but divulges from the epilogue and CC. I also love well-written Professor Potter AUs because I can honestly see Harry being a professor. However, there still needs to be magic for me to read it because the characters lack a depth when the magical aspect is left out. Some aspects such as the trio being in Gryfindor, Dumbledore dying, and at least reference to the original pairings (you can diverge from those with good explanation) need to be present.

** That's very hard to say. My favorite Harry Potter fic is a Last Airbender AU by Water Mage it was the most cannon Harry I've read on the site.

** I only like AUs which slowly diverge from canon, but there plenty of readers into the Wild and whacky.

** It depends. There are three main components of an AU Harry Potter story: Setting, characters and plot. And changes to any of them have a wide range - often very subjectively defined. What someone might consider ooc varies, f.e.

** I usually start to take issue when they leave Hogwarts. Nothing against the concept, I'm just attached to the setting. Also, the fics that push "wizards should do everything like muggles". I'm fine with muggle involvements, and solid writing can make me ignore leaving Hogwarts, but generally, fics that either have them destroy Hogwarts traditions, or leave Hogwarts altogether.
