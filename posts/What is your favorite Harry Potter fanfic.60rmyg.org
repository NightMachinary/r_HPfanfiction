  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** Stages of Hope linkffn(6892925) I think has to be my favorite completed story. I'm a big fan of dimension travel stories, and stories that are depressing, and this one hits hard at parts. The basic premise is that Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Luna from a mostly canon (until book 7) universe end up in an AU world where instead of the Mauraders, there was Sirius, Snape, Lily, and Remus as four friends. All of the dimension travellers are broken in some ways from the war they've been fighting, and agree to help out deal with this universe's voldemort while they find a way home to finish their own war. Sadness and feelings follow.

** This is a tough one. For a completed long work, I love /Harry Potter and the Lost Demon/. For an in-progress one, /Harry Potter and Future's Past/ makes a point of correcting everything I hated about books 5,6, and 7.

For a shorter fic that just works very well, I'd pick /You have Always Believed Me/, a story about Hermione having a dark mark and how her friends react to the situation (she's as surprised as anyone else). For a crossover, well, my favorite is probably /Something Wicked This Way Comes/, which drags Etna from Disgaea into Harry Potter's life.

** I love the rich prose in "No Loyalty in the Moonlight" and the author's ingenious take on the complexities of Horcruxes. Plus, it's a Severus/Hermione story, which I'm partial to already, and while the author paces the story with an agonizingly slow buildup where those two characters are concerned, it ultimately pays off for the reader and then some (in my opinion).

It casts Sirius in the best possible light and fixes so many things from the canon story, is highly detailed but clearly written so it reads smoothly, super absorbing and satisfying. I just keep thinking how /decadent/ this story is.

I have extremely high hopes for the remainder of the story because I love it so much so far.

  Secrets are discovered. Alliances are forged. Battle lines are drawn. Some friendships strengthen while others break. The war has started. A friend and a Godfather have already been taken away from him. No longer will he stand for the manipulations!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging][The Merging]] - It's an interesting concept, and gives Harry an OP-ness that's more of a burden than anything else.

Runner-ups:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540175/1/A-Mishap-and-an-Opportunity][A Mishap and an Opportunity]] - Bite me, but this one is one of my favourite time travel fics, and it's a healthy mix between Marauder banter and serious (also Sirius-related) themes. It involves a Metamorph Harry and Tonks stuck in the 70's.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6337450/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Turning-of-the-Sun][Harry Potter and the Turning of the Sun]] - The writing of this one is kinda bad, but it does get better in more recent chapters. I really like the more proactive, but still canon-like Dumbledore in this one.
