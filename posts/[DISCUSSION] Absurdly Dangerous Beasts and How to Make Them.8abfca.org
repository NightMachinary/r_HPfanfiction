What do yall think would be the most terrifying and difficult to fight magical beast crossbreed?

for me its an Erumpent Hydra - like a normal Hydra but it blows its own heads off.


** A Basilisk Veela. You want to look at her, but you die when you do...

** Oh goodness, a Basilisk/Diricawl hybrid.

It can teleport directly into your line of sight, but it looks impressively retarded for a bird-snake.

** Malobscudementisk (Maledictus/Obscurus + Dementor + Basilisk)

Like a Dementor, it's indestructible unless you've got something like Fiendfyre, and it can suck out your will to live and your soul. Like a Basilisk, looking it in the eyes is fatal, and it has venom that can destroy anything. Like a Maledictus, it's originally an innocent person who may turn into that heartless monstrosity at /any moment/ --- additionally making it harder to decide to buckle up and put it down if you ever figure out how.

** Spoiler for my fic: Combining an Obscurus with a Horcrux and fusing it with a dark wizard creates a malevolent, parasitic entity that is next-to impossible to destroy, and can survive the death of its host and possess a new host who is emotionally vulnerable.

Also, incubating a fire crab egg in manticore blood is how you create a Blast-Ended Skrewt.

**** I mean the ritual to make a Horcrux involves a soul-splitting murder, so maybe alter it a little bit and kill the host of the Obscurus? Or use the thing as the soul container instead?

***** The Obscurus is ripped from the Obscurial and bound to the Horcrux (In my fic, horcruxes have the additional function of being high-power batteries of dark magic, which is used to power its defenses and absorbs any dark magic it comes across if its separated from said defenses.) The Horcrux (in this case, a ritual dagger) is fused with a willing Dark Wizard (Not the one who created the Horcrux, mind you), creating a nigh-unstoppable demonic entity with a penchant for tearing its victims entrails apart from the inside.

** Dementor hydra hybrid.

Basically just a dementor with a lot of heads for maximum soul sucking potential.

Or while not a creature, combine a dementor with a patronus and everyone is fucked. You'd just have a dementor with no weakness.

**** yes. The new breed might be called Red Dementor. it will first suck the soul, and then hack you to death and consume the body. maybe instead of wearing black, the red dementor might be shrouded in red, covered in the blood of its victim. Also, it would be a little short because red caps are dwarfs.
