Can anyone recommend any general Snape, as long as it's well written? My preference is he mentors Harry, or adopts him. I also love crack, with him placed into embarrassing situations, or interacting with children and animals. Fair warning, I may have read half of the fix that you recommend, but if that is the case I would love to discuss them with you. Always up for a chat üôÇ

** Snape, Head of Hufflepuff by Shankelor linkao3(3403247) No Harry in this one, as it's before his time.

Six, Revisited by Warviben is a very sweet story if Snape taking care of a de-aged Harry. linkffn(8707789)

Redefining Life series by OliverSnape has him taking taking care of a teen Harry who is occasionally de-aged to a small child as part of his cover on a mission. The first story is The Definition of Home linkffn(5878880) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/14893][also on AO3]].

Hindsight by Loralee linkffn(3160980). Severus is in a funk, thinking about Harry Potter coming to Hogwarts in all his arrogant, bullying glory... when Severus from the future shows up to tell him how wrong he is.

[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=1663][Finding a Famiily and a Home]] by Hestia (HestiaA1 on FFN). I recommend reading it on Potions and Snitches (the direct link) because it's all been put into a chaptered story there, instead of the small pieces on FFN where you'll have to keep track of the proper order. First story linkffn(4360923)

#+begin_quote
  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

** Obscura Nox Animae, by Heatherlly. It is finished, incredibly long and well written, although it might not be everybody's cup of tea. It's a Snily but not cliche, it's hard to explain so I think you best look this one up if you are interested. Always in your shadow, by Arinus. A very good and well written Snape's daughter fanfic, it works, I usually don't like things like this but it was great. It's completed too. Seeing as you like Snape, I'll just write all the Snape mentors ones I have that are great, most of them if not all below are finished and long. Harry Potter and the battle of wills, by Jocelyn. Harry Potter and the enemy within, by Theowyn of HPG. What's Owed, by ruth7019. Moment of impact, by Suite Sambo. Visions of sugarplums danced in their heads, by fawkesfeathers. And just to throw the cat amongst the pigeons, I'll throw in a Snamione... I usually don't go for this ship, but my friend persuaded me to read this a couple of years ago and it was very very good, a slow burn which I love. Chasing the sun, by Loten. O Mine Enemy, by Kirby Lane. A very long ongoing, steady updates every two weeks. Incredibly well written, quite slow, Snape mentors Harry and there's a lot on mind magic which is great. I love it. Basilisk eyes, by Hegemone. Very long and rambling, general where Harry is blinded in the chamber of secrets, there are a lot of OC's, it's still ongoing but is hugely long. The writing isn't the best, but I love how the author deals with blindness, the author is blind themselves and I think that's why it's so good. I don't know though, there is something quite charming about it although it may take some getting used to. crime and punishment, by mlocatis. Another Snape mentors Harry, very very well written and well structured, not finished, updates are sporadical, but recent so it's not officially abandoned or anything like that. It's definitely worth a read if it's your type of thing. The second string, by Eider Down. Don't quite know how to describe this one, it's definitely one-of-a-kind, it's a real gem of a fic, although not finished and not updated constantly it definitely doesn't seem abandoned. It's one of these alternate reality/time travel not cliche or generic. I think your best looking this one up yourself. Against the moon, by Stoplight Delight. All I remember about this one is it was very very good, it's extremely long and I think it's finished. When I say long I mean over 800000 words long. It's a marauders, can't remember if it's a wolfstar, but it was good as I've marked it as a favourite. Casting moonshadows, by Moonsign. This is another good one, although not finished. It's marauders era again, and I think it might be wolfstar. The changeling, by Annerb. It's definitely finished, quite long, took me a few days over 100,000 words, Ginny gets sorted into slytherin but it is so much better than that. It's great love it. Sorry it's taken me so long, if you want any more information on any of these please feel free, I realise not all of these are about Snape, but these are all brilliant in my opinion. Happy reading and please let me know what you think of them.
