I'm looking for this Fanfic, I don't remember the name, but I do remember that either death eaters or Voldmort kills harry, and Hermione gets revenge all while being haunted by his ghost.

*** Somebody told me the same thing but I don't know what that means, the story starts I think sixth year death eaters are turning up dead, Hermione is being trained by moody and she give Bellatrix to Neville that's about all I can remember

** I remember one I read a while back.

Professor McGonagall tried to do a sex-ed class in the mid 1970s to everyone in James Potter's year. I don't remember much, but some of the couples (James and Lily and Frank and Alice) did some faux demonstrations. Professor Slughorn made a rather creepy remark to a Hufflepuff while it was going on.

Shame I didn't mark it down like I do most other fics I read.
