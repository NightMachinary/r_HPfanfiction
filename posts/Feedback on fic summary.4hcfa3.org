Current summary as follows:

At a party before her 6th Year Daphne came across an unpleasant surprise in dealing with the Wizengamot. With the help of her favorite muggleborn scholar she tries to turn a disaster into something positive. Some traditions fell for good reasons. And sometimes the best laid plans fall apart. Because the blood of the covenant is thicker than the waters of the womb.


** 'an unpleasant surprise' and 'the best laid plans fall apart,' are stock phrases that don't tell prospective readers much about the story. IIRC Muggleborn is capitalised.

The last sentence is interesting, but strangely phrased. It leads me to believe that Astoria will be the antagonist in a largely political fic.

Also the tense is a bit strange (e.g. 'came across' then 'tries to turn'). It sounds like all of this has already happened. 'Fell apart' also hits the inner ear wrong. Do you mean fall as in 'fall apart' or 'fall to pieces' or 'fall by the wayside?' Given that you use 'fall apart' in the next sentence, I'd recommend rephrasing it.

I think your third and fourth sentences could be merged into one: Some traditions fell for good reasons, and sometimes the best laid plans fall apart.

I'd recommend reading [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=21308][this]].

Edit: Here's a decent, but very generic format.

Setting [e.g. Post-GoF AU]. When [source of conflict] [acts], [protagonist(s)] are [forced to act] with/in spite of [challenges]. How will [he/she/they] survive when [hint at resolution/further conflict]?

*** The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb is basically the opposite of the similar quote and I believe it is actually the original.

It basically means those that you choose are more important than those that you are born with.

*** Thanks for the advice.

The last sentence was something I ran across related to the phrase blood is thicker than water, and that came up.

I see your point about the third and fourth sentences.

I don't see a fell apart, I see a fell for good reasons, and the next sentence there is a fall apart, so maybe I'm seeing something different

Again thanks

** It really comes across a bit choppy. The first sentence is fine. The second sentence is a bit odd.

/Her/ favorite muggleborn scholar? If we're talking about Hermione, you might be better off with breaking the fourth wall there and replacing "Her" with "Our", because there's no apparent reason for Daphne and Hermione to know each other, much less like each other. You have to introduce that relationship first before I'd accept such a statement, and you can't do that without me reading the story, which I won't do after reading that statement.

If it's /not/ Hermione, then keep it in because it if people assume Hermione like I did but don't see her tagged, they'll get curious, which is what you want.

The other three sentences are what feels choppy. You can do what [[/u/MacsenWledig]] suggests and combine them, but honestly I think you should remove the fourth sentence entirely, possibly even the fifth sentence. "The best laid plans of mice and men" and variations of the phrase have been done to death.

The wordier version of "blood is thicker than water" is a good mixing up of another done-to-death phrase, but it doesn't work with the rest of the summary. To put it metaphorically, the phrase is a good hook, but it's not attached to a line. I would add a sentence specifically about Daphne and the Muggleborn scholar making a deal before the fifth sentence if you want to use the fifth sentence as a hook.

Both the third and the fifth sentences are good hooks, but they can't work together.

Personally, I would take out both the fourth and fifth sentence and focus on the third, using some variation of "Some(times?) traditions fall for a reason." This is also a good hook, and it is a more relevant to the previous two sentences than the fifth alone.

The best summaries lead into the hook. My favorite example is this_old_dance's Wastelands of Time

#+begin_quote
  Take a deep breath, count backwards from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It will all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter, the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces the greatest challenge of all... Time.
#+end_quote

Wordplay aside (and damn is it good wordplay), it goes from Non Sequitur -> Main problem -> Main protagonist -> Antagonists -> Possible answer/challenge

Each statement leads into the next. Each statement is relevant to the next.

I kind of forgot where I was going with this. You probably get what I'm trying to say by now. Good luck!
