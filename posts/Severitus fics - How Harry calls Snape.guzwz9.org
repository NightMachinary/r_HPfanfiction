I read a Severitus/guardian fanfic today and there's a whole thing where Snape tells Harry to call him Severus. multiple times. It was written as a way to get pass their previous hostilities and for Harry to be more comfortable/trusting with his Guardian. Every time I read it though it just came off a little creepy... I prefer if Harry calls him Snape or Professor or sir. Honestly I probably just don't like Snape's first name, but I don't think it's weird when any of the adults call him Severus. It's just weird when Harry does... To me I guess. What are your thoughts on this? Do prefer them to use first names in Severitus fics?


** I can see why you think it's weird. I haven't read that many Severitus fics either but just picturing Harry call Snape that is weird. I think it's because in the series he was called Snape the whole time and we only ever see Dumbledore, McGonagall and Remus call him Severus. But if Snape were his guardian, it would make sense for Harry to call him by his first name. It's like how I find it really weird how Harry thinks of Sirius as Black in fics where they have a colder relationship. To me, he's Sirius, not Black. By the same logic, if Harry had a parental relationship with Snape it would make sense to call him by his first name.

*** Exactly! It makes sense, it just seems weird to me since I'm not used that kind of relationship between them.

** I read A LOT of severitus type fics and it makes sense to me for Harry to say "Severus," particularly if Snape requests it.

Obviously ways of addressing people are different in every culture, but when I was more familiar with teachers or knew them outside of school (which was a lot, small town) I called them by their first names in those other settings.

Particularly if Snape is adopting Harry it makes sense, because not many people call their guardians Mr. [Insert Name], Sir, or Professor.

Obviously I've read a lot so I'm used to it. But I do think it makes sense.

*** Thanks for the list! I agree it makes sense, I just never thought of it. I've read quite a few Severitus fics myself and I don't think any of them ever addressed the name thing lol

**** I commented on a previous post with these but here are some I like. Some are severitus where Snape is actually Harry's dad. Others are more guardian/mentor stories.

A few of my faves: Definitely the best I've ever read is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]] by Aspen in the Sunlight. Absolutely love this fic. It has some torture that I usually skip through, but the connection between Harry and Severus (and) eventually Draco is super real, takes time, and is so sweet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/][Resonance]] by Green Gecko. Super well written and one I read once a year.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5926514/1/Perception-is-Everything][Perception is Everything]] by Kendra James (Severus and Remus take Harry on as an apprentice after discovering his abuse). I read this about once a year too.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/In-Care-Of][In Care Of by Fang's Fawn]] (Severus is stuck as a bat & Harry takes care of him. Severus sees how the Dursley's treat Harry). Not a true severitus but there's definitely a bond here.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3341876/1/Reading-the-Signs][Reading the Signs]] by GoldenCompass (Don't remember much from this but Harry loses his voice & Severus discovers his abuse. They communicate in sign language)

A few others: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12063568/1/][The Best Affinities]] by Caesara (more neglect & exploitation than physical abuse. Aunt Petunia uses Harry as garden labor for people in the neighborhood & Severus takes him on as an apprentice after he discovers Harry had a special magical ability)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4437151/1/Harry-s-New-Home][Harry's New Home]] by kbinnz

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16909389/chapters/39725442#workskin][An Unexpected Detention]] by MagnificentandStrange

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4547552/1/Arms-of-A-Dark-Angel][Arms of a Dark Angel]] by snapegirl

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3804990/1/Emerald-Eyes][Emerald Eyes (& Sequel Mindful Eyes)]] by JadeSullivan (this is one of the first guardian Snape fics I read)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4722467/5/][Harry and His New Family]] by grugster (lotsa hurt/comfort in this one & honestly it's a bit much. But there are lots of adults concerned about Harry's healing in this one)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2519543/1/Skin-Deep][Skin Deep]] by vingilot (honestly this isn't my fave & there was too much abuse for me & there maaay be some dumbledore bashing. But Harry is sexually abused and has tattoos on his body to make sure people don't touch him. I believe this is severitus.)

** Okay, but what's your suggestion? Obviously with their history any derivation of Father is not going to be an option, at least at the beginning. And after the Dursleys, "Uncle" might be problematic for Harry. The goal is to foster something closer than the student-teacher relationship (especially since theirs has been so fraught), so professor or sir doesn't reflect that change.

I'm not a big fan of children calling adults by their first name, as I was taught it's disrespectful. Here in the southern US they've come up with a compromise: Mr or Miss FirstName. My niece calls her stepfather "Mr Mark."

*** In the case of the fic I read, I think it was really early on in their relationship and they hadn't even really showed any respect to each other to begin with. Just constantly fighting and then all of a sudden it was like 'call me severus'. I've read quite a bit of Severitus fics and this was the first one that ever addressed what to call Snape and it threw me off. I never really thought of it. With Remus, if I remember correctly, Harry went back and forth between Remus, Lupin, and Professor. So I just never really put much brain power into it . Honestly, out of the other fics I've read, I don't think Harry ever addresses Snape by name lol.

** I get what you're saying. It takes some getting use to, but after reading a lot of OOC Snape fics I don't bat an eye anymore.

** Ok for clarification: this is the impression I got from the ONE fanfic I read that this happened in. The fanfic had a really back and forth and not clear relationship for Snape and Harry and it basically came out of nowhere. I can see how it would work if the relationship was developed and was well written. That's why I wanted to see everyone's opinions on this! That's the beauty of fanfiction: we all the story and characters but we all have different thoughts and feelings on them and that's okay!

** I don't really read these often, but the name somebody calls another is dependent on the nature of their relationship in any given story.

*** Totally! It's purely a guardianship fic (no slash) in this case but I still find it strange to picture Snape as anything other then Snape.
