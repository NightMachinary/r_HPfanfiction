Since Harry was the last one his line, why couldn't he invoke using a proxy to take his place during the tri-wiz, or maybe multiple proxies depending on the particular task? I'm sure he could think of someone more appropriate to use as a stand-in...\\
Task 1:\\
Task 2:\\
Task 3:


** I think I've seen a comment around here talking about Dumbledore putting Tom Riddle's name into the cup. If the proxy doesn't have to be willing and is still magically binding, it could be interesting to have Harry force Voldemort into the public's eye. Especially when he's in his creepy baby form.

Ooooo or maybe Peter Pettigrew to prove he's alive.

*** There isn't a rule that said the proxy had to be */living/* or on this plane of existence to be declared a proxy.

Harry "I declare my proxy to be..." drum roll sound ensues.

** The only story I've read where Harry had someone be the champion instead of himself is called Champion's Champion by DriftWood1965

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** Assuming that it has to be someone that agrees to participate, first task it is Dumbledore, because he doesn't have that much time to find someone, the challenge would be pretty much a walk on the park for him no matter what it is and considering that he was the one who protected the goblet he should be pretty easy to guilt-trip into accepting.

Second task he uses the life-debt to have Pettigrew do it, claiming that he would be re-paying the life Harry spared by doing his best to save one of Harry's friend (alternatively, assuming that is not how the debt work, he can use the unbreakable vow Snape made to protect him to get the professor to do it for him.

And finally, after almost an entire year of baiting him with the prize, understating the danger of the task and maybe even using some compulsions and potions on his letters the last proxy comes through and is none other than Vernon Dursley himself. Harry sits happily eating popcorn while the rest of the public watch in hopeless horror as the muggle is severely injuries and then killed by the beasts and traps on the maze.
