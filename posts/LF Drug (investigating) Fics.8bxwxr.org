A Drug is floodin the Magical World and Harry and Ron have to investigate, but accidental are exposed to the Drug. Affected by it, they may possibly cheat on their Spouses (if they are married or dating), by either sleeping with each other or with other Partners.

And since im looking for Drug fics: Post War, Harry meets a female Drug user and "settle" with her, also taking Drugs and drink Alcohol, but without losing his Personality and sink to much into the "Swamp". She is annoyed by her Body being aroused and sexual active, so she has to touch herself to get it out of her system. While Harry is there, he helps her, but she actually has no fun in Sex (possibly through the Drugs). This request is inspired by Zoe Baker from Resident Evil 7, because (despite her tragic Origin) she appears like the typical Drug addiction, so i more or less imagine her with Harry. But maybe there is a fitting Crossover.
