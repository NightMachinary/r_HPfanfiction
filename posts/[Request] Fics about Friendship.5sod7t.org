  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Gryffindors Never Die by chipmonkonspeed. It has its on core plot line and what not, but the main relationship emphasized throughout the story is Ron and Harry's, which is something a lot more rare than you'd think in fanfiction.

** This is one of the very few Harry/Draco friendship fics I can stomach. Something in the writing draws me in completely; I've read it at least 7-8 times over the years. Post GoF AU, though it is somewhat OttP compliant.

** Well, if you're looking for something relatively light-hearted, I'd recommend these:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9484514]]

/Dinner With the Weasleys/ is another great one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6222365/1/Dinner-at-the-Weasleys]]

Are you a fan of Peggy Sue (time travel) fics? Friendship is a major theme in /Nightmares of Future Past./ Harry goes back in time, because he wants his friends back. This one should keep you busy for a while.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past]]

Can't overlook the strength that is /Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection./ One of the most prominent subplots here is Luna's friendship with Ginny, and also with one of her shyer roommates.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1]]

And /Stages of Hope/ is simply superb. One of the very best.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope]]

There's also /A Night Without Stars./
