I see a lot of Ron bashing (not my cup of tea, but you do you --- imo most of Ron's flaws come from him simply being the most realistic teenage character in the whole series), but almost no stories where Ron is the main character. Any good ones out there?


** I agree that Ron was, without a doubt the most realistically human character in the series. He gets abused by writers of Fan Fiction because he's perfectly placed for it. He's perfectly placed to the Comedy relief, his bad habits from canon are easily amplified to supply a goof for the story, and he's close enough to Harry for betrayal to hurt him badly.

It's all too easy. I know, I've done it a lot.

But it also got me thinking. What if we changed not one aspect of his character, but gave him the motivation to be not the head sidekick, but the goddamned hero of the story?

Besides, I'd never given Ron the big damned powerup in a story... well, not seriously anyway.

Remember the Prewett cousin they don't talk about from the first book? He lives in the states in a sleepy little town called Blue Valley... and has a son named Wally.

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

** Dude. I just literally just started republishing my old Ron Weasley and the Philosopher stone like 2 weeks ago. Today I published chap3.

Ron travels back in time to first year. But not one of those ol' "Uber powerful saves everyone smoothly".... more like tries to keep timeline unchanged and return to his time without shit blowing all around him.

Canon compliant if you overlook the time traveling... and obviously heavy Ron/Hermione references... but I would say that this is a Ron story, not a Ron/Hermione story.

** Okay I know I'm super late, but here are my fave picks! There's a lot. Some probably will have already been suggested.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24897403]]) is also a time travel fix it, Ron-centric.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341]]) is just fucking good. It's where Hermione gets consequences for attacking Ron in HBP. I can't say any more cause it's just good.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12365883]]) is also quite good...Dark! Trio with OP characters and time travel to Lord Voldemort's time.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18561046]]) is also really good, follows Slytherin Ron. Oneshot

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16199003]]) is another Ron time travel fic. It's so good though. Like astounding.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16288199]]) is a time traveling Percy Weasley fic where he fucks himself up and tries to protect everyone.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23425024]]) is a hilarious Draco/Ron rom com.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1992918]]) is a oneshot where Ron comes back from summer after something terrible has happened to him.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/951044]]) is an amazing post hogwarts fic in which Ron and Draco have a lot to do with. Draco redemption, Ron and Harry friendship, Ron and Draco friendship.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498]]) is incredible. A series of what ifs, with 16 works, each about 8000 words.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2044746]]) is a poignant Ron whump fic. Oneshot.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24003130]]) it's a Ron becomes a vampire before 6th year fic.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4327485/1/]]) Ron and Hermione centric- set after DH

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]) Sadly will never be completed. Time traveling Ron!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12157282/1/]]) Percy centric but has a lot of Ron! What happens when the Weasley parents die and Percy has to take over?

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2594688/1/]]) Solstice Muse is an amazing author. Highly recommended for everything Ron!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13356023/1/]]) SI merged with Ron. It's actually incredible.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1806117/1/]]) Ron-centric. Ghost Ron where he dies and has to deal with those ramifications.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/]]) Oldie but a goodie! One shot but very well written.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13139083/1/]]) This one is simply incredible. The tale is spun so well. The anticipation. It's amazing. Follows Ron on his last case as an Auror, finding out Harry's family's darkest secret...

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1216035/1/]]) Chess game and Ron and Snape centric. Not a slash! Just good ol Death Eaters and a chess championship.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6905950/1/]]) Incredible Ron time travel fic where the tropes are thoroughly explored and discussed in a very realistic way.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/]]) The Red Knight. It's very well known, very well done. An all around great read.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4100736/1/]]) Incredible. Ron dealing with insecurities and family while taking care of an ailing Muriel.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5288841/1/]]) Ron centric, also dealing with Ron's insecurities!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3880365/1/]]) When Ron's exposure to the Horcrux exposes more than just his thoughts, they need to save him.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2954815/1/]]) and linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2929256/1/]]) Extreme Ron whump. What happens when Ron decides to take Harry's detention with Umbridge in his place?

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2333917/1/]]) Ron and Harry have more in common than they'd thought.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10199030/1/]]) Ron gets in over his head and is faced with terrible consequences.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12120803/1/]]) Ron, Harry and Hermione relationship. Oneshot

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12632772/1/]]) Ron has been missing for years. He may or may not have betrayed Harry. And why is Harry hearing his best friends voice all of a sudden in his head?

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11019962/1/]]) A oneshot exploration of Ron and Molly's relationship.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7523798/1/]]) Stay Standing. The original Ron whump fic that if you don't know you need to.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/]]) I'm sure you have this recommended already, but a very jaded Ron and Harry go back in time!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11491514/1/]]) Another time travelling Ron fic.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12742123/1/]]) Ron love to get away from all the bashing! An exploration of his many achievements.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7467796/1/]]) The other original Ron Slytherin fic. Choices.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12632781/1/]]) Powerful Ron with a power he doesnt know how to use. Incredibly well written. Incomplete but the author will be updating.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12868266/1/]]) An exploration of Ron and his family.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12870741/1/]]) Ron-centric and major whump. The Boogeyman is real and Ron knows this all too well...

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11595257/1/]]) How Ron and Snape become bros!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10024932/1/]]) What happens when Ron leaves on the Horcrux Hunt? To what lengths will he go to make it right?

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11598532/1/There-and-Back-Again]]). PeggySue Ron that died in the Hogwarts Battle coming back to first year. 

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13601689/1/Maroon-Eagle]]) New fic. Ravenclaw!Ron. (Obviously) Ron-centric.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866134/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Weasley-Seer]]) Ron's Divination predictions come true somehow. Becomes crackish in later chapters.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3637489/1/Six-Foot-Of-Ginger-Idiot]]). Ron's 6th year journal. Semi-canon compliant.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). 4th year, PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry, for that matter).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]). AU 6th year fic where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.
