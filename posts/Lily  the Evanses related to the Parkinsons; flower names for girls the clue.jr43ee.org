Pretty much "see title". There was a fic, it turned out the Evanses were related to the Parkinsons some ways back and both families had maintained the "all the girls get flower names" tradition; Pansy had to write to her family for permission before openly acknowledging the connection, iirc.

  “No, no-one. It's just, my mother and aunt have flower names, and so did my grandmother, and her mother before that. And my maternal grandmother's maiden name was Parkinson. So you see,” he babbled frantically, “I thought there might be a connection. Because you've got a flower name too, and you're a Parkinson.”

  “Well, you'll be pleased to know that I wrote to my father and after some investigation we did uncover a family connection. Two, in fact.” Pansy got out a scroll of parchment and unrolled it, pointing out some people on a family tree diagram. It looked like it was based off his one, but with lots of extra branches added it. Pansy's name was down the bottom, on the same level as his.

** The Perfectly Normal series is such a great story. I typically only stick to reading Slytherin Harry fanfics, but I was willing to break that cycle for that one. It might have one of, if not the best written Harry in any fanfic I've read. I'm going to cheer when Harry finally realises just what shit people the Dursleys are, and hopefully get over the mental conditioning they put him through.
