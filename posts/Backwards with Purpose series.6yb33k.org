I may be missing something on the internet, but am I correct in saying that Refuge of Hope hasn't been completed on some other random website that isn't FF.net?

** Thanks everyone. I'm just sad because this is quite possibly my favorite HP series, and it's a shame that the last two chapters may never see light.
