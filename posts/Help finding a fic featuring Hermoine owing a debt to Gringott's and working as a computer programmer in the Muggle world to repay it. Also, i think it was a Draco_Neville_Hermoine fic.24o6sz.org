I read this fic a few years ago and cannot locate it. It was set right after the end of the book series. Gringott's demands compensation for being smashed up. Harry has enough to pay for himself and one other person -- he chooses Ron because the Weasleys are poor. Hermoine has to work as a computer programmer, but she also works for the Ministry of Magic creating some sort of database of war crimes based on pensieve memories. She has a super time turner that she uses extensively, and she pushes her friends away as they become concerned about her overuse of the time turner.

Finally, I seem to remember Draco being emotionally shattered, and Hermoine and Neville slowly falling in love and eventually having some comfort threesomes with Draco.


** That would be [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/][Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1994264/Vera-Rozalsky][Vera Rozalsky]].

It's an amazing, immersive story that sadly hasn't updated for a year.
