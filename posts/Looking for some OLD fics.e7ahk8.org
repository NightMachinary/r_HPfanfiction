:FlairText: Help Please! What's That Fic?
:END:
So by old I mean at least a couple of years, so it's entirely possible that they don't exist anymore. I'll try to give as much detail as possible so hopefully somebody else knows what I'm looking for!

1) Set during school, I forget which year but I want to say past 3rd or 4th (so not younglings). Harry returns to Hogwarts for the new year after having found out that Snape, who he had always felt close to/respect for, is his biological father. He gets resorted into Slytherin. He and Blaise Zabini are best friends who are so close they make each other plates at dinner and they wear a kind of bonding-bracelet that has been enchanted with the help of a portrait (I think Slytherin's portrait actually) to cement them as brothers. In order to get the portrait to help them BZ had to swear to help HP stay pure because HP is the mate of a creature called the Draconian (I'm like 90% sure that's what it's called because I immediately went "Draco? Draco".). Legend has it that magic has been dwindling in the world in the past era, but when the Draconian and his mate meet and... mate... magic will be replenished (I think the imagery was something like it falling like snow). And wouldn't you know, the Draconian is Draco! Parts of the fic are told from Draco's perspective, how he's jealous of BZ's closeness to HP, and how he gets nervous about the bonding bracelets only to learn from their story that they are repurposed into Brotherhood bracelets and HP is the Draconian's mate. The only other thing I remember is that at the end everyone finds out, Ron tries to run his mouth, and then promptly gets shut down by somebody else because *these are really important people wow Ron geez*.

Key points: Harry as Snape's son, Harry/Draco, Harry & Blaise friendship, Slytherin!Harry. I have tried searching a mixture of these tags on both [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] (where I'm 99% sure I read the fic the first time) and AO3 (because that's the only other place I read fic) but have yet to find a match.

​

2) Severus Snape is sent to collect Harry instead of Hagrid. What he finds is a self-assured young man (even though I'm pretty sure he's still 11) who somehow made his relatives very wary of him and who looks very much like his dad (that being Snape). (Possibly important but impossible to search - when SS goes to look for HP he's not at the house, he's at a friend's house. I think in what would be the second book his friend turns out to be a witch but I'm not 100% certain.) When they get to Hogwarts he is sorted into Slytherin. Either on the steps of the Great Hall or down in Slytherin Common room he finds some people teasing Daphne Greengrass (I'm 90% certain it's her, I've been through almost every fic with that pairing and can't find it so maybe it's someone else? Only things I know for sure is that she is Slytherin and something along the lines of *composed even while crying*) about not having a betrothal contract yet, so he promptly drops down on one knee and offers one to her. [When SS comes in to give the Start of the Year Speech in the Common Room he asks who all has contracts and then raises his eyebrow when HP puts his hand up.]

Key points: Harry as Snape's son, Harry/Daphne?, Slytherin!Harry, possibly Grey!Harry.

​

At this point I've basically accepted that they're probably long gone, and I've found some other pretty good ones in the mean time, but if anyone out there can even tell me "yeah I can't remember the name but I think I know which one you're talking about" that'd be wonderful - I'm starting to think I've gone nuts!

Thanks!

** Have you looked through HPSlashAddict's favourited stories on ffn? Tried to search for the fics but couldn't find anything. Would love to read them though, so darn!

** That second one, just from your summary, seems pretty rich and interesting.
