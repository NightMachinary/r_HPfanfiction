Easily one of my favorite time-travel stories of all-time.

Easily one of the best slash fics of all-time.

Incomplete, but frequent updates.

Read it. If you're really against slash, this fic doesn't get explicit, and the pairing is done very well and realistically.

Harry is not OP. He struggles and makes mistakes and is wrong and, in general, has a severe lack of control in a lot of things.

(This is mostly just a summary from when I last posted regarding TSS)

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

** Seconded on the recommendation, as someone who usually doesn't read slash, I was surprised how much I liked this. One of the best stories in the fandom, really glad it updated!
