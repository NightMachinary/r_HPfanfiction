** That Harry actually is a parselmouth.

I know, I know, JKR said that he was only a parselmouth ‘cause of Voldemort, but I've had a headcanon for literal years now that Harry actually was born one and only realizes it years after Voldemort is defeated when Albus starts speaking parseltongue as a baby and he realizes that he still understands it and can speak it lol

That means both Harry and Ginny are parselmouths (and Ron is NOT, the liar), so they could easily pass it down to their children. Now there's another family besides Slytherin that can become known for that trait.

**** How much cooler would it have been in book seven if Ginny was the one to help Hermione and Ron down to the Chamber of Secrets. That sounds like an awesome scene to play out -- Ginny revealing that her exposure to the diary left her a parselmouth, then she has to return to the scene of the trauma, plus possibly being one to kill the horcrux in Hufflepuff's Cup. Totally would have proven her worth instead of an editorial note about her being Harry's 'soul-mate' or whatever.

The sorting hat wanted to put Harry Potter in Slytherin, but he belonged in Gryffindor. An alligator is a large predator, fierce as anything, covered in scales. Some people claim that Harry was secretly Slytherin on the inside, but honestly? Harry's Slytherin traits were pretty surface level. He's fearsome and brave and loyal at his core. Usually I go with turtle for Ron (for some varied reasons) so it's kinda cute that there's footage of them interacting non-lethally in a mutually positive way.

(I am technically writing a fic right now where basically the entire main light cast all seek their animagus form, it's kinda fun. The leonine three are guided by Remus to become animagi in third year, which leads to the discovery of Pettigrew faster and well everything derails from there. Also Lily dies in her animal form, a Deinosuchus, so make of that what you will.)

  In 1997, Voldemort had Antonin Dolohov and Thorfinn Rowle tortured with the Cruciatus Curse after they failed to capture Harry Potter. Hermione Granger had cast Memory Charms on them so as to cover the trio's tracks. It appears that the charms were not broken by torture, since the Death Eaters remained unaware that Ron Weasley was with Harry and Hermione, rather than sick at home with spattergroit, as had been claimed.[9] This may mean that a certain level of torture was necessary to break the charm, or that the torturer needed to be specific on wanting to break it, rather than just inflicting the pain.
#+end_quote

As per the Wikia page for Memory Charm. Unfortunately that citation just says "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", otherwise I'd get the actual book quote. But the point is Voldemort clearly worked out /something/ happened, and if he'd succeeded in breaking past the altered memory, he would not only get a lead on Harry's whereabouts, but Ron would be revealed to be travelling with Harry, putting the entire Weasley family at risk.

******** I think it's implied that the bulk of the psychological damage is from the charm breaking as opposed to the torture itself, in which case Dolohov being up an fighting only proves Voldemort failed, but it is kind of unclear, so I can see your point.

But I think we're beginning to argue academics here, far beyond the information Harry actually has when making the decision. He knows from Barty Crouch Jr.'s interrogation that Voldemort can break memory charms

"/[Voldemort] had captured Bertha Jorkins in Albania. He had tortured her. She told him a great deal. ... He tortured her until he broke thorough the memory charm my father had placed upon her/" GoF pg. 597 UK paperback

As far as I can recall that's the only time Harry hears anything about breaking memory charms. I think he knows what happened to Bertha, but there's nothing for him to really deduce that it's the breaking of the charm that damaged her, and not the constant torture, which Harry knows from Neville's parents is possible.

And Hermione admits that she's never done it before,

"'/Nor have I [done the charm],'" said Hermione, 'but I know the theory'/" - DH pg. 139 UK paperback

Compare this to Crouch, who as a member of the DMLE should probably have done this several times before, and his charm was broken.

And imo, given that Harry spent the entirety of the Battle of the Seven Potters lobbing stunning spells and/or disarming people and general being non lethal, killing them makes it look less likely it was Harry they came across.

So, it depends if Harry believes Voldemort willing to do that on his servant on a mere suspicion.

** That he is a secret bookworm. Many bullied children take refuge in the library (because even bullies can't get around a librarian), and you have to read to be allowed to stay there.

He doesn't show it because (1) Ron is his first friend and he doesn't want to alienate the clearly non-bookish boy, and (2) Hermione's example that being overly smart is the way to become a social pariah.

** Harry was a generally unlikable character, nasty, arrogant, spiteful, vindictive, self-entitled and, quite like Voldemort, a secretive loner. Unlike Voldemort, he had a kind loving side that he showed to Ron and Hermione, and to some extent to Ginny, Luna, Neville and the rest of the Weasleys, but only those people who saw his true side genuinely cared about him. Everyone else was drawn to him because of his celebrity status and later as a symbol for the resistance against Voldemort. Not even Sirius loves him for him (even if Harry gets attached to his godfather) but more because he is the embodiment of his memory of James. That's why it's so easy for people to turn against him whenever things go awry.

In turn, he is very biased drawing conclusions really quickly on people he doesn't like. For example, Snape was a bully sure, but he only took points from Gryffindor when Harry was a cheeky piece of shit or gave him detention when he seriously stepped out of line (insulting Snape in Book 4, attacking him in Book 6 and also almost killing one of his classmates and then blatantly lie about it again in Book 6). Yet that didn't stop Harry from putting every single blame on him, from trying to steal the Stone to being responsible for Sirius's death. Same with Colin Creevy who absolutely adored him, but all Harry could think of after the former sacrificed his life for him was that "he looked small in death".

*** Oh daymmmmm!! I've never heard this before. That's a very interesting take on Harry, and whilst I don't agree I definitely see where you're coming from, and I guess its down to perspective.

I think that Harry just never really opened up to many people. You even see that in his own house. Seamus is quick to turn because Harry never made an effort to be friends with him.

I definitely see what your saying tho, apart from his close friends, no one likes Harry for Harry, if they even like him at all. And the Snape thing I feel was mutual, although some of Harry's decisions were definitely down to his immatureness as a Kid.

**** I'm not excusing him at all, but being that I had my fair share of bully teachers who held on for dear life to the only form of authority they had kind of makes me see him like just that type of teacher. Whereas no one in my classes really hated those teachers but were more like "let them be", let alone accuse them of theft, murder or belonging to a terrorist organization. So Harry's hatred seems to me a little more unnatural than a frustrated shitty teacher.

On the list of issues people, and Harry, have with Snape detention and points are at the bottom of it if featured at all. Yet they're something people who go up for Snape mention all the time. Harry was quite respectful in his first class up until the very end of the questioning and even that wasn't horrible.

I can't remember him insulting Snape to his face unless this is after Snape says "I see no difference?"

Attacking? You mean when he verbally casts a Shield Charm to protect himself against Snape? If so that's not an attack. Or do you mean after Snape kills Dumbledore?

Shame he didn't kill Draco, who, incidentally, was trying to kill people.

**** Fr I hate when people use the Draco Harry bathroom fight against Harry. Like do they not remember that Draco attacked him, Draco was trying to kill Dumbledore almost killing two others in the process, Draco got cut off casting the cruciatus at Harry, and that Harry didn't know what Sectumsempra did? Like he shouldn't have used it, but up to that point the poitions book was filled with good notes and was positive in his schooling so he likely trusted it to not kill someone. I bet he thought for enemies was something like Levicorpus or the Bat Bogey Hex

**** I'm not going to waste too much time defending Snape because I don't like him that much either. But put yourself in the position of a student and do the things that Harry did to be warranted detention and tell me with a straight face that you wouldn't be out of line. I was just emphasizing the fact that overall, based on the interactions we see in the books, Snape was never unfair when subtracting points or giving detention, yet Harry always kept saying how unfair he is. If there was one thing unfair, was vanishing Harry's potions in the fifth year or humiliating him in the first class. But then again we only see things from Harry's point of view so we don't know exactly what Snape was thinking.

Truth is, that books don't offer an objective view of most of the circumstances. We cheer for Ginny when she hexes Zacharias Smith on the train for the simple fact that he asked some uncomfortable questions, but we feel sorry for Harry missing out a Quidditch game because he almost killed someone.

#+end_quote

Did Snape give Malfoy detention for hexing Hermione? Was it fair to deduct points because Harry was late in HBP? Harry absolutely deserved detentions. Unfairness is due to the fact that Slytherins are not punished by Snape and mentions of it are littered throughout the series.

  what Snape was thinking
#+end_quote

Except there's a chapter full of Snape's memories in which he tells us exactly what he thinks of Harry before Harry does anything besides say "Hermione knows the answer. Ask her" or whatever he said. Snape was biased and nasty from the very beginning and there are moments, where points and detentions aren't a factor, to show this.

And no, we don't cheer on Ginny, a lot of people don't cheer on Hermione's cruelty, a huge part of the fandom hated Harry crucioing Amycus.

Edit: yes, Harry almost killed someone who was also almost killed people /and/ had tried to use an unforgivable on Harry.

** It's sort of a few of them and one is more a general one

Oliver and later Angelina's training wasn't just sitting on broom and flying. It usually required much more running, calisthenics and slight weight training. Which by 6th year has paid off in That Harry is in Insanely good shape.

While Harry didn't hit Dudley out of fear of being punished, that didn't prevent him from hitting Malcolm and the other goons in Dudley's gang and Harry has quite the set of heavy hands and even a bit of knock out power when fighting hand to hand.

Harry is a top 15 student in Hogwarts on his own merits, so many Ravenclaws specialize in a class or two while Harry is very good at all his wanded class and most others. This adds to his popularity since he while not a show off is still a pretty good student.

Harry is actually pretty good friends with his fellow Gryffindors in his year. While not Ron and Hermione level, they are all pretty good friends with each other and during school have a weekly game night in Gryffindor tower.

Harry lost his Virginity between 5th and 6th years to a Muggle girl in Little Winging, she also helped him mourn Sirius and even Cedric somewhat. They broke up pretty amicably mostly since it was just a Summer Fling when he got Albus's letter.
