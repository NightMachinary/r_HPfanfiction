** It was interesting to see Hermione lean on her Slytherin side (goal-focused and willing to make whatever sacrifices are necessary) in linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds). I've finished it and /still/ don't understand the title, but it's about Hermione being sent back to stop Rookwood from meddling with the final battle and blowing everyone up. She has to go all the way back to first year, though, to find a suitable body to inhabit.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10991501/1/][/Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance/]] by epis10n is pretty neat. Salazar Slytherin forcefully reincarnates himself as an old man and is reborn a millennium down the line as Hermione Granger and goes about trying to fix his/her reputation.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318951/1/The-Archeologist][/The Archaeologist/]] by Racke has an adult Harry sort of plonked in an alternate timeline in his dead sister's body after a curse breaking job goes bad.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/][/Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool/]] by the Mad Mad Reviewer is similar to /The Archaeologist/, but a bit more fucked up.
