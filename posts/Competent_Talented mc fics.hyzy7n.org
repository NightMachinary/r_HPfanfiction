I'm looking for a novel with a competent/talented mc. They don't need to be the next Merlin but beyond canon Harry in terms of school and stuff. He shouldn't be as powerful as adult Dumbledore or anything like that, but anything realistic, so even as talented as a young Tom or Dumbledore is fine but it doesn't need to be that talented.

I prefer a male mc without slash for the mc (any other characters is fine) because let's be honest this is low key wish fulfillment and im a straight dude. I'd also prefer long stories like 100k+ words. No harems please.

I've read a lot from fanfiction.net so if you have stories from other sites there is a lower chance I've read them, but any site is fine.

Thanks in advance, I really appreciate it.

*** Thanks. The first one looks great and I've never seen it. I've seen the third one mentioned a bunch but somehow I've just never read it. Maybe this will give me the push to start it.

**** Fair warning for the third one, it seems to be abandoned and I'm pretty sure it wasn't completed last I looked.

***** Yeah I know I've seen it a bunch and it's word count never changes. It's too bad.

** DrT has several stories that meet your criteria, assuming mc means male character, but they're hard to find.

[[https://ficwad.com/story/15333]] is The Saga of the White Warlock, you have to create an account on the site and log in but it's free. The character in question is a Runes professor who I think you will like.

[[https://fictionalley.ikeran.org/authors/drt/]] The first three stories on this page, the first being Relations so I think of it as the Relations series, has an older cousin of Harry's who has been unavailable to him for the first years of his life but comes into it the summer after 4th year, I believe. I think you will like him too.

All of DrT's stories are phenomenal and I maintain copies against the fear they will vanish completely because I reread his whole bibliography every year or two.

*** Thanks for the rec. They look good. I'll check them out. Mc means main character, though I did specify that I wanted them male.

**** Oh yes I see that now. Glad I hit the nail mostly on the head and if you like these, read all his stuff, it's so good.
