I'm honestly in a mood for slight Dumbles-bashing or manipulative!Dumbles for justification of hiding Harry away, but my main focus was for fics where Harry undergoes training before and/or during Hogwarts in some fashion where his capabilities and/or identity are for the most part hidden. I'm partial to fics like Quoth the Raven, Who Dares Wins, and Growing Up Black. I am tolerant of fics like Partially Kissed Hero, Harry Potter and the Iron Lady, and Hawk-Eyed Charlie (I know these last two are kinda over-the-top mugglewank but they certainly fit, again I'm tolerant of them but if we're gonna include muggles as a core part of the story it shouldn't really be at the complete expense of the fact wizards are overpowered. This isn't even to mention that PKH is basically God!Harry, it is entertaining for its ridiculousness).

Can be BWL or WBWL. Can be Light, Gray, or Dark Harry. Preferably HP/HG or HP/LL if we're including romantic relationships but others are fine if they're developed well instead of just thrown together (this applies to the preffed relationships too, I like these ships because the fics I found usually built them up well). Preferred not genderbent characters for the duration of the story. Can be Complete or WIP (if abandoned it should be something you've felt is particularly inspiring, unique, and/or overall worth to have read).


** If you don't mind the crossover elements my own Linkffn(The Kyle Side) might work. Harry gets hidden away and trained. On another world. By a grumpy old Jedi master. Rated T for space Chuck Norris kicking people in the head.

** That is the main plot for linkao3(Of A Linear Circle) if you're up for a big read? It really goes out of its way to specifically point out all the reasons why Dumbledore is a big ol manipulative asshole, it's so very cathartic to read ,üòä. One chapter is just an itemized list üòä.

It's also incredibly written with a lot of lore and history and world building it's my absolute favourite story üòä

It's really good, 2 out of the 3 books are complete, unfortunately abandoned on the third. However it is well worth the emotional agony of realizing it won't be finished

** Not quite so much training, but leans heavily on the "Dumbledore didn't care about Harry at all" idea.

  ‚ÄúJust... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.‚ÄùWhat was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
