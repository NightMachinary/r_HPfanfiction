** Only one that doesn't do something stupid (like changing the name of the class) that I can think of is linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt by DisobedianceWriter). Incomplete with only three chapters, and s/he has a kind of strange authorial voice.

*** I was so excited when I found this fic. I reread it and thought I know just the thread to recommend this in. I came back and found you'd already recommended it before I'd even posted here the first time. I feel like an idiot. Good recommendation though.

** There's one I remember where the new teacher comes in and puts the class in pairs with each pair trying to solve the curse. Harry is paired with Pansy I think and she refuses to help. In the end the professor reveals that the curse was linked to the Professor saying "My name is professor..." and they break the curse because of that. I can't recall any more though...

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

Hogwarts never has strife with Ministry and DADA lessons end up being taught by aurors, who switch after the year.

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.
