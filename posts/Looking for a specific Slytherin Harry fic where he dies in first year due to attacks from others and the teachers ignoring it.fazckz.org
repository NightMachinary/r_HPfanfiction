I believe he becomes a ghost/spirit and stays in hogwarts after? it partially changes peoples views of the houses and goes deeper into how he was unfairly treated by the teachers when asking for help before he died.


** Was it this?

***** But it is sensible. Fate as a deity in a fanfiction would probably not appreciate the subject of her prophecy being killed. Why? Because then her will isn't followed.

****** A) "Lady Fate" rarely crops up in fanfiction as a character.

B) The assumption that a ghost BWL would create chaos is nonsense when the power he knows not could be ghostliness.

C) Harry dying at the hands of Voldemort's Slytherin supporters could arguably satisfy the prophecy anyway.

D) Who cares if it "creates chaos" or "upsets Lady Fate" the OP is clearly looking for a specific fic as per their request not for some random poorly worded criticism of the premise of that fic.

So that's why it got downvoted, it wasn't a sensible comment and it didn't help the OP find the fic they were looking for in any way.

********** I'm on mobile so I'm not sure if it's the same on desktop (but it probably is) but the only real way to know is whether the number is in the positives or the negatives. Sometimes someone will comment "why are you being down voted?" On a comment/post with a positive number of upvotes because originally they were being down voted when they were commenting and then later upvoted.

Sometimes the number doesn't show up. It may show up later. I'm not sure why this happens. But if the comment has been hidden (you have to click it to read it) then it's probably in the negatives.

** So someone killed a first year at Hogwarts, and it just changes some opinions? Said first year being the boy whole lived, Harry Potter? Doesn't sound like a very well thought out story.

*** Having your link be a google cache of a whatchamacallit of reddit was probably unnecessary, but I did find linkffn(6128212) Black Dawn and its prequel Lost Hope. By the description, it sounds like what we're after.

  Sequel to Lost Hope. If the Wizarding World thought normal would be restored following the death of Harry Potter, the House of Black has news for them. So too did the new ghost...who's kind of green.
