Hey all

I recently rediscovered this fic in my favorites list, and I'm wondering what happened to the author? Of course it's very abandoned now, but I'm still curious.

** Just a sidenote: Please don't link to the last chapter of a fic. Thats like handing someone a book with the last pages opened.

*** Is hair transplant surgery hard? I don't mean to be insensitive (I seriously don't know) , but I know some great authors who fought Cancer while writing. (I agree they should care more about themselves, and that writing shouldn't be a burden. They have their own lives.)

But um, is this, like, the reason they stopped writing for so long? I mean, I don't mind! But do they plan to continue or not? Because I honestly love this fic so much.

***** Curse my naive personality. Why am I like this.

This reminds me of the time I was getting an app and they said in the rules that 1. You had to have a working brain.

Someone asked how to get Brain.apk Not me, thankfully.

** I am still alive, though I admit my output (especially when it comes to my older fanfics) is less than adequate. I've attempted to force out new updates, mostly to get the ball rolling again, but thus far it's been a relatively unsuccessful endeavor, even with the urging of numerous DLP busybodies.

Some of my more recent projects that share some commonality with W&S include my Marvel CYOA story '[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/stark-transcendent-iron-man-marvel-quest.3513/#post-467578][Stark Transcendent]]', though your mileage may vary on the writing style of that genre (and it, too, suffers from some abandonment issues.) as well as a read-through of the complete [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dooms-day-has-come-lets-read-marvels-doctor-doom.46067/][history of Doctor Doom]] (I am currently about 7 years in, arriving at the 1970s.)

Other miscellaneous writing tends to be released on Sufficient Velocity first, particularly since some of it is related to Worm, which is concentrated mostly on that forum & its parent Space Battles.

If you feel you can influence me to continue any of my fics, feel free to toss me a PM or bug me on IRC or Discord - I'm not hiding! :)
