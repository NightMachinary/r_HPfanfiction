Hey friends! Do we have actual confirmation on how the trace works?

Some people say it's attached to the wand, others say it's something that just detects magic in an area and places that don't typically have magic but have under age magicals must be under age magic.

I'm looking for theories on how it might actually work, whether it actually conforms to canon or not. Let me know what you think! Thanks loves!


** As far as we know from canon this is how the trace works.

The Trace is on a wizard, but its considered next to impossible to remain after the 17th birthday, the trace reports what kind of magic was used in proximity to the underage wizards and where it was used, but it doesn't report who used the magic, neither does it report whose trace reported the magic.

This result in the Restriction of Underage Sorcery being unenforceable by the ministry in a magical household, and causes them to rely on parents to make sure their kids dont use magic outside of school.

It also allowed Tom Riddle to get away with using magic to murder his family when he was 16, since the trace wouldn't have told the ministry who used the magic and even that he was nearby when the whole thing happened. He planted further evidence against his uncle by using his wand and altering his memory, but thats irrelevant to the trace.

For the way the trace seems enforced, it looks like they just receive an alteration that a certain piece of magic was cast near an underage wizard at a certain location, and then they just look up the local underage wizards and should there be no adult wizards there, it would result in them getting a warning by the ministry.

Thats why when Dobby used magic near Harry, in his home, when he is the only wizard living in the neighborhood resulted in him getting a warning by the ministry.

** [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Trace][Yep]].

Long story short, detects any magic around underage wizards with certain exceptions being some magical items (brooms) and creatures (thestrals.)

Children with magical parents aren't likely to get a warning like there muggle-raised counterparts as they can't detect if it was actually the child that cast the spell or not. Any magic in areas with muggle-raised wizards in training is attributed to the child as its unlikely for another magically inclined being to be in the area.

*** We know adult wizards can have a shielding effect on magic detection spells, as evidenced by Dumbledore and Harry in the cave in book 6.

** My personal favorite is that the Trace is a part of the wand. When a witch or wizard first gets their wand bound to them, the Trace activates on them, to be broken when they reach 17. If any magic is done around them, then a notice will be sent to the Ministry, however this won't happen if the Trace senses another, un-Traced wand near the Traced one. It's somewhat contrived but it's really one of the few ways to explain it.

1) The Trace clearly isn't connected to the magic the wand uses itself, otherwise it wouldn't have gone off because of Dobby.

2) Adults are free to use magic around Harry (eg The Order showing up at Privet Drive in book 5, and Dumbledore taking him to the cave in book 6)

3) It can't simply be linked to a general area (unless it's just within someone's house), otherwise any magic used in that area would be blamed on a kid. Harry was at least a few blocks away from Privet Drive in book 5 when he cast the Patronus, and if that were the case then any wizards who happened to do magic within that area would be mistaken for Harry.

4) It doesn't make sense that kids in wizarding homes would get free reign to use magic as it's left up to the parents to discipline them. In Muggle homes, it seems to be a 2 or 3 strike and you're out policy (if you count Marge as strike 2 in Harry's case). It could be that Harry is a special case and another kid in the same situation wouldn't be expelled/put on trial, but he's all we have to go by. And no one in the Wizengamont really seems shocked by it. So if you get a warning or two then expulsion for underage magic (not breaking the Statute, as he was on trial for the underage magic rule), then giving other kids free reign doesn't make sense. Though this could be explained by people like Lucius bribing their way to let their kids do magic at home, the only other explaination is that they don't have a perfect system that allows them to differenciate between a kid's magic and magic going on around them (as shown above with the Dobby/adults using magic around Harry).

I'd love to hear other theories on how it works, but this is what I came up with when thinking about all the examples of magic being used by/around underaged students throughout the series. Although one advantage of this system is that, if you were to buy an un-Traceable wand, and use it, you could do all the magic you want and not be caught. +Or, if the Trace still sends notifications to the Ministry but notes that there are other wands around without the Trace, then you could leave your normal wand at home and go out with your un-Traced wand, and not be tracked at all.+

EDIT: This would also explain, 1, why the Trace didn't activate in the Graveyard during book 4, and Voldemort and Wormtail had wands, especially since, if the Ministry got /any/ notification at all they'd see the Unforgiveables being used (so, ignore the striked-out part above). 2) It would explain why none of Harry's accidental magic was registered prior to him starting Hogwarts. Even if the Trace was placed on the kids themselves rather than the wand, the rules definitely seem to be the same either way.
