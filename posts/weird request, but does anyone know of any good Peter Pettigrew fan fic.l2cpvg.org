I love reading Marauder's era fanfic, but the one issue is that across the board there isn't very good characterization of Peter. And it's obvious why, nobody wants to give the guy any positive characteristics given that he's the fucking worst, so it's probably hard to write his character given what he did. BUT it doesn't really make sense for him to be characterized as dumb/pathetic/irrelevant when they're young (like he usually is in Marauder's fanfics) because he was trusted by Lily, James, and Sirius enough to be made the secret keeper so he had to have been a valued member of the group rather than just their charity case. Also, in order to plan framing Sirius for everything, he had to be manipulative, smart, and like 5 steps ahead of Sirius the whole time. So I think a more accurate portrayal of young Pettigrew would be someone whose very cunning and helps the Marauder's think ahead and not get caught for some of their pranks. I also think it would be super interesting to read about how he starts out a good guy who is one of James's best friends and eventually devolves to the point that he's an evil coward that is responsible for all of their downfalls.

Bonus points if your recommendation for a Pettigrew fan fic includes wolfstar 🥰

Also sorry if this has been requested before, I'm brand new to this sub!

  Peter had learned from an early age that magic was about intent first and foremost, and if he wanted something badly enough, he could make it happen.

**** Absolutely. He's far and away the best thing in that story so far, although there's a distinct possibility that The Toymaker is going to make a late sprint to pip him at the post.

The Death Eaters generally in that story are brilliant, actually. Reasonable people may differ on the merits of Prince of Slytherin generally, but that the author Gives Good Villain is /undeniable/.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Linkao3(Peter Pettigrew and the Deathly Hallows by AverageFish) is decently readable and I like the take on who and why Peter was. It's a time travel/fixit, however, it is not Marauders era.

  Joining the Order was easy, a chance to die for their beliefs. It was much harder to live with his own choices, each worse than the next, until all he had left was to face the person he had become.This is the story of a man who survived, like a cockroach. This is the story of a man who did the wrong things for the right reasons, a man who betrayed everything he was and is now trying to make things right. A Peter reincarnated as Harry redemption fic you didn't even know you wanted. No character bashing---Peter's character is very relatable. Falling down the slippery slope of your own decision-making is so much more human than rat.AN: No Horcruxes AU. The pairings are tagged, so slash-haters are forewarned of some fleeting teenage crushes, but there won't be any underage relationships. Betad by Eider Down.

** Saving Connor by Lightningonthewave on FF was super good and had a super interesting Peter Pettigrew. He wasn't the MC though and he isn't around much just a little but I found him really interesting. It's a darker fan fiction that I always call in my head “the adult version of Harry Potter”. Voldemort is worse, and smarter, Dumbledore is also evil, Harry does have a twin brother, unfortunately there isn't wolfstar. It is a Draco/Harry pairing. It's a different perspective of all seven books and it's hundreds of chapters long. The books get longer as they continue. I definitely recommend but super long books aren't for everyone and there is a lot of dark themes as you get closer to the final battle.
