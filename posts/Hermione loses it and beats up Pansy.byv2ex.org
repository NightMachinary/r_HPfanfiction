** There's plenty like that. Linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) even has a little more brutal torture.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

*** That was my first thought. I'm sure there are more stories that have a more mundane version of Hermione beating up Pansy, but that fic turns it into an important plot moment.

** Why would she bother with Pansy? Draco is the one who usually earns everyone's ire.

Sorry I can't help, sadly.

*** Ignoring her being a blood-purist, Pansy is kind of a racist in canon. And Hermione might be black. I'm kidding, it's mostly because canon Pansy is pretty much a female version of Malfoy.
