I really want to give those marginalized ships a chance, like, it's fanfiction, we shouldn't be that judgey. Slash accepted and welcome. (I mean, I love SS/HG stories and honestly might be my favourite ship in fanfiction world, and I get so much backlash for it. So, shed a light on your favourite yet misunderstood ships!)


** I don't know if this is controversial, but Snape/Neville is definitely not common. Warning for major character death. The story is called [[http://yearningvoid.net/stories/julad/000080.html][Night-blooming Heartsease by Julad]]. If you're familiar with an older Harry/Draco story called Transfigurations, this is the prequel.

*** I absolutely love this fic. Neville's POV isn't the only great thing about it, but the author nails it.

Also, OP, this is an old fic, so it goes way off-book from canon, and Snape isn't quite in character. However, he's definitely book!Snape, not Rickman!Snape, which is a big plus in his favor.

** There's linkffn(8615605) - it's very well written, with probably the best version of """mentor""" Snape that I can think of and keeps him very much in character... But the (eventual/never actualized) pairing of Harriet/Snape is obviously offputting.

Not sure if it qualifies, though - the fic doesn't have the pairing in it, and the sequel seems to have died out before that point. However, it's well worth a read to see a fun interpretation of Snape.

(I'm not a big fan of the planned pairing, but it's well written enough for me to overlook it)

*** I /am/ a Snape/Harry fan and not usually into genderbending either of them, but this fic is brilliantly written, even though I think everyone wanders in and out of character here and there. It also has a lovely, bittersweet depiction of Sirius/Remus and plenty of plot. Since I'm not that interested in a het version of Snape/Harry, I'm not bothered that we never arrive at the actual romance, although I'll be delighted if laventadorn decides to pick up the story again someday. She's just that good.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. Future Snape/Harriet. Sequel "No Journey's End" (Ootp - DH) is now posting.

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.
