** Just a couple of things...

'Sonny' doesn't seem particularly Scottish to me, so I don't think Moody would use it over anyone else. It actually sounds American to my ears?

Truck is American too. Brits would call it a van or a lorry.

What does 'kettle' mean in America?

I also thought the Oxford comma was American, but I'm not great on grammar so stand corrected on that!

Lots of Brits do say 'kid' - it's very common in Manchester ('our kid', for example)

School nurses are (were?) common in Britain, so while Pomfrey is principally called a matron in HP it wouldn't be incorrect to call her a school nurse.

*** My dad is Scottish and he's never said Sonny. He tends to call male children "laddie" or "laddo". Sonny is, to my ears at least, violently American.

I have no idea what the Yanks think a kettle is, but I know they don't have electric kettles in their kitchens. Barbaric I know...!

Yep, the Oxford comma is more likely to be disputed in British English, it's used in America far more commonly than here. It's still /correct/ though.

I think the "kid" point is a valid one - us Mancs do say "our kid" but in general "kid" on its own wouldn't be used as a term of endearment or whatever. We would refer to "my kids" meaning "my offspring", but the "here's lookin' at you, kid" kind of usage (that so many fics have Sirius doing) isnt very British sounding.

Posh boarding schools don't have nurses, they have matrons. Hogwarts is based on posh boarding schools. She's a matron. A "school nurse" is an American concept. In state day schools in the UK, we have "qualified first aiders." We don't employ someone specifically to be a nurse, we just send random staff members to get first aid qualified and send kids to the hospital or home if it's serious. Posh boarding schools do have a live in nurse, but she is known as a matron. (Source - i worked in a school)

And the state primary school I attended had a nurse but she was only part time - I think she went to other schools too. I am very old though so this may no longer be common. My secondary school had a nurse as well but she was hardly ever there, I have no idea why.

***** Yeah, if it's a school where there's a lot of health conditions or its a special school I can imagine there would be a nurse. Out of interest, is your nurse employed by the school direct or by the NHS?

The nurses who go into primary schools tend to be employed by the NHS and go in on specific days for specific reasons - they aren't there to fix everyday injuries in my experience, they'll come in to do the nit check or whatever but if you skin your knees you just get sent off to nice Mrs Evans who teaches Year Three and has done the first aid course most recently!

Your secondary school nurse probably wasn't there all the time because she was nurse at other schools too, which is different to Madam Pomfrey who works 24/7 out of Hogwarts, is employed exclusively by Hogwarts, has her own hospital wing in Hogwarts and so on. That's what makes her the matron - she has her own domain and is school staff, not just a visiting or part time health worker.

******* I think Sister is something really specific but I'm not sure what exactly. A "ward sister" is the nurse in charge of a ward in a hospital, so maybe if they're called that in a school they're in charge of a group of nurses?

True, she does play with the format. But Pomfrey is specifically described as the matron on at least one occasion in canon. I think the difference between a nurse and a matron is that a nurse just fixes ailments, whereas a matron is in charge of "domestic arrangements" as well - like she can give you a prescription or insist you have a specific diet and so on - which given at least 50% of fanfic has Poppy insisting that Harry takes nutrient potions and instructing the elves to give him specific food deffo makes her a matron!

**** The term "yanks" is typically an insult to Americans, you know, not that I think anyone really reacts much to it, mind. And I believe a kettle is what people put on their stovetops to heat up their water for tea? No idea what anyone would think it is otherwise unless you're thinking that it's the cauldron looking thing kettle corn is made in. I've never personally seen one of those, though, only googled it. My gram uses a kettle for her tea, though it's not electric. I typically use a coffee maker for my tea as I don't have a kettle and I'm not keen to use one, actually. The coffee maker is perfectly fine for me and I don't have to waste time soaking a tea bag in a mug.

***** A term that's more used in American on American insults though, given the southerners call all the northerners "yankees." I think it actually predates the civil war though and was originally a British insult to those who left for the new world. Most Brits these days use it to be affectionately insulting, because that's our thing, the ruder we are to you the more we like you ;)

Kettles in the UK are electric. Safer and faster. Stovetop kettles haven't been widely used over here since the 1960s. So, if you don't use a teabag, you put the tea in the coffee machine the way you would with coffee beans or something? I think this is why Americans often don't like tea - you're not brewing it hot enough. Black tea needs to be made with boiling water, whereas the optimal temp for coffee is around 85 Celsius.

****** In my family we make our tea by boiling three family size bags of tea in a kettle filled to capacity. Then let the kettle sit on a trivet on the counter for a couple of hours to steep and cool. Once the tea is cooled off we pour it into a plastic gallon pitcher and fill it the rest of the way up with water. The pitcher is placed in the fridge and can last us a couple of days. We mostly only drink tea and water at home. We drink it over ice, with or without sweet n low and or lemon juice.

I don't really get why an electric kettle would be safer. We used to have one, [[https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1745/8107/products/IMG_1612_800x.jpg?v=1577820666][like this]], but if memory serves it took a long time to finish making, just like coffee pots. We fell out of using it in favor for a regular kettle because half of all the ice that we ever made had to go into the pitcher just to melt as soon as the tea started dribbling into the pitcher. This was back before our freezer had an automatic ice maker. The cooling process still does take a while, but getting the water hot takes a lot less time, and frankly I find the regular kettle more satisfying.

Only damn northern yankee scum (this is a good natured joke by the way) would be uncivilized enough to not appreciate a good glass of tea.

******* Electric kettles in the UK take about three minutes to boil the water. Which you then pour over the teabags or tea leaves that are in a warmed pot or cup. People in the UK don't drink iced tea (not homemade anyway, you can buy flavoured iced tea in bottles in sandwich shops or whatever but I have never known anyone regularly make their own in this way). Tea is drunk hot, with milk (or lemon juice for certain types). You do /not/ boil the tea in the kettle. You boil the water to make the tea.

For the purposes of HP fanfic, which is set in the UK usually in the 80s and 90s, absolutely no one would drink iced tea. It's only taken off here as a soft drink in recent years. If a character talks about heating the kettle, they are heating water to pour into a teapot or mug to make hot tea.

Microwaves are more powerful and will often heat water to above boiling temp, which cooks the tea rather than just heating it enough to release the flavour. It makes it bitter tasting rather than aromatic. We call it "stewed" over here, and you want your tea brewed not stewed!

Sort of the same as how you shouldnt make coffee with boiling water straight from the kettle, because you burn the beans and they taste wrong, or if you make green tea you should let the water cool down to about 93¬∞ because the "overcooked" flavours for that tea come in at a lower temp.

******* I meant really in terminology. In a boarding school, she's the matron and that's what they'd call her. In most state schools there isn't one permanently employed "school nurse," if a child is injured it's usually a teaching assistant with a first aid qualification that tends to them, although there are nurses who's job it is to go around schools doing things like nit checks, injections, and health education. But they dont run a ward, most day schools dont have any kind of hospital wing, just a room with a comfy chair and maybe one bed if you're lucky!

Yeah, school matrons especially back in the day usually were former nurses but it wasn't a requirement. A school matron in a boarding school is more than just a nurse, she's involved in "domestic arrangements" - so like the laundry service for the bedsheets for the dorms, doing the purchase orders for cleaning, sanitary, and health products and so on. She's expected to be qualified in first aid and basic healthcare, sure, and probably will have nursing experience, but it's not a requirement that she's been a hospital nurse.

My primary school genuinely did have a designated area, but I agree a hospital wing (ward) is more applicable to a large boarding school. I would say that Hogwarts fulfils that category.

Actually, now I think of it - my secondary school had a full time nurse. Office in the front room and a bed in the back room. I avoided it like the plague except for when my friend hassled me into collecting emergency tampons. One of my primary schools had a similar set up, the other didn't.

I suppose it depends on where you are with the value of drop ins? One school I worked in, in England only had nurses come in for flu vaccinations. In Scotland, the school acts more of a hub - though of course normal GP/dentistry exists.

Tbh, it looks like the remit of school nursing has very recently expanded: [[https://services.nhslothian.scot/SchoolNursing/Pages/The-new-school-nursing-role.aspx]]

If he is Scottish, I'd say he's a very English sounding Scotsman. Although we see McGonagall as sounding very formal with Scottish English, Mad-Eye is more informal and both the syntax and word choices don't follow casual Scottish.

** I'm with you for the most part, good reminders about characterization through voice, plus some important Briticisms.

‚Äã

I feel like once you got to Magical Britain not being a backwater country you shifted more towards opinion. In book canon we are given no next to no understanding of other magical countries outside of Britain, and absolutely nothing outside of the Eurocentric wand based form of magic.

Hogwarts has teachers like Snape, Binns, and Trelawny, creatures like acromantula, trolls, and basilisks, and continual near deaths like Ron, Katie, Harry(x100), the muggleborn during year 2, etc.

Britain has Public Officials like Umbridge and Fudge, rampant corruption and bribery, summary executions, a punitive system using literal soul sucking demons, imprisonment without trial on multiple occasions, and systematic racial oppression of multiple sentient species.

‚Äã

Those are objectively bad things that I get to shit on if I want to.

‚Äã

That being said, writing every other country as perfectly civilized bastions of utopia that look down on the filthy British prancing about in the muck is bad writing. Writing as if the wand based magical methodology of canon HP is laughingly weak in the face of other methods is bad writing too. Bad writing is bad and I get to shit on that if I want to too.

***** A couple of factors imo.

- They have extremely stringent standards. McGonagall says that since Tonks was accepted there hasn't been a candidate in three years

- Training, like SOF units, is long. Auror training takes place over the course of three years.

- They could have operational jurisdiction in other countries, given that Kingsley said that he was misleading the hunt for Sirius by saying he was in.

The books are vague about what Aurors do, but given their status of the elite I'd liken them to elite police units like CTSFO or an SOF unit like SEALs, Rangers, SAS etc. If a real life comparison is too limiting, think of Aurors as magical 00 agents or a magical Jason Bourne.

** The "master" thing is an interesting one - clearly in canon JKR is using the old fashioned use of "master" - ie a male teacher ("Mr Smith was the Geography Master") and that's made very clear when he refers to himself as "master of this school." Back in the day, schools were staffed by "masters" and the ultimate authority was the "headmaster." I think places like Eton still refer to their teachers as masters.

BUT I don't think it's a problem if people want to make Snape a "potions master" as in he has a masters degree in potions. If you have an MA or and MSc, you are known as a Master of Arts or a Master of Science. So there's no logical reason that as well as being the potions master (teacher), he can't also be a master of potions. Plenty of teachers have masters degrees.

*** Cuppa is fine. If your character is from the North of England, they may also ask for or offer a "brew", which also means tea. I love it when authors make Snape say this one btw, he canonically lives in a mill town so is 80% likely to be from the north and brew can also mean make a potion, and the double meaning amuses me for some reason.

The Malfoys of course would never offer a cuppa or a brew. They would ask if their guest would like "tea", or a "pot of tea" just so we all know that Malfoys don't brew in cup like a Muggle builder üòâ

**** The idea of Snape asking someone if they want a brew is really making me laugh for some reason, sorry! Idk I always headcanon him as wanting to distance himself from his origins, I imagine him deliberately trying to adopt a more 'upper-class' English accent to fit in with his peers.

*** It's quite common, but you shouldnt have a "posh" character saying it. It's very casual, and most commonly associated with regional dialects, but not always - middle class people sometimes say it too, but they might be being playfully ironic. Otherwise you can also just have "d'you want a tea/drink?"

More likely to be adults that say it too, and more likely to be women. But that's not a hard and fast rule and plenty of men say it too.

  You have to be careful where you choose to chop off Hagrid's end-consonant. If you overdo it, then readers will lose interest, become confused, or just skip the dialogue or exit the fic out of annoyance.
#+end_quote

Can confirm. English isn't my first language and I often struggle to understand what Hagrid and Fleur are talking about. And McGonagall on occasion when she's angry. Lately, I just skip their dialogue if it's in an accent.

Not that there is anything wrong with accents. I probably also have an atrocious accent when speaking. However, I certainly don't /write/ in one.

**** JKR advised that McGonagall was Scottish which is why Dame Maggie Smith used the accent. So she almost certainly has a Scottish accent, but it doesn't show in her quotes.

JKR says she grew up in the highlands so she almost certainly has a naturally strong accent, but I'd put good money on her toning it down for work - I know people who work in customer service on phones and do this, to save the hassle of not being understood. To an extent people tone things down when talking to me, though I'm fairly immersed/live in an area with relatively mild accents.

To this end, I can well imagine that McGonagall code switches when relaxed. This could be how her angry accent comes out, though we haven't proof that anger does bring it out.\\

I've linked a couple of examples of Scots plus a slang humour page. SMostly for shits and giggles. Additionally, my favourite words are probably 'cheesing', 'raging', 'greeting' 'scran', the 'morn' and 'wido'. I have mixed feelings about 'muckle'. Unsurprisingly, I am as as stereotypically English as they come. Oh, and Scots especially isn't regional to McGonagal.

I just want to emphasize how /completely/ she lost it (when she learns that Dumbledore left Harry overnight in the English November night; that's slightly AU, but I cannot imagine how otherwise sensible woman would let that happen; Dumbledore is the old guy who never touched a baby in his life, I guess).

** You make a few nice points. I also disagree with some of the opinions.

However my issue is with ‚Äúall right‚Äù versus ‚Äúalright‚Äù. These do not mean the same thing. Please don't use them interchangeably. This is one of my biggest pet peeves, if you care about aesthetics or that much use a thesaurus. Some alright substitutions include; satisfactory, acceptable, adequate, fine.

For example: if your essay was alright, you clearly could have done better, whereas if your essay was all right you could not have.

** Just wanted to add, when writing stories or fabrics, in this case, you really don't have to write accents into a character's dialogue. For example Fleur's French accent. Seriously, adding all the "Ze" and all that takes away from the writing and makes it harder for readers to follow along. Trust your readers, allow them to make their own decisions and views.
