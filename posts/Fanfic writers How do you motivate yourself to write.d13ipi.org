Hey all,

I'm basically looking for ideas to motivate myself to carry on writing one of my fanfics, â€˜The Lost Child'. I published it when I was a lot younger and after reading it a few months ago, I absolutely hated it because it was so badly written. I want to go back and rewrite it all and change the plot and take it in a direction I want to, and I published the first revamped chapter a few months ago.

Trouble is, I can't motivate myself to sit down and write it. I'm stuck going between it and my fantasy story but I want to get both done.

How do you all get past writer's block? Any advice is appreciated.


** I'm not a writer but imo you should write whatever story when you feel like writing it , if youre not motivated about it , then dont write it , just dont limit yourself to a schedule or make promises about releases like some writers do and you'll be fine.

** I have to force myself to write something, even if it's complete trash, jut to get through the part that's causing the block. I just try to get the general idea of the scene, and come back to flesh it out later. Though I'm not a shining example of continuous posting

** Sometimes I get drunk and hope for the best. I've written some good stuff under the influence.

Other times I look for a prompt on Pinterest/Google to help me along. I've also been known to have my friends read the piece over and see if they can direct me one way or the other with the story.

** I write best when I really, really should be doing something else. When I make time to write, I often find myself without the drive. When I forbid myself to even think about my stories before an important deadline, I spit thousands of words with no problem.

Don't know how useful this is to you, though. But maybe try to reverse psychology this one out. Relax about your writing goals and focus on other tasks. The motivation to write might come back at an unfortunate time, but at least it'll come

** I have a set (rough) quota per day and a weekly deadline. And I stick to it, updating weekly until a story is complete.

*** That's a recipe for subpar writing even if you're an exceptional writer. It's easy to burn yourself out if you set a daily quota. Works for some, I guess, but most people can't always feel like writing every day (especially if it's just a hobby).

**** No, that's perfectly sensible way (see [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0553296345]] and [[https://youtu.be/LoSnjYLw2A0]]), but you then have to collect all those written pages (or kilobytes) and throw them away. A famous Czech songwriter claimed he wrote a song every day, but then in the end of the year he took those 365 songs, and he was barely able to collect twelve good enough to be on his new LP. So, write it, but DO NOT PUBLISH all of them.

**** No, that's a recipe to write /fanfiction/. If you only ever write when everything's perfect and you feel like it, you won't ever write enough to progress as a writer. Practice makes perfect.

***** Yes, practice makes perfect, but the problem is that you're posting the practice.

****** If you only ever post a perfect story, you won't ever post anything. Perfection is the enemy of good enough, after all.

And by posting, you'll get feedback. Some will be the usual drivel by entitled idiots who demand everyone write according to their headcanon and decry anything they don't like as bad, but there'll be useful feedback as well.

** If you cannot make yourself to write it down, it is usually a good sign, the story is really not that good, and you should drop it. If you as an author are not interested, why do you think your readers will be?
