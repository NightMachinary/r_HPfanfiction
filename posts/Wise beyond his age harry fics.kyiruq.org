I'm looking for wise beyond his age harry potter. Not asking for snotty, bitchy ,ott harry like the one we see in sinyks fics. A harry who is wise without shoving it in others faces. I don't know how many of you have read linkffn(finding why's by b.a.ware) or linkffn(the good master by peaceful compassion). The harry in these fics is wise because of all he has seen in his short life all the bad things he had to overcome. So any recs for a harry who is absolutely beautiful like he is in these fics?

  Harry must have been lonely while living at the Dursley's. What if he wished a friend and it worked? "Inquisitive, unconventional Harry. Lots of humour" like someone said. Writing gets better later on, said another. In the end H/Hr, some N/L.

  Harry didn't have the authority of the Ministry. He didn't have the reputation of the Dark Lord. He didn't have the influence of Lucius Malfoy. At heart, he was a simple tailor. "But anyone who had heard of Harry Potter knew that he was more than just a simple tailor. He was a good master." Abused, wise-beyond-years Harry.
