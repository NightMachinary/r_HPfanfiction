In canon, Hermione spends very little time with her parents between being at Hogwarts and spending many summers and breaks with friends. I've heard people imply that Hermione may have run away or even obliviated her parents waaay earlier than she says she did. Hermione doesn't talk about her parents much and never mentions things like Christmas gifts. The only canon birthday gift Hermione gets is a pet which her parents aren't even there to help pick out. I think there last physical appearance is in the second book, with all other evidence of them existing in her life are on Hermione's word. And Hermione seems really willing to obliviate her parents for someone who's so concerned for rights and justice. Anyone have opinions on Hermione's possible family life, that relationship in regards to accidental magic, or have any fic recs based on Hermione being on bad terms growing up and just not wanting to tell her friends?


** We only know about one gift and that's because Crookshanks was important to the story.

It's entirely possible she had a bad relationship with her parents, but I think it's all overblown conjecture, especially in a universe where people without magic don't matter unless they can benefit a witch/wizard. I mean we don't even learn their names. They don't matter that much.

Everyday people do things for others without their consent or opinion because they believe they know what's best. This is the big issue with SPEW, so it's not unbelievable she modified her parents' memory because she believed she knew what was best for them.

*** SPEW was a righteous cause, and while Hermione's methods weren't great, she was the only one who stood against slavery which brainwashed the slaves so badly, it ingrained an urge to self-harm when they as much as talked badly about their abusive masters.

** I think it's less bad terms and more that they've grown distant over the years. They could have been really good parents who Hermione loved very much, but that's meaningless when you can no longer relate to each other at all.

Hermione, in particular, is keeping so many secrets that being at home likely feels like a field of landmines. There are so many things she wouldn't be allowed to tell or else have to downplay if she was to be able to return to Hogwarts.

As for why she never talks about them, there are many reasons. It could be out of respect for Harry being an orphan. It could be the distance between them is hard on her, and it's hard to talk about, especially when her friends can't understand. It could be that her focus is so much on school and on Harry, that they simply slip her mind.

Lastly, Hermione had always chosen duty over her friends. Obliviating her parents is merely an extension of that. It wouldn't matter how good her relationship with her parents is, she'd have done it if only because that was what she deemed the best way to both keep them safe and maintain operational security. Duty comes first for Hermione.

Anyway, the interactions between the Grangers are so few that there is really no concrete evidence either way. The most we can conclusively say is that Hermione has gotten distant with her parents. Outside of that, everything we have is a matter of speculation.

As for fic recs where the relationship is indeed bad,[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25660273][[FIC] The Brightest Witch of Her Age]] by julchen_in_red is a really good one.

*** Another reason why Hermione might not talk about her parents may be that we're wrong in assuming she doesn't. The books are very strongly from Harry's POV after all. As important as Hermione's parents may or may not have been to her, they really weren't of much importance to Harry, who never even met them. It could very well be another "Dumbledore's gay but it wasn't relevant to the plot." Hermione could love her parents loads and casually mentioned them as much as any other loving kid, but it wasn't relevant to Harry.

** One thing is canonically Hermione didnt obliviate her parents. She confunded them to make them think they were a childless couple named wendle and Monica wilkins and convinced them to move to Australia. The obliviation was a movie thing that I for one never understood. As for her relationship with them I dont believe she had a bad relationship with them. I agree she might have planned to send them away for their safety early on after the world cup but couldnt have until after her 6th year maybe that christmas as she would have been of age by that point.

  â€œI've also modified my parents' memories so that they're convinced they're really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life's ambition is to move to Australia, which they have now done. That's to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me --- or you, because unfortunately, I've told them quite a bit about you.

***** Confundus is in the movies. Hermione uses it on Cormac in HBP

Movie chose obliviate because it's more dramatic and emotional, and because they never have the scene where she tells Harry what she did, unlike in the books. So just showing her saying "confundus" and then leaving the house wouldn't be clear to audience members who hadn't read the book what it was she'd done, because film viewers only know the confundus charm as the mildly harmless thing she used to get Ron on the Quidditch team.

You know what else is dumb about it? Confunding them to think they are different people who want to move to another country makes sense because it's specifically the move to Australia that protects them. Them not knowing they have a daughter and some pictures having one less person in them isn't going to protect them from the Death Eaters. They might not know they're Hermione Granger's parents, but the DEs sure as heck will, and they'll come knocking anyway. And I can therefore only assume that, in the movie universe, Mr and Mrs Granger were tortured and murdered /and had no idea why./ And that, that is some of the darkest and most horrific shit I can think of.

** I remember reading one theory that posits the idea that Hermione's relationship with her parents was somewhat distant. The idea being that with both parents working as dentists, they weren't around for much of young Hermione's life, possibly pushing academic pursuits onto her at a very young age as a way to distract her from that fact. It likely explains in part why Hermione was such a teacher's pet to begin with, as that was probably the only real approval and positive attention she received while growing up.

** One thing that is never really picked up is that for all the bashing of Ron being an insensitive git in book 1, he is not wrong. Hermione's social skills are objectively terrible, just spewing out what she has memorised from a book without giving anyone else a chance to reply. This is incredibly rude and makes holding an actual conversation with her impossible. It is possible that upon entering a new world, and possibly with bad experiences from being too quiet in her previous schools, she is suddenly overcompensating and has never acted like this before. However given she is just eleven I feel that the blame should lie with the parents setting her up to fail. Either through negligence or their own failings, they didn't teach their daughter how to behave with others properly and she suffered for it.
