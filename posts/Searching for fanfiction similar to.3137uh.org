[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Boy_Who_Lived]].

I absolutely love these kind of fanfictions where the stuff that happens to the characters actually feels believable. Where Harry just does not suddenly become evil or out of nowhere becomes so strong he makes Voldie and Dumbledore his bitch.

I'd prefer if they were long and complete, but if they are really good I'd love to read those too.


** Delenda Est was one of my favorite surprises. It was a great time travel story and I loved Bella in that story. She's adorable and slightly unhinged but a thoroughly likable and well-written character.

The "sequel" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum][Para Bellum]] is a different style of story, but it's pretty hilarious. The focus, unfortunately hasn't been on Bella, but there's enough hilarity that I didn't mind.

*** Yes, but it is nowhere as good as Delenda Est regretfully.
