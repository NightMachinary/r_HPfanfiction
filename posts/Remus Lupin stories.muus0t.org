Do you have any recommendations for good Remus Lupin stories?

Length doesn't matter, language should be English and theme is not entirely the main focus - I just want to read about Remus at the moment


** Have you read All The Young Dudes? Thats the big one and is wonderfully written. I was the same, got a hankering for Lupin and went hunting.

Anything by TheDivineComedian is fantastic, they have lupin to a tee. linkao3(Calibration by TheDivineComedian) and linkao3(Let it Choke by TheDivineComedian) are two fantastic ones.

Linkao3(Break by K1toftheworthies) is excellent at looking at the prejudices faced by werewolves in society which I really enjoyed.

linkao3(Remus Lupin and the Prisoner of Azkaban by JannaElizabeth93) is PoA from Lupins point of view and also extremely good fun to read!!

If you need anything else throw me a shout with specific requirements.

#+begin_quote
  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

  Remus Lupin certainly knew what he should do: Keep his distance. Reassure Susan that running from the Boggart was perfectly fine and understandable. Have her write ‚ÄúI will not skip Defence Against the Dark Arts‚Äù five hundred times and then send her on her way, ensuring that whatever issues she had would be dealt with in the proud tradition of the wizarding world: Through avoidance and denial.Except he knew where that path lead.And if he ever wanted to help the Boy Who Lived With Terrible Memories, he should probably start heading down a different one.

He likes to think he's made peace with the fact that he'll never know what it tastes like.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/949735][*Adagio*]] *by lupinely:* Remus wonders if Sirius knows. For the first time, he thinks---maybe he doesn't. [First war / lie low at Lupin's. They never said ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17477249/chapters/41160119][*Trust the Wolf to Bring You Home*]] *by pancake_surprise:* Remus Lupin saves 18-month-old Harry from the Dursleys, and realizes that perhaps Sirius Black isn't as guilty as everyone thinks.

All he wants is to curl up on his bed. Smoke a pack of cigarettes. Get drunk. He can't stop looking at Harry. ‚ÄúRemus...‚Äù Dumbledore is gentle. Remus hates when he has that tone.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/927712/chapters/1803877][*Common Woodbrown*]] *by imochan:* In 1985, Remus Lupin realizes that Sirius Black is innocent. Now, he just has to prove it.

Remus Lupin is trying to find his place in an ever-changing world, and when he is invited to serve on a truth and reconciliation commission, he has to confront the truth that lives there---in the past and within himself.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15889737][*Remus Lupin, a Werewolf? Gasp! Who Knew?*]] *by LullabyKnell:* The clues were there and they were not impossible to put together. A person didn't have to be breathtakingly clever and named Hermione Granger to realize that Professor Remus Lupin was a werewolf. The regular absences were covered up well and then explained away with the dismissive ease of someone who had been making these excuses all their life, but there were still students who could take a break from their own busy lives just long enough to make the necessary leap of logic. [Some snippets of realization with some random Hogwarts students.]

A Lonely Path by la baguette

Focuses on Harry and Remus's friendship. Harry doesn't go to Hogwarts until his fourth year, when Remus takes him in. If you're just in it for Remus, I would skip to chapter 6 after reading chapter 1 since he doesn't reappear until then.

**** Yeah, Remus and Harry go through a lot of drama and angst together, especially when Harry starts to open up more, but I found their connection really heartwarming.

** I've really enjoyed this one! It's a short Remus/Tonks fic that I think really illustrates Remus's struggle well in terms of finances and being too proud to ask for help.

** Carnival of Dark and Dangerous Creatures is a wonderful but very angsty fic about Remus between the wars. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4412736/1/Carnival-of-Dark-and-Dangerous-Creatures]]

If you like Remus/Tonks Lady Bracknell has lots of lovely fics - I think my favorite is the Werewolf Who Stole Christmas. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2712711/1/The-Werewolf-Who-Stole-Christmas]]

Also R/T - but VERY different - is the recently completed Human, which I highly recommend. It's an AU where as a child Remus and other young werewolves were trained to be Voldemort's assassins. I highly recommend this story. (Wait, did I already say that?) It's the best new fic I've ready in a while. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23404057/chapters/56088769]]
