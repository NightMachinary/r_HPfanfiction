I've been thinking a lot lately about post-war opportunities for Harry Potter, and one of the ideas I've been tinkering with has been magical architecture. I've always loved how much Harry seems to admire the Burrow, and growing up as a young man looking at the same houses side-by-side-by-side in Privet Drive, I can totally see him embracing the idea of creating unique houses that form a community while having personality of their own.

I guess as a result of my thinking about that, I was thinking about the building of houses in general - I was interested in the level to which the Ministry might control house regulations, what the regulations are for a building to be considered habitable or serviceable for a business, et cetera, and then I started imagining an all-wizarding settlement.

We're told a few times that while there are some areas where more wizarding families live, that the only all-magical town in the UK is Hogsmeade. It makes sense that with the size of the wizarding population as it is that there'd not really be enough people to populate anything bigger than a village, but what about the population booms that naturally come a few years after a war? What about people who might have fled the country returning now that it's safe? What about immigrants doing the same, if Wizarding Britain flourishes again?

A lot of the business owners we see in Diagon Alley close up shop in the war, and I'd wonder if all of them would be willing to return - that aside, many business owners we're introduced to, such as Fortescue and Ollivander, are characters we think of as being quite elderly. Who will make wands when Ollivander's gone? Who will make ice cream? (I know one of these is blatantly more important than the other.)

I guess I'm just thinking of how an all-wizarding community might flourish as the UK rebuilds itself after the war, and I was wondering what the main cases against building such a town would be, population issues aside. If the benefits outweighed the cons, what would this town look like? What should it have?

I'm thinking thus far of:

- Muggle-repelling charms.
- General security, if there are lingering Death Eaters or the like.
- How much wizards might like the idea of a village where their child can play on their broom without worrying about the Statute of Secrecy, et cetera.
- The sort of resources a village would need: a primary shop, a post office, a Knight Bus station (so it doesn't move anybody's houses out of the way and has an established landing spot), perhaps some public amenities like a magical gym, swimming pool, park, etc...?
- How expensive this would be to set up re: land and property.
- Perhaps a community police or neighbourhood watch style thing? Not a full on Auror outpost, but some sort of subset.


** I am usually cheeky in my fics and extend Diagon Alley and Knockturn Alley into a mini-town in the middle of London, with a few back streets and flats. I imagined this to be about the size of Covent Garden. Even though I stick close to canon in every other respect, no one has ever questioned this.

#+end_quote

Those "population booms" are actually /small/ increases. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom#/media/File:Population_pyramid_for_the_United_Kingdom_using_2011_census_data.png][Here]] is some real world data from 2011. WW2 /really/ stands out. Straight after the war the birth rate went up by about 20%, for two years, before falling back.

But a 20% increase in the birth rate for 2 years has very little effect on the population, because humans take bloody ages to reproduce. Assuming 20 years for a generation, that's a roughly 2% up-tick in the overall birth rate. The real population growth, such as it was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom#UK_population_change_over_time][came later]] during the sustained peace and economic boom, but even that didn't last and from 1931 to 1971 the population increased by less than 25% before the rate of population increase fell to almost zero in the 70s. It fell because the 1970s were unremittingly grim. It's important to note that the economic boom and population increase was /not/ just a result of the war. It happened again in the 80s with no war in sight.

However, don't take this as just being a massive downer. Architects in the real world don't get to do lots of interesting work early in their careers. Assume that he has an apprenticeship of a few years, and then work in someone else's practice for another few years, and by the time the real population increases hit decades down the line he'll have made a name for himself and be able to flog someone a town.

But if you want a quick population boom you need immigration. That's OK, just write an economic boom, that'll both encourage immigration and make sure there's enough money sloshing about to build a new town!

*** You're right about the 80s. The same thing happened in the US. The Baby Boom generation (in the US) ran from 1946-1964, with its peak year in 1957 (which was then broken in 2007). The bulk of the Baby Boomers began have kids in the late 1980s and early 1990s which led to the Echo Boom, a generation that was modeled after their parents' due to their sheer size, following the very small Generation X (those born from 1965 to either the late 1970s or early 1980s depending on your source). But the Echo Boom had many births not because the birth rate was high (it was in fact rather low) but because there were so many Boomers having children that the number of births surged.

** I don't think the British wizarding world is anywhere big enough yet that they could populate more than a village through a post-war population boom.

This doesn't mean you can't have a purely-magical town, though... how about having the characters travel abroad and visit foreign magical communities? In bigger countries, with a larger population, the number of wizards and witches may very well be big enough to justify an entirely magical town.

** Aurors aren't the entirety of the DMLE's law-enforcement personnel, their basically Magical Scotland Yard. There are regular police officers, like Cerberus Langram.

**** Sources:

- PoA, Fudge mentions Hitwizards so they're another law enforcement force.

- HBP mentions the magical law enforcement patrol.

- Improper Use of Magic office enforces law relating to underage magic in conjunction with the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad and the Obliviators.

- Department for the Control and Regulation of Magical Creatures enforces law relating to magical creatures (Buckbeak's hearing and execution, plus notes from the FB book).

- Arthur enforces law relating to Muggle artifacts.

The general rule appears to be that each Ministry sub-department enforces its own domain of law rather there being a functional division between law making and law enforcement as in the Muggle world.

The Aurors are the anti-Dark wizard division of the Ministry, not a general law enforcement force.

** I imagine a lot of wizards and witches living in small villages or in manor houses across the UK. Decentralisation and security through obscurity would have been excellent early approaches to surviving the witch hunts, and later would not have had to be changed with the advances in magical travel.

I made an annotated google map (before my laptop decided that google maps should forever be a nice blank grey landscape) with pins for every place mentioned as possible living places for wizards and witches in one colour, quidditch club locations in another colour and a third colour for cool place names that sounded magical, and extremely old places. From this I thought there must be roughly the following magical "counties":

- Devon sort of area (Ottery St Catchpole, etc)

- Hogsmeade

- Diagon Alley

- Possibly around the Wye Valley, South Wales through to the Cotswolds

- North, around Manchester/Liverpool

- Yorkshire

- Sparse houses dotted across the Midlands and Norfolk

*** Yeah, instant transportation and no need for energy or communications infrastructure rather eliminates most of the benefits of living in a densely populated area.

*** I later for my AU (since it has a larger population and a hopefully more workable economy) added a couple of other areas like Diagon Alley, and smaller all-magical villages with Hogsmeade being the largest.
