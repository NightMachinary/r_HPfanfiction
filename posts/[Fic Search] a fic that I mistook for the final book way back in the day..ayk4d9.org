As far as I can remember, it picked up where DHpt1 left off, more or less. I used to read books on an app that was originally designed for people to share their own short stores with others that was also used to spread bootleg books around.

I can't remember much of it, but I do remember that Harry was captured by Voldemort and held so that he would be a horcrux for him and kept “safe”. While freeing Harry, somebody slashes Draco (with a sword or Sectum Sempre, can't remember) and his intestines start spilling out. Hermione fires petrificus totalus at him to freeze him, keeping his innards from continuing to pour our and cause more damage.

The final battle between Harry and Voldemort saw Harry having to use AK against Voldemort, splitting his soul so that the portion that was Voldemort's would be able to be trapped in the original snitch from the first movie meaning Harry makes a horcrux, and then he would cast it into the veil, destroying Voldemort once and for all.

I went on for years thinking this was /the/ DHpt2 and was so confused when the movie came out and nobody mentioned how different they were from each other. It wasn't until I decided to reread the series and bought a legitimate copy that I realized my mistake.

The fic was actually really well written and, for the most part, felt like something JK would write, at least to me at the time. A part of me wants to reread it and laugh at myself and another part of me wants to share it with my friends so they can better understand my confusion at the release of the movie.

Does anybody know the fic I'm talking of?

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl
