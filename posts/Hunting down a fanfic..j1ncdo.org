:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was a crossover with Star Wars, where Anakin Skywalker, Padme Amidala and a bunch of others were reborn into Harry Potter characters. It ended up Harry/Ginny.

Tried hunting it down myself, to no avail.


** The story you're looking for is probably /rise like a phoenix in the desert winds/ by TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel. I believe the author deleted their account and took down their stories, but you can find the fic with the wayback machine: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20170408075700/http://archiveofourown.org/works/8624473/chapters/19776076]]
