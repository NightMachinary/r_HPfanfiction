** Hhm not sure if it's the right one but Runic Animagi is similar and IMO is pretty great.

Here's a link

** Doubt it's the one you're looking for, but as you said any other daph/harry fics;

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]] and the accompanying short story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6206646/1/Be-Careful-What-You-Wish-For][Be Careful what you wish for]]; The best darkish harry fics I've ever read, semi-legitimate, to Harry's knowledge, reasons of mistrusting and hating Dumbledore, muggles and Muggleborns, and he /doesn't/ join or cooperate with Voldyshorts. It's also the only story I've seen where Dumbledore is seen as evil to Harry, but is truly just doing the best he can.

I highly recommend it. If you do choose to read it, I'd recommend reading the short story or whatever it is, careful what you wish for, mid way through chapter 35 when it cuts to Hermione and Ron, as that's where the thing takes place, don't know why the author didn't place it in the larger story and delete the short story itself, but they did. I guess it sort of works as a stand alone though.

*** I thought the short story was supposed to be the 'chapter 0' of this longer fic?

//Edit: it does take place chronologically at the end of that flashback, but it's clearly meant to be read first since chapter 1 is a direct sequel to it.

** A lot of Harry/Daphne stories are based on fandom's second most idiotic idea -- the marriage contract (there's a ten-way-tie at the top). Fortunately there's gold in this piss and shit, and if [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4079609/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Marriage-Contracts][this]] isn't what you're looking for, it's at least a story very much worth reading.

Somewhere out there is a story, that's canon compatible and fantastic and I'm looking for it. I will update this post if I find it, but until then: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4334542/1/The-Grass-Is-Always-Greener][read this]], it's pretty good.

*/Edit:/* didn't take long, but as far as I remember [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess][this]] is very, very good. At the very least it's the one Endless7 story that doesn't make a mockery out of Quidditch.

**** Drafts and trades and franchises and owners and GMs. Quidditch is an ancient game. Why would its British league be run on modern American ideas?

***** Because Magical society has had a large influx of muggle borns directly from the area that revolutionized such ideas of Sports unions and the modern view of sports.

Football/Soccer arguably exists as early as 2nd century BC, Arguably 3000 before the fictional history of quidditch. Modern football has transfers, owners, managers, while it is also an ancient game.

I find the thought that, with how much of a cash cow professional sports are, that no one in the magical world thought of profiting off of them.

As for American, well, honestly, a buddy wanted me to write a story that dealt with the relationship between a hockey player and a baseball player and I used VP, where most of this complaint likely comes from I used most of VP as a way to explore how I'd write about those sports.

******** Not in Europe. If he had Harry move to America in his stories, then, fine, whatever. European sports don't draft and they don't trade. They sign and transfer, which is something completely different.
