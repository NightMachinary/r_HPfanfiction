By this I mean something vaguely reflective of the fact Voldy doesn't have a paternal bone in his body. So, for example, an acceptable reason for him to take Harry rather than kill him is that he thinks he'll be a very powerful weapon (in other words, not because Harry's just so darn cute). Or perhaps after the killing curse rebounds he's taken by Death Eaters hoping he's the key to resurrecting their Lord. Or taken from the Dursleys for similar nefarious reasons. Basically, Harry can be as OOC as is reasonable but Voldy/DEs should be as in character as possible. Anyone? ðŸ˜˜


** linkao3(14270454) has hiding-in-an-Albanian-forest-Voldemort swapping bodies with Harry at moments of high stress. Since he has no other allies Voldemort is willing to pay attention to a kid and he enjoys tormenting the Dursleys anyway.

  The first time Harry became a snake slithering through a forest, he thought he was dreaming. But he soon realised that in fact he was switching bodies with a magic snake. A very special snake who swiftly became his childhood friend -- for when he came back to Privet Drive after body-swapping things were always better for him.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  After the infamous massacre of the Potters, young Harry Potter went missing. It doesn't really help that years later he turns up again, a bit darker, stranger and more erratic than anyone had hoped for. But Harry hardly cares, since in the end it's his decision on which side he will fight; Dark, Light or no side at all.

  What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? A Dark Harry fanfic. AU Mild HG
