** That's a fairly common trope, though most that I've seen are either unfinished or turn into slash.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7932144/1/Solace-in-Shadows][Solace in Shadows]] - This is probably the most well known non-slash example, though it's also unfinished. The Diary Horcrux kidnaps Harry after getting a body in the Chamber of Secrets. At first they have a purely antagonistic captor-captive relationship, but Harry later starts feeling closer to the Horcrux Tom Riddle. linkffn(7932144)

#+begin_quote
  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark... Warning: Deals with Stockholm Syndrome and dark themes.

  Having spent over fifty years as a notebook the fragment of soul who still refers to himself as Tom Riddle regains influence over the mortal plane and finds reality to be an ephemeral thing while Harry Potter, a young boy of eight, discovers that things both are and are not what they seem. AU
