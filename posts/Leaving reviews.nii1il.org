I used to never leave reviews because I couldn't be bothered and also because I felt it wouldn't matter. Then I read something written a decade ago that compelled me to leave a review. To my surprise the author replied. Now I'm leaving reviews for all the works I finish reading in case it might give the writer a fraction of joy their writing gave me.


** Excellent policy! I can confirm that being left a review is a brilliant feeling!

** I feel a bit awkward leaving a review on a chapter I just read in the middle of a story that may have been written years ago, but sometimes you just have to let the author know what that chapter MADE you contemplate.

*** Honestly, I am always so stoked every time someone leaves a comment on an older chapter. Love to hear what people think.

** You are so sweet. That is really good in an age where people can bully the writer for not writing according to their idea or whatever a good review I believe can give them a little bit of happines of what they give us.üëèüëèüëè

** For me, reviews and comments matter way more than kudos and bookmarks as it gives me feeling of being read by actual living breathing people.

** Getting a good review is great! It makes the writer feel good to know their work is appreciated. I don't respond to individual reviews, but I do give my thanks for reviews in a foreword in the following chapter. Believe me, we appreciate the reviews, don't you doubt.

For some, it drives them forward in their writing, but that one's dangerous. It leaves you open to the idiots who find it necessary to attack you and your work, almost as if you wrote it to personally offend them. I ignore mentally handicapped people like that, and hope they're getting the help they so clearly need.

When I began uploading my story, I knew I would get negative reviews, it's pretty much inevitable. And negative reviews are fine, so long as they're polite, and I'm really rather happy if they're constructive. It may not change the way I'll write my fic, but I do store them in my head for future works, if applicable.

*** As a writer, I really like it when people review, and not just the nice ones. I especially like the ones which help me improve my writing.

** I just wish I knew what to say. Sometimes not much happens in a newly released chapter, so I'm left racking my brain.

** Yeah, as a writer even someone just saying 'I liked it' is better than nothing. I try to respond to my reviews as much as possible to keep the good will going.

Especially in this day and age of people being such huge assholes via the anonymity of the internet, basic human decency goes a long way IMHO.

** Leaving a review is about the best thing we can do to show appreciation.

As someone who dabbled a bit with writing (but is too busy to update lol), getting reviews has a much bigger impact than kudos/follows/favorites/subs/other. It shows what people think of my story, gives me new ideas, shows things that I can improve and more.

And as a reader, I just like to thank people for creating something I enjoy for free/
