Nothing too extreme. I have a prankster Harry but I want some ideas that everyone can have a laugh at.


** I think the main considerations are 'does the recipient mind', 'does it cause actual harm' and 'does it end before being genuinely annoying' to make sure your pranking doesn't shift into bullying. Even if 'they deserve it', like Slytherins or Umbridge, there is a tendency for authors to have characters cross a line and still pretend it is all fun and games. I think it is often better to have pranks randomly targeted, so you are not singling one person out and an individual may only be affected rarely, or have some form of 'prank war', e.g. vs the Weasley twins, where everyone explicitly consents and gives as good as they get. In terms of actual ideas:

Changing colour of clothes, hair and other short term cosmetic effects. Spike the pumpkin juice so everyone speaks two octaves higher for an hour or their footsteps squeak loudly for ten minutes. Glitter bombs that fade away.

Swap out the ink someone is using when they are in the middle of writing something (as long as they won't be marked down). Charm Snape's chalkboard to show rude messages whenever his back is turned. A fanfare plays whenever anybody walks into the common room for an evening, except for a few who get boos.

Charm the toilets so that every time they flush a quote from Snape, in his voice, plays. Some mirrors just show horrible distorted reflections. A chair gets slowly lower or higher the longer someone sits at it. Magical whoopee cushions which dispense weird perfumes.

Finally there are the purely decorative ones, which don't actually affect anyone. Magical fireworks, messing with the house banners, magical graffiti, animated performances in the great hall, sudden music playing throughout the castle, all the suits of armour saluting Filch every time he passes by.

Also consider getting accomplices. Especially if other people agree that the castle needs 'cheering up'. This could include teachers giving deniable advice, or suggesting spells. I am sure Dumbledore would love to help. The house elves or the ghosts could also be excellent allies, especially if there is a lot of prep work to be done, or requires Harry to be able to deny he was doing something.

** I'm trying to remember the fic in which everyone was charmed to substitute cutesy words for blood slurs. Like, Draco or someone would try to call someone “Mudblood!” but it would come out “Snugglewugums!” The charm was on everyone, but it only affected racists since they were the only ones who used those words anyway, and they couldn't go to a teacher about it because they'd have to explain what was happening.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??

** The students enter the great hall for lunch and notice a tense air in the tables. Some students seem to be holding their laughter for some reason, some do their best to avoid looking at the teachers table.

Looking at the front of the great hall, the reason becomes obvious. There seems to be a massive chicken nesting on Snape's head, just chilling. He doesn't seem to notice.

*** Even better if he's actually playing along. Prankster Snape, imagine that. Using his scary reputation to play pranks on everyone and blaming Wesley Twins, and giving them detentions that are actually brainstorming sessions for all three of them, or just extra classes on practical and humorous topics.

** "/Accio/ Hogwarts Student!" -- After the first Triwizard Task, Harry wants "revenge." As a result, everyone simultaneously stumbles, looks at each other, then decides to say nothing for fear of looking awkward.

Harry enlists the House Elves to "get revenge" on Hermione by moving everything in the Gryffindor common room by 1 inch to the left.

Students walking down Hogwarts feel like they are being followed. They turn around to always see the same suits of armor 'hiding' awkwardly on the sides of the halls.

Draco moves to get an egg for breakfast. Inside of each egg Draco touches, a howler "hatches" from it, calling him a bad egg. Similarly, all the apples he touches dance away while singing that he is a bad apple. The pears tell him to grow a pair, but the pies are sympathetic, calling him a regular sweetie pie.

** There is a real life prank that could apply here called a short sheet. Basically you take the foot of the top sheet of a bed and fold it back towards the head of the bed and tuck it on top of the comforter. Now when they try to open up the covers to get in bed they can't fit their legs in.

Harmless and I doubt most people would be offended unless they were already at the end of quite a bad day.
