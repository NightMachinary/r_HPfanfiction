As Harry saw his mentor bringing down his newly-conjured cup to the basin with a potion Voldemort handpicked to cause the greatest amount of suffering he could he came to a decision.

Dumbledore was definitely a better duelist and a more skilled wizard than he could expect to reasonably become for a few decades yet at the absolute optimistically best. Hell, he isn't even that good on his classes and the less said about his “duel” against Bellatrix Lestrange the best and Voldemort is a lot of things, but careless isn't one of those, there were most assuredly other measures to detain invaders if they somehow managed to counter the potion, measure that Harry is realistic enough to know he would probably not be able to deal with.

And then there was the fact that he /knew/ whatever Malfoy was planning would be done that same night. Admittedly, Malfoy was a far more manageable foe and his plots much more clumsy, but he still almost killed Katie and Ron and /this/ plan is the one he has been building towards for most of the year, if he somehow succeeded in whatever it was, or even if he screwed up this one too... his friends would most certainly be caught up on the crossfire, and between Harry and Dumbledore it is not even a question of who would be the best to deal with this plot.

/'Dumbledore told me to obey all his order'/ though the Gryffindor amusedly while raising his wand and picking up a rock from around the basin /'he really should have know better'/ he concluded as he silently cast the switching spell on the rock targeting the cup.

Dumbledore noticed something was wrong petty much instantly. Harry didn't allow him time to do something about it. In a smooth motion born from years of practice in the hospital-wing he downed the cup in a moments notice. Then paying no heed to either the awful bitter taste on his mouth or the startled cry of Dumbledore he summoned all the boldness embodied by his house and immediately plugged the cup again and downed it a second time still not allowing himself to think about the cold /cold oh so cold/ spreading through his chest or the pain quickly surging through his chest. Down the cup went a third time and once more he forced it down his throat as simple pain slowly turned into agony, his hand shook as the cup went down a fourth time as the cold enveloped all his body and his head pounded like never before. He managed to force it down his mouth when suddenly it became too much.

He screamed and grabbed his throat in utter pain as his body felt like it was burning with ice while his bones melted and /oh Merlin Please please make it stop!/. He was dimly aware of someone screaming his name and that he was now fallen in the ground for whatever reason... and then it started.

He watched in horror as memories he wasn't even aware he still had played in front of him with impossible clarity, not only seeing them, but being forced to /relive/ every second of pain, all his panic and fear and /it just wouldn't stop/.

As an alarmed voice sputtered some indecipherable sound somewhere he felt the cup once again pressed to his lips and unthinkingly swallowed, not for some noble cause or for the Horcrux, only to have something else to focus on other than the agony racking through his body or the non-stopping stream of memories he was being forced to relive. It didn't help.

As the liquid entered his body he felt the pain getting somehow /worse/ as the memories slowly started to distort before his eyes, a memory of Petunia swinging a frying pan at his head morphed into his own mother pouring boiling oil on him, Wormtail killing Cedric suddenly was himself /lashing/ at the other champion until his flesh opened and his bones /cracked/, until his whimpers and screams begging for mercy quieted and then finally stopped...

He drank and pleaded for the pain to stop as he slowly drowned in the black lake punctuated a thousand times by Ron and Hermione and then his own parents, and then he begged for death as he saw Sirius come back from the veil only to cast the cruciatus on him. All the while a broken voice pleaded with him to drink /just one more time/ from the cup, that it would all be over soon and each time it got worse while /something/ stubbornly kept him from fainting, but he still drank if only for a distraction for the barest of seconds.

Eventually he was walking in a wasteland with the sun burning him alive while paradoxically his body froze from the inside in an unending loop of agony, the very air an acid gas that forced itself on his lungs and seemed to slowly dissolve them. There was no one around and he kept walking as his bones felt like they were ground to a powder inside him. All the while he dimly heard a voice crying. Begging him to only drink one more cup and it would be all over, Voldemort would be one step closer to defeat.

/'Voldemort'/ thought dazedly the young man /'ha made this, he created this hell'/ he thought crazily. And at the thought of repaying in at least a fraction the suffering this being put him through Harry mustered his last efforts and swallowed the last dose.

Immediately the memories and hallucinations faded away along the cold and the pain. On their place they left only a bone-deep tiredness that he didn't think he would ever muster the will to overcome and a dryness so all-encompassing that he wondered if even drinking all the water in the oceans would even slightly satiate him.

“Water” he croaked weakly “Water”.

“Soon Harry, soon” Dumbledore said brokenly as he lifted the young man on his arms and mercifully stunned him.

The headmaster couldn't understand what in the world had lead his student to drink the potion on his place. He had been alarmed when he saw the teen drink the potion and despaired as he saw the pain it brought him.

He hated himself a bit more with each mouthful he had to force Harry to swallow but for all he tried and /oh Merlin he tried/ he couldn't find any way around it. The potion had to be drank by a human being, the one time he conjured a monkey to try feeding it to had resulted in the animal dying immediately and the potion mockingly going back to the basin. He had wanted to take on the burden himself all through the process and cast every spell he knew plus a few he created on the spot to try alleviate as much as he could Harry's suffering but whatever was in that potion was far darker and more terrible than anything he had come across since Grindewald's insurgency, it thwarted him at every turn and with Harry already on that condition if he tried drinking the rest both of them would be left unresponsive, locked up inside the cavern in constant torture until Voldemort found them.

And considering that he had no idea how much longer he could resist the curse he knew that this could be Harry's only chance of getting the Horcrux with the help of a wizard on par with Voldemort. As he used every bit of enchanting he knew to make the damn boat cut across the fake lake faster while absently casting Fiendfyre on the surging inferi he again tried unsuccessfully to divine Harry's reason for taking such a burden upon himself needlessly.

It was only when he finally got outside the cave's insidious enchantments which even Fawkes refused to cross and impatiently apparated to Hogwarts' gate at the very edge of /those/ wards that he figured out his answer.

/'Seems like I underestimated young muster Malfoy's dedication to kill me'/ thought Dumbledore with growing rage as he saw Voldemort's abomination of a symbol glowing eerily over /HIS SCHOLL/.

In normal circumstances Dumbledore recognized that he could be very frustrating to interact with for his seemingly endless well of patience born of decades spent carefully overthinking all his actions to make sure he never did anything he would later regret like with Arianna, to always measure the force he used so he never went to far and fell in the same dark path Gellert and Tom had, to never forget that others are also persons with their own life's and histories, always trying to see both sides of the argument plus the underlining issues which caused them before passing judgment.

But this night in particular he had been dealing with a rather painful and disgusting piece of dark magic trying to end his life for close to a year. Had had to make plan after plan and plant contingencies and secret protections all the while babysitting another deception of a government, leading the order /and/ playing a sick game of treasure-hunt with the most abominable being he ever had the misfortune of meeting with the future of the country and potentially the whole world at stake. And then he had watched as the bravest boy he ever meet willingly drank a potion so vile that it reduced him to begging for death and then had to feed said boy the rest of the potion himself with a growing sense of self-loathing and hopelessness (something he had almost forgotten the feeling of), all because he had refused to take said boy seriously when he came to him with concerns he believed under control, all because he took Severus vague assurances that the Malfoy boy wasn't able to cause any relevant amount of destruction despite having almost killed two of his students previously. Now there were Death Eaters with free access to children */in his school/*. Turns out that even the deepest well will eventually dry and the most restrained of men can snap once pushed far enough.

With a word that sounded more of a snarl than any human language Fawkes showed up and in a blinding flash of fire he was now in the astronomy tower. He saw the Death Eaters and the youngest Malfoy startling at his sudden appearance amidst them. Bellatrix opened her mouth to taunt him, he wasn't willing to listen.

The elder wand purred seductively in his hand as he raised it quicker than any of his enemies could see and with less than a thought all of a sudden the tower turned into a death-trap, telescopes and random bits of equipment turning into knifes, than being extensively cursed with spells that give experienced curse-breakers nightmares and then animated to seek their targets with flawless accuracy and speed greater than any muggle gun could ever reproduce. Greyback didn't last a second, nor did Bellatrix who died with a morphing expression of shock upon her face as her body was frozen while her fat boiled and fried her now rotting flesh, it wasn't a pleasant sight. He retained enough self-control to simply restrain Malfoy instead of succumbing to his first instincts, he would deal with the foolish boy when he didn't have to talk himself out of strangling him on his own bowels.

As he quickly descended the staircase he heard the sound of fighting and saw more death eaters battling his staff, he saw McGonnagall fiercely battling away Dolohove and Kingsley keeping Avery and Gilbson in check, he didn't care to notice more than that. With a wave of his wand the halls suddenly become a small jungle with trees breaking their way from the walls to block spells and to grab enemies, crushing them and digging deep into their bodies ripping them out from the inside. MacNair somehow managed to keep himself from panicking long enough to cut his own leg off before the roots dug their way to his internal organs, he was the only one.

As Dumbledore raised his wand prepared to kill his last standing enemy a shot of pain from his arm drew his attention.

Albus Dumbledore was a highly-regarded academic who spent most his life dwelling into the intricacies of magic and teaching what he believed worth keeping to those surrounding him. He may never have even tried figuring out how to make himself a philosopher's stone despite unfiltered access to his former mentor's notes, but on his studies he stumbled upon his fair share of ways to extend someone's life and escape certain death, most of them very unpleasant or requiring great sacrifices, sacrifices he is just not willing to sully his soul with for a few more years on the mortal plane. Then a few years earlier he found quite a few more while researching the true nature of the diary Horcrux, for all the talk of immortality being impossible there were quite a few people desperate enough to try anyway, truth be told, Horcruxies were quite mild compared to some other things he found during his studies.

All through this he held steady to his ideals and refused to ever let fear push him into something he so despited. However as he looked at the death eater who had managed to infiltrate his school, as his mind conjured terrifying images of what could have happened had he drank the potion and been unable to repel the invasion and as he looked at Harry still contorting in pain on his arms even while unconscious he remembered the talk he had with the same young man years previously about doing what is easy or what is right and knew that his own ethics were not worth the life of his students.

With a heavy heart he cast a spell he had previously only theorized about more for the intellectual exercise rather than any plan on actually letting it ever be cast. It was based on the protean charm linking two people together to the point of metaphysically superimposing their selfs, than on a changing charm designated to pass on the attributes of one object into the other and on an ancient Sumerian ritual destined to heal a person of all wounds in exchange for part of their life's. And so it happened that MacNair was abruptly brought back from the edge of unconsciousness by the burning pain on his arm as his hand quickly withered into nothing and the curse quickly traveled up his now old body. Dumbledore looked him in the eyes as he died feeling it was the least he owed his former student after robbing his life, then went on his path to the hospital wing, faster now restored to his 40 years old body, both his hands now healthy and unmarked and how he loathed the sight of them so clean when they should be dripping blood... but dying was the easiest thing someone can do, it is just giving up and washing your hands from the world, living only for life's sake is selfish, but to keep fighting for what you believe when all you want is to lay down and die, this is the right choice.

/'at least'/ thought Dumbledore grimly /'I dearly hope so'/.

*** I was trying to be mysterious, guess it backfired a bit 😅. Essentially Dumbledore would have invented this spell that lets him heal himself completely by passing on his injuries and curses upon another. What he did was make it so they were metaphysically the same being to some extent, then cast the healing ritual simplified and then the changing spell in a way that made it so MacNair paid the toil alone while Dumbledore benefited by having him take on Dumbledore's curse and the toil in exchange for his age. So Dumbledore walked away perfectly healthy and physically at the age MacNair was at.

I imagine this will be confusing too, so no, Dumbledore didn't actually steal the years of MacNair's life, MacNair died because his body couldn't deal with the sudden weight of both the curse and aging up, Dumbledore's vitality for a lack of a better term is still the same, but with a younger body there is less of a chance that his body will fail him until he has lived all the time he still has in him.

** Even better is the fact that I'm pretty sure this would hurt Dumbledore more. Not physically, of course, but. Knowing that Harry loves him enough to do this. Knowing that he's put Harry through a lifetime of pain and he's going to have to keep doing it. Knowing that he's planning to have Harry /willingly walk to death/ and confirming that he absolutely will, given the choice, and even when /specifically asked not to/. Having to look the consequences of his actions in the eye, and tell himself "Yes, this is the plan we're going with."

Harry's had a lifetime of pain, taken both willingly and unwillingly. What's a little more, if it keeps someone else fom hurting? Dumbledore's plan managed to succeed beyond his own expectations.

I feel like it makes for more of a punch if Dumbledore doesn't get a Get Out of Death Free card, though. Harry wakes up in the hospital wing, with full faith that Dumbledore's fixed everything because he always does, and Madam Pomfery's fussing over him, and someone has to tell him what happened to Dumbledore. He's dead. Because that was the plan the entire time, for Snape to do it. Not that Harry knows that.

*** I imagine that in this case Harry would be beyond furious with Snape and Malfoy (not knowing the plan), he may even decide to put the hunt on hold for a few days to infiltrate Hogwarts and confront Snape, and of course, if he somehow manages to land a killing blow (supported by Ron and Hermione plus faculty and members of the DA he would probably have a good chance at it, even more so with the cloak of invisibility and the map to track him down).

This would end having quite a few consequences, Voldemort would probably become even more determinantes to haunt the trio down and the light-sided faculty and students would potentially have to leave with the trio to escape the repercussions (Grimmauld Place maybe?) the Death Eaters would probably be a bit afraid that one of their master's inner circle was killed in the supposedly most protected place on Britiain petty much instantly after being assigned there. And of course Harry wouldn't know about the Horcrux in him, so even /if/ Voldemort decided to give him the self sacrifice option for some reason he probably wouldn't take it, not sure how it would go beyond that though, but definitely interesting.

After this attack Dumbledore realise that the Horcrux hunting must be moved forward. It all comes to a showdown on on Harry's 17th birthday as the blood protection is gone. Before the battle Voldemort casts a killing curse at Harry. He meets Sirius/his parents in the inbetween, who tell him to keep living or something. He wakes up again while Dumbledore and Voldemort are still battling so he grabs the Sword of Gryffindor, which conveniently laid beside him, and kills Nagini because she was coming at him. Something happens (what? Dunno) and Harry kills Voldemort with an Expelliarmus.

He may now start his 7th year in peace.

**** Personally, I'd be interested to know how you'd think the presence of this Dumbledore - newly resolved to protect all of his charges - changes the war. What do you imagine the lingering effects of the potion would have on Harry? What does Voldemort do in response to the death of Bellatrix/his other Death Eaters? Snape is no longer on the run. What happens to the Malfoys, now that Draco has failed? Narcissa saved Harry in the forest, so that plays out entirely differently if she's murdered by Voldemort. Does Draco redeem himself following his mother's murder, or does he blame Dumbledore for his own failing?

***** Well, okay. this is what I had in mind: with Dumbledore still around and having pulled out all restraints when it comes to defending the students Hogwarts definitely wouldn't fall, and having seen the effects of the potion on Harry he would probably decide against having anyone either underage or alone hunting the Horcruxes, so Harry would petty much be confined at Hogwarts while he takes Moody, MacGonnagal, Bill, Snape or Kingsley with him as support. He would probably just look through the list of students or ask Snape to figure out who was R.A.B. even if a single brainstorming session didn't provide him with the answer, then a short call with the stone and he would know the location of the Horcrux, he would still need to wait for Harry to wake up and call Kreatcher before finding out Mundugus took the locket, but this would just be a matter of time.

After the locket he would be starved for ideas of potential locations of the other Horcruxes, so maybe he would consider interrogating other death eaters since both Lucius and Regulus were entrusted with helping protect them, and since he just killed Bellatrix and has the stone... calling her could or not wield accurate answers depending on if or not she was compelled to answer, but either way her reaction would already give him a direction for his search, from there capturing and interrogating the other Lestranges would be a no-brainer, though how he would manage it would be up in the air, other than that he would also start looking into place where Bellatrix would be likely to keep such things including any house the Lestranges may or not have, eventually he would arrive at the conclusion that the locket was in Gringotts, and since it would be petty much political suicide for the Goblins to let him or the ministry confiscate the vault of political enemies we would have a rerash of the bank robbery, but this time with Dumbledore at the lead-role. He would still be understanding enough of the goblin's position to not start a slaughter, but I still think he could make a far cooler job than Harry & Co at it. Either he managed to cover perfectly his tracks (no way for him to convincingly shift the blame to Voldemort) or the goblins join Voldemort's side.

The diadem is the one I honestly don't think he would find, this would fall to Harry quite against Dumbledore's will, the way I see it being confined to Hogwarts while the war heats up after a very traumatic experience and with knowledge of Horcrux is exactly the type of thing that would drive Harry up the walls in frustration, enough that he would consider the possibility of Voldemort hiding one at Hogwarts and search for it, if for nothing else than to alleviate his own frustrations. He already knows Voldemort used the founders artifacts, knows that the locket and potentially the cup (don't think Dumbledore would be cruel enough to keep him out of the loop worrying if Voldemort is still immortal after what he went through) were used and found and that the sword wasn't used, so he would ask his Ravenclaw friend (aka Luna) about Ravenclaw's artifacts leading him to ask the grey lady and find out the location of the diadem. A quick jaunt to the headmaster's officer later to furnish him with the sword and the second last Horcrux is now gone.

Then comes the climax with Dumbledore and Voldemort ducking it out without restraints. Dumbledore knows that Voldemort still has Nagini and Harry tying him to the mortal plane, but at this point he will settle for either imprisonment or temporary decorporation as ways of gaining more time to try preventing Harry's death while Voldemort would eventually find out about the destruction of his Horcruxes and freak out completely leading a full-attack on Hogwarts while using the passages on the chamber to infiltrate the castle with some of his best soldiers while the staff is distracted (which Snape wouldn't be able to tell since he didn't kill Dumbledore and so died by the end of the year along with the Malfoys, making Draco an orphan alongside a compulsory guest at hotel Azkaban: /now with more dementors than ever! Visit our new dementor nursery and help provide food for the newborns, or don't, they will visit your room regardless any time they feel peckish/). Even without the warning about the true plan Dumbledore would probably still be weary enough to evacuate the students, though Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny and Luna would find some way of staying inside and use the map to keep an eye on the fighting (maybe in the RoR).

As they watch the staff of Hogwarts keep the bulk of Voldemort's forces at bay they notice the dark lord himself and his most trusted lieutenants making their way through the castle to attack the staff from behind, Nagini with them but kept under guard and away from the fighting since Voldemort isn't willing to either let her too far away from him or too close to Dumbledore who have already destroyed almost all his Horcruxes.

****** They then decide to split up, Neville, Ginny and Luna go to Dumbledore's office get the sword to kill Nagini while Harry, Ron and Hermione try to either delay Voldemort or at least warn Dumbledore. They cast all spells they can to prevent detection and use the cloak before going after Voldemort's group, however Voldemort seems to have had the same idea since only the map shows he is there, they follow him at a distance and when they see their dots on the map standing still behind the Hogwarts staff (probably taking aim) they all take it as their clue and cast the flashiest, loudest and most destructive spell they know (probably some kind of blasting curse). The spell does it's job and they not only manage to prevent Voldemort's group from catching Dumbledore's unaware, but also injured/killed at least one of them. Naturally Voldemort is furious that he lost the element of surprise, but isn't foolish enough to show his back to Dumbledore in order to to kill the trio, meanwhile, even not having been caught unaware Dumbledore still has to fight a battle on two fronts while keeping Harry and his friends from getting killed on the crossfire, and so comes the scene I am absolute sure I can't pull out competently, the four layers free for all battle between the dark army on the front (compromised of the bulk of the death eaters, werewolves-so probably on a full moon or almost since they got to chose the time- dementors, giants, Acromantulas and any other dark creature) raining destruction against the defending army (formed by Hogwarts professors, the order, some aurors, Hagrid's giant brother, the suits of armor and anything else they can enchant or transfigure), Voldemort and his inner circle and Harry's group who are arguably in the best position for both attack and defense but are definitely the least skilled.

While the bulk of Voldemort's army would represent the greater number of combatants they would have to deal with not only the enemy force, but also Hogwarts' wards keeping them from attacking at full force, while Dumbledore's group would be free to cast as they wished at the army but wouldn't be able to crush them because most of their attention would be directed at the more skilled forces behind them while having to pull their punches as to not accidentally hit their students. Voldemort's personal force on the other hand would be casting as much as they pleased without caring about the damage, and then Harry's group would be taking cover on the grounds of Hogwarts while taking potshots at Voldemort's group, which wouldn't be able to return fire in earnest since it would mean showing their backs to Dumbledore's. Meanwhile Voldemort and Dumbledore start ducking it out as best as they can while keeping an eye on the other combatants and would be evenly matched with Voldemort focusing on casting curses and spells and Dumbledore focusing on transfiguration and enchantments. Some highlights of the fight would be Voldemort sending a dark smoke that rots everything it touched at all those around only for Dumbledore to conjure a wave of insects to absorb the curse while animating their blood in thousands of almost solid needles targeting Voldemort; Flitwick suddenly expanding and diminishing the space surrounding them to either give them more time to counter spells heading on their direction or giving the enemy less time to do the same; Harry managing to nail Voldemort with a sectumsempra as he is defending against a best conjured by Dumbledore only for the Dark Lord to turn around and send a wave of Fiendfyre at them in anger with them barely managing to run ahead of it (Accio brooms maybe?) and eventually be right above Voldemort with the curse still after them when Voldemort feels Nagini's death making him lose control of the fire, killing some of his group and forcing Dumbledore to focus on defending against it while Voldemort recovers and sends an AK at Harry in rage sending him to King's Cross.

About Harry, the potion's effects on him would have deeply traumatized him, Dumbledore, his friends and Pomfrey would eventually manage to get him somewhat functional, but he would still have bouts of depression and anxiety plus the occasional nightmare. He would also be quite conflicted about Dumbledore since on one hand he is his beloved mentor and is fighting the war efficiently, while on the other he was using the kind of magic he seemed to always refuse to in doing so, so upon arriving at the in-between he would find his parents waiting for him and have a long and very emotional conversation. He would start genuinely wanting to go to the beyond with them, but they would eventually manage to convince him to keep living and he would go back reassured (though not knowing about the Horcrux since his parents didn't really wanted to tell him).

When he wakes up Voldemort and Dumbledore are now having a full-on brawl while everyone else scraps for cover. Voldemort is laughing maniacally and taunting Dumbledore while Dumbledore is petty much foaming of anger. Then Harry sees Ron about to die because of some curse Voldemort had cast all around him. This is the moment he fully understands Dumbledore's choice and willingly does the same, his morals are not worth his best friend's life.

When he casts the killing curse there is no true hate behind it, he isn't killing Voldemort because of revenge, he is doing so because the alternative is having the blood of his friends on his hands. He casts the curse with no intent of having Voldemort feel fear or suffering, only wanting him /gone/ so his friends will be safe, as a consequence of this pragmatic efficiency his AK hits an unaware Voldemort petty much instantly, giving him no time to block or even notice it coming to him. His face doesn't even change into surprise, he just didn't have the time.

After that... honestly no clue, an epilogue I guess.

#+end_quote

Bold of you to assume Harry could ever pull off a silent switching spell.

If you mean thoughts on the drabble, it's certainly an interesting idea. And there's a lot of potential. But your writing tells far more than it shows, needs editing for grammar, and the formatting needs to be changed. A lot needs to be cut out. As it is, though the concepts are interesting, it's a bit of a chore to read. For example:

#+begin_quote
  The elder wand purred seductively in his hand as he raised it quicker than any of his enemies could see and with less than a thought all of a sudden the tower turned into a death-trap, telescopes and random bits of equipment turning into knifes, than being extensively cursed with spells that give experienced curse-breakers nightmares and then animated to seek their targets with flawless accuracy and speed greater than any muggle gun could ever reproduce.
#+end_quote

First of all, this is too long of a sentence. This is meant to be combat, fast and risky. The length of this sentence and the amount of needless exposition results in this seeming like it takes ages to do. The adjective "quicker" doesn't fix the reader's first impression from the length of the sentence alone.

*** Eh, he /did/ manage to cast it silently to fill up the mead on the cups after Aragog's burial.

I would argue about language and the auto-correct, but to be honest I make the same mistakes in grammar on my native language, so it is mostly a moot point. And definitely, on rereading some parts sounded really awkward, always had this problem with show/don't tell and those specific parts are arguably the worst in the entire book to delve too deeply in character thought process, kind of felt the need though cause without it it seems like a switch just got flicked and Dumbledore started killing without caring. Will probably edit it tomorrow, if for nothing else than to at least smooth out some of the more awkward bits, correct the words that /did/ get changed by the autocorrect, try to divide some of the longer sentences and fix Dumbledore's seemingly three arms which was what annoyed me the most while rereading.

Anyway, thanks for the feedback, it was very helpful 👍😁.

  The Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point, and he noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was running out fast. Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable: Indeed, Harry grinned to himself as, unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slughorn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill.
#+end_quote

As an aside, Harry used the refilling charm for the drinks, not the switching spell. And had the Felix Felicis to help him out for the charm. To be honest though, it doesn't really matter, I was mostly joking about Harry's magic skills.

And going further from there, Dumbledore proceeds to kill Voldemort but fall himself victim to the seductive power of the Elder Wand and in attempting to establish his utopia in which all wizards live in peace, he turns into the villain.
