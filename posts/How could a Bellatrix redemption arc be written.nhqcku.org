My idea is that she's amnesiac, and ends up on Nirn during the start of Skyrim. She's the Dragonborn, of course.

She then makes her way back to the HP-universe after the end of the game, and is shocked to find out about who she once was.

Any ideas from you all?


** It is really really difficult. The true redemption and repentance for her is the only one: to knock on the door of DMLE and ask to be put into Azkaban for the rest of her life (UK, even the magical one, doesn't have the capital punishment), which doesn't make much happy finale of the story.

The only two options how to make her happy end is somehow to explain away her actions, so it is either

- time travel before she was such a bitch, e.g., excellently played in “Stepping Back” by TheBlack'sResurgence linkffn(12317784), or “The Last Peverell” linkao3(29167410).

- put here under some kind of Imperium Curse or something of that kind (marriage ritual or something).

However, the problem is that by getting her out of the hook the author completely destroys any hopes for the redemption, because where there is no guilt there is no redemption.

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right?

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

*** You got any other thoughts?

I guess I could have her start out as canon Bellatrix, then have say Tiber Septim talk to her, and try to mold her into a person worthy of the Dovahkiin's mantle.

She could start out as in canon, but be molded by Septim into the Dragonborn, then sent to Tamriel by the gods.

*** Making her conscious/aware during her whole time under whatever form of mind control and her guilt of having done whatever she did during that time (even though she was mind controlled, she believes that her body did it and she is/was responsible for it. Maybe some form of PTSD, idk Im not well versed in things like that, but you get the idea. And as illogical as the whole PTSD thing sounds, guilt, and emotions in general for that matter, don't follow logic) still allows for some redemption arc IMO

** Permanent full amnesia is very, very rare (it's less than .1% of people). Most amnesiacs either struggle to make new memories or temporarily forget a portion of past memories (which generally come back over a year or so after the initiating incident, and only account for a specific period of time - usually the time around the incident itself or a few years previously).

Also, there are multiple types of memory - autobiographical being about personal identity, and procedural memory that covers our ability to do various tasks, etc. Generally you'll only forget one type of memory, not all of them.

So, my approach would be to have Bellatrix land, end up forgetting her recent life experiences (maybe back to her pre-Voldemort years), but still having the ability to cast spells. She'd have no idea where or how she learned those skills as she'd have no memory of Hogwarts, but she'd still have the skills.

She gets helped, connects with some people, and slowly starts recalling more and more of her past life as she 'adventures' through Nirn and starts helping people. Her current self, who'd be a slightly more decent person, would look back at these memories with fascination and horror. Eventually, have her come to terms (in the abstract) with who she used to be - then, she gets teleported back to Rowling-World and has to deal with her previous identity directly. Explore the feelings behind exploring the arsehole she used to be and you'll have a sympathetic redemption arc, most likely.

*** One thing I definitely will have is her being advised by Tiber Septim(AKA Talos), as he was the Dragonborn's previous incarnation.

I think a good emotional scene would be her finding out about her torturing Nevilles parents from Neville, and her begging Tiber to kill her.

**** That kind of thing could work, but I'd say you'd have to set up her new moral code beforehand to make it work.

Maybe have her see someone else in the Elder Scrolls world being tortured and being horrified and saving them, in the time before she starts getting reminders or information of what she was before? Establish that she sees the kind of things she did before as wrong, why she now sees things that way, and then have her beg for punishment or death or whatever. It'd provide a stronger foundation for the emotion in that scene if you could call back to her saving someone from torture previously and have the "Someone who could do that... they'd be a monster. I was that monster." moment.

Breaking her down that way, with a moral foundation to her distress, also opens the opportunity to rebuild her in her new morality - "You were a monster, but now you can be better." - and really get deep into the redemption part of your story.

***** First of all, it just so happens that in the main quest of Skyrim, the Dragonborn saves someone from Thalmor inquisitors.

Second of all, it would make sense if Tiber Septim was responsible for the Dragonborn losing her memory. After all, Bellatrix was hardly the kind of woman the Empire needs in its time of extreme danger.

****** I like your first point. Especially since, if I recall correctly, the Thalmor are High Elf Supremacists (or at least racist against other races?). The parallel to her old self would be a nice thing to play around with and allude to there.

Regarding your second... I mean, the last hero of the Empire was technically an escaped prisoner who ended up head of the Dark Brotherhood in Cyrodiil, the Gray Fox, and probably would've ended up joining the Mythic Dawn if they'd asked. Don't know if the Empire really has all that high a standard for heroes. :D

Be a fun thing to lampshade though. Have her wake up after landing and Septim goes "Hey, you, you're finally awake!" :D

More like she's advised by him throughout her travels through Skyrim.

Her travels are still much the way mine were in Skyrim, just that she's advised on which paths to take by Tiber and other past dragonborns like Ysgramor and St. Alessa.

I also look forward to writing about the reactions of people in the HP-verse.

"An evil bitch is the literal savior of the universe?" - Hermione, probably.

** Whatever was before, torturing of Neville's parents was definitely the moment indicating her fall behind the moral horizon, point of no return. You can't make her redeemed without rewriting her personality or/and life story to the point it is OC with Bellatrix' name on them.

** Finally my one area of Harry Potter expertise bellatrix that's admittedly kinda weird in retrospect.

Anyway in the fanfictions I've written with a bellatrix redemption arc here's how it's gone. She grew up being indoctrinated by the entire black family pretty much then hog warts came along and she married lestrange. Lestrange makes me think of intense emotional abuse. He doesn't physically abuse bellatrix because he's be fucking dead if he did but emotional and mental abuse on top of racist indoctrination for decades has a way of breaking a person.

The best way to break the indoctrination is to be confronted with the source directly or to get away from that. Which is where it works in your story. She has no one around to reinforce her racist ideology so as she explores nirn it slowly crumbles then gets brought back and has to reconcile who she is to who she was.

Ps:this sounds incredibly fascinating and I'd love to read it

** I don't know how you played Skyrim, but my characters always end up as complete psychopaths. I don't think time spent murdering your way through various creatures of skyrim, while facing all sorts of magical creatures you also end up killing, coming across 10 different types of racism not to mention all the people who despise other people because of the way they fight... Necromancy is sortof frowned upon but not illegal, summoning demons is a standard way of fighting, you end up coming across and making deals in some way with several demons during the course of your time there. By the time she got back she would probably be worse than Voldemort and liable to take over and become a worse threat than he was.

*** I don't play Skyrim that way.

I always try to do what I think is right.

Besides, in my fic I add Tiber Septim(Talos) to the mix.

He advises the Dovahkiin on what the best course of action is. For instance, Bellatrix only joins the Dark Brotherhood because Tiber thinks that the Emperor should die for the Empire to have a better chance at defeating the Aldmeri Dominion.

** Basically having her become a Super-Powered Batman/Punisher hybrid. She Soul Tears Voldemort, Soul Traps him and sacrifices it to the Ideal Masters, kills her former comrades, the Dark Creatures (Soul Tear or Soul Trap would likely kill Dementors or get rid of them) and uses her OP Skyrim Alchemy hax or Restoration Magic to heal everyone in Saint Mungos (especially Neville's Parents), before returning to Skyrim. "I've done my part here... I'd just remind them of the monster I was if I stayed behind. Bellatrix Lestrange is Dead, she should stay that way. I'll stay as who I was in Skyrim".

Parthurnax would be exactly who she needs to recover from it. He was once a badguy too but redeemed himself and became the goodguy mentor. He could help her seek self-enlightenment down that path.

** My Bellatrix was fairly accepting of the pureblood mantra, but she wasn't insane. She was unwillingly married off to Lestrange, and to make certain she behaved, her father put a very sinister compulsion on the contract, binding her to Lestrange, and partly his will.

Unknown to Cygnus, and Lestrange (at the time), the witness to the contract being made, one Tom Riddle, placed a similar compulsion of his own onto the contract.

This created a conflict within Bella's mind, sort of like trying to fight against two equally powerful /Imperius/ at once. Her mind didn't know which attacker to fend off, so eventually, the 'good' part of Bella's mind retreated in on itself, in an effort to protect what sanity remained. What emerged was the utterly insane killer we know from canon.

Harry managed to break the compulsions, bind her to him, to ease her mind back from the brink and into the light. His heart and soul healed Bellatrix, along with some heavy work with Mind Healer Andromeda. Bella's and Harry's connection faded away as she got stronger and ultimately disappeared, but not before she had fallen head over heels in love with him.

She doesn't much care about my Harry's quest to bring peace and equality to Magical Britain, but she cares for her sisters, niece and Harry. She feels a deep need to redeem herself, and seek revenge against Riddle and Lestrange for what they made her do. And to avenge her victims.
