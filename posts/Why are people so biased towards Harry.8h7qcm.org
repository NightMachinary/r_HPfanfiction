** Maybe I'm not reading the right threads, but I don't think I've seen people rage if you say Harry is less than perfect. Anyway, getting mad over people not reading stories they don't want is pointless. I mostly stick to HHr stories r stories without romance. Doesn't make me bad, I'm not required to read anything besides what I want.

** Protagonists aren't meant to be perfect, in my opinion at least. A perfect person with no flaws is dull and hard to empathize with I think, and seems less real.

Not sure why people would be against this. Readers probably already have this idea in their head about Harry and as soon as that idea/image is challenged they get defensive or back out of the story.

** First of all, the whole thing with Harry doing whatever he wants and getting away with it... well thats just bad writing. Usually I find its some kind of self insert wish fullfillment on the authors end. I'm not a huge fan of that either. It seems like most fics either have Harry get away with everything OR have Harry blamed for everything that isnt his fault (inlcuding self defence) to a ridiculous level. It seens to normally go to either extreme with not many stories sitting in the middle.

As for your other point, I just like Harry-centric stories. I don't know why, I just do. I don't think it's fair to get angry at people about that though. Everyone is entitled to their preferences.
