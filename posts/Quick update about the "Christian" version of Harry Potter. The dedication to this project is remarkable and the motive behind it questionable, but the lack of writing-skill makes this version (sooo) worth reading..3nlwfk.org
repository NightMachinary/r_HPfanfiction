#+TITLE: Quick update about the "Christian" version of Harry Potter. The dedication to this project is remarkable and the motive behind it questionable, but the lack of writing-skill makes this version (sooo) worth reading.

** This has to be a troll. I couldn't bring myself to read past the first chapter, but I simply can't fathom /that/ not being the work of someone trolling.

** - First Reaction: I admit the idea sounds cringey.

- Second Reaction: "dedication" /hmm/ I have been thinking of, and will probably do a post about, Death Eaters and basically lamenting over the fact that they are just so boringly evil. So this might be interesting (where you can only serve one master; one the very source of good, one utterly bad)...

- Third Reaction: I'll check ou... oh "LACK of writing-skill" /sigh/ I don't enjoy reading train wrecks

- Review: The title took me on a roller coaster of emotion, would rec.

** 8k reviews for that. Even if it's a parody or troll fic, that's darned depressing.

*** Read the reviews. It's 8/8 b8 m8. Every review is telling the author how stupid they are and how bad the story is - atheists, christians, catholics, everyone gets sucked in and feeds the amazing troll.

** Dear me. She's dwelling rather fulsomely on Hagrid's extreme manliness. I thought that was going to go in a rather different direction for a moment.

** I think my favourite part is the fact that

a) the men's virtue is basically based on how hairy their chest is (see Snape's 'thick carpet' vs. Voldemort's lack thereof)

and

b) the fact that you can somehow always /see/ said chest hair despite the fact that they're wearing clothes that would cover it up, like Snape's suit with a tie.

** Seriously, it has to be a troll. Hitting on every possible stereotype regarding Christians? Sounds like some snide idiots wet dream.
