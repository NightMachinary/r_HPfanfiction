I've been using an app titled, simply enough, Fanfiction, and it's good, but it only trawls fanfiction.net. Does anyone know of a good, free app for Android phones that would let me favorite, save, and most importantly, read fanfiction on my phone? I find I don't stay up until all hours of the morning (just most of them) when I can put it on my phone and get away from the glowing altar of the computer.

Thanks!


** I use flagfic.com to download in .epub format and Aldiko to read.

*** Well, sure, but I was asking for stuff to use on other sites, like Portkey or the like.

** I use [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apps.webreader][Fanfiction Reader]] (I got the paid version personally) because it lets me have a "true black" background for reading at night. It also let's you search by author or story, or browse without using your browser.

One that is almost as good is [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anompom.fanfictionreader][FanFiction Reader Lite]] which nicely will launch fanfiction.net links right into the reader and give you the option to download.

** Get some sort of PC, Mac, or unix system running Python, and use FanficDownloader (the one on Google Code) to download the stories to epub format, then read with FBReader.
