Bonus if you also explain Ginny asking about love potions in HBP. I understand all the characters in Harry Potter are flawed, but a more palatable explanation than gold digger would be nice.

An example would be one fic where Molly doses Arthur to lust after the Gargoyle as a prank.


** Molly needed to test a love potion antidote that she had brewed as a NEWT Potions project, and her boyfriend Arthur volunteered to be the test subject.

The test was done in private and Molly let Arthur make a fool of himself for a bit as a prank before giving him the antidote, and that's why Hermione and Ginny were giggling when Molly told them the story.

** Ginny actually doesn't ask about love potions as far as I remember.

Quoting from the HBP scene in question: "'Haven't you girls found our special WonderWitch products yet?' asked Fred. "Follow me ladies....'

Near the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically. Hermione and Ginny both hung back, looking wary.

'There you go,' said Fred proudly 'Best range of love potions you'll find anywhere.'

Ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically 'Do they work?' she asked"

Fred specifically brings up the topic of love potions and Ginny and Hermione are shown to be wary and skeptical. Ginny does ask if they work, but thre is not indication she would be interested if they do. They're notably less interested than the girls around them "giggling enthusiatically" and even then, those girls could be giggling about any number of things, such as discussing any crushes they have, even if they don't actually intend to use love potions beyond pranking someone.

*** Knowing Ginny's character and history with Tom Riddle, most likely she's creeped out by the whole thing.

*** I like this interpretation. The scene lacks any commentary afterwards in canon, because they start talking about her dating, but I like this interpretation of Ginny's character.

For all the bashing done of Ron and Ginny, Fred and George are the only Weasley children who ever dabbled in love potions.

**** And not because they're bad people but because pranksters tend to have a twisty definition of morality.

***** Definitely a twisted sense of morality.

People love them because of book 3 where they gave Harry the Marauder's map. We also like them for the fact that they're magical geniuses, despite being academic underachievers.

They were super irresponsible with their products, considering that the Peruvian darkness powder provided cover for Malfoy.

*** I hate the Molly is administering love potions plot that fanfics often do. I'd rather have something more original for that story.

** So heres a thing, we have been told that a child conceived under the effects of a love potion cant feel love,

But

If love potions are commonly used shouldnt there be more people like Tom Riddle running around? Is that perhaps what has happened many purebloods, arranged marriage leading to dosing to produce children leading to children that dont love and need the potion in a vicious cycle?
