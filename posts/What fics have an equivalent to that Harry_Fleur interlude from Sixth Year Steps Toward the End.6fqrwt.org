You know that bit I'm talking about, where Harry has to spend a few days in Fleur's home recovering from Cruciatus exposure and there is a damned hot romantic interlude that happens.

What other fics have something like that happen? No slash, pls.


** No, I don't know the bit you're talking about since I haven't read it, but you have my curiosity.

It starts in this chapter with the attack on Harry and Fleur and goes on for at least the next entire chapter, and (I think) part of the chapter after that too.
