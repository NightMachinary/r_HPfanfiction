So far I've read and loved "Benefits of Old Laws," "The Devil in Me," and am reading "The Parseltongue Twins" right now.

I hoping there's more really long and intricate Voldie-Dad fics that I can get into.


** The Benefits author's current ongoing story is also a V-as-H father figure fic, although Harry is just a baby it's really cute. It's quite different from Benefits but I recommend it.

** If you don't mind a self-rec of a WIP, I've got some [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30208026/chapters/74434125][Voldie-Dad]] for you. Very low-magic, Voldemort kidnaps Harry instead of killing him and runs off to America to hide. There's slash (not Tomarry/Harrymort), heads up. And I won't claim to be super long, again, WIP, but it is entirely Voldemort-as-Dad.
