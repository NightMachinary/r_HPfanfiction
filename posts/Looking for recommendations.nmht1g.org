Hi I'm looking for hurt/confront and angst. Mostly for something with mental illnesses such as eating disorders/self harm/suicide etc which Harry experiences and someone (snape) helps him. I would love for it to be a severitus/snape mentor (no snarry). I'm particularly in the mood for such fics with Snape, but drarry is also okay. Thanks!


** There are like a bajillion of these, but my latest favorite is linkao3(28613241)

  Harry Potter is located in London in the dead of night. How exactly did he end up there, and what has he been doing? Well, any kid with half a brain knows not to talk to strangers.

** If you don't mind female Harry, my series is guardian Snape and the character is dealing with selective mutism.
