** Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay: Dumbledore teaches Harry to breathe Fiendfyre under the belief that the Prophecy may mean that only Harry could destroy the Horcruxes.

I've also seen a couple with the Goblet of Fire Summoning and Dumbledore having a 'what have I done' moment when he learns the scar was dealt with.

#+begin_quote
  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
