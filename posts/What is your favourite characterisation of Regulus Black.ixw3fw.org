** Canon always gave me the vibe that, like with Snape, Regulus had no general disagreement with pureblood supremacy, he had a personal one with Voldemort. So I prefer him to be depicted that way, rather than everyone acting like he was secretly good.

If Regulus had never learned of the Horcruxes and Kreacher would not have been harmed, Regulus would happily have been a Death Eater as far as I understand things.

*** Yeah. Rowling always wrote the books like it doesn't matter how many people you kill or torture so long as you love one person at least; that automatically makes you "brave and good." It's such a naive and silly belief. As if horrendously evil people weren't perfectly nice to their families and friends.

*** From what I gather, Regulus discovering the horcrux and sacrificing himself to destroy it was the /start/ or his journey that was cut short by his death. So while not a good person by the time of death, he could've had such an arc and might have been better than Snape as a person. I always compare Regulus to Draco that he was just as spoiled (albeit smarter and maybe wittier) but I cannot imagine Draco going out of his way to destroy a horcrux, even if somebody as important as his mother was being hurt.

So that's where I draw the distinction: Regulus has a noblesse oblige that isn't necessarily driven by good intentions, just that's he's a better person than people so he must go out of his way to he brave and noble and whatnot. Couple that with teenage recklessness, a nerdy boy and you've got a recipe that led to his untimely death. I do like to think if he'd survived then he'll tread the path Sirius did earlier than him to unlearn his prejudice.

** I base my interpretation of him from Sirius's description of him as a soft idiot - a remarkably generous description considering how vehemently he talks about the rest of the family.

My Regulus is a bit childish and naive - not in his maturity (because I think he was quite a precocious child), but in the way that he views the world. He's eager to please, readily believes what the people he trusts (or, people in authority) tell him until there is stark and blatant evidence to the contrary, and he values loyalty: he believes Sirius still cares for him until he leaves him for James, he believes his principles align with Voldemort's until he leaves Kreacher for dead.

He's a bit prim and proper, he can be petty and passive-aggressive, and he has his brother's tendency towards recklessness when pushed.

He absolutely believed his parents' ideas about blood purity, but I do think that he had mixed feelings when it came to his /own/ superiority - he tried to portray himself with the confidence, arrogance and aloofness that his family and his position (especially after Sirius left) demanded, but I think he was dealing with a lot of insecurities and anxieties about his role in the family and the wider world.

There are a lot of big characters in that family: Sirius, Walburga, Bellatrix... it must have been difficult to stand out, especially as the youngest. Sirius thinks that Regulus was 'the better son', but I don't doubt that Regulus thought exactly the same of Sirius - Kreacher says that Walburga was heartbroken after Sirius left and Regulus must have witnessed her grief, too. I can easily imagine Walburga and Sirius sharing a lot of similar traits (and perhaps is why Sirius hates her so violently: he sees too much of himself in her) and it must have been all too easy for her to wish that Regulus was more like Sirius - more confident, more independent, less compliant - which would no doubt be very confusing for a young teenage Regulus who suddenly found himself the heir of the family after mostly being ignored in favour of Sirius.

And those insecurities and anxieties, that lack of self-worth, is what pushed him to join the Death Eaters - we know that his parents roughly aligned with Voldemort's values, though they weren't themselves DEs despite being at school with Tom Riddle and from one of the oldest, most prominent pureblood families. There must be a /reason/ they weren't among the original followers. And I think Regulus thought that by joining, he would help smooth over the cracks in the family that had appeared after Sirius (and Andromeda) and make them proud - but I think, actually, he just ended up making things worse.

I don't think he had a particularly active role in the DEs - or if he did, I don't think he was happy about it at all and beat himself up about it a lot, afterwards. I don't think someone Sirius described as 'soft' would be happy doling out curses and torturing people. Perhaps his offering Kreacher to Voldemort was to make up for a mistake, or a lack of participation, a last-ditch effort to make something of the mess he had landed himself in.

School-wise, he was better at theoretical than practical work. We know he's intelligent and good at research (otherwise he wouldn't have unravelled the clues about the horcrux) and I think he's booksmart rather that streetsmart - I reckon Transfiguration, Arithmancy, and Runes were his subjects of choice. Maybe Potions because of his diligence, but I doubt he was as creative as, say, Snape. Nobody wants Professor Binns for a teacher, but Regulus probably had a better chance than most at doing well in History.

And - this boy is so full of contradictions - we know he was Slytherins's Seeker, and therefore good at Quidditch. Perhaps, like Harry, flying gave Regulus that sense of freedom and release from his worries that he couldn't find on the ground.

*** That's a really thorough analysis, thanks for your valuable input.

Could his childishness and naivety also be a distinction between him and Sirius here? The older unlearned all of his prejudice by his sixth year, presumably. Or if he hadn't, then he was still doing so while learning it's wrong. This just makes me believe Sirius was a naturally more introspective child who questions everything and curious about the forbidden, while Regulus was more rigid in his thinking. I mean, Harry directly draws a parallel between Regulus and Percy Weasley.

I find your interpretation of regulus being also reckless interesting because the general consensus in the fandom is Regulus as the 'smart brother' and Sirius as the 'stupid brother' while I think nothing points to either being more true than the other, with both brothers being generously smarter than the average person.

You mentioned insecurity; Harry says Regulus is less handsome than Sirius. Could that have also contributed to him being more overlooked, I wonder? As far as we know, Sirius didn't play Quidditch so maybe Regulus volunteered as opposed to his more general traits (prim, proper, neat) just to draw differences between Sirius and himself.

I also believe Regulus was better at theoretical and less practical magic. You've plucked this right out of my mind. Generally I believe he achieved high grades, and was a bit odd for taking History of Magic to the NEWT level. For me, I believe Regulus was good at charms (more light hearted, a softer subject as per Augusta) while Sirius is more scientifically oriented and more precise with transfiguration (as per the wiki). That's not to say he isn't good at practical magic, he just doesn't in tune with it as much as the theory behind it.

One thing I find very common as an interpretation is Regulus being a very quiet, withdrawn person who doesn't frequent parties, nor has many friends (usually it's just Barty, which I have a soft spot for) and is generally the opposite of fanon Sirius (which I feel being a rowdy party animal who sleeps around and drinks himself to unconsciousness everyday a baseless characteristic). But is that strictly true? Couldn't he have been fun as well?

**** NP! I write pretty much exclusively about the Black family and spend a lot of time trying to get into Regulus's head, so I have a lot of thoughts about him!

I think Sirius and Regulus are both curious, but while Sirius is very gung-ho in exploring that Regulus is naturally more cautious and rule-abiding and probably more able to control his impulses than Sirius is - to a certain point.

Which is where the recklessness comes in. Sirius is definitely /not/ stupid, and I'm not a fan of the interpretation of him as being this sort of clownish character. He's canonically intelligent, creative, and extremely capable - he's more than able to hold his own in duels despite being incarcerated for over a decade. But he's definitely reckless, and I think Regulus is too - but Regulus is constantly trying to self-regulate (ha!) himself. The whole event at the cave is completely reckless. Regulus apparently made no plans (why didn't he use Kreacher's experiences and insights? why didn't he take a flask of water with him? why didn't he do /any/ preparation? did he /want/ to die?) and left a note that quite easily identified him. Even if he knew he wouldn't make it out alive, it would still leave Kreacher and his mother (and, presumably, Sirius and every other Black) in danger if Voldemort ever discovered it. Extremely reckless, imo.

Yeah, I 100% think Regulus was overlooked for most of his life. Sirius is so... /Sirius/. I can't imagine him ever being a quiet child. I think he took up a lot of space in that house, and would have done even if he hadn't been the eldest and the heir. And I imagine that Regulus internalised a lot of those comments about Sirius being more handsome, taller, potentially even more clever - because I can see Sirius's magic being a lot flashier, more creative than Regulus's? - just /better/ than Regulus, and probably struggled with feelings of inferiority for his entire life. This might also tie in to why he joined the DEs, as a way of distinguishing himself from Sirius and proving that he could be more than just their second-choice.

I'm not sure I would describe Sirius as more scientific, but more creative? Although perhaps science and creativity are more alike than I think! I feel like Sirius is one of those people that picks things up very quickly, and is just naturally pretty good at most things. Transfiguration is obviously a particular talent of his and I quite like the idea that it's a trait that the brothers share - but while Regulus gets more bogged down in the theory behind it, Sirius is able to be much more creative: two different approaches to the same subject that probably caused some arguments when they lived together!

I personally don't see either Regulus or Sirius as 'fun' in that way! I don't think the Marauders were the popular cool kids they're quite often made out to be. Whenever we see them in canon they're making dorky jokes (the werewolf exam thing, their ridiculous nicknames for each other) and only hanging out with each other. I reckon Sirius was very protective of his little found family and didn't appreciate anyone else trying to worm their way in - I see him being very jealous of Lily, at first, for example.

And I definitely see Regulus as an introvert, far happier curled up in bed with a book than at a party. I headcanon Barty as a few years younger than Regulus, in my fic his closest friend is Evan Rosier (they were cousins and knew each other before Hogwarts) and while he does have other friends, I think he always keeps them at a slight distance, especially after Sirius left, because he's scared of being hurt again. I think he was quite difficult to get to know and didn't easily open up to people, which is also why I struggle to imagine him in a sexual or romantic relationship. But I think in smaller groups or pairs, with people that he trusts, he would be quietly fun, yeah. I reckon he could be quite sharp and acerbic, especially /after/ the fact, like in relating events/conversations to other people rather than in the moment.

***** That makes sense since any intelligent person will have at least some curiosity about the area they alive, if just going by a strictly academic approach.

I wonder if their upbringing had anything to do with recklessness. I stray away from the belief that they came from a strongly abusive household; Walburga may have insulted him senseless in her portrait - drawn after Sirius was disowned and imprisoned, her son missing and husband dead - but the idea that this also means she cast the Cruciatus curse on Sirius if he didn't cut his hair makes me gape at the screen. Negligent almost surely, but physically abusive is a bit of a no-no unless it's linkffn(12948481).

Okay, I have gone into endless rants on this site ever since I joined it three years ago. In fact, this is a new account. I made an entire post about how Sirius is not an idiot in a fit of annoyance on my old account, which I've deleted a month or so ago. It's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/anvuxx/fanon_sirius_vs_canon_sirius/][here]], although to be honest I've changed a bit of my viewpoint since, but it's still a hill I'd die on.

#+end_quote

I'd think that almost cracking the Goblet of Fire mystery in a cave living on rats is enough to pin down his intelligence and strategic thinking, but no, it's still up for debate whether he's an oaf or not. Sirius's tragic flaw is I think his recklessness which comes from a sense of arrogance. I would even go as far as to call it pride in some respect, but among his many contradictions is that he's also a humble bloke on top of his arrogance.

#+begin_quote
  did he want to die?
#+end_quote

You've hit that sweet headcanon spot where I firmly believe Regulus was passively suicidal and a bit of a coward. So there you have this teenage boy who's discovered something groundbreaking and instead of taking it to the people in charge he goes ahead and dies in vain. Part of it is, I think, if he survived then he's on the Ministry, Order and Voldemort's blacklist and he'd rather take the quiet way out. Add to that him being passively suicidal, and it's perfect in his delirious state to just get it over with and die.

While I definitely agree with you on Sirius being better at magic than Regulus in some sense, or even naturally brighter, maybe, it's still such a vapid explanation for him to shack up with the Death Eaters. I usually explain it by him being a spineless person. Barty Crouch too; you have loving parents, a comfortable house, untroubled background and you're a very intelligent student, why did you tread this path? It's also more chilling that a seventeen year old boy sought out the Death Eaters as he explicitly says he saw Voldemort as a father figure. Can't you just resort to a teacher or something? Way too overkill.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not sure I would describe Sirius as more scientific, but more creative?
#+end_quote

Creative, yes, absolutely. When I say scientific, I'm referring to [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Transfiguration][this interview]] where Rowling says transfiguration is a more scientific branch of magic, so Sirius probably had a bit of structural thinking. Although being creative and scientific are not mutually exclusive. You have to be creative to truly enjoy science, because it's like a puzzle to me. Added to my list of headcanons is that Sirius and Regulus bickered about transfiguration at home - talk about some nerdy boys.

Me neither. In fact, Sirius is much more sullen than James in the flashbacks. I often say fanon Sirius is actually more alike to canon James than canon Sirius. If you look closely, Sirius and Lupin are much quieter than James and Pettigrew! I see Sirius as actually quieter around more people, not very sociable but still charming and definitely not shy nor timid, he just prefers his mates and their company over others.

I'm glad somebody else agrees that Sirius and Lily didn't immediately get along or were best mates before James started dating Lily. I see it as Sirius being jealous that his mate has 'picked' her over him. My honest opinion is that all throughout their school years they were antagonistic or indifferent to each other, even their seventh year. I like this because it doesn't make everything easy for everyone - especially James, who needs some conflict in his pampered life - and around the time Lily wrote Sirius the letter it was the fourth year after graduation where they start warming up to each other and being truly amiable.

I relate to your Regulus on so many personal levels; I too love curling up with a book rather than party. Ok, is it funny that I also see Evan Rosier his age? I just add Barty to the mix and get a trio. My favourite romances start with two very private people unexpectedly getting entangled in something to get to know the other. Although, Regulus may have been aromantic or asexual, I guess, although I do not see him this way. Humour-wise, I think Sirius and Regulus were very much alike, while Sirius has sharp, biting wit like Regulus, he also adds a bit more of 'forbidden humour' to the mix which makes him seem more surreal around people who don't know them.

Also, are you comfortable sharing your fic? Because you could count me interested.

****** Oh, I love Blackpool! But yeah, I'm with you in that I don't generally think the Black household was physically abusive - fully on-board with portrait!Walburga being a heightened version of a witch in the midst of an emotional breakdown. I actually think that Sirius was doted on as a young child (the first son of his generation!) and I also struggle to imagine Walburga being happy to hand off her first precious son, whom she named after the brightest star in the sky, to a wet-nurse or whatever. Walburga, thinking anyone's sustenance but her own would be good enough for the Black heir? I don't buy it! But yeah, I imagine that Regulus never received as much attention and that Walburga withdrew her affection pretty quickly one Sirius started 'acting out', but I certainly don't think she was torturing either of them at all, let alone on a Regulus basis. I /have/ flirted with the idea of her giving Regulus Veritaserum at one point, but that's long after Sirius has left home and Walburga is solidly on her mental decline at that point. And again, that's more psychological than physical.

That Sirius post is *chef's kiss* - love it!

Oh yeah, I didn't mean Regulus wanted to distinguish himself from Sirius as the sole reason he joins the DEs - I've basically written an essay on this, but it pretty much boils down to: A, Regulus thinking it will make his parents proud (spoiler: it doesn't); B, Regulus not wanting to get left behind when he finds out that Evan has joined; C, Regulus not completely understanding what he's getting himself into because, D, his joining is part of an internal plot by the secondary branch of the Black family (namely, Cygnus and Lucius) to undermine the primary branch (Arcturus/Orion/Regulus) and gain control of the lion's share of the family's power and wealth. Not to say that it wasn't Regulus's decision to join and that he wasn't delighted to start off with - it was, and he was!

Ah, my third member of the gang is Thorfinn Rowle! Was playing around with having it be a witch to make them an interesting foil to the Golden Trio but having three young wizards makes it a lot easier for them to have secret conversations and bonding time in their dormitory.

So I'm not publishing my fic until it's finished (I'm 56k in, estimating 120-150k in total) just in case I feel the need to retcon something!

******* Blackpool is one of the first fanfictions I've read, but I feel like TDC can be a published author with her prose; it's very beautiful. I do think Sirius was a spoiled child and very privileged, the favourite in the family as he was the heir and the first boy after his older cousins, and not just by his mother. However, I find it interesting that while Snape is mentioned to be neglected in flashbacks, James has 'an air of being adored'. Sirius isn't described as such so I believe while he was comfortable, he just didn't live in a very affectionate household. Another thing I find interesting is that Kreacher - Walburga's mouthpiece - insults Sirius by calling him 'murderer' so probably Walburga didn't endorse murder like so many people have her be. TDC also has another story where they are subjected to psychological abuse. However, I have a soft spot for Izzythehutt's Black Sheep Dog Universe, so I don't they were abusive, just negligent.

Haha, thanks!

You're right, it's probably all these factors, coupled with his upbringing and teenage stupidity in a very intense psychological war that did it. I like option D, I've never seen it done before but it seems unique without being diabolical and comically villainous since it's something that has happened frequently throughout history.

I actually have a fourth member who /is/ a girl, that came from a strong inspiration after reading The Secret History about morally skewed up people, but whom I wanted to redeem. I also love magic mercenary fiction so it was coupled into that but I don't have time to write anything while I'm juggling O-levels and A-levels, so it's blissfully being written in my head.

Oh wow, I've seen the ghost Regulus story many times while browsing but didn't look at it, but I'll give it a shot. I think I'm about to read the second one since I've given myself a break. Kuddos to you for actually having consistent writing and plot, I wish I can achieve this internal motivation - maybe after the winter session is over and my exams are done.

******** Yeah I think I've read all of TDC's HP fics, I appreciate that when they dip into 'darker' themes (ie the psychological abuse) it's always handled very thoughtfully and with lasting consequences for the characters involved. It's not just used for shock value or as an easy way to paint Walburga/Orion as the villains of the story, which I think probably happens all too often. Also, I'm not particularly interested in stories where there are out-and-out villains, I like a bit more nuance! I'm trying to make my Walburga somewhat sympathetic (or at least give her motivations/reasonings for why she acts the way she does) which is admittedly a little tricky when writing from Regulus's POV!

Ah I'm afraid I'm not a big fan of BSDU. I've tried reading a few times and frustratingly I can't even pinpoint what it is that I don't like about it, which is doubly annoying because I'm sure it has many of the elements that I look for in fics. I'll maybe give it another try after I've finished this Regulus story.

Oh I'm glad you like my Black family subplot - it actually came to me as I'd already started writing the story but I thought it was a decent way to add another layer to events. The Black family is so huge, I just there must be so many different rivalries/factions/simmering resentments going on there, just like any big family!

I've been meaning to read The Secret History for a while, it's somewhere on my ever-expanding list of things to read! I hope you get some time to write soon - it's a pain trying to juggle things. I've been writing this Regulus story on and off for about a year now, the pandemic really threw me for a loop and I actually started completely rewriting it during lockdown. But I'm a lot happier with how it's progressing now. And actually, threads like this one are super useful for really nailing down my headcanons and making sure I stay on track, character-wise, so thanks!

********* Yes, it all ties into the plot one way or another. Neither am I, because I really love Orion and Walburga as three dimensional characters who have their own motivations and personalities other than 'cold detached man' and 'shrill screaming woman'. A good villain or antagonist is always the sign of a great writer who has at least given their character stakes and opportunity cost. E.g. Sirius running away but leaving a good life behind.

Oh, I tried reading BSDU three times before I finally managed to actually go through it and it was wonderful. Orion and Walburga are very nuanced people, the dialogue is great, Colette is the pinnacle of good OCs and Sirius defies almost every single stereotype in fandom. The only ones that remain are superficial, such as him liking punk music, etc.

The Secret History is an experience. You'd think it'd be a sludge but I finished it in three days and it's still on my mind. I love anti-heroes and 'Greek students commit a murder in the prologue and karma bites them in the ass' is the perfect plotline. Besides, since English is just my second language this was a goldmine of vocabulary, I always had the dictionary by my side. I'm currently rereading Circe by Madeline Miller and I've forgotten how good that book was.

Classics interests me but the entire time I saw Richard switching from medicine to classics I was internally screaming about job opportunities.

Regulus it is then, I always used to imagine Sirius and Regulus playing the piano. I had a brief period where I imagined Regulus playing the harp, but it was too over the top. However, after Blvnk's recent art, I found a compromise with violinist Regulus and pianist Sirius. Although to be quite fair, I imagine they'd know more than one instrument since wizards have a lot of free time on their hands. Being the idle rich probably also helped. What are your thoughts?

************ Oh Rebecca!! One of my favourites. I'm actually hoping to start work on a fic set in 12 Grimmauld Place around 1900 after this Regulus one, that will be heavily based on Rebecca!

So I was also fully on board with pianist Sirius and Regulus until I realised that pianos weren't invented until after the Statute of Secrecy and I was like, would Walburga allow her sons to learn an instrument so /muggle/? Pre-piano, you've got your harpsichords and virginals and stuff, things like [[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/bGGSWkuRQZ_uBCZevYxqODqOwA_yn9eMOj3o8Pyquj-OpGCjiiY1fqBka9yvuGg4UYa-5UUvj-abCNLaV9hFe3El_DamqPKTKDF0EffRbXAU2nIRO9x0vKxrjkDDVHTYJstCST3B2t6XxO_z3QB8QoOHj6wjscJR9Res8LD6VVmNnDySytkvbpiONK8n1BXgU3-mCx2tiflmn8ri_fGsKzdXseCX9F2tb4Eut-zvKvoLeOanJp8Pqg][this]] that I can totally imagine in the drawing-room, decorated with the Black crest! And I've got to say, I do like the idea of a young Sirius pushing his boundaries and choosing a gong or pair of cymbals or something when his parents let him choose an instrument to study. For Regulus, I've always found the oboe really haunting and melancholic, maybe an early version of that for him.

Also, last time I was looking up instruments I came across the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_(instrument][Serpent]]) - to me it /screams/ the Black family!!

Languages - I think most pureblood families would have their children learn Latin and Greek, purely because most spells and incantations seem to be derived from those languages (although we know that spells /can/ be purely English as well - like Point Me - but because wizarding society is generally very traditional, it's probably still seen as 'better' to use Latin/Greek. also, interestingly, Greek seems to be almost exclusively used for healing spells - episkey, anapneo) and it would also help with Herbology and Astronomy too.

I think the popular fanon idea is that the Blacks spoke French? I prefer German, at least for Sirius and Regulus, because Walburga is a Germanic name, as is her mother's name, Irma. Although to be honest they probably learnt both, as they would definitely help with communicating with the other European magical centres. I could also see some potential for other, more obscure, older languages - different Runic languages, maybe hieroglyphs or Sumerian or something.

Oh and Arabic!! I recently came across the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picatrix][Picatrix]], and Arabic astral/celestial magic in general, which I thought tied in beautifully to the Black family's obsession with the stars.

But I think Regulus specifically would be better suited to the more ancient/obscure languages, and Sirius to the modern - I can see Sirius preferring languages he can use for communication and being better at immersive study (like, staying with relatives in Germany for a fortnight), whereas Regulus would be happy with just reading (totally projecting here - that's precisely why I went for Greek and Latin rather than languages I would actually have to speak!) I also like the fanon interpretation of their uncle Alphard as a traveller, so I reckon he was definitely a polyglot!

************* Looking forward to it! I've followed you on Tumblr to keep up with updates

Interesting research on your part...the statute and the piano would be eight years apart. Although, there may be exceptions such as the radio, because wizards have the WWN, and that was in 1895. I've always wondered about this, I doubt the Malfoys had a wireless, but people like the Weasleys, Boneses and Patils would have those. Oh my, the oboe sounds like heaven, I've never thought of it. It also satisfies the aesthete in me who loves the silhouette of somebody playing the piano or the violin. It looks kind of futuristic but also very 17th century. Consider me onboard.

I wonder how Crouch Snr could speak over two hundred languages. He probably had an innate gift or it's magically propelled knowledge; I quite like a potion where one of the ingredients is the tongue of a native speaker. It's a really expensive item in the magical black market...the tongue or potion. They probably did learn Latin but I've never been satisfied with Ancient Greek, so I take the route of learning Ancient Runes earlier on in life because older books are written with them, it seems to have been the Lingua Franca at some point.

I like how French sounds but it's a pain to learn. I used to speak this but have long since let my skill die, no more sore throats. French is historically more important than German, so that's an advantage to it too. It's more useful because francophone countries exist on almost every continent while German seems to be strictly contained to Europe? But I do think that the Blacks were taught German, absolutely, since it's from Irma Crabbe's side of the family. However, I doubt the Arcturus branch spoke it; just Walburga, Cygnus and Alphard. By extension, the Black sisters and Black brothers.

I'm glad you've shone a light on Arabic, as its my native language and frankly, it's very beautiful with a rich history. Many constellations have Arabic roots. One I can think of is the star Altair (الطير). Classical Arabic would be more useful but they can't trot around speaking that. For dialectal Arabic, if to be spoken, I'd choose Iraqi just because it sounds very regal, and it has the best poetry and authors. Jordanian is also understood by almost everybody.

I actually really like the idea of Jewish Blacks, but it seems to be disproven by canon, unfortunately. So Hebrew had a place on my list for quite a long time, until I remembered Sirius sang Christmas carol and seemed to have memorised those even after years in Azkaban.

I like Alphard as a travelling polyglot but I personally think that he controlled a large segment of the wizarding black market for artefacts and obscure books and texts. But hey, why couldn't he have been both?

************** It does amuse me to think of the more traditional pureblood families deliberately choosing to ignore muggle inventions and live in relative discomfort when halfblood and muggleborn families are living quite happily with like, the radio, cars, maybe central heating!

A mother-tongue potion, I love that! Creepy. 200 languages does seem quite excessive even if you include black market potions or some sort of language learning spell, maybe there's some boasting going on there... although his son was super smart too, so maybe it is true.

Yeah, I think part of my leaning more towards German with the Blacks is that there are already quite a few pureblood families with French-sounding names, even if they're not canonically French - Malfoy, Rosier, Lestrange, maybe Avery too - and also, there are the dark magic connections with Durmstrang. Agree that it's definitely from Walburga's side rather than Orion's though!

Oh wow, I'm in awe - I took a semester of Arabic at uni and it almost killed me. The oral exam was the most humiliating half hour of my life, I think I answered 'I have a book' (I can't even remember how you say that now!) to every single question, no idea how I managed to scrape a pass! I'd completely forgotten about the Arabic constellations - Regulus is 'heart of the lion' in Arabic as well, right?

I wonder whether Sirius's carols were actual wizarding carols or if he just made them up himself... Have you ever heard [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1NgHonWNE0][Gaudete]]? Imagine the cousins being forced to perform this every Christmas!

*************** I don't know, I rather like the 19th century aesthetic but with magic.

I have so many thoughts about the Crouches, they're like my favourite minor characters and they aren't even that prominent, I could just go on and on about them. Barty and Barty being geniuses is just one of them

I've always seen Durmstrang as somewhere in Germany, although it seems to be somewhere in northern Scandinavia. The wider magical community has always captivated me. For the Arab world, I headcanon instead of house-elves, they have teacups, teapots, pans, etc. that when you rub lets out a genie that cleans your house. It's a good way to subvert a powerful stereotype in the wizarding world!

You're very brave trying Arabic, because even as a native speaker I find it extremely difficult to learn classical Arabic. I just stick to my dialect and sludge through learning the other stuff. Although I do like listening to songs and poetry, as well as the calligraphy. Regulus doesn't sound anything like Arabic to me. We say 'qalb al asad' so I can't see how it lines up? Unless there are more obscure synonyms in play, I'll look it up for you if you want.

I always thought it was a tongue-in-cheek way for Rowling to tell us that he was a good singer, in addition to the Stubby Boardman rumours, he might have had a great singing voice. Just like his heavy involvement with animals (Buckbeak, Crookshanks, Pigwidgeon).

I haven't heard the Gaudete but I will when I have the time. I've actually just recently discovered Western music classics like Bohemian Rhapsody. I can totally see them being forced to sing together, however.

Do you have any thoughts on potential occupations Regulus would have had, had he led a normal life? Religious inclinations?

**************** I LOVE the genie idea! Are genies even mentioned in the books? I can't remember any, that kind of feels like an oversight/missed opportunity.

Very brave, or very stupid! Juggling three different languages, with three different alphabets, at the same time, was A Lot. Would not recommend! Don't know how old Bartemius managed it. Oh yeah it wasn't 'regulus', but the Arabic equivalent, I just couldn't remember what it was - does 'qalb al asad' mean 'heart of the lion'? I might just be making this up, I can't remember!

Occupations... besides being extremely rich? Ha! In my fic I have Alphard encouraging Regulus to think about professional Quidditch or horse riding (his aunt Cassiopeia has a stable, and breeds thestrals and winged horses) or /anything/, really, but after Sirius leaves home Regulus is pretty much set on just running the Black estates. Outside of that, I think something academic - a writer, maybe? I thought about an Unspeakable but I don't think he'd like to work at the Ministry. And I love the idea of Professor Black (get rid of Binns and give History to Reg!) but I don't know if he'd want to be so busy? Maybe a historian, and he could give guest lectures at Hogwarts.

Actually - I read a fic where Draco was a genealogist and I could see Regulus being into that. He values family, and I reckon he was very into the family tree and all the Black heirlooms and stuff. I could see him helping people to research their own family trees. Maybe post-war, he could start with his own - tracking down the people who had been removed from the tapestry in previous generations and reinstating them. Aw. I want to write that now!

I haven't really given religion in the wizarding world a great deal of thought, tbh! I have the Blacks hold family get-togethers at Christmas and Easter, but they call them Yule and Ostara instead, after the Celtic/pagan tradition, and basically just use them as an excuse for a family get-together (kind of how Christian festivals are pretty much just cultural rather than religious in the UK for a majority of people).

There are so many similarities between Christian and pagan traditions anyway, but I like the idea of the pagan Wheel of the Year having special significance for certain things - like maybe certain potion ingredients are more potent when harvested during Lammas, or weddings are thought to be more successful when held during Beltane. Oh, and a link between wand woods and the Wheel of the Year - like, wands ought to be made from specific woods during specific times of the year to be the most powerful. I can't remember exactly when they are, but each month (roughly - I think it's split into 4-week periods?) corresponds to a certain tree.

***************** Nope, they aren't depicted in canon. It's like how she mentioned non-British folklore like vampires and look how it ended up. So I'm actually glad she let the fans handle the genies, flying carpets, etc.

Care to share the other two languages? Yes, 'qalb al asad' means heart of the lion. Which honestly doesn't line up with his Regulus sounds.

You've given the Black family so much thought. On your end, Aunt Cassiopeia breeds thestrals and winged horses and on mine their grandfather Pollux has a generous amount of kneazles in their home. Whenever Sirius and Regulus go there - no matter how clean the house is - there are always kneazle hairs on their pillows. I also thought Unspeakable or a genteel Ministry job. Historian sounds extremely good, I was thinking of Defence teacher but in my heart of hearts that job belongs to Remus. One thing I think of Regulus doing is being a part-time healer at St. Mungo's to cure spell damage left by dark magic. The rest is spent doing research in his country house. As you can see, Regulus isn't dead in my mind.

Oh, that's a lovely idea. Genealogist as in the Muggle way or with a sprinkle of magic? It's a lovely idea.

I have a question that I've been pondering over for a while now: is having godparents a regular thing among non-religious people? Are Lily and James devoutly Christian or is it just a thing that people automatically do as in how you mentioned, cultural? I can definitely see the Blacks doing Yule and Osatara. I've never thought it made much sense for wizards to be extremely religious, and I see religion not even taking part in the aesthetic of the wizarding world. But it looks like in casual settings it's Christmas and more formal ones it is Yule.

Potions is definitely much more complicated than 'wizard cooking', a mindset I could never agree with. I can see certain potions need to brewed in midsummer in a valley near mount Olympus on a foggy night where there's a full moon, or something that equally rare and frustrating. Didn't Rowling use something similar? Apparently Hermione's wand is yew and she's born in September, and that's the wood for that month and it lines up with her personality? Yeah, but one thing's for sure, I love making characters and aligning their birthdays and names in relation to their story, just for those obscure etymology or background cookie points. For me, Regulus is born either 12th of January or May 10th, Taurus or Capricorn for me, even if I don't believe in astrology.

****************** Latin and Ancient Greek!

Kneazles! I hope someone's allergic (Bellatrix - she deserves it) and whenever they sneeze someone chimes in with a terrible 'sneezles from the kneazles' joke

Genteel - that's absolutely the word to describe it! He doesn't want something dirty or fussy or that will involve too much bureaucracy. A part-time Healer is very sweet, I like that. It would definitely be genealogy + magic, I think in the fic I read Draco made family trees that sort of grew out of the parchment and could extend as the family grew? Something like that would be nice, tailored to each family's interests.

The godparents thing, among my friend group at least, is sort of dying out. I was christened and I have a godmother, but my parents weren't/aren't religious at all - I think it was just sort of the expected thing to do? And again, an excuse to get all the family in one place and introduce them all to the baby! But most of my friends who have had children haven't had them christened, as far as I know.

Oh, I didn't realise that about the wand woods, that makes sense though. She does seem to utilise astrology for some of the characters too - as a Scorpio myself, I feel like I'm allowed to say that Sirius is a /classic/ Scorpio! I've actually made Regulus a Cancer (June 24th). I wanted the brothers to share an element (the fact that it's water makes it extra poignant!), and for Regulus to be quite young for his year - youngest at home, and youngest at school. I like the sentimental/emotional/intuitive vibes of Cancer, and the turbulence that affects him so much in his teens. I can see him as Taurus or Capricorn too, though, I just tend to lean more into the emotional side of him!

Going back to wand woods, I gave Regulus a cypress-wood wand (a symbol of mourning and the underworld in Ancient Greece/Rome) with a thestral hair core, taken from one of Cassiopeia's!

******************* I wish I can learn Latin someday. I just have so much stuff I want to do that I get so distracted jumping from one hobby to another. I really admire you for juggling three languages.

You reminded me of an idea I had a for a literal family tree through this. It's basically an apple tree watered by a drop of blood each other. For every drop of blood it'll grow a tree to represent the person on it. If it's an orange then the person is ill, if it's rotten they're dead, if there's a blossom it's a new addition to the family.

Thanks for your input, highly appreciated. I guess Lily and James may have been irreligious and just wanted to make it obvious whom they wanted as Harry's guardian in future. That turned out very well indeed.

My three siblings are all Scorpio, I was bummed out when I realised Sirius was one. You're breaking my heart with Regulus being one of the youngest in his year. He was just a kid when he died. People often portray him as this martyr of all that is good and great but it's honestly just extremely tragic that a kid has to take responsibility for something this big and sacrifice himself in the process. He was barely older than I am now, just extremely young and tragic. Regulus Black needed a good mentor and that's a hill I'll die on. Emotional Regulus, and hear me out, when assigning an MBTI just to plot out the layout of a character's personality, Regulus ends up IXFP for me. Maybe INXJ :3

That's a great pick, I personally choose hawthorne for him, sense it's a mess of contradictions in both Pottermore and mythology (although I'm slowly starting to disregard Pottermore more and more these days). The thestral hair core is a nice addition, and it fits him really well. For Sirius, I'm quite conflicted but ebony or blackthorn, maybe dogwood but that's overkill.

******************** Oh I love the blood-apple tree, very creepy and cool!

So the godparent/guardianship thing - I think historically it used to be the case that godparents would have a sort of legal responsibility to take care of their godchild if something happened to their parents (maybe like wards? wards as in children, not protective enchantments! I'm not sure though) but it doesn't work like that any more, there's a lot more legal stuff and I'm pretty sure it has to be explicitly stated in the parents' wills etc. Although, saying that, there's no reason why wizard guardianship would work the same way that muggle guardianship does - in fact, I suppose it makes sense that it would be more like the 'old way'

They were all so young! Alan Rickman was an amazing Snape but I feel like it does take away from the tragedy of it all when you have Snape and the Marauders as 50 (60?) year olds rather than 30 year olds. And Regulus was the youngest of them all, poor thing.

Ok I had to look up the personality thing like I have to do every time lmao, for some reason the letters WILL NOT stick in my head. I'm leaning towards INFP or INFJ for Regulus - although I'm biased because I'm an INFP and I pour a lot of myself into him!

Haha Sirius at 11 getting his dogwood wand just like, wow what a coincidence. And then he discovers his animagus form is also a dog and he's like /really???/ We make gin out of blackthorn (sloe) berries! I like ebony - thinking of his wand in the films, with the runes on it? I LOVE that. I think it would be such a cool thing to be able to personalise your wand and have whatever you carve into it affect it, somehow?

********************* Thanks, feel free to use anything if you like it, and thanks for the godparent clarification.

It's very hard to get somebody to play Snape. You'd have to basically insult them by insinuating that they look just like him, greasy hair and yellow teeth and bat-like appearance and Alan Rickman was far from that. But my dreams of a Harry Potter series spanning the seven books throughout seven season are futile. Although... I see Timothee Chalamet in fancasts, my brain jumps to Regulus or Sirius or maybe even James and then I just see it's a fancast for Snape and I LOL.

Sometimes, I feel if the fanfiction route happens and Sirius goes ahead and falls in love with someone, they'd be older, and not some long lost school girlfriend or Remus (after Azkaban that is), who's just as damaged as him. Regulus would likely be the same had he lived. That's just about what I have for my headcanon on Sirius and Regulus in a relationship.

It's good to see another INFP. Sometimes I project so much of my own self onto my favourite characters that I remember most people don't actually see them that way. Catch me when Dune is released trying to turn Regulus very intricately into Paul Atreides even if they share next to nothing in common. Just because of a face claim...

Why do I imagine wizard kids buying their sands already personalised? Maybe the runes on Sirus's wand were actually put there by Ollivander to complete his wandmaking process. Alternatively, Sirius is an Ancient Runes nerd. I actually have zero thoughts about Sirius's electives, just know that Sirius takes COMC while Regulus has Arithmancy and Ancient Runes. Then he takes up Alchemy in his sixth and seventh years.

I never bought into Timothee as Regulus (he's too interesting-looking for me, I hc Reg as much plainer, still good-looking but in quite an ordinary way, if that makes sense?) but then after seeing him in period costume in Little Women I can see it more and more, although I do still picture him with shorter hair

I like to think that Sirius took Muggle Studies just to piss his parents off but then ended up really liking it - getting all excited to tell Remus about lightbulbs or toasters or whatever, and Remus is just sat there all bewildered at the idea of someone being so pureblood they've never even seen a lightbulb. I saw this comic about Remus taking James and Sirius to a supermarket, it makes me laugh every time, I can't find it now!

Ooh Alchemy. I wish we'd been shown more of the elective subjects! I like adding in like an Anthropology sort of class too, that studies the cultures/societies/languages of magical beings, like goblins and mermaids and giants. I could see both Regulus and Sirius taking that tbh!

I mean, we also have to take into account that anyone is 'rather less handsome than Sirius had been' as Harry put it, because the way Sirius is described, he's a 70s Adonis. The only one who is described much more than Sirius is Riddle. So yeah, after Little Women, he was cemented in my brain as Regulus. Along the same lines is maybe Colin Morgan?

I like the idea but it's also a bit 'eh' because the things he does at school (animagus, two way mirrors, map) suggests he's bored and likes a good challenge. I also cannot see him taking three electives. So it's either his spiteful pride or his interest, and I go with the former. So yeah, I agree with Muggle Studies lol. There are many headcanons along the supermarket one, one of which is being introduced to soda cans, which is one of the only ideas that doesn't make me punch myself in the face.

I think with the way wizards treat merpeople and goblins they'd be too prideful to study this at school. Although I do kind of get wistful about a class that details magical geography (in canon, Transylvania and Assyria are their own seperate nations!), or other wizarding cultures such as the Middle East, Africa and the Carribbean in particular fascinate me.

** I loved Regulus in Dead Man Walking by cywscross. It's unfinished but what's there is definitely worth a read.

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.

  Three days after he turns fourteen, Sirius Black is called home. One month later, Orion Black is dead and Sirius must accept a title he's never wanted - and along with it, a nice fat bullseye on his head. Sirius realises why he wasn't allowed to turn down the succession: for that to happen, he must die. Not 24 hours later, he's considering it as an option. Warnings inside.

  Ron and Hermione died due to the events at Malfoy Manor and Harry was on track to join them. Alone and beaten, Harry resorts to the most horrendous magic to try and save his own life and continue the hunt for Voldemort's Horcruxi. An act that would start him on the path to becoming a monster so much greater and more terrible than the one he had set out to destroy.

** Regulus in linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky) is by far and away the best I've seen. An alchoholic sarcastic conman who's just one of the funniest characters in that whole fic. I love it.

** I think Regulus was quiet, someone who liked to stay in the shadows. I can't imagine him having any friends - I don't think he would trust people enough to share with them important things about himself. I think he was smart, maybe even smarter than Sirius, but he wasn't flashy, and most of the time, his successes and accomplishments went overlooked because whatever he did, it wasn't shiny, bright and loud.

He definitely had abandonment issues. He grew up in a big family, but they all left him one by one. Andromeda was disowned, Narcissa married and started her own family, Bellatrix became enamoured with Voldemort, Sirius ran away. I think Regulus desperately wanted someone to pick him, but everyone always treated him as the second choice.

He wanted to please his parents, make them proud, and it probably was why he joined Voldemort - he thought that's what they wanted.

I don't like when authors shy away from the problem of Regulus joining Death Eaters. He probably believed in the whole pureblood bullshit, though considering his fondness for Kreacher, maybe not as strongly as the rest of his family.
