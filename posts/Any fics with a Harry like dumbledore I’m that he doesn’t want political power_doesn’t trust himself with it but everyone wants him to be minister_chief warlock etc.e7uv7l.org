** The linkffn(Resonance) trilogy has something sort of like this a bit further in. Harry defeats Voldemort very early on, in sixth year, and finds himself at a bit of a loss as to how to live the rest of his life. Dumbledore in this fic has been not allowing himself to age normally so he can stay alive to combat Voldemort, and resumes aging and dies in Harry's seventh year.

At several points the Wizarding public is quite frightened of how powerful Harry is and Harry finds it useful to emulate Dumbledore's mild mannerisms to put them at ease. He also dresses up as Dumbledore at a Halloween party at one point.

** Linkffn(12307886) has Harry very reluctantly becoming a political figure and Chief Warlock but that isn't really the focus of the story

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.
