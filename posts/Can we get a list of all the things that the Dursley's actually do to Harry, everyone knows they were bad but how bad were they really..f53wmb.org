All the things that they did to him in canon to see it straight and not little mentions at the start of seven books


** There's already one, and even if we just go off the top of our head with being kept in the cupboard when there is another room, given only secondhand clothes when they can clearly afford more, telling him his parents were drinks who killed themselves, it shows the Dursleys actively engaging in emotional abuse and intentional disgusting neglect.

They're going out of their way to show him he's unloved, that he's a freak, that he doesn't deserve to be loved and cared for. Forget being physically abused, this kind of abuse is just as bad because it leaves mental scars that never go away.

I'm honestly sick and tired of people who come into this sub demanding we be "fair" to the Dursleys because "oh it's just a fanon thing, they weren't that terrible to him in canon". They were and they don't deserve to be forgiven.

*** What annoys me is when people go the other way and add on all sorts of non-canon abuse. The way he was treated in canon is more than terrible and should work fine for any plot line of that type.

As for those who don't think the Dursleys were that terrible, it genuinely makes me worried about their reaction to abusive situations in the real world. Hopefully its just that it's spread out a fair bit and they didn't notice.

Same. but I also understand because it's fairly easy and justified to assume that the casual abuse we saw in canon was just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. I've also noticed sometimes that the authors are projecting their own abuse, or seem to think the canon abuse isn't clear enough which, given how some people think it isn't abuse, is a fair assessment.

Ron is another example where people seem to think we shouldn't bash him or isn't awful simply because people are blind to non-physical forms of manipulation and abuse. I'll shut up before I write an essay on Ron.

****** I'm really bad at explaining so bear with me, I'll keep it short though, my main issue with Ron is his relationship with Hermione. Ron, throughout the time he's known Hermione, gaslights her, verbally and emotionally abuses her, and uses her. Hermione with her self-esteem issues, latches on to that kind of attention and dependency, and is thus emotionally, intentionally or unintentionally, manipulated into thinking she likes him. This never leads to healthy relationships later on, and often ends up with the Rons domestically abusing the Hermiones. Bickering and constantly sniping and fighting is not "aww they're like a married couple", and they do not have much in common besides Harry.

He makes her feel like she isn't attractive before Yule Ball, then when she shows up as the Belle of the Ball, he waits until her night is over and ruins it for her, that's an abusive person's classic poisoning tactic. She later makes the first move, invites him to Slughorn's party, he throws that in her face by snogging Lavander because he suddenly felt inadequate since he found out from Ginny that Hermione allegedly had made out with Viktor, and because of her assuming he used the Felix potion illegally.

Ron has jealousy and inadequacy problems, he feels like he's not good enough at anything and so others having something he covets makes him feel terrible. That applies to Harry multiple times (fame money etc) and Hermione (smart and praise from teachers).

Hermione has self-esteem issues stemming from her looks earlier on in the series and people's dislike of her for being bossy and a know-it-all. So much so that when Ron said what he did as a reaction to being shown up at magic by the demonstration of the floating spell as a kid, it broke her down because she feels that people dislike her and she's been trying to help people to make them like her but it's not working.

She also has (guessing here) a lack of close friends besides Harry, Ron, and Ginny which makes it hard for her to have someone to point out what I said to her as Harry is emotionally stunted, and Ginny is Ron's sister. Case in point, when Ron makes out with Lav, Harry fails to clearly stand with Hermione. As far as she knows, Harry is acting like this is just another of their fights, but it wasn't, it was Ron intentionally hurting her. To Hermione, her friend is communicating that this shit is okay.

[[http://keiramarcos.com/2016/10/reckless-and-a-little-magicalharry-potter/][First three paragraphs of this one-shot expand a bit on how shit Ron is to Hermione.]]

All of this is just about Ron and how he is towards Hermione. Let's not forget the two times Ron abandoned the trio even when he immediately knew he was in the wrong, and his apologies when he came back were horrendous and only because both Hermione and Harry are dependent on him and desperate that they easily forgive him, and it doesn't help that Harry had repeatedly demonstrated that Ron is his closer best friend than Hermione.

This is not to say that I see Hermione as perfect. She has faults, she makes mistakes. She has communication problems and lacks the ability to know when she's wrong and when she should relax. That does not mean it's okay for her to be treated like that.

JKR, in a series written for children/teenagers, created an abusive relationship and said essentially "YO, this is relationship GOALS, boys who like you will treat you like shit and insult and manipulate you, you should marry them and you'll have a happily ever after with them. THIS IS REAL LOVE".

******* I definitely hear your argument and pretty much agree. My overall feelings on the matter are definitely colored by my childhood perception, since I started reading the series when I was seven/eight, but objectively, what you say makes sense, and I do think Hermione and Ron don't make sense together, and she would have been much better off with Harry, at least compared with all the other well-developed male characters in her age range.

******** Honestly, I'm the same as you. I was completely blinded by the series since I practically grew up with it and it took a third read through and an illuminating conversation with a friend of mine who been in Hermione's situation. It helped that by the third read through I'd become a hardcore leftie.

JKR is a dirty 90s neo-liberal.

** Kept him in the cupboard.

Never got a single present and no birthday greetings.

Never treated as a member of their family, so he never featured in any photos.

Lied about his parents.

He was very small for his age, means he was not properly fed.

Left him in one of the busiest railway station in Philosopher Stone.

Never took him to optician after his glasses were broken.

Locked him in the room like an animal.

Encouraged Dudley to bully Harry.

Petunia tried to hit him with a pan, but misses.

Ruined his reputation in neighborhood by spreading rumors.

Marge sets her bulldog on Harry, when he climbed a tree to escape, she left him there for hours while laughing.

These are the things I can remember.

*** Malnourishment for sure, they used no food as a punishment so he had to sneak out to get some, and even when they feed him in CoS it's a tiny amount.

Bit of conjecture there, isnt it? I cant recall anything explicitly saying he was starved or malnourished.

Being grounded is perhaps the closest the Dursleys got to treating Harry like a normal child. I mean, they were somewhat excessive about it, but..."Like an animal" might be a bit overboard a reaction.

**** Starving someone and not feeding them properly are different things. Starving means not providing them enough food to function. Not feeding properly means feeding them the bare minimum needed to function and perform tasks. Besides, in HPSS, Harry states that the Dursley's didn't starve him, but they didn't exactly feed him well. Or something along those lines. So yeah, he wasn't starved just underfed.
