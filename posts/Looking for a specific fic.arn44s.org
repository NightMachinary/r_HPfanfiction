I read it a while ago, and it was sadly incomplete (and possibly abandoned).

So: The story starts at Harry's first year, in a totally reimagined Hogwarts. The house points are personal and used to 'buy' things (like your own room, or for having the house elves do your laundry). You get the points based on performance and house, so the best Gryffindor will get 5 points, and the rest will receive less. Therefore, the older students are working in groups of 4 (one of each house) to get the most points (and not compete against each other). I remember that Harry's group had Neville (Gryffindor) initially, but that they stopped getting along. Hermione (also Gryffindor) was by herself and would've probably joined Harry later. I don't remember in which house Harry was in. Surely not Gryffindor, maybe Hufflepuff.

I hope someone has any idea what I'm talking about. Thank you!
