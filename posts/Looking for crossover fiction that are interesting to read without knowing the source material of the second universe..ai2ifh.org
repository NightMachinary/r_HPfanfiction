The idea is that there are plenty of interesting universes out there that one could learn about, but finding an entry into a new franchise/universe isn't always that easy. Which is why it would be great to use crossovers as a jumping-off point - if one half of the story is atleast familiar, it might be easier to ease into something new.

Not to mention, borrowing interesting ideas from other sources can make for great and unusual stories. So, any suggestions?

** Linkffn(Denarian Knight)

I read this one and enjoyed it immensely without ever hitting up Dresden files. The third sequel gets wierd so I would stop after the second.

I've read a few Naruto crossovers without any foreknowledge and have been fine. Chakra = magic.

EDIT: oops linked the sequel but you get the picture

**** The Ancient/Merlin angle is the usual tie-in, from what I have seen. Also, putting the two together works for me, since Apparating has a description ("like being sucked through a tube") that could be interpreted as a form of wormhole travel. That, and the general anti-religion tenor of SG also fits.

I wouldn't put either milieu together with Percy Jackson, but others disagree.

** Late, but:

linkao3(Whispers in Corners by esama) is a Sherlock/HP crossover that I particularly like. Someone already recced esama, and I definitely want to second that. It's more focused on romance than world building though.

linkffn(I See the Moon by hctiB-notsoB) is an Avengers/HP story that mainly focuses in on the relationshio between Bruce and Harry. Super sweet, though Harry is certainly not like his canon self. Definitely hilarious.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter) isn't marketed as a crossover, but essentially is. It's not really labelled as one because you don't need any knowledge of the other fandom (Song of the Lioness, or the entire Tortall universe maybe) to get through it, and it doesn't take place in the other world either. What it /does/ do is bring plot elements, ideas, and characters from SotL to create a rather unique fic. Reading this got me to pick up the real SotL series. too. It actually contains more worldbuilding for the other fandom than the two other crossovers I linked.
