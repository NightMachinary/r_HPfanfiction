Just curious, and it seems to me like a likely plot someone already must've used.

I read this a little while ago, it's a marauders fic but it starts with almost your premise. Harry's dead in the forest, Hermione's in the ROR with Draco and he casts a spell that causes her to be sent back to the marauders 7th year. She proceeds to do everything she can to ensure the final battle doesn't have to happen again.

** If I remember correctly, Linkffn(Shadow Walks) covers this, but in a different context than what you specifically requested.

** Harry was just a kid at the time. Not a very intelligent one, at that. Why the hell would anyone want to revive him?
