Are there any fics where Harry is naturally smart and very good at practical magic like Riddle or Dumbledore without being OP?

Any pairings (or no pairings) work as long as its not Snarry, Drarry or Harmony.

Bashing fics are also fine but no harems/multi-pairs.

Thank-you!!


** If self promo is okay, this is my completed year 1 fix of a smart magically powerful Harry. It's got a tiny bit of everything in it. If your interested here's the link. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I'm working on book 2 now among my other projects so if you like it stay tuned for more

** +/There is always Methods of Rationali/+

/Ahem/. Linkffn(Harry Potter And The Boy Who Lived) Comes to mind with a Genius Harry.

Linkao3(Harry Potter And The Ashes Of Chaos) is a WBWL story where Harry is a natural at magic and comparable to Riddle.

Linkffn(An Simple Act Of Vengeance) Has a Harry who is a natural at wandless magic.

Linkffn(The Mind Arts) Harry kickstarts his intelligence with mind magic.

#+begin_quote
  After a miserable ending to an otherwise magical first year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter wants nothing more than to escape the clutches of his muggle relatives once more and return to the world in which he belongs. His brother Charlus, the Boy-Who-Lived, wants nothing more than to redeem his own failures and prove to not just the wizarding world, but to himself as well that he is more than just some child celebrity.Unbeknownst to Harry and Charlus, the two of them will have to struggle with more than their own personal demons. There is a monster roaming the halls of Hogwarts, one controlled by an equally mysterious Heir of Slytherin, one who is seemingly hell-bent on destroying Hogwarts from the inside out. How will the Potter twins react to threats from this Heir of Slytherin, along with their own personal struggles, both internal and external? And what of the enigmatic Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor who seems to be far more than what meets the eye?

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him. The sequel, Wrath and Remorse, is published on this site.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** So one of my all time favorites is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/68/][Death of Today]] It's a slashfic which might not be your thing and Harry is called Izar in this which takes a bit to get used to. (Slowburn Harry/Voldemort) Apart from that, I still highly rec you to check it out. One of the best Death Eater!Harry fics I've read. It has a very interesting plot and plot-twists. Features manipulative!Voldemort, smart!Harry, a good character developement for Harry as well, cool world-building, especially in spell developement, alive Lily and James, Death Eater raids, clashes with competent Aurors.

Minor spoiler alert but an explanation for the premise: So basically Harry (Izar) is a product of an affair between Lily and Regulus Black - Lily seduced him in order to get intel for the Order of the Phoenix. She gives him up to an orphanage. Thus Lord Voldemort never got defeated the first time aroumd, but the Order is still fighting hard against him

I linked the complete fic on ffn above, but an edited version is currently being posted on ao3, chapter by chapter which is that one Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26953177]])

  HP/LV Slow Burn. Major AU. Orphaned and having no tolerance for Muggles, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by both the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. His loyalty, however, is not to the Ministry nor to the Death Eaters, but to the cause of bettering himself and becoming his own force in the Wizarding world. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

Its kind of unreaslistic but not crack with time travel elements (not like redo or anything it just there to have more time in the day) and no bashing of Harrys brother. Its so so well done please give it a try!!!! You can even read it without seeing the other fandoms (i did the first time and i still havent seen CSI even though ive seen the other shows by now)!!!!!
