At some point, most of us have probably read a fic where the main character is raised by Bellatrix Lestrange, Cassiopeia Black, Sirius, etc. Most of these stories include certain predictable features, e.g. MC get to know a lot of Pureblooded children before going to school (regardless of whethe they are pureblooded or not), they are bscenely rich, they have been educated in 'pureblood' traditions, etc etc.

I enjoy these fics just as much as anyone else, but when all of these predicatble tropes feature in every story it becomes boring. One of my favoruite stories of all time is Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7 because it includes some of these things, and a Harry raised by Bellatrix, but does everything well and without overdoing anything.

So, what I would really like to see is something different. E.g. main character is bellatrix or Sirius' child. They are sent to live with Walburga afetr their parents die or go to prison. They live with her until she dies after which they are stuck in Grimauld place with just Kreacher until they are found. perhaps by Sirius in third year, maybe by another relative or the Order of flaming chickens. Story progresses from there, you get the idea. From this basis, you could have a character who is wealthy, has a partial 'traditional pureblood' education, but has no socialisation with people, has never hqd discipline, and has maybe experimented with magic using a wand they found and the dubious library housed within Gramauld place. They could even be a few years younger than the canon main characters and then interact with them from the PoA timeline onwards.

Just a few random ideas. What do you all think? DO youi have any reccommendations to make?


** There are a couple fics where Harry is adopted by the Tonks family or just Andromeda at some point AFTER beginning at Hogwarts. It's either that or the "pureblood" tropes.

Since all of the Tonks ones have a Harry/Tonks pairing, I started writing a fanfic which is centred around Andromeda becoming an aunt in the mother role and Tonks the honorary big sister. However, it begins after the third year, so I am not sure whether it is what you are looking for on not. It has some more background on the Black family and especially Andromeda, Narcissa and Bellatrix and I definitely will stay away from those ridiculous "pureblood" tropes, so it might be down your alley.

  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turns out to be the best decision Sirius ever made. Eventual Harry/Lisa Turpin.
