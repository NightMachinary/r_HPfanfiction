I've seen some stories where you can create a Horcrux by simply killing somebody and then, with a spell, move the soul piece in a container. However I am more curious about fanfics which account for the fact that JKR stated that it's an extremely horrible process.

*** Witchcraft by a Picture! ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5316529/1/Witchcraft-by-a-Picture]])

I don't remember how far it gets into the horcrux creation itself, but it's a great story that at the very least goes into the consequences and effects of horcrux creation.

** Shezzas Denarian series [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4359957/6/The-Denarian-Lord][has a bit]] on horcruxes - I am not sure if it is invented stuff for the fanfic or if the lore is pulled from the Dresden Files (of which it is a crossover with). Below is the relevant stuff but you can also Ctrl-F horcrux and read the couple relevant paragraphs.

or... "To create a Horcrux, one must commit a great evil, cold-blooded murder," "This acts as a ritual, in a way, opening our level of existence to those below." the methods of creating them barbaric and sadistic.\\
To create a Horcrux, one must make a murder of an innocent person. could you drag a small child off the street, slit their throat, mutilate their corpse, ingest their flesh and use their blood as the symbols for a summoning circle, all on a whim?" "The murderer cannot kill under the pretence of righteous judgement or for the greater good," they must take a cold-blooded kill and thoroughly enjoy it. They must profane themselves, their souls and this very world with the creation ritual, the contract of sorts with creatures far beyond our realm, deep in the Nevernever where even the Fae do not tread: the twisted power and knowledge of the J'irth'kyaka 'Half-twisted creatures of creation, failed products of life who's souls were never properly formed. As such, they can enter neither heaven nor hell. They; can never find peace in their tormented lives. They are immortal, ageless and in constant agony. It's a wonder how Voldemort managed to stay relatively sane when bartering with such things.'

"To create such a terrible object fractures your very soul By binding pieces of his soul to these objects, Lord Voldemort has gained enormous power. He has the ability to resist the touch of the mortal coil Voldemort has also increased his... perception, so to speak. He can see power and magic in ways that you and I will never be able to. This has given him great power."

Hope that helps! Best Horcrux stuff I've run across.
