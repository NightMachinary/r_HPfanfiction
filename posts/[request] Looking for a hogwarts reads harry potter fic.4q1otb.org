So most of you might be thinking I'm looking for a Hogwarts read harry potter books but, that's not it. What I'm looking for is something like this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8918000/1/Harry-Potter-Reads-the-Multiverse]]


** It's called "The Marauders' Companion" and it's about the Marauders and Lily reading bad fanfiction stories. Not exactly what you were looking for but I hope you like it.

** I can't believe I'm throwing this fic up again, but have you tried linkffn(Dimension Hopping for Beginners)? Not reading the books but hopping multiverses.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

*** Yeah i read it, but it's not what i'm looking for. I want something closer to: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10483604/1/Allied-Shinobi-Forces-reading-Naruto-DxD-Purpose-of-Living]].

** For completeness, there's linkffn(11606412). Not very well written, but the Inception-like quality of a /read-the/-read-the-books fic is pretty surreal.
