Do any of you guys ever start reading a great fic. Its believable, canon, characters aren't ooc - and then out of nowhere an unforgivable either trope, pairing, or even like time period detail just ruins it for you to the point where you can't read it any more? If so what are those story ending things for you guys?!?


** Happens all the time. Just now: linkffn(3882344) ... setup nice, development good, I hoped I finally found a decent Harry/Susan Bones story, but all issues are soooo stretched and people behave like idiots just to keep needlessly conflicts alive, that it is almost unbearable.

**** I don't care that much about ships. I usually prefer Hinny, but mostly because stories tend to be more interesting (especially contrary to Harmony ... Harry and Hermione tend to be *so perfect*, that it is unbearable). Dramione doesn't make any sense canonically, so it must be either heavily AU, or post-war with heavy conversion therapy for Draco (and then I would probably prefer OC ... still eagerly waiting on sequel to linkffn(Exile by bennybear)). What I am most afraid of (and which I am afraid is the foundation of plenty of Dramione stories) is the idea, that love of good girl will change a bad boy to be good. That is so repulsive, that I would generally stay away from such stories with a distance (I know a couple of victims of domestic violence).

Well, at least you are not into Snamione.

***** I agree that something needs to heavily change Draco to make that work (or maybe change Hermione, if you're going for something dark).

I wonder, do you think there could be special circumstances that justify "Love Redeems"? I quite enjoyed a long fic recently where Severus, upon his canonical death, is offered the chance to return to his teenage self, six months after his estrangement from Lily, and choose another path. He accepts on the basis that if he can keep Lily alive this time, anything else is worth it. But upon seeing his newfound patience, maturity, and especially his firm rejection of the Death Eaters (though he's still antisocial, private, and prickly), Lily gives their friendship another chance, and the happiness of having her back in his life sloooowly makes him less abrasive and more able to forgive others.

Severus unquestionably has codependency issues in that fic, and is paranoid about her safety, but I've seen mixed opinions on whether it's actually abusive. For example, when they discuss possible enchantments on her engagement ring, he acknowledges that his pragmatic suggestion would be a tracking charm. But he's fair about it; asked how he would feel about that being applied to /his/ ring, he's 100% ok with her being able to find him. He sets wards that alert him when she leaves their house, but when she's missing for longer than expected, he doesn't punish or shout at her, merely spends a sleepless night worrying (and his fear for her is not unjustified given the war they're in; she's later kidnapped to get to him, and they barely escape with their lives). He freaks out a bit when she wants to join the Order of the Phoenix, and uses his leverage with Dumbledore (who knows about his foreknowledge) to veto her membership, which upsets her. But he isn't idle in the war, or unsympathetic to her desire to see Voldemort gone; he just wants to fight like a Slytherin, with information and planning, and keep her off the front lines. She can and does contribute a great deal to everyone around her in ways other than fighting, even apart from her special role in keeping him sane (because, with his future knowledge, he has unique value to the war effort). And as atrocities continue to occur, she does develop an appreciation of where he's coming from, especially after her kidnapping, despite still having mixed feelings.

Would that still be unacceptable by your standards?

****** Are you talking about linkao3(Severus Snape and the Art of War CypressWand)? That's set in the Marauders era, so it is before most of Snape's crimes. I have specifically mentioned for Draco post-war scenario, so Snilly is not an exercise in paedophilia (with Snamione my other biggest problem is that he could be literally her father, her classmates' parents were his classmates, after all).

I can imagine (and there is just a zillion or so of such stories, I am sure) the Draco's conversion before the Battle of Department of Mysteries, where he was just a stupid prick, not a murderer (two attempted murders are quite crimes in my books on the same level as the accomplished ones; being inept and unable to accomplish your crimes doesn't make you any better). And that would certainly fall into “heavily AU” category.

** - Bashing if it turns characters into morons. I've read so many stories where it looked like the bashing was done well, and suddenly Dumbledore does something you'd expect from a five year old child instead of a supposed master manipulator that's been running everything from the shadows from decades.

- Overly self-righteous Harry. Some righteousness is just fine, but when he starts metaphorically shitting rainbows it's a no sir for me.

- Writing about rape for the sake of having rape in the story. Seriously, just, why? Like it doesn't come up at all for 100k words, then suddenly it's randomly mentioned that death eaters are rapists, and then it never comes up again. It serves no purpose and leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. Especially the ones where it's introduced as a method to paint Harry as a hero. Even more so if literally nobody does anything about it but Harry.

- Daphne Greengrass. Like I don't immediately bow out of a fic when she's mentioned, but there are some specific cliches about this named OC that just make it absolutely impossible for me to continue reading. She somehow manages to make her way into fics where she isn't even a listed character.

- Friendly, main-ish character OCs. I don't mind OC enemies. I don't mind OC side characters, be it extra kids from older Hogwarts years, Aurors or order members. But any time an OC appears and starts becoming closer then the canon 'Ministry Six', I drop the story and move on to the next one.

*** I'd say that last point /can/ be done well, but it tends to have a very strict requirement: There must be no canon character that would fit the role occupied by the OC. For example, a story where there's a decent teacher at Harry and Dudley's primary school that starts looking out for Harry - there's basically no real Muggle characters shown in the series at all outside of the Dursleys (Hermione's parents aren't even given names or descriptions, for Merlin's sake!).

** Not a specific plot direction, but recently I have been coming across fics that look good and the story has potential but suddenly the writing becomes unbearable.

The most glaring example I can recall is 'In the Forest of Dean' by T3Tohru (can't figure out how to use bot for ao3). The plot is really cool and I like the characters but oh god the author suddenly became incapable of writing a single interaction or emotion in less than 20 lines some 10 chapters in. Everything is written so intensely that it puts you off. Every third paragraph Hermione will remind you why she absolutely has to <insert generic war task> because she absolutely cannot fathom subjecting herself to living a second without Harry, and vice-versa with Harry.

Similarly, a normal Harry Sirius fic after 2 chapters suddenly becomes incapable of referring to Sirius as anything but the "dogman". Why?? Oh and the each twin only saying <5 words continuously before the other twin has to complete for them. Like, does a single line need to be broken into 4 parts between the two of them? And not once but every time they speak?

I'm baffled, anyone else see such fics with writing that starts off okay but becomes trash? Or am I just getting more critical the more I read a fic?

The two examples that come to mind are HPMoR (started out a fun and humorous fic about a semi-Stu Harry trying to analyze and quantify magic, became a dark political clusterfuck) and an old Naruto fic called "People Lie" (suddenly introduced eldritch horrors and had the characters getting turned into totally-not-vampires-honest).

** Yes. I once read a pretty good fic with Harry, Sirius and Remus --- and then BAM it's Wolfstar. I understand wanting to surprise people with a pairing, but there should be warnings for pairings like this. And that's only one instance. I can't count the number of times I've been so excited to read a fic, only to stop halfway because the author decides that friendship isn't enough. No, platonic friendships are old now, there's no such thing as really really close friends, they HAVE to be lovers.

Right, I'll go now before this descends into my rant about why I think Wolfstar is a shitty pairing.

**** Right. So.

First of all, I am in no way a homophobe, so don't mistake my hate for the pairing as hate for gay people in general. In fact, bisexual!Sirius is one of my favourite headcanons.

Second, to all Wolfstar fans reading this, I mean no offence, so by all means, continue reading/writing whichever pairing works best for you. This is just my own opinion.

Now, let's get on with it.

What I hate so much about it is how Sirius and Remus' friendship is one of the greatest things in the series, but Wolfstar has to go and ruin it all by inserting romance. It's like people, even those of the same sex, can't have a simple platonic relationship. No, there is no such thing as really close best friends, there is only friends and lovers. As if romance is the next step after friendship, when in reality, the two are vastly different from each other.

Also grating on my nerves is the assumption that, just because Sirius has no known girlfriend in the series, he has to be gay. Again, I'm not a homophobe, but just assuming that he's gay means ignoring that there are people who simply don't want a relationship, can't get one or don't have time for one. Like me, for instance.

The development of the relationship in fanfiction is usually really unrealistic as well. In a lot of Wolfstar fics, it is done as a way to exclude Peter, since then we have Jily and Wolfstar, and Peter is left as the annoying fifth wheel. In others, particularly post-Azkaban fics, it is done to "let Sirius have some fun". And /of course/ the only way you can do that is by making him have a romance with his best friend. Never mind the fact that there are loads of other witches and wizards in the Order to choose from.

And this ridiculous notion that the only way Sirius can be happy is by having a partner. Or that having a partner immediately solves all his problems. Well, newsflash, depression and other mental illnesses are more complicated than that! Sharing a few kisses with someone won't just fix someone who's battling something like that.

And I actually think that, after all Sirius has been through, he won't have time for romance. He'd be too busy dealing with the past and present, not to mention that being isolated for almost 12 years doesn't do wonders for someone's social skills. So even if he decides to try a relationship, it'd be after dealing with all his problems, most likely going to a therapist. The only way I'd support a relationship straight after getting out of Azkaban is if it was with his pre-Azkaban partner, or someone who is really close to him --- but NOT Remus.

It's just, seeing them acting all lovey-dovey is weird, OOC and, frankly, disgusting. A young couple might act like what fanfiction describes their relationship as, not Sirius and Remus. And, no matter how hard I try, I can't picture them kissing or having sex. It just won't come.

I could go on for hours about how much I hate the pairing, but this post has gotten way too long already, so I'll finish up here.

Peace.

Of course, Remus thinks he betrayed Lily and James, which could complicate things.

There's another fic I deliberately can't remember the name of where a semi-decent political!Harry suddenly started Basil-Expositioning Hermione in a DADA lesson about how Homosexuality was evil and would make you lose your magic.
