** I can totally see Harry /repeatedly/ dragging Dudley and his gang through the hallway. Just waiting for a teacher to finally look for them. Just so he can"These aren't the kids you're looking for..."

** Even better if he gets to the Wizarding World and gets distressed by all the 'Jedi-like sentiments' that everyone has, then sets up his own Sith Order, working it all out as best he can.

Eventually, he sends an Owl to George Lucas. Lucas obviously doesn't respond, fanboys and all that, so he goes after the next best thing - the man who parodied Star Wars. Cue a Sith Harry Potter inspired by Dark Helmet and exchanging letters with Mel Brooks. :D

Harry's version of Divination is just reading the Harry Potter books. :D

(For those who haven't seen it, there's a Star Wars parody movie called Spaceballs that was made in '87. It's great.)

*** If harrys birth was pushed forward to the mid 90s, he would grow up when the prequels released, imagine him going Palpatine on the magical world, have a war so that he can claim absoulte power.

**** I would love to see a Harry acting like full blown Camp-AF Palpatine. Ian McDiarmid's campy, hammed-up-to-hell, Shakespearean-drama Palpatine performance in the prequels would be hilarious on Harry's part.

It would be such an interesting variation to the usual "I lace my cocaine with the tears of my enemy's wives and daughters" emo-Harry that he always seems to do whenever he's a villain. A Villain Harry who loves life and evil and has fun the whole while would be a delight. :)

****** Or Harry pulling off that mad spinning thing Palpy does in the final confrontation with Windu while he's in the graveyard.

Or in the bathroom with Malfoy:

"Strike me down with all of your hatred and your journey towards the Dark Side will be complete!"

"What are you talking about, Potter? I'm already a ruddy Death Eater! You moron!"

"Yes! Let the Hate flow through you!"

"For fuck's sake, Potter!"

...Ah shit. I'm adding this to the to-write list now. Idea number bloody 135. Buggering womblenuggets.

**** Sith is used in the novelization of the trilogy, if memory serves, and it is definitely used in the various books that were published before the prequel trilogy, even if it weren't until then it was canonized.

If Harry were to watch the movies and realize that he has achieved something similar it is not unreasonable to have him look for more information in, say, a library.

** I have it a plot bunny where Harry watches the Star Wars movies, reads some EU novels, tries to be a Jedi, but finds out being a Sith is more fun.

It's basically like this, but he's much subtler about it. (He still "Mind Tricks" Dudley though.)
