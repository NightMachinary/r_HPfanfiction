:END:
All i remember from the story is that ; Harry is sorted to Slytherin but rejected by his housemates, they throw him and Draco (+ Blaise and Theodore??) out with their belongings, so they have to sleep in Snape's guest room. The students make his life hell; cursing him in hallways and classrooms and his housemates bully him by accepting Blaise and Theo back but not Harry and Draco. Then, Harry is somehow made seeker so they ''accept'' him back..and Harry is pissed off and refuses but is forced back into the dorms..
