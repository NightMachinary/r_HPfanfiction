I am looking for stories 40,000 words and up where Harry is either metamoph or a metamoph is a big part of the story.


** I tried writing my own but gave up once I realized how long it would take to finish it all. I started because I couldn't find a single good metamorph story, sorry.

*** Alright, so I finally forced my way through this story.

Well, to start off with, the author has some great ideas. A lot of the reinterpretations of the HP universe do a good job of making it feel like a fundamentally different place; house-elves disbelieve the outside world could possibly be larger than the Hogwarts library and whatnot. Harry doesn't sound like a child at all and really feels a lot like a logic-bot, but I'm pretty sure that's intentional on the part of the author. I mean, his reaction when finding out Filch's cat is dead is to tell him in front of an office full of professors that he could always just get a new one, then become confused that everyone becomes shocked and deeply offended by him.

I also like some of the other characters more than the versions in canon; Snape's dictionary detention (have two students both copy pages from the same dictionary, they have to start copying again if they finish the page before the other, they get punished if he catches them speeding up or slowing down to match each other) perfectly exemplifies the sort of petty, understated cruelty you'd expect from him. Harry's simmering immature resentment of Hermione for taking the spotlight from him plays well with his changed characterization here, and Ron being a bit of a nerd with his fascination with chess works out surprisingly well too.

But at the same time, so many scenes just fall apart, especially when the author turns characters that aren't Harry into logic-bots. Is Snape really going to, and I make no embellishment here, go on a three-page philosophical monologue at Harry and Hermione about the Liar's Paradox without provocation? It sorta reminds me of Bioshock Infinite in that way; it's a smart story, but not as smart as it thinks itself to be, and it's made a worse story by the fact that the author keeps trying to point out how smart the smart thing they just wrote is. I legitimately wondered at several points in the story if this was Yudkowsky posting under a pseudonym like Perfect Lionheart did; the story definitely has more than a few similarities in motifs with HPMOR, and I'm pretty sure a line about "how the human brain evaluates small but non-trivial chances of disaster" is a direct quote from his writings.

Besides these and other invasively changed characterizations that make everyone sound the same at somepoint or another, the author has a real problem with Floating Heads Syndrome. You don't really get any detail on what anyone besides Harry is doing, or what they look like, or really any details in general, and I swear the author wants to make sweet sweet love to the words "he said". It also feels like as soon as the author comes up with the core of a cool new scene, they'll just vomit it onto the page immediately and damn the need for context and transition scenes. As a side note, though in comparison with the other flaws this is comparatively minor, the author throws new abilities at Harry like they're going out of style. Really, being able to change into magical animals and gain their abilities when even Animagi can't consistently do that is one thing, since thet's the whole idea behind the story. Spontaneously developing the ability to sense that Hermione is in the process of completing twenty of the thirty-something steps to the Patronus charm is quite another, especially when the ability to intuitively sense and understand when magic is being cast never gets brought up again.

In summary, there are individual excellent ideas in the story, but they're brought down by technical writing skill that never rises above workman-like at best, pointless training montages and excuses to become stronger in a setting that's ultimately not tooled to DBZ-style constant fighting, and an insistance on showing only impressive and impactful scenes while skipping all the "boring" transition scenes that make them fit in the story and give them meaning.
