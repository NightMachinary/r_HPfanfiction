** Wow, I don't think any of those are Snape/Hermione or I probably would have recognized them. I didn't realize it was that unliked as a pairing that it didn't even crack the top 100!

*** That's just this particular subreddit. Also, very few of those fics tend to focus on pairings. They're mostly action/adventure and comedies.

** I made this goole doc back in May and never got around to posting. It has the 10 most popular fics on [[/r/HPfanfiction]] based on how often they are linked. This includes links requested from ffnbot.

* EDIT: I've added an additional page with all the years combined and the top 100 fics

*** Nah. Just just link your own fics to every single request post, regardless of relevance. You'll break top 100 in no time.

**** Nuts to that, for the most part I refuse to link my own fics unless someone essentially describes them (if you see anyone ask for screwball comedies featuring the Weasley family and a ginger Harry let me know). I want other people to like it, not just me.

***** Don't worry. There are plenty of that love your writing. Not just you. Each update on Like a Red Headed Step Child brightens my day.

Also are you planning on continuing with Monster Hunters Extraordinaire or just focusing on Like a Red Headed Step Child for now?

****** I plan on continuing Monster Hunters after year four is finished. I'm trying really hard to wrap up red headed stepchild before the end of the year as well so that I can focus on other projects. Starting a bunch of stories at once was, in hindsight, not the best choice.

**** Well because it isn't really Harry Potter fanfiction. It's just fiction that uses a name "Harry Potter".

And yeah, it's not being recommended as much in the last couple years.

** Interesting. It's nice to see all of these in one place. I found four fics on the list that I haven't seen before and are relevant to my interests. I'll have to check them out.

(And of course, I'm flattered to have three fics on the list.)
