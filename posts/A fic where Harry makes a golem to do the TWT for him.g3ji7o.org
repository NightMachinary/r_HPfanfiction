Yeah, you could almost get burnt to death by a dragon, almost drown/die of hypothermia/get stabbed to death by grindelows, and unwillingly resurrect the most feared dark lord in recent history... or you could not do those things and just leave it up to a super intelligent AI that is 100x better than you at everything.

Bonus points if the fic isn't just “AI evil, humans good”

Not quite what you're looking for, but it sorta fits.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.

** Huh... I'm picturing him using a ritual to create the golem that essentially makes it a Horcrux, that way it still counts as “him” doing the task, with horrific consequences to Harry. Oooh maybe he Alphonse Elric's himself and his /whole/ soul goes into the golem!
