For those that need a reference its [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/64/][this one]]

Its been one of the few that has really caught my eye, but sadly not completed. Would like to find a story similar to this one, to hold me off while I wait for this one to be updated.

Edit: completed story recommendations would be best, but if the story is good, I'm willing to read some that are still being updated.


** Love the story. The author updates very slowly and havent update in the last month :(

**** An amazing story that never gets updated is The Prince that was Promised. HP / Game of Thrones. Very good read. Story is gritty and is one of my all time favorites. Just wish updates happen more than once a year...

Hogwarts Battle School is amazing too!

****** In this case you want to go with Hogwarts Battle School. That one is updated once a month I believe. The quality is very good and its quite long.

*** It's really frustrating as she used to update every week. She's been having some IRL issues from ANs.
