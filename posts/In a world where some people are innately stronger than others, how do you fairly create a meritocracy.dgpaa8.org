In the real world, not everyone can be Albert Einstein or Usain Bolt, both have a much higher ceiling at their respective craft than the average person. No matter how much work I put in, I can't run 100m in less than 9.6 seconds. In a world where some people are born with magic, some stronger than others, and some are born with none at all, how does one counter this. Crabbe clearly could never become a Dumbledore type figure no matter what he does, and with a whole world revolving around the magic system, he lacks the essential skills required for any job that requires a certain amount of magical talent. He could never become an auror, or a potions master. He can never gain an animagus form. He can never handle the magic required to be a dragon trainer. Even though magical talent isn't strictly passed down though blood, there is clearly a component baked into a wizard at birth. How can this be made more fair so there is social and technical mobility in society without either haemorrhaging talented wizards through some other form of oppression (I.e. blood supremacy) or severely limiting the society's productivity.

TL;DR How can a society ever be fair (as far as is possible for any society) when some wizards and witches are naturally stronger than others?


** I think you are confusing fairness and equality.

​

In a meritocracy, fairness is defined as everyone being treated (and rewarded) based solely on their merits and not other factors. Nothing about a meritocracy ensures that everyone has equal chances. In a meritocracy, a child with mental retardation who will never get beyond the mental abilities of a 10 year old will not achieve as much as those with all their mental facilities.

In fact, you could say a meritocracy explicitly rewards special skills, even those people acquire through unfair means (such as being born with it). The entire point is the reward because of the skill instead of say, who your family was.

​

Now if you want to talk about equality, that is a whole nother issue.

The same as in any meritocracy - you reward the strong, the talented, etc.

The whole idea of meritocracy is inequality - just inequality based on talent rather than e.g. class or inherited wealth.

** Same as in our world, the Crabbes are still bottom feeders. In fact, the guy who played Crabbe got arrested for his part in the London Riot of 2011 and is most likely a loser today, while Emma Watson has become filthy rich and is worshipped by millions.

The important thing is that everyone must have the same legal rights, at least in theory. Individual abilities and talents will show up in how much they get paid, or how much influence they wield in the society.

*** I would have used a different example to crabbe if I could because not only is he pathetic as a wizard, he's also pathetic as a human being but I guess from a narrative stand point it doesn't make sense for one of the good guys to be weak. The closet we really have is Neville I guess at the start but he just had a bad wand and didn't believe in himself enough or some crock. In the real world, there are millions of people who live pay check to pay check despite working 80 weeks and generally being good people because of different barriers to their economic mobility. Say we had a family like the weasleys, desperately poor, with no links to higher society, but none of the children have the talent shown by the weasleys. How would they escape the poverty line by legitimate means. Even if someone is intelligent, if they don't have the power for simple spells they simply can't perform any practical job more competently than someone with more firepower behind them

**** If they're magical, they move to the muggle world, where their magic gives them an edge that they would never have in a society where everyone has magic. This is what Merope Gaunt did. She had few magical skills and no education, but she could still get what she wanted with potions.

If they can perform minor magic, like Confundus or Divination, they can get away with a lot in a muggle job. They can run their own palm-reading/astrology business. Plenty of gullible muggles, especially business owners celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow, have psychic advisors and life counselors that feed them all sorts of nonsense.

The ethics is questionable, but as long as they don't let the muggles know that magic is real, there are ways to scrape a living with a few tricks.

Like [[/u/4ecks][u/4ecks]] said, they can make good money off Muggles. With liberal use of memory charms, why settle for a lowly palm reading job? How about 'convincing' the board of directors of a multi-billion dollar company to pay you millions in stock options for your 'valuable consulting work'?

Or use Reparo to fix up deeply distressed real estate and flip them at market prices.

Or use Gemino curse to duplicate expensive industrial metals and sell them for decent profit. According to the Books, gold and silver can not be duplicated. But what about titanium, palladium, neodymium, and those rare earth elements that cost a lot more than gold?

Some ask what to do with all this Muggle money. Well, for starters, you can buy physical gold and silver on commodities/futures exchanges. Goblins and Wizards both take real gold. Or you can buy Muggle real estate, slap an Anti-Muggle charm on it, and it becomes a magical property! Hey, even Dursley's home can be connected to the Floo network!

Some others say that this is all illegal. Well, Ministry only cares if you throw around flashy spells in the public. They don't care what magic you do behind closed doors, and they don't care about memory charms at all. You see Wizards obliviating those poor Muggles at will in Book 4. You see Ron boasting about confunding a Muggle driving instructor in the Epilogue. Harry Potter, then the head of Magical Britain's elite police, actually finds it funny. The Trio was hunted by both Ministry and Death Eaters during Year 7 and cast all kinds of magic in Muggle areas, they were never caught. The Ministry's ability to monitor magic use in Muggle areas seems to be quite limited.

The thing, if you are smart and have decent magic, you can make yourself living in paradise.

****** Nah, that just makes it easier - if you aren't morally bankrupt you can just open up a repair shop or somesuch, gather some money, buy real estate and repair/remodel it for hefty profits. All with one charm that someone who didn't even go to Hogwarts yet could perform (Hermione)

** Once they're out of school there are quite a lot of jobs/careers that do not require the average witch or wizard to do great feats of magic. Ministry workers, shop keepers, home makers (although we have seen that Molly Weasley is quite magically strong) would all use minimal magic or simple and repetitive daily charms and such. Those born into privileged position would use such charms even less if they have a house elf. I don't really think it would be too different to how muggles live - some people have special training, knowledge or skills which they use in elite professions but most don't and they seem to live happy and fulfilled lives.

** You encourage a mindset of hard-work and individuality. You don't need to be the next Dumbledore, you just need to find the one thing you are good at that positively contributes to society. Maybe Crabbe is an excellent dancer, or has a real passion for flower arrangement.

There is a couple videos on a similar topic, though in relation to My Hero Academia rather than Harry Potter, by Explanation Point.

** I think [[/u/Taure]] basically got at it in his post -- meritocracies are inherently inequitable. They do not care about equity. In the ideal meritocratic world, people are given power and success based off of their skill; in an ideally equitable world, people are given power and respected because they exist, because everyone is inherently valuable and not worth more or less than anyone else.

So, in some ways, I guess I don't really accept the premise of your question? If you want to make the magical world equitable, the way to do it is by making things like magical skill simply not matter. If you want to make it meritocratic, you make magical skill the /only/ thing that matters. If you're trying to find the right balance between productivity and equity, well that's an ongoing discussion in the real world, isn't it? And not one that has a clear and obvious answer, either.

** To put it in RPG terms.... Someone like Usain bolt was born with +15 to running while most people are born with a range from -5 to +10, and occasionally someone is born with or obtains a massive penalty, like -50, due to physical deficiency.

The problem is that the soft cap on the skill is +500.

Sure , without putting any work into it, bolt is faster than almost anyone else, but until you hit that cap of +500, hard work is going to trump natural affinity every time. Affinity only really matters at world class levels, and even massive natural disadvantage can be competitive with unmotivated lazy bum most of the time with the addition of hard work. It has to be pretty extreme for natural disadvantage to be an insurmountable barrier.

** Outlaw inbreeding...

Apart from that, a diverse education. Not just magic, also some math and social studies. That way even someone with zero magical talent can get a job doing paperwork at the government or for companies. Doesn't take much magic to run a shop selling floo power either, if you get it from a supplier in bulk. Or the magical equivalent of flipping burgers, although that kind of job would probably involve some spellwork. There's plenty of jobs available that don't require much magic.

** *mild self-promotion*

I included a dark version of this in my fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/1/Harry-Tano][Harry Tano]] where Voldie was offed and Lucius Malfoy became a scarily competent Big Bad. One of the "reforms" he oversaw made Blood-status legally important, but linked to education (get enough top-level marks and you'd be promoted from Muggleborn to Halfblood, Halfblood to Pureblood, Pureblood to High Pureblood etc) meaning that an intelligent-enough Muggleborn could conceivably end up socially and legally as a Pureblood and thus eligible to marry into the more traditional families/get a job that is traditionally restricted to Purebloods etc.

His explanation for why he supported this? Breeding Stock to help raise the IQ of the more traditional families.
