I like fan fiction where things happen in Harry's life that cause it to slightly split from canon like in terms of peoples behavior and who they're friends with. I particularly like ones where Harry doesn't trust Dumbldore and acts like a condescending asshole through the hole story. Also please put finished ones.


** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/6/They-Shook-Hands-PostCanon-Revision-Year-One][They Shook Hands]] series features Harry in Slytherin with all different friends all because of a chance meeting and friendly conversation in Diagon Alley. Harry's kind of an asshole toward certain characters... and muggles... and a /little/ toward muggleborns. I honestly can't remember his opinion of Dumbledore. Years 1-5 are completed (each is each own novel-length story) and year 6 is currently in the works.

The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall][Harry McGonagall]] series is AU starting from baby Harry NOT being left on the Dursely's doorstep and in that one Harry definitely hates Dumbledore. And Snape. I actually kind of quit that fic due to the intense amounts of Dumbledore and Snape bashing but maybe you'll like it!

*** I love Snape and Dumbledore bashing, it's my favorite because I personally hate them both. Thanks for the links.
