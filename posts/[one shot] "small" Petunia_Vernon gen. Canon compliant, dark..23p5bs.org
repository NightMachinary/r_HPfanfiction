** I don't think Vernon ever hit Harry in a frequent, casual manner, so I don't imagine he would hit Petunia. I think Harry is hit once in the head with a frying pan by Petunia and choked once by Vernon, but I think that's the extent of the physical abuse mentioned. The Dursley MO seemed to be more starvation, imprisonment, neglect, and looking the other way at Dudley's hitting Harry. This causes me to think that scene is a little uncharacteristic.

I'm not sure if it's necessary for Petunia to have two miscarriages-it seems a little contrived and lessens the impact. I think the story could be written with only one. When she has the second miscarriage, is she at her neighbors? That was a little unclear.

The stark writing makes this seem more like a script than a short story.

I think the explanation in this story provides a good explanation for why Petunia hates magic in addition to her jealousy-it couldn't help her in her time of need.
