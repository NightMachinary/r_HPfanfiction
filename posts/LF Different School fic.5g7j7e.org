There was this fic I read awhile ago but I can't remember the name. Harry gets injured badly at the dursleys but Dumbledore won't let him leave the dursleys and bill allows Snape and Remus to portkey him to his house in Egypt. He attends a different school and at the end he is dating this demon and dragon type person. I know it was a trio. K think harry was like a kitsune or kiatara. Does anyone know this fix?


** Arcane Academy. I can't remember who wrote it, though. It is on ffn.net, however. Also, it is not complete.
