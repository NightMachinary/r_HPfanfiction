I've seen a lot of incomplete ones, but are there any that the writer has actually finished or is updating regularly?

  Ginny Weasley is haunted by the past. Tom Riddle looks forward to the future. Such obsession always leaves traces. A two-shot Gin n'Tonic.

** Copy+Pasting a previous comment of mine...

linkffn(11983735) How do you solve a problem like Ginevra?

It can be a tad confusing at times due to how the author writes, but I really loved it. Very magical, very intense. Not time travel but still a good read.

linkffn(7190230) Prejudice and Pride is a time travel AU. Really liked it and best of all, it's long and complete (so rare for Gin and Tonics).

linkffn(8210840) Colouring Hearts is shorter but also complete, also a time travel AU and has a great plot. It's somewhat nonlinear and Tom is very in character.

linkao3(Inferno by 7serotonin) is a great one shot.

linkao3(Left Hook by elicitillicit) is a time travel WIP. Well written and captivating but the author hasn't updated in a while.

  Ginny never took Ancient Runes, but she grew up with magic seething in her sinew and coiling in her gut, and so laughter, hard and hysterical, bubbles up in her chest when she sees a precisely cut crescent moon sitting inside a pictogram of a sun.The sun marks the hours of the day, but the moon marks the passage of weeks. Months. Years. There's still shouting behind her.Ginny doesn't hesitate.

  Arrogance and bigotry can be well-founded, but perhaps that is when it is most important to fight through prejudices. Sometimes choices have to be made, even if they go against everything that you stand for. TomxGinny.

  She had been handed a power they hadn't understood, patted on the hand, and told to focus on him and him only.

  Stopping short of leaving the alleyway, Tom asks, "Have you ever had a Butterbeer?" She has. "No," she says instead. GWTR - a rather different time travel novella. Complete.
