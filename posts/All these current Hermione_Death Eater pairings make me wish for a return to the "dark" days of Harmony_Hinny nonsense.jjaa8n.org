Kind of self-explanatory really but still remembering that old era (and having seen some of them recently) I really do prefer it to the new insanity of the fandom. Yes the writing was typically sloppy, poor-quality self-insert wish fulfillment with enough sugar to kill a class of children but it was more bearable to now.

Instead the most popular pairings of recent times seem to be, in no particular order, Hermione/Draco, Hermione/Snape, and Hermione/Bellatrix, you know a trio of characters where Draco was a proud racist until his life was in danger and then became a coward, Snape was an incel obsessed over a dead woman who wouldn't sleep with him, and Bellatrix a straight up serial murderer and torturer.

Even if you tried ignoring canon for a hot second, the canon where she was a repeated victim of their machinations, and giving authors a chance to set the scene they never do, instead suddenly these three characters are simply "hot" and Hermione, a woman whose entire thing was resenting surface level interests, suddenly can't help but quiver over them and in most cases be a submissive to their dominance even though all three of those characters were depicted as subservient to other people.

If people want Hermione or another goodie to date a "reformed" character or the "bad" person there are plenty on offer already in the series. Pansy Parkinson for example is depicted in canon as a petty schoolgirl follower of the cool kids and never really rises above that level of childish nastiness and being scared to be left out or become the target herself. That is someone who can easily and realistically change and grow with only a few additions/changes being made, hence why she's one of my favourite characters to be depicted in fanfiction in terms of Harry/Pansy (funnily enough she is actively denied redemption by Rowling because of her own childhood hangups).

tl;dr I preferred annoyingly obsessive yet innocent "One True Pairing" over this strange, and frequently tinged with racist/misogyny imagery, "Why Women Will Place Themselves Under Men" bent the fandom seems to have taken...


** All this current gatekeeping in the fandom makes me wish for a return to the "dark" days when fanfiction was just a light relaxing activity. It's fanfiction, not mandatory school reading.

** Stories that people are interested in reading will get written because people write what they like to read, typically. More people in the community enjoy reading dark fics than regular fics now (to my knowledge), so you see that reflected in the majority of newer stories. I don't think it's particularly bad. Hardly anyone writes new stories with those old pairings cause they've been done to death and the newer portion of the community just isn't interested

They go full "sex pants Draco" or "Snape sexy because Rickman", chuck in "BDSM" as a tag on AO3, and just ignore every aspect of canon that makes these characters awful to instead just pretend they never did anything bad.

People write fanfiction precisely because they're upset over the events in canon, the lack of character development, or because they have their own interesting story ideas.

Maybe it's normalised for that writer or maybe they're just trying to write smut for their two fav characters. BDSM is a complex thing. I think defending people (id est characters) that don't need defending is just pulling pigtails. These are characters being written down for people's enjoyment. Even irl, people in the BDSM or raceplay scene still choose to participate willingly, no matter how much it makes PC people want to tear their hair out.

As for being drawn out, I more perceive it as all those foreshadows that was dropped during The World's a Stage finally playing out. The author has hinted at a greater storyline spanning several installments.

The Harem-dynamic was also foreshadowed, first I believe in the after-raid healing session, when Harry is cautioned to how his power may attract followers. I believe that it's not long after that Daphne and Pansy debates the eventual Coven.

But sure, if those are elements that a reader doesn't appreciate, then I can see where the fic would be unsatisfying. But I believe that the reader had a long time to prepare for this.

But still, the scenes where we see the triad act against eachother us still gold to me, even if most hurdles seem to be in the past at the moment.

  The wedding was lovely. Really. It was. Harry isn't even jealous that Ginny is marrying Draco, more frustrated that he's wound up at yet another wedding without a date.Pansy, still somewhat of an outcast after the war, has been left behind by her own date/flatmate after Blaise spotted a boy he was interested in.Daphne, having lost her standing in Pureblood circles thanks to a failed teenage romance, has shown up mostly for her own amusement. When these three "leftovers" find themselves without any other prospects at the end of the night, bemoaning their singledom at an afterparty at Daphne's flat makes sense, right? After all, they can't stay on their best behaviour forever.

** I‘ve been reading Snape/Hermione exclusively for more than 10 years now. Fight me.

There are a lot of fics featuring that pairing that are not about dominance and racism. I also wouldn‘t necessarily say that Snape is a Death Eater, as I believe that he had truly changed, but that‘s just my opinion. The thing I like most about the pairing is the various interpretations of their relationship paired with all the external conflicts that can arise, every fic has its own dynamic and if you filter them accordingly to your tastes, you will also never read anthing non consensual or overly dark. Fics are well tagged most of the time.

**** It was not my intention to justify myself :) It‘s just funny that people get so upset over a habit I picked up as an 11 year old.

But then again, might have been a weird 11 year old, the Snapecast introduced me to fanfiction. At the time my English was not good and I didn‘t bother looking up what the „explicit“ tag meant and just assumed it was a sign of good content. I was also very confused about the meaning of citrus fruit in fan culture, but I found out quick enough.

sry for super late comment (indulging again in HP fanfiction after several years out of it) was searching reddit for fic recommendations & stumbled across this thread

SSHG was one of my first 'HP pairings' i really enjoyed in the early 2000's & i always felt super weird about it, so your comment makes me feel less alone 🤣

Always enjoy meeting fellow shippers, thank you!

o and one more! again, it appears to be a standard as I've seen it recommended all over tumblr, but commenting anyway:

****** Hi, it‘s me again 😊 I just finished your first recommendation and I enjoyed it greatly. I really liked the emotional subtlety. Many fics just plainly describe emotional states plainly, while this one is more vague and open for interpretation. I really need to figure out how to effectively search stories on AO3, I might be missing out on some gems right now. And yes, Second Life is an absolute classic 😊 Maybe I should reread that one some time soon, it‘s been a while.

I hope you are doing well and thanks again for sharing 😊

Also I might have looked at your post history and have definitely joined the Snape subreddit right now. Ever since the Snapecast stopped putting out new episodes I felt very lonely in the fandom, this might be a place that shares my appreciation and passion for once.

******* o hey there! isn't it a beautiful fic?! im so glad you enjoyed it. [[https://reddit.com/r/SeverusSnape/comments/lrhbwo/doesnt_anyone_touch_you/][i actually ended up drawing a silly sketch of one of the lines lol]]

yasss it can be difficult to search on Ao3 sometimes. I find that searching and filtering by kudos/comments nets higher quality fics, but definitely miss out on hidden gems that way

here's some fic recs from tumblr that i saved as well! (the blog post isn't mine, just a post i saved lol)

******** I saw that sketch 😅 It‘s certainly a talent to both accurately preserve the hurt and vulnerability while turning it into a meme 😂

Definitely checking out that post, I‘m in the mood for more right now 👀 Also would you mind if I dm‘ed you? Exchanging fic recs would be lovely, and while I do still read regularily, I am well past the obsessive days of my youth lol. So you wouldn‘t be bombarded.

********* absolutely sure!! i think i sent a dm your way (but am pretty bad at technology so it may not have sent)

also dunno if you like Naruto but i have some KakaSaku recs as well (i like that ship because it reminds me of sshg but set in a different universe/slightly less antagonistic starting point🤣)

this oneshot in particular is really wonderful, I've read it several times. tbh, it's probably one of the best I've ever read. (it's an AU so you don't even need to be into the show:)
