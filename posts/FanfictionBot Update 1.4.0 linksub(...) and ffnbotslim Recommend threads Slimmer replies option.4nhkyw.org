So today I'm fulfilling two requests that came to mind when I saw [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4nb2fk/highest_quality_fic_youve_read/][this thread]], which felt like it was almost the exact same as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4km10c/highestquality_fics_youve_ever_read/][another thread]] that was only a few days older.

The requests were to *(a) give people the ability to recommend older threads* - useful for "repeat LF/request" threads like those referenced above; and *(b) allow for bot comments that take up less space* (goes hand-in-hand with (a) when the bot is recommending fics from an entire thread).

--------------

** Quick Overview
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: quick-overview
   :END:

- =linksub(link_to_thread)= or =linksub(thread_id)= will cause the bot to parse all previous bot comments in the old thread, and reply with a slimmer version of them (/implies ffnbot!slim/)

- Adding =ffnbot!slim= to your comment with bot requests will cause the bot to return a much slimmer comment, carrying only the name, author, description, and download links for each fic.

--------------

*Additional Notes*

- The thread ID is the six-character key from a thread URL: in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4j5i3f/request_any_good_stories_where_harry_dumbledore/]], the thread ID would be =4j5i3f=.

- Combine this with the private message feature and Reddit's new email feature to get multiple threads and download links packaged nicely and sent to your email!

- Rarely, ffnbot!slim may be buggy or incorrectly formatted. It basically reverse-engineers old bot comments to avoid overloading fanfiction websites, but this can sometimes fail.

- linksub will work across all subreddits the bot runs on, which currently consists of [[/r/HPFanfiction]], [[/r/WormFanfic]], [[/r/NarutoFanfiction]], [[/r/Fanfiction]], [[/r/fandomnatural]], and [[/r/marvelfans]].

- You can recommend multiple submissions with linksub, separating with semicolons - just like normal bot requests.

- I've tried to make sure there'll be no duplicates when linking multiple threads, but I haven't really tested that yet.

--------------

*** An example: linksub([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4j5i3f/request_any_good_stories_where_harry_dumbledore/][some random dumbledore thread]])
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: an-example-linksubsome-random-dumbledore-thread
    :END:
(I've removed one of the replies so as to not clutter this thread. The bot will recommend all the fics in a thread. You can see the greatly improved information density for yourself!)
