Does anyone know how to get ahold of the audiobook for G Norman Lippert's James Potter and the Crimson Thread? Living Audio published the first 4 books in their podcast feed but never released the 5th one despite a blog post in May 2018 saying it was fully recorded and getting ready for release. I've sent their site moderators a query about it but the site overall looks dead so I'm not sure I'm super hopeful. Any ideas?


** Theres only 4 books in that series. The author wrote three then I guess just sort of wanted to stop writing it and then skipped ahead to the last book and wrote that.

*** I'm sorry but that's incorrect. He may have gotten tired and skipped ahead but it was after the 4th book, concluding with the 5th book. [[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/]]

** If you find anything out please let me know. Living Audio posted that recording was done November of last year on their Twitter, but hasn't posted anything since, their website looks like it hasnt been updated in a year either. I'm tempted to send a message to the author on Facebook. I just eant someone to tell me that it deffiinetly is or isn't coming out on audio.

*** Someone else posted this link to their Facebook. [[https://www.facebook.com/pg/livingaudio247/posts/]] sounds like they had some personal life delays but still plan to release so fingers crossed!
