I'm looking for any fics where Harry builds a new magical world separate from muggles. I've read again and again by athey and Fes2 by shivani. Also one where they build on the moon and an avatar crossover where they go to that dimension. Any one know of anything similar? Thanks!

  A different spin on the Potter Verse featuring a manipulative Dumbledore and an evil worse than Voldemort. A look at what could drive three people to destroy the Wizarding World.

** linkffn(for love of magic) by NoodleHammer. Somewhere in the middle of the story Harry creates SpellHaven as a independant magical society.

I'm going to warn you beforehand, NoodleHammer isn't well liked on this sub and for a good reason. The end of the story does feature NoodleHammer projecting his Islamophobia and racism though. The overall story, however, features solid world building, realistic character development and consistent character personalities.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Spoilers * in the end of The Other Kryptonian, I believe that's exactly what happens. They build a wizard world in an earth sized moon, where everyone gets a super power - up.
