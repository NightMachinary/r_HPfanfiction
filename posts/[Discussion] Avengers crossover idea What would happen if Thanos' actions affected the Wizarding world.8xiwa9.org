In light of what is happening over at [[/r/thanosdidnothingwrong]] right now, I find the question in the title of this thread occurring to me. How would the wizards handle it? Would they risk exposing their world in order to help defeat Thanos and restore the world to the way it was- or at least, as best as possible? What would happen if key figures in the plot fell victim? How would they move on after that? Would certain magic be able to give them immunity?

I would love to see a story that explores all of this.


** Thanos sees Voldemort get oneshotted by Harry in the Great Hall, gets pissed of with how the incredibly powerful dark lord got defeated like a bitch, grabs his gauntlet and says,

"If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself."

What a great post-DH story that would make. Harry learns magic from Dr. Strange.

** I saw a one-shot with Thanos where Strange sacrifices himself to summon MoD!Harry to kill Thanos. It was pretty decent.'

If Thanos has the Gauntlet, nothing less than the combined efforts of a few Dumbledore-level wizards is going to stop him. As for the Black Order, a decently trained wizard wouldn't have much trouble to be honest.

** I hate crossovers that go "lol, these two completely separate worlds were in the same universe the entire time" and expect us to make sense of that.

Wizards keeping secrets make no sense in the same world where Thor and Loki are openly gallivanting around with the Hulk.

Plus wizards like Dr Strange also exist in this universe and even have an entire base of operations in London. Does Strange not know that Diagon Alley exists? Doesn't the ministry not ever visit the Sanctum?

In order for this story to make sense there would need to be an in-universe crossing of dimensions. Like openly saying "this is another dimension where magic manifested itself differently"...

But to answer your question: Wizards would be one-shotted by Thanos. Not even Dumbledore and Voldemort teaming up would so much as slow him down.

We know Strange and co. are in fact hidden from the world as well. There's not really much issue here, it just depends on where you time things. Like pre-invasion of New York, no one would have any inkling of magic so the issue is nonexistent.

Also, why wouldn't Thanos be slowed down (if not defeated)? Strange alone clearly held him up with a few tricky (but powerful) spells. Granted, having a few Infinity Stones makes it trickier, but definitely not anything like impossible (Avada Kedvra kills just the same).

If Harry Potter magic was an actual existing thing in the MCU then Thanos would have at the very least known about it. The statute of secrecy is only a human thing after all, the other planets are far more open about the existence of magic.

If Thanos knows about it, he can counter it or even do it himself. He would at the very least recognise what a curse is and know to dodge it, which he can easily do given his monstrous speed and power.

******* Not exactly. In canon, we have one description of the effects of the Killing Curse from someone's perspective. Voldemort says the spell ripped him (that is, his soul) from his body. That's why there's no physical damage from the curse. That's why I said the Soul Stone could defensibly be assumed to block it. Of course he could dodge it, I'm just saying that it would kill him if it hits because, as JKR has said, magic trumps the mundane.

Well, Thanos /did/ already know about magic. He refers to Strange as a wizard in their fight and didn't seem too surprised. That aside, as far as I know, Magic isn't widely known by other races. Aside from the Asgardians, we only ever see one single other alien use magic; it was a one-off shown in the second Guardians of the Galaxy film.

It's effective on any living thing that isn't immortal (or specifically, phoenixes can sort of cheat the curse), it has worked on animals, humans, goblins and is said to be completely unblockable (with one exception). It has nothing to do with humans. Under any sensible definition, Thanos /is/ mundane, meaning he can't do magic, and even those with magic are killed by the curse. If the crossover retains the facts of how HP magic works, AK will kill Thanos unless he has the Infinity Gauntlet.

********** Look, let me give you an example on why that logic doesn't work.

#+begin_quote
  In cowboy movies guns are effective at killing anything. If someone is hit with a gun, they die. It works on humans, it works on animals. it's too fast to be dodged and no amount of armour can stop it. Therefore, according to cowboy movie logic guns are perfect killing weapons.

  Therefore I conclude that guns from cowboy movies can easily kill Thanos.
#+end_quote

You see why this doesn't work?

It's the same with the AK. An AK can generate a certain amount of "death magic" which can kill most things on Earth. However there is nothing that says a Titan or an Asgardian can't be immune to it, or isn't strong enough to overpower the "weak death magic of a human cast AK".

Look, every franchise has something that *BY THE LOGIC OF THAT FRANCHISE* is undefeatable unless some specific counter is used. When doing a crossover you need to let go of that logic and generalise certain concepts, otherwise the lone ranger with his "perfect gun that kills everything he shoots at" is the most dangerous thing in the universe.

My reasoning

1. The MCU has magic, see Dr. Strange.

2. Thanos can overpower said magic with tricks of his own (that may or may not be amplified by the infinity gauntlet), see Infinity War wen Thanos overpowered Strange's magic.

3. Harry Potter magic is also magic.

4. Therefore Thanos can overpower it as well.

No, because that is a complete non sequitur. "Guns are effective" is not equivalent to the nigh perfect record of AK killing any living thing. Simple logic:

AK kills any mortal living being.

Thanos is a mortal living being.

Therefore, AK will kill Thanos.

Thanos never overpowered a magical move which by nature kills. Your comparisons are based on simply effective methods (as opposed to virtually perfect ones), so the reasoning doesn't follow. AK is not simply lethal, if it hits it kills. Without the Infinity Gauntlet he would have to dodge it to stay alive.

** When I saw the movie, I had the same question. Here is the plot bunny I came up with. If anyone is interested in picking it up, go right ahead, just give me credit.

This would work great as a post-canon fic; perhaps even a post-epilogue fic if you wanted to. I would have the fic start place after Harry's children are born and some/all are attending Hogwarts.

What if it was not Captain Marvel that helps save the day after the Infinity War, but Auror Potter?

Chapter One

All was well.

It starts off at the last day of term, Harry Potter excited to see his children again. With a kiss to his wife Ginny, he heads into work and runs into Hermione.

They have a conversation about what has been happening at the Agents of Shield, where Hermione is a spy. She is in the office to return some information about the Civil War between the Avengers. At this point, you would only be getting a taste of how the Wizarding World has changed. Hermione loves what she is doing, but admits that much of the technology is above her. She does not feel as if she fits in. Worse of all, are the accords, which: "It reminds me of the mudblood records in the war'

Their emergency notice goes off, leaving them a minute before they are whisked away.

“I hate these things.” grumbled Harry.

“I can't imagine why...” She smiles.

“That blasted thing went off in the middle of the night. One moment I was asleep, the next I was standing in the middle of the meeting. I was bloody starkers, Hermione, starkers!”

Once in the meeting, they get told unknown alien vessels are approaching earth, with one landing in New York.

The US Aurors' have been standing guard and watching the Avengers do their thing and reporting to the International Council. At one point they make a comment about Dr. Strange and him being a 'magician' and laugh. The few that know about this branch of magic laugh, as it is old, outdated and practically worthless compared to theirs.

Harry has always been a supporter of getting involved. He dislikes the current wizarding world position of avoidance. Many of the plots the avengers have faced would have hurt the wizarding world as well. Instead, they work with the limitations they have, and make sure those who are protecting the world are guided in a way they will never learn about. Part of this is Harry's job when they are in England.

You learn that at one point the Wizarding World almost went public when a branch of magical creatures and half-breeds announced themselves to the world. It was a turbulent time in the world, but the protests ended up rapidly dying when the Accords were established. For those who believed in a complete separation, this was god send. It showed the wizarding world they would not be safe if they went public, but slaved to the countries governments their land was under.

After two days of absolutely nothing (but sitting around and barely seeing their families), they get a call that some random things are happening in Wakanda. They all grimace. Wakanda is the only nation in the world that does not have a wizarding population. What makes vibranium powerful is it can and has absorbed magic. A small piece can be extremely powerful for wizards, but large concentrations of it are dangerous. If left in an area with lots of vibranium, a wizard would slowly lose their powers and go insane. Any human that may have been born with magic, would be pure muggle by the time they reach 11. The Vibranium would suck all the magic from the person. The whole area of Wakanda is a no-go zone for the wizarding world. Thus, when the attack begins, little is known to what is happening, and there is very little the wizarding world can do.

Thus, Kingsley let's Harry go to the Burrow. It is the annual family dinner where everyone comes and catches up now that all the kids are back from Hogwarts. Kingsley knows that Harry should not miss this, and it is not like anything big is going to happen tonight that they will need him. Plus, if for a crazy reason they do, he is only a flick of a wand away,

At the Burrow, it is great. Lily is talking about her first year, the food is delicious and everyone is having a good time. Even Charlie came by this year. All is well.

As Ginny comes in from the kitchen, helping her mom bring out desert, she mutters that she feels weird. She shakes it off. As she goes to place the cake, it drops and shatters. Her arm is disintegrating in front of them. She screams, and Harry rushes to her aid, just to hear Molly gasp. Both of them disintegrate.

Hermione, Lily, James, Charlie, Bill, Arthur and George all turn to ash. The few that remain are crying, screaming and trying to figure out what happens.

Harry disappears, goes back to the ministry which is in absolute chaos. The MoM tells him there was a major surge of magic in Wakanda and then people started to vanish. They go to the DoM and demand answers. They are told about what seems to be the infinity stones, a myth that turns out to be true.

In rage, Harry and (whomever you want, Ron perhaps) demand to go find their wives and children's killers. They are going to find a way to get them back.

End Chapter One

In the following chapters, in addition to the story moving forward, you could see how the Wizarding World changed and viewed the actions of the years before. Such as:

- Men flying in metal suits

- A man coming back to life after being frozen (with the help of magic of course).

- Aliens

- A branch of magical creatures that dubbed themselves the Inhumans going public. Now that had been a nightmare.

- Then came The Wizard. When the International Councils of Wizards told them about a secret elite group of wizards that protected them from ‘mental and physical threats' and after a large attack, 'only two remained' Harry wanted to slam his head on the table.

- The almost civil war within the wizarding world, and more.

From here you can take this plot in any direction. You can bring HP son or daughter with him to fight, or Teddy. Perhaps its Ron and Harry against the universe. You can do crazy time-travel shenanigans and more. Either way, I suggest having the story begin after the events of the movie, instead of HP saving the day in the middle.

The comparison to programming was to give an analogy. I think you're also discounting the change in themeing in the Marvel films. They tried to make it that the Asgardians weren't deities (even going so far as to have Odin say they aren't gods), but that definitively changed in the Phase 3 movies, where Thor repeatedly says he is a god and accepts being referred to as anything less. Magic wasn't originally going to be in the MCU, but it was confirmed that they changed that so Doctor Strange and co. are using magic.

  GamesRadar asked this very question of Doctor Strange director Scott Derrickson (Sinister) at Comic-Con, in an interview that was only recently posted. For fans of the weird and wild nature of comics, his answer was quite heartening:

  "Magic is magic in this movie. It's not something that's explained away scientifically. It's not something that's easy to define. As magic should be. Magic should be mysterious. There's mystery to magic and there's mystery to the tone of the movie. Mystery is a good thing."

****** It's described as "channelling dimensional energy", at least for the strongest spells. Otherwise they're drawing on some power within themselves, which seems to be how it's described in HP (Ollivander says wizards channel their magic into mediums like wands). But it's definitely not science, depending on how we define that word. I mean, magic in HP appears to be pretty systematized so I don't know.

Otherwise, I recall it being said that originally they weren't going to have magic in the MCU but they changed that when they made the Doctor Strange film.

****** Found the answer. Seems pretty definitive:

#+begin_quote
  GamesRadar asked this very question of Doctor Strange director Scott Derrickson (Sinister) at Comic-Con, in an interview that was only recently posted. For fans of the weird and wild nature of comics, his answer was quite heartening:

  "Magic is magic in this movie. It's not something that's explained away scientifically. It's not something that's easy to define. As magic should be. Magic should be mysterious. There's mystery to magic and there's mystery to the tone of the movie. Mystery is a good thing."

**** It can be blocked by a Gravestone in canon, so Adamantium, whatever Thanos armour is made of, Thor's magic metal or whatever it was called woud, Vibranium etc would all be dense enough to block it and avoid killing the one hit. Everyone else would die.

Because it is a gravestone. Canon somewhat supports my theory on it, as Animagi can turn into animals and back without having to put clothes on or off. So it is possible for magic to consider your clothing as a part of you. And, again, given that wizards don't wear armor in battles, it's possible, if not likely, that the Killing Curse considers armor a part of you.

Remember, magic > mundane. While vibranium and adamantium are incredibly strong, there's no reason "/Reducto/" wouldn't be able to deal with it. Or a simple Transfiguration of the armor. Or a Vanishing spell. I doubt even Thor's armor would withstand a Killing Curse.

****** Reducto... not so much. It's never shown the feats of being capable of taking out things like Vibranium or Adamantium, the latter of which can and has hurt 616 IG Thanos, who sees Silver Surfer as a nuisance.

Transfiguration... don't you have to roughly understand what you're transfiguring? that, and they never just transfigured someone else's bodyparts. Human transfiguration on yourself, sure, but actively, in combat, turning someone's arm into a snake and having it bite them... Damn i want to see that in a fic now.

Vanishing... entirely possible. But the sheer density, especially of Iron Man's armour, unless you hit him exactly in the bit in his chest, Avada wouldn't touch him, and i assume, given any slight warning, Strange could dissect Wizard spells and protect against them. Tony would see one of the weak characters like Widow die, and then immediately see "DON'T LET THE LIGHTS TOUCH YOU TAKE THEM DOWN HARD AND FAST" and Wizards well... can't react to people of Supersonic speed or higher, there's no real Body enhancement spells. Kiritsugu Emiya could solo the verse. Wizards actually making any sizable contribution vs either side, Thanos or Avengers, would require ambushses and surprise hits. Can guarantee if Cap still had his shield, he could casually nosell anything short of Fiendfyre.

The purpose of the spell is to turn objects into pieces. There's honestly no reason it wouldn't work on those. Again, magic > mundane. Magic doesn't need to work in the same way our world works. You can argue that the Reductor Curse would work on those elements in the same way you could argue that the Shield Charm could protect you from a bullet. Magic in HP can be conceptual, so I don't see why the Reductor Curse can't simply be "Smash!" regardless of what the element is.

#+begin_quote
  Transfiguration... don't you have to roughly understand what you're transfiguring?
#+end_quote

I highly doubt they're learning advanced anatomy in Transfiguration. If they can Transfigure animals, a metal really shouldn't provide a problem. If 11-13 year olds can Transfigure things into animals, that's probably because you don't necessarily need an understanding of what you're Transfiguring. And animals are much more complex than metals.

#+begin_quote
  Avada wouldn't touch him
#+end_quote

Again, why not? Magic already considers clothing as a part of you, why wouldn't it with his armor? Why wouldn't a Reductor Curse turn his Arc Reactor into dust? Couldn't a bunch of random powerful spells just make his technology not work anymore?

This isn't about if a wizard can take out all the Avengers at the same time. But rather if a Killing Curse can't kill any of them.

Expelliarmus. No more shield. Reductor. No more shield. Vanishing. No more shield. Killing Curse would either just kill him or shatter the shield and his arm in the process. Again, magic > mundane. This is something JK Rowling has said.

******** You overestimate the shit out of Reducto. It's not a "Be all end all" Destruction Spell, It failed to destroy Hagrid's weird Skrewts, and there's a lot of Headcanon in here. I'd rather go for "Armour blocks the Avada, slows you down so much... FIENDFYRE MWAHAHAHA" so that's why we don't see Wizards in Plate. Plus, they're traditional idiots.

Magic > Mundane wouldn't apply when the Mundane can be seen as Magic to Mundanes who don't know; If A Gravestone can block an Avada, a crappy stone statue can when Dumbledore flicks his wand and summons it in the way, then Cap's shield which has blocked FAR Stronger things could block it. You'd assume the Expelliarmus would actually have to hit CAP for him to drop the shield, not hit the shield. Vanishing? Maybe?

Avada can't be blocked by HPverse Magic. Far more in depth Magic could easily. There's no possible way Al Azif/Demonbane couldn't block it (Extreme example to prove a point)

You mean like Harry using the Reductor Curse on a Skrewt? :P

There's nothing in canon to suggest Reducto can't destroy powerful metals. And given what we know of other spells, it's not unreasonable to come to the conclusion that it'd be able to destroy the strongest ones, especially if you're a powerful wizard. /Again,/ magic > mundane. If anything, there's more evidence to suggest it /can/ destroy those metals than evidence to suggest they can not.

/"I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override ‘mundane' nature, but not ‘magical' nature."/

These are JK Rowling's own words.

That doesn't make any sense. Why would the Killing Curse slow you down? And why would a wizard just summon Fiendfyre so casually? Fiendfyre is more likely to kill you any everyone around you than it is to only kill your opponent.

This is used quite often as an excuse to explain away the gaps JK Rowling left in. Just because something wasn't explained doesn't mean that there isn't a logical reason in there somewhere. It's not a valid argument in this scenario. We have logical conclusions we can come to in this conversation.

#+begin_quote

This doesn't even make sense. The mundane that appears as magic /isn't magic./ It doesn't matter how it appears to muggles. What matters if it's magic or not. It absolutely 100% applies here.

#+begin_quote
  Cap's shield which has blocked FAR Stronger things could block it
#+end_quote

Yet again you seem to miss the fact that magic can consider what you wield or wear as a part of you, /and/ that magic > mundane. I'm not sure how many times I have to repeat it. There is more to support that it would still kill/disarm than there is to support it wouldn't.

#+begin_quote

Cap's shield hardly ever fails. I'm fairly certain he would try blocking the spell with his shield.

This is so nonsensical that I almost didn't even bother responding to it. There is literally no way we can know this, and no reason you should confidently say that. This kind of thinking can let us just dismiss pretty much every universe's magic when it comes to crossovers. If the Killing Curse is unblockable in a world where magic is so powerful that you can curse /abstract ideas,/ it's downright silly to dismiss the curse's lethality in other universes.

********** I didn't mean the Killing Curse slows you down, i meant "I'm wearing fucking heavy thick armour, i can barely move or dodge other spells, but the Avada won't touch me"

Going off pure Logic and Density, It'd take at the very least top tier Magic to get past Fictional Metals, and to vanish or transfigure them, an understanding. If Voldemort used Legilliimens on a Wakandan and knew everything about Vibranium, I'd agree, they'd be fucked. If a Gravestone can block a spell, then a MUCH denser metal could casually Nosell it.

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic was the logic i was going by. There could be some crazy science logic "Wizards manipulate Zero Point energy (a Stargate fic) or something that allows Magic to work.

What you wear = Part of you removes two of your arguments. Why would you try Vanishing or Transfiguring part of someone in combat when you'd rather just ping destructive spells at them (How literally everyone that isn't McGonagall has been seen fighting)

How the fuck would a Shield be considered part of the human body. "Oh i Avada'd your shield. Loludied" makes literally 0 sense in terms of spells hitting you. Why would me holding a Kite shield and deflecting a spell (assume at least as thick as a Gravestone. It's my Benchmark for the Avada as that's the thinnest thing that's blocked it successfully) count as the spell hitting me. That makes no fucking sense at all.

Harry Potter Magic is a LOT lower on the food chain feat wise than Demonbane (my EXTREME example) where instead of cursing words so you know when people say it, You actively fight Eldritch Entities that store thousands of Universes in Jars. Heck... I'd argue that Itachi Uchiha (Yata No Kagami) or Obito and Kakashi (all 3 from Naruto. Obito and Kakashi using Kamui) could stop the Avada. Feats + Scale + Higher Concept beats "Unblockable" spell that gets blocked by literally stone.

As I've /repeatedly/ said, it can be considered a part of you.

***** No they wouldn't. Dumbledore is literally the only person (besides Lily) to block the Killing Curse. According to Crouch Jr., it's supposed to be unblockable besides the sacrificial protection. Adamantium, Vibranium, Uru (etc.) would do nothing to stop the curse.
