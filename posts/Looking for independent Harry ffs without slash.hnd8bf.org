Does anybody know some Dubledore /Weasley Bashing Storys or independent Harry storrys without slash? Thx


** The Don't Fear The Reaper and Champions of Lilith Challenges are pretty good for these. Same with Robst, if you're into that. I'd be linking all day if I put them all here, but either search in this sub (reddit has an inbuilt option and you can limit it to this sub, if you weren't aware) or on google generally, you'll find 'em all pretty easily. Enjoy.

Particular favourites of mine for each category are He's Not Dead Yet by Redbayly for the Reaper Challenge, Fairy Heroes by Paladeus for Champions of Lilith Challenge, and No Hurry at All for Robst [Links below].

** You want bashing? Try Say A Prayer. linkao3(4629198)

Really fun ride, tbh. Starts off cracky, but eventually get's a more... well, it's not a serious tone, but it chills out a bit lol.
