** Separated. I find shared ones are almost always clumsy. That being said, when I look at my tastes i see that what appeals to me is the magic of the Harry Potter world and its possibilities. I actually dislike several of the main characters, or at least their regular fanon interpretation. Having a separate universe means that there should be less characters crossing over. Post-battle of Hogwarts Harry can be almost anything. He's onto the next step of his life having finally stepped out of Voldemort's shadow and he's free to think about the future. It would be understandable for him to grow and change a lot which makes him incredibly flexible as a character. What I want to see is the magic of Harry Potter world put into somewhere else. Often Harry Potter magic would curb-stomp other universes, but that doesn't mean the conflict has to be Harry vs new universe. Wizards in Harry Potter can shape reality at a whim but are, for the most part, content to live out their lives as normal people. I don't see why Harry would be any different. What would it take for him to take on the mantle of hero again?

** Honestly it depends on the universe in question. Some are similar enough to the Potterverse that making them separate universes is counterproductive. Some are so different that making them a shared universe would be more immersion breaking than 'somehow this character moved universes'.

If you are trying to make me believe that things like LOTR, ASOIAF or The Witcher somehow take place in the Potterverse's past or future or whatever then that's probably going to occupy more of my attention than your plot.

On the other I have the vague premise of a Tomb Raider/Harry Potter crossover where making them separate universes would be silly.

*** Rule of thumb: If the crossover world is recognizably "Our Earth +", it can work for a Shared Universe. If not, best to go with seperate universes (unless it could feasably take place in our universe, in which case would only require interplanetary travel)

** I don't really have a preference either way. Like, I don't mind if an HP/ME fic just is simply just HP in the future. I firmly believe that a fusion is possible with most works, despite how contrasting the mechanics might be. That being said, I don't mind if it's just a new dimension either. However, for whatever reason, I don't like when it's the secondary story that comes to the first world. Like, the idea of Daenerys Targaryen coming to Hogwarts just doesn't appeal to me at all.

When its a shared universe it starts to become very hard to account for all the inconsistencies, and the extra baggage the second universe brings can kind of end up turning the story into something of a clusterfuck.

Besides, how the hell can you explain something like the Elemental Nations being part of our Earth all this time? How does nobody know about an island full of god like warriors who house demons inside their bodies and can manipulate creation itself? And no, "it's hidden by magic!" is not an acceptable answer.

** I honestly like both. Of course, it's nearly impossible to pull a shared universe off successfully with most other fantasies, but there's no need for dimension travel when the other franchise is "all-muggle", and /some/ magics (Roald Dahl, /Beknobs and Broomsticks/, even some /Star Wars/) can actually fit pretty well if you blur the details on either side.

** Seperate, the whole dimension traveling aspect seems fun, and its a good way to balance out Harry. (What can he/does he bring, etc.) And i always have this notion of "why have we never heard of this before?" Dont rehash canon ofc, but dont expect us to believe the 7 books were canon and this new fandom were never mentionen.

That said, some stuff works in shared univeses, avengers, supernatural, and buffy for me works. But the author has to explain properly why either storyline dont know of eachother before now.

And that doesn't make sense to me. You could ask that about any universe (even ignoring crossovers) where there are multiple protagonists but they don't all show up (like marvel). At least with HP (if for some reason other wizards aren't called upon) you can blame the statute of secrecy. But you're kind of proving my point. You're saying a separate universe is better because otherwise Harry could just call on other wizards (easy way out of a problem the SoS creates).

Alternatively, throw Shepard, Garrus and Legion in the Harry Potter universe and the Battle of Hogwarts just became the Hogwarts Turkey shoot as a lance of superheated metal blew Voldemort's head off from a mile away.

****** Hmm, maybe Bellatrix Lestrange in the GoT world would be too OP, but I think I disagree with the idea that Hermione would easily win in the Hunger Games. She'd have an easier time for sure, but I think with careful world-building it could be quite interesting. For example, say the Statute of Secrecy was still in effect and the wizards/witches were more obsessed about hiding their world because of how twisted the Muggle society has become, not to mention how much more advanced their technology has become too. Then you could have Hermione struggling not to use her magic overtly, which means she can't just summon food from across the arena or put up wards that will render her invisible to everyone else. She'll have to be crafty about how she uses her magic. That way, she'll actually be in significantly more danger, and there will be actual stakes involved.

******** I think a fairly popular way to limit canon magic in fanfiction is to say that the properties of the multiplied object become more... I'm not sure what the correct way to phrase it is, but just stretched, I suppose? So like a slab of stone multiplied five thousand times becomes increasingly weaker and weaker and weaker, until it can't be multiplied anymore. In this case, maybe some of that multiplied gunpowder would have been multiplied so much that they couldn't even light anymore. Or something like that; I'm not a very science-oriented person, so forgive the vague and somewhat awkward phrasing xD

Basically, the end result is that the gunpowder wouldn't be capable of doing enough damage to take out the government.

Anyway, in that scenario, you'd have to be writing a pretty ruthless Hermione willing to kill a bunch of innocent people in order to take out the government. If you have a Hermione that has morals as strong as her canon personality, both the explosives and Imperius options are out. The latter because of the strong stigma against Dark magic in canon.

And if you blow up a tyrannical government, perhaps the only innocents to die is the cleaning staff. All others are part of the system hurting millions. If she has the power to help millions, canon Hermione wouldn't be above getting her hands dirty. She was the second in command in the second war against Voldemort after all.

Hell, with apparation you can assassinate people with ease and be out without being seen. Magic might not be useful on the front lines of a modern war, but one witch could bring down the administration of an entire nation by destroying the bureaucracy.

********** True, she wasn't above crossing rules, but blowing up an entire government building full of people and actually killing them is an entirely different matter. She's never shown an inclination to kill that I can remember, let alone an inclination towards the 'save a million lives by killing one thousand' logic. Either way, this is really down to how you interpret Hermione's character, hence I don't think it's really all that relevant to the discussion. I can see Hermione developing into the kind of person you're talking about, especially with the darker tone of the Hunger Games world, but I could also run with a moral Hermione and have her actions be limited by that morality. Both versions of Hermione are still plausibly canon, imo, so neither would be considered too out of place. As long as the author can make these versions of Hermione believable and not laughably OOC, how they choose to portray Hermione is their prerogative. It's fanfiction, after all.

Apparition would be an interesting one to play with. She could definitely do that, assuming she is willing to kill Snow. It would still be interesting to see her execute the mission, because she'd have to first infiltrate and find out when Snow is alone/what places are safe to Apparate into and won't have security cameras, lest she Apparate in at the wrong time and get discovered and gunned down by a bunch of people.

Besides the obvious answer of simply casting a muggle repelling ward on something and carry said object around, disillusionment, soundproofing, invisibility cloaks, Polyjuice and animagus transformations make infiltration with magic easy as pie.

************ I'm not really sure how casting a Muggle repelling ward would help? But for the rest...

Animagus transformation depends on what form Hermione takes. If she's a lion, it's going to be pretty weird for her to just trot into the building.

Polyjuice is another one, but how far she can get on it depends on whose hair she can get, and the security clearance of the person whose hair she manages to take.

For invisibility cloaks, she could borrow Harry's, I guess. Unless Harry's cloak is inaccessible to her by one way or another; they could stop being friends, or maybe Harry died and his cloak vanished or something. I'm sure the disappearance of the cloak can be easily explained away. She'd be hard-pressed to find another cloak too, because we know that Invisibility Cloaks are rare.

Soundproofing: The two 'soundproofing' spells we see in canon are Muffliato and Silencio. I've seen Silencio used as a way to silence footsteps in fanfic, but in canon we only ever see it being used to silence voices. Muffliato creates a buzzing noise on people who are trying to eavesdrop on conversation. For both spells, they haven't been used in canon to silence footsteps, so if we run with the assumption that they can't, then that will make Hermione's job quite a bit harder.

As for Disillusionment, given how advanced the technology in Hunger Games is (literally creating crazy monster dogs in a day), if heat-sensing technology is incorporated into their security systems, that would make it harder for Hermione too.

Honestly, we could argue all day about whether HP magic is too OP. The fact is, HP's magic system is so vague that it leaves a lot of room to maneuver. It makes it easy to add restrictions or effects that could respectively underpower or overpower it while still remaining canon, which is the beauty of having such an undefined system.

** Separate for sure, the shared ones I have read seem to spend too much time explaining how each universe fits together and excusing why problems aren't solved by the other fandom. It can be done well, but my preference will always be a character moving to a unique setting and then exploring the outcome. The best example I can think of is linkao3( There May Be Some Collateral Damage by metisket), where there is a shared universe but there is very little emphasis on that, it is all characters reacting to the differences. Also love Ron in this one, while there isn't much of him it is one on the few stories that I feel gets him right.

** Shared. There is nothing inherently interesting in a character jumping tothe universe which has different powersets. There are some good fics that utilise this concept (in case of HP it's Shadow of Angmar and... eee... don't know anything else), but usually it works only when it's connected to one of originals' canons (like Zero no Tsukaima).

On the other hand, merging universes require worldbuilding. The resulting new world is a draw in itself. How can you adapt, connect, twist various aspects of canons? There is a lot of potential here.
