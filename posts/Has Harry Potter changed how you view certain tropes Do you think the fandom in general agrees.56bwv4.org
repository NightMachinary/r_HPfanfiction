Personally I use to love the Heroic Sacrafice trope, the good, just hero sacraficing himself to save those he loves. The ultimate form of love. Then Harry Potter came along, I had spent my youth reading the books, and reading fanfiction. Harry was a friend, someone who I grew older with. Seeing him walk to his death did not fill me with awe, it did not inspire me as it usually did. Instead it filled me with dread, this constant in my life was choosing to die. Harry had decided suicide was the answer.

From that point on, the heroic sacrifice has been tarnished for me. Sure, a rare show can pull it off and give me a bit of that same old feeling, but it's always overwhelmed by disappointment.

I feel like the fandom would probably agree, with the amount of stories that exist that flat out call the sacrifice dumb.


** Harry Potter ruined passivity for me, i.e the protagonist(s) lounging around and wasting time on frivolous bullshit while A DARK WIZARD PLANS TO KILL YOU. Nowdays if I'm watching, for example, a scifi show and I see the gang making heartfelt conversation instead of preparing for the attacking aliens, I just rage.

It's bad writing really. There's a time and a place for filler, if the author is talented enough. Most aren't.

As for your sacrifice point, I personally am stuck in post-GoF & post-OttP fics. I read so much fanfic from 2002 to 2007, that the 6th and 7th books were not meaningful or enjoyable at all. The only things they added for me were plot mechanisms (horcruxes, hallows, w/e). That's why I mostly love gen AU fics.

***** Haha I'll start with recs: tbh I haven't read anything (non-crack) that handles Years 5-7 well. I'll gladly take recs, but a lot of my favorite fics are highly AU or post epilogue.

If you're in the mood for something light, ALMOST A SQUIB is nice (written by the sample person who wrote HARRY THE HUFFLEPUFF). It's short and kinda funny, but Harry has a lot more common sense.

As for why I hate them, I'll tall about my biggest pet peeve of book 7. It's not the characters, it's the entire Gringotts scene. You know the one where the trio breaks into Gringotts.

Let me repeat that. Three 17-year olds (and an ex employee who can't do magic) break into the biggest bank in Wizardig Britain, and one of the most secure places in the entire country.

And worse than that, it's the way they do it too. Remember, Gringotts is considered state of the art security.

Griphook, Harry, Ron, and Hermione wear disguises. (Harry's cloak is considered a disguise because there are ways to detect people inside, so hypothetically Gringots should have anticipated invisibility).

Ron is disguised using random cosmetic charms taught to 16 year olds, and Hermione is using a potion so well known that 12 year olds read about it.

Now this isn't a problem, because Gringotts (like any reasonable bank) Asks for ID, which in the Wizardig world is a wand. And they happen to have Bellatrix's ID. Except for one thing: the goblins know it's fake. Bellatrix's has reported it stolen and using it should lead to their arrest.

Except it doesn't because Harry uses the mind control spell (the imperious curse). On the bank teller, the Death Eater accompanying them, and he even confounds the 2 security guards.

Yes. Harry breaks into a bank by mind controlling the bank staff. In a world where ever single person knows that a mind control spell exists.

What this means is that every single one of Gringott's hundreds of employees looked at Gringott's defenses and no one realized you could just mind control your way through.

Also, in the history of Gringotts, no one has ever thought to break in using it? Ever?

It's totally nonsensical that Harry and co can break into a location that's so secure Voldemort would put a Horcrux there by mind controlling people. Like no one ever saw this coming?

How is Gringots not robbed like every other Tuesday?

EDIt: The ministry scene is also bad (where 3 17-year olds break into the government) but at least they tried planning. Gringotts was just a Hail Mary

  Does it also bother you that Harry & co suddenly get strong enough to match Death Eaters? Was there behind the scenes training where Neville got strong enough to match Bellatrix?
#+end_quote

Sorry, but I've been tied up with classes for the past few days but I decided to take a quick break and answer this question (a bit shorter lol).

But yeah, the world created is the best part, which is one of the main reasons I read FF. I like the characters and the world, just not the plot.

I'm actually not bothered that Harry and Co can go toe-to-toe with normal Death Eaters. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/4s5h94/harry_potter_movieshow_come_when_wizards_fight/][The top comment in this thread]] basically summarizes why I don't really have a problem with it.

What I have a problem with is Harry and co. being able to fight top level death eaters. Remember that Harry got his ass whooped by Snape at the end of book 6 (and while Snape was a professor, he wasn't the head of Voldemort's troops).

I assume Neville trained with some of the Hogwarts kids, but Voldemort's had years to train his death eaters to fight well (or at least the top command), but the only Death Eaters we hear about that are actually worth it are Barty Crouch (who... I don't want to even go into the 4th book) and Bellatrix Lestrange who gets killed by Molly Weasley.

Yes, the head of Voldemort's armies (and the only Death Eater who is shown to have any real combat skill, Snape aside) gets killed by Molly.

Every single soldier in Voldemort's army was weaker than Molly Weasley.

I hope I'm not the only one who sees something wrong with this picture. How on earth did the aurors not manage to stop the Death Eaters if they're so ass at fighting. The aurors train for years in combat and they can't stop these Death Eaters.

The problem is that JK wanted a climactic scene where Molly kills Bellatrix. And I agree such a scene is a nice story moment. But she sets it up in such a way that it kind of ruins the world a bit. If it was set up differently (Bellatrix injured or weakened, Molly teaming with a few other wizards, Voldemort having other high level fighters) it would've been even better. But the way it is now is just... meh

The two situations you are describing are different scenarios. Harry is lounging around for 3 years while Voldemort is trying to take over because he's a 15-17 year old kid. All of the adults are trying to keep him out of the battle, and they refuse to give him special training.

He was just immature and unprepared to shoulder the burden thrust upon him at first, but he wasn't completely idle. In 5th year he did the DA. In 6th year he did lessons with Dumbledore. In 7th year he literally hunted down the last parts of Voldemort soul.

I hope you aren't implying that Harrys passivity in canon was bad writing. His passivity was part of his characterization. It was intentional.

The scenario you are describing where in the middle of a pitched battle, the main character stops what they are doing and hugs their lover or whatever. That IS bad writing, but it's different from what JK did.

Maybe I just misinterpreted what you were referring to in canon. What exactly were you talking about from canon?

***** I always felt that a big part of it was the Dursley treatment; Harry was always told he was worthless and a burden. Therefore the consideration of sacrifising his life must have been made easier by the probability that he placed less value on his own life, compared to the life (or lives) of his loved ones.

All of which points to Dumbledore being a sneaky motherfucker and altogether a lot more ruthless than his portrayal in the previous books.

****** This is ridiculous. It is such a common thing in these 'manipulative!dumbledore' fics that he sent Harry to the Durselys to become 'meek and pliable' but Harry isn't that. He was never that. Harry is fundamentally a good person. That is why he went looking for Hermione to warn her about the troll, thats why he jumped into the tube of death to help Ginny, thats why he was willing to die to end the war and save the lives of the people he loves. Dumbledore said that love was the power Voldemort knew not, and he was clearly correct.

I understand the motivation for people having a poor understanding of Dumbledore. JK mostly used him as a plot device and so some of his behavior is conflicted but we never see him as anything but a good person, and if his only goal was for Harry to die so Voldemort could than Dumbledore would've just smothered Harry in his sleep and saved everyone a lot of trouble.

** In just straight up Harry Potter Fics

-Harry gets super wand that has 7 cores and 20 woods, because Brother Wands don't make sense to me and isn't special enough

-The Death Eaters weren't wrong, just misguided especially Draco and Lucius, but not Peter.

-Harry hears slightly shocking thing and faints, he doesn't argue or ask questions because that means writing important dialogue no he needs to faint.

Crossover Fiction featuring Harry or others from any fandom

-Harry is X's Brother (or sister in Fem!Harry Fics), although if he was Harry wouldn't fit any facet of the Prophecy which they all use to have Dumbledore kidnap Baby Harry away from that family, or even worse Dumbledore dumps a Potter who's existence would make Harry's Sacrifice even easier to protect his sibling.

-Everyone is Magic and going to Hogwarts despite it being impossible to explain how people go years without being known as a Wizard past their 11 birthday AND for some reason are now going to Hogwarts despite almost all living in the States.

-Harry feels afraid of a basic human threatening him over gurting their sister/brother/friend.

-The Over abundance of Slash Fic's in Crossovers. I would bet 10 Bucks the most common crossovers between Harry and another Fandom, like Harry Potter/Avengers, Harry/BtVS, Harry/Twilight. Every Page will hold at least 5 stories Harry in a Slash Relationship, or Harry in a Gen fic with Slash Undertones

You assume it's something that instantaneously obliterates opponents with one spell, but in reality, a mega wand can just be a wand that can /become/ OP but takes time, training, knowledge, skill, power, etc.. You don't just pick up a wand and randomly know every spell, no matter how powerful a stunner you pull off, it wouldn't matter against a shield made of water. Percy's sword is arguably more powerful than any Super Wand, as most people don't make it so that the wand appears back in their pocket after being lost, or can be hidden in the form of a pen.

**** The sucky thing about the concept of Super Wands is that it removes the ability of the user especially in Fanfiction.

Instead of Harry or even any other Main Character working to understand the magic they wield (which was a complaint about how Harry is Lazy) it's easy breezy, the Wand is so perfect and powerful and great it shoots Stunners twice as powerful as any other wand because /It isn't Harry, it's the Wand/

The non connection between Percy's Sword and Harry's mega wand is that Percy still needs the skill and ability to slay said god, the Sword doesn't Stab and Slash for him, nor does it make his stabs and slashes any more powerful or efficient. Harry's Super Wand does that 99% of the time

Was James Potter really that good at transfiguration? Or was it just the fact that his wand was meant for it? What about Dumbledore? Would he have been able to take on Voldemort in the ministry without the Elder Wand to aid him? It's a pretty one-dimensional argument when you think about it, people don't want it to be Harry either. When a powerful Harry story appears people bash it to all hell just because he is powerful.

Harry still needs knowledge and power, even with a super wand. If he didn't have the magic, his wand wouldn't be able to shoot sparks or even choose him. If he didn't have the knowledge or skill, how come in most Super Wand fics he is knowledgeable and is trained? People just want an excuse for why canon Harry is perfect the way he is, they don't want him powerful or intelligent, they want him naive, that way they can look at the world with the same magic it has always had for them. Super Wands aren't really the problem, the writing, however, is. Can't tell you how many times I've seen grammatical errors in Super Wand fics, it's disgusting.

JKR stated herself that he is no saint, and he is willing to get his hands dirty, so why does he have a wood that represents purity? Sure he managed a Patronus, but so did most of the other people in the DA. Holly and Phoenix is how the public sees Harry, it's how Dumbledore sees Harry, but it isn't how Harry is, the wand doesn't make sense.

********* That's because you're looking at it from a close-minded standpoint. Don't look at it as a way to power him up, look at it as a way to build his character. You could always give him one really OP wood and one really OP core. But the reason others give him multiples, is simply because they are trying to demonstrate how complex he is personality wise. To them, it shows how twisted he has become from the years of abuse, to them it shows that his personality change was monumental, it isn't just a way to flex power, it is a way to show what kind of character he is. Why should he get the same wand as everyone else? If he has godlike power, you obviously need a godlike wand to handle it. If he is destined from multiple forms of magical mastery, that too can me more cores, after all, usually, the wand chooses the correct wizard, for the correct reason. James got a wand that was good at transfiguration, his destiny lied in that subject, he needed to become an animagus, he needed to teach the rest of the gang how to do it as well. But Harry simply getting a wand that is "Good at defense, or decent at charms" is a complete outrage, Voldemort has the same core and he gets "Very Powerful Wand". You can give Harry a simple wand in the beginning, but it should progress, it should evolve, along with him, his character, his power. The one thing I hate about super-wand fics is that he gets the wand from Ollivander. Typically, super-wand fics give Harry about twenty or so heirships, and always one with the Peverell line. So why wouldn't he be able to find a powerful wand in the world's greatest wand maker's vault (Antioch was said to have made the Elder Wand, doubt that that was just a fluke of luck)? I'm sure he didn't just make one wand and stop at that.

** Soul bonds. I hated that, but after reading good fanfiction about it it changed my opinion. I disliked the sacrifice part as well, not because I thought it was out of character or anything, but because I thought it could have been written in a better way. It was a bit rushed in my opinion.

** Yes, Magical Britain as described in the Books is a totally fucked up place. Imagine a society that needs saving through sacrifices by child soldiers.

That Ministry needed to be torn down and rebuilt from the scratch. Those who supported Voldemort and his genocidal ideology had to be punished to the fullest extent of their crimes. There would be no more cover ups.

  Seeing him walk to his death did not fill me with awe, it did not inspire me as it usually did. Instead it filled me with dread, this constant in my life was choosing to die.

I was so insanely pissed about the rest of book 7 by the time it reached that point that I had absolutely no emotional response to anything that happened towards the end there. I wasn't even sad that Fred died.

  flat out call the sacrifice dumb.

The fact that you had such a strong emotional response just goes to show how much the character meant to you. I don't see how that translates to dumb. The dumb part is that he talks to Dumbledore in the afterlife and comes back to life.

*** No, the dumb part is the fact that Harry didn't just choose to move on. He had lost so much during the war, and he had a chance to got to his family, the people that love him, that people that never turned their backs on him when they found out he was a Parselmouth, the people that were by his side through thick and thin. Instead he goes back to an unhappy life, with two annoying sidekicks, and a girl who only likes him because he is the boy who lived.
