Because it'd be funny if, when Umbridge prompts her to give a prediction, Trelawney rattles off a detailed list of the many misfortunes the former's in for that year, from nifflers in her office to being force-fed her own pink cardigan (or whatever those centaurs did), in exacting detail.

And maybe, when she's not teaching classes, Trelawney might go up to the Owlery to enchant the post-owls with home-in-on-the-recipient magic.\\
And occasionally, when major events happen, she's waiting at the scene beforehand, with popcorn at the ready.


** I would love to read a fic like that :

- 1st year : "Oh don't mind me, I'm just here to watch. Harry I hope you didn't forget your flute, this harp will soon stop to play.
- 2nd year : Hello again Harry, finally found the entrance. Better speak to it in parseltongue if you want it to open.
- 3rd year: Good for you to join us Professor Lupin, now if you could get on the side so the kids can knock out Snape that followed you with an invisiblity cloack, then we will be able to expose Pettigrew and leave. Then Black will have to fight you because you forgot your potion today, and Pettigrew will use it to escape . . . I should not have said that right?

​

I'm not sure how she would be able to watch Voldemort return thought (if we even reach this point considering how much of a plot breaker she would be).

*** If she really had Seer abilities on that scale, Dumbledore would have ended the war before Harry was even born.

**** A lot of the Voldemort schemes we see in the books do rely on information security, don't they?\\
"Quirrel is being possessed by Voldemort, and is seeking to steal the Philosopher's Stone." "Ginny Weasley is being possessed by a cursed book and is releasing a basilisk to petrify students." "Peter Pettigrew is a rat animagus disguised as Scabbers." "Mad-Eye Moody has been captured and replaced by Barty Crouch Jr." "Voldemort survived because he created these horcruxes..."

I wonder what a fic with a decisively un-stealthy Voldemort would look like? Where knowing where he is and what he's doing isn't sufficient to foil his plans?

***** What kind of a plan could Voldemort possibly make that would work regardless of who knows about his plans? If that were to happen, he'd have to stage a complete and total coup of the ministry AND Hogwarts AND kill off the resistance very quickly. How large are his Death Eater forces? Anyway, Voldemort's stealth or lack thereof wouldn't matter if Trelawney could instantly tell everyone everything about Voldemort's plans!

not really what you're looking for, but it's the only fic I thought of that portrays Trelawney in a positive light.

  Imagine Harry Potter raised under the guiding hand of Sibyll Trelawney. He arrives at Hogwarts versed in the higher arts of Divination, Arithmancy, Numerology, and Palmistry - you know 'real magic.' Prepare yourself for one humorous ride.

** She's quite a badass in the Firebird trilogy.\\
And at least somewhat competent in Itachi ("Sybill said something")
