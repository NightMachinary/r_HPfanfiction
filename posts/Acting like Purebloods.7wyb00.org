I've just finished reading Ginny Returns, qnd there's been something that's been nagging at me about the last few chapters.

Those of you who have read it will be aware that the actually plot of the story finished up around chapters 13 or 14, while the fic itself has 17 chapters. Letting go of the fact that the resolution of the plot is actually quite of a letdown. What was bothering me is that afterwards everyone started acting like Purebloods for the last few chapters.

What I mean by this is after Voldemort is defeated, almost out of nowhere come this obsession with every character about rules and etiquette about the wizarding would. The Weasley's all of a sudden obsessed with makibg sure that Ginny presents herself as a good match for Harry, while worrying about Ron embarrising them in front of influential people. And on the other had you have Sirius going around making all these deals with other Purebloods families.

For me I found this to being the story down instantly and I had to force myself through the last few chapters as I felt like just giving it up.

But it also raises another question, why are so many authors obsessed with this apparent stuffy and backwards culture that in cannon very few people actually care about. I want to read about the wondering of nagic and good's triumph over evil, not a bunch of booking ass rules which mean you can't even act like yourself.

I was under the impression this was 100% a fanon invention? I don't recall any times in canon where any characters acted this way, are there some? Certainly Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle never acted like they were going by 16th century aristocratic etiquette rules. Neither did Lucious or Belatrix or Snape. Not many other pureblood slytherins even had much dialogue that I can remember, Pansy and Milicent had a few lines I think, but again no weird etiquette rules.

And then beyond that I don't recall pureblood culture in general even being a thing. There were some superficial differences between Wizard and Muggle culture, but there didn't seem to be anything Pureblood specific, or similar to Pureblood culture in fanon unless I am forgetting something. They had different pop culture, but it was more alternate versions, e.g. beedle the bard instead of grimm, weird sisters instead of muggle rock bands, quiditch instead of soccer, etc, not really completely different in nature, just different instances. They also didn't use muggle technology, which is part of culture, but that's not really what most people mean when they talk about pureblood culture in fan fiction and is again just them having alternates for the same stuff, quills for pens, floo/night bus/apparition/port keys for cars and planes, owls for post office workers, etc. And yeah there fashion was different too, but its not like that would take more than a short period for a muggle born to familiarize themselves with, and no one ever commented that Harry or Hermione were wearing incorrect or odd clothes.

You can infer they had different views on political systems, freedom of the press, corruption, needed safety measures, treatment of prisoners, etc, which are big cultural differences. But again that's usually not what stereotypical Pureblood culture entails.

**** Yes, 'pureblood culture' is a total fanon invention, created by people who thought Purebloods were some sort of sophisticated aristocracy.

On the other hand, Purebloods were not villains in the Books either. There was no glorious class struggle between tyrannical Purebloods and oppressed Muggleborns. Most in the DA and Order were Purebloods, and the war was mainly fought against Purebloods of the opposite ideology. Known Muggleborn participants beside Hermione, Dean, and Justin (even he went missing in the entire Book 7) were non existent.

Muggleborns made it to Minister (Nobby Leach in the 60s) and at least one department head (Dirk Cresswell) at the time of Voldemort takeover. It's interesting to note that Cresswell's heritage was only exposed through treachery, meaning that Ministry jobs didn't require applicants to specify their blood status.

In that particular fic you mentioned, it's on my favorite list and I still like it. However, the part about Sirius suddenly warming up to 'pureblood traditions' just feels incredibly OOC. Sirius was well know to piss on what his parents stood for, and he should even more so after suffering 12 years wrong imprisonment.

I had reviews praising that I did not have Andromeda teach Harry about pureblood culture. She has perhaps 2.5k words screentime and most of that is used to drive the plot. Makes me wonder how low peoples' expectations are if the lack of pureblood Andromeda is noteworthy.

***** There isn't really a pureblood culture to speak of in canon. At least nothing that would be significantly different from muggle England (as in, showing differences on the level of, say, those between England and France).

***** It might be, but either way it's not something that I can see any of the main characters adhering too. It's worse in the fic as well as it literally come out of nowhere in the last few chapters, it's like the author wanted a certain amount of chapters but ended up finishing the story too early so they had to make up something else to fill in the remaining chapters, it was basically the equivalent of a tv show having all their filler episodes after the series finale instead of spread throughout the season.

**** Many readers don't (or don't want to) see past the fantastic facade of magic and don't realize what a horrible dystopia Magical Britain actually was:

- Where the likes of Cornelius Fudge, Dolores Umbridge, Rita Skeeter, and Lucius Malfoy controlled the government and the media.
- Where the government would throw anyone it wanted to be tortured by soul-sucking demons.
- Where the government would place these soul-sucking demons around the only school of the country, just to catch one prison escapee who had never been convicted in a court of law.
- Where members of even 'enlightened' families such as the Longbottoms felt it was ok to murder their own children born with disabilities (Squib).
- Where a murdering psychopath was running almost unopposed by the government, calling out for genocide and mass torture.
- Where government officials could torture school children without repercussions.
- Where the supposedly wise and powerful headmaster would use his own school as a battleground to face off the above murdering psychopath, amid hundreds of children.
- Where school bullies ran unopposed and some openly called out for murders of a certain minority.
- Where half of the teaching staff (DADA, Potion, History, Divination, Muggle Studies) was incompetent, bullies, or actively trying to murder/torture students.
- Where the supposedly wise and powerful headmaster would resort to sacrifice children in his desperation to stop the above murdering psychopath.
- Where the use of date rape drug went unpunished or even seen as fun.
- Where they raped other people's mind whenever they felt like it.

***** The Ministry of Magic we experience in the books isn't /that/ different from governments throughout history, either when faced with what we'll call generational evil (Bin Laden), or when taken over by generational evil (Hitler).

Incompetent leaders with a biased media defending their actions and undermining their detractors? Yup

Throw away criminals to soul-sucking demons? We don't have soul sucking demons, but Gitmo and black sites like Abu Ghraib? Japanese internment? Yup yup

We don't have a direct version of putting dementors at Hogwarts, but an estimated 210,000 civilians were killed during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, so, y'know, not a huge premium was placed on making sure only enemy combatants suffered while we tried to fight Al Queda

I dispute that families were okay with squibs being killed. We're told that families often sent squibs away to live among muggles, which is debatably cruel or in their best interests, but is definitely not murdering them.

Once Voldemort came out into the open after OotP, he was opposed until he killed the Minister of Magic and installed a puppet.

I'd advise you to look into how schools were allowed to treat kids up to like the 80s. Corporal punishment was the rule, not the exception. It's still legal in like half of US states (Jesus Christ, America, get your shit together).

Dumbledore organized his resistance from Hogwarts, but he didn't face off against him at Hogwarts. Not sure what you're basing this on.

Bullying isn't exclusively a magical problem. Nobody at Hogwarts committed suicide from being bullied, which puts Hogwarts ahead of today's schools.

With the exception of Lockhart and Umbridge, none of the teachers are incompetent. Muggle studies only exists canonically when its teacher is murdered for teaching it too well. Harry doesn't pay attention in History of Magic, and doesn't try in Divination. Yes, Snape is a bully, no denying that. He doesn't try to murder or torture anyone, though.

Other than recognizing that, due to Voldemort inadvertently making Harry a horcrux, he'd have to die, he isn't willing to sacrifice any students, and he believes that if Harry willingly offers himself up, he won't actually die, so that's questionable.

Yeah, love potion is a weird grey area JK left, where it's sold by the twins at their joke shop, but in the same book, it's how Voldemort's mother conceived him.

That's an... aggressive description of legilimancy.

That happened once (By that I mean Snapes "Special" lessons with Harry), it's an exception seeing as it's a very obscure magic.
