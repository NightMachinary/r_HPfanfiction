So like, george weasley in ohshc .

As a teacher. So after fred died , he became quiet and socially awkward. He couldn't talk to his family and they had a fight so he flew to Japan and started making a joke shop.

His joke shop thingy was so successful, that he was famous around Japan. So like tamaki's father is like aight bro u wanna work here n' George agreed.

This idea just came in my head at 2am


** They thought that the british fella was disgusted by the famous ouran's host club. That it went against his occidental sensibilities. What they didn't know was that every time George Weasley watched the twins talking, a cold emptiness in his heart made itself known.
