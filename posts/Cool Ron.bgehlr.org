Are there any fanfics where Ron is depicted positively? In nearly everything I've read, he is 1) A non-character along the lines of Seamus and Dean 2) A punching bag, basically used for Harry to have a dramatic moment of yelling at someone in order to demonstrate the difference between CanonHarry and SuperHarry 3) An honest-to-god villain, dosing Harry with love potions to get him to marry Ginny or whatnot.

He can't be UNIVERSALLY hated among fanfic writers, can he?


** The thing with Ron is that he is one if the few kids that is actually described as an actual Teenager in the books. He's emotional, aggressive, a little bit perverted, lazy, clumsy, gluttonous, highly insecure and at times very selfish.

While Harry shows a bit of a childish side, he's way too humble and mature, mentally due to his upbringing as an unwanted element. Not to mention Hermione who was always described as the 'mom-friend'.

Ron had the most... Stable childhood out of their entire circle of friends and he ended up being the most normal teenager as a result which doesn't really endear him to a lot of fanfic authors, which is a shame because despite all of the crap that happened between Harry and Ron, he always remained loyal to Harry in the books.

**** Shame there's only one chapter, I love the back and forth between Harry and Ron. It reminds me of canon. I particularly like the part where Ron acts as the voice of reason to Harry's dumb ideas and talks him into a slightly less dumb idea, it's a rarely written side of their dynamic.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

****** Oh sorry, I've forgotten about the Hermione/Snape aspect of A Game of Chess. It's a time-travel fic and so far Hermione/Snape has only been vaguely mentioned in the a few chapters, referring to an adult Hermione and Snape's marriage that took place sometime post-1998. It hasn't been addressed yet in 1994 (Goblet of Fire), the year to which Ron time-traveled to.

An important thing that I should've mentioned is that the author stated that the fic is an exercise in using problematic/challenging tropes, Snape/Hermione being one of them. Here's what the author said in one of the AO3 comments:

#+begin_quote
  We'll eventually reach a discussion in the author's notes, but the Hermione/Severus pairing is, in and of itself, one of the problematic tropes. I could reconcile it so long as they were both of age. Hermione here [in 1994] is definitively not.
#+end_quote

Here's one of the meta discussions that take place at the Author's Notes of every chapter (one of my favorite aspects of the fic):

#+begin_quote
  Today's problematic trope is time travel romance. And whoooboy is it problematic to the nth power.

  In this scene, Hermione is fourteen and Ron is in his twenties.

  It's complicated by the fact that Ron loved her when he was also fourteen, and that Hermione has always been 'the one who got away'. Ron's love does spring from a place of the two of them growing up together and being through a war together. It's real, and untainted by moral quandaries.

  But now Hermione is a child, and Ron is not. She is not the Hermione who grew up with him - she still is growing up. She is not the woman who fought at his side: she is not a woman at all.

  It's really unfortunate (and creepy) how many time travel stories don't merely sidestep this moral question with flimsy justifications but rather behave as though it is not even there.

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

  Before Harry's sixth year, he never thought a great deal about how wizards Sort others: by blood, by allegiance, and by House. When those strictures begin to crumble, Harry must find his own way without relying on prejudice or presumption, aided by Severus Snape, Remus Lupin, and an increasingly enigmatic Draco Malfoy.
