For me, Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets Snape looks very, very different from book 3 onwards. That is because when 11 year old me read these books, I thought that hooked nose meant that the tip of Snape's nose literally curved upwards like, Captain Hook's hook, with the abnormal thinness and all. To this day, that is the only reason I pity Snape, including The Prince's Tale.

This is embarrassing to admit, but I also thought that Spellotape was regular English, and it wasn't until years later I discovered that it's actually Sellotape, and it wasn't just a British eccentricity, just wizarding terminology. I thought that Blimey and Wotcher were wizarding things like 'Merlin!', on the other hand. It wasn't until after I read another book that my small brain pieced together the facts, and discovered that it was just slang.


** I thought Dean and Seamus were the same person. I was eight when I read the books in English (not my mother-tongue) and for some reason I decided that the person's name was Dean Seamus and that JK just alternated between the two names.

I think a common one (especially for non-English speakers) is the pronunciation of Hermione .

Edit; this is a really amusing post, OP! I can't wait to read the other comments

***** I think it's right that way, because they say it in the movie like that. But then the passage where she explains her name doesn't make sense to me. She says it's pronounced "Her-my-o-nee" but that would sound weird, and i don't get it, why is the o in the explanation when you don't pronounce it? I'm glad that they translated it to "Hermine" in German, way easier

** So, I was 6 when I first started reading/being read the books. I can't remember many of the major errors I made, but I do remember being utterly convinced that when JKR talked about toilets she meant chamber pots.

One thing the films vindicated me on what that my mum was convinced Dobby was pronounced Doby and used to have a go at me for it, but clearly I was right. Also, for years I was convinced Dolohov was Doholov.

In te reo,"wh" is pronounced "f" so instead of, for example, "Wongaray" it's "fangaray" for Whangarei (allowing for other mispronunciation issues). Consequently, whenever I read the name "Kawhi Leonard" I pronounce it in my head "kaa-fey"instead of "ka-why".

Similarly... whew and phew are often homophones.

** The two biggest ones for me was the pronunciation of the mirror or eroded - I pronounced it eh-rised for so longs it's embarrassing.

I also had a lot of trouble with Narcissa's name for some reason and said Naricssa in my head when I was reading the books - it was my Mum that pointed out to me how wrong I was eventually.

** Hermione was mentally pronounced Hurr-mee-own instead of Hurr-MAI-uh-knee. Draco was (and still is!) mentally pronounced DRAH-koh, because it sounds closer to words like "Draconian" and "Draggo".

Not really a misconception on my end, but my sister kept calling That One House Elf DOH-bee instead of DAH-bee. I told her that "Doby" with one 'b' rhymes with "Toby". "Dobby" has two 'b's, and therefore rhymes with "Lobby".

** I was seven when I first read the books, and for me all giants were green. So my Hagrid was green during all the books, and it's only when I watched the movies that I realised that he was just really tall. I also pictured Neville as green, for absolutely no reason. I must have really liked this color as a kid.

** This was a US vs UK marketing thing, as a kid Philosopher's stone didn't sound as exciting, and I dont exactly remember the initial marketing buy my mom had heard of the UK title version and I didn't get it for a year or so because we didn't know Sorcerer's Stone = Philosopher's stone. (I think it was something like the, the original Scholastic ads made the book look very generic to a 10-11 year old)

*** Whereas I'm an American that bought all of my books through Amazon UK (which was a hassle) because I was offended that the US publishers thought Americans were too stupid to know what the Philosopher's Stone was, and refused to buy dumbed-down books.

I also think it was a disservice to Americanize the other terms (like sweater/jumper trunk/boot) because I grew up reading my way through the library, including books by English authors, and I think it's better to expand a child's world by learning alternative terminology --- learning that there IS alternative terminology --- than sanitizing their world so they don't have to stretch their brains.

** 2 major mistakes with the 6th book. I don't even have age to count.

First off: I accidentally skipped a few chapters of half-blood prince. Then had a meltdown when I realised they were all having a bloody funeral for Dumbeldore.

Then, lost in a haze of grief, I went back to read the chapters and somehow missed that Dumbledore fell off the astronomy tower. Here I was thinking that the man fell down those few steps to the front door, but I watched the movie and did a double take.

That man fell off the tallest tower and still had an open casket. Wizards can do a damned good job at patching up, can't they?
