Wondering if anything like this exists.

Harry knows the prophecy and decides to milk it to get away with truly awful behavior. Murder? Cant go to Azkaban when there's still a Dark Lord to defeat. Abuse of power? Ron, give me all your stuff or I wont kill Voldemort, in fact you too Hermoine or else Ill let the Death Eaters get you first.

** "... And that's why you can't send me to Azkaban!"

"Perhaps, Mister Potter, but it is also the case that prophecies are often fulfilled in highly unexpected ways; it is therefore equally likely that your going to Azkaban is a necessary step that will eventually lead to your defeating the Dark Lord. Since we don't know either way, we would rather have one fewer murderer on the streets. Your sentence stands."

**** "Perhaps, Mister Potter. But, they say that the harder you try to prevent a prophecy from coming true, the more likely it is to come true; and I am told that yours, in particular, gives equal weight to the possibility of the Dark Lord destroying you instead. Think about your decisions carefully, Mister Potter. You will have plenty of time to do so in the years to come. Take him away!"

********** Do you really think that this brat could have defeated Voldemort in the first place, even if they'd done what he wanted? To defeat Voldemort, it took a hero, with unmatched will and determination, and willing to sacrifice himself to save others.

This brat, with his attitude, and reinforced by others' subservience, would he defeat Voldemort in Priori Incantem? Would he to sacrifice himself for his loved ones, granting them protection and destroying Voldemort's last horcrux?

No. Giving in to his demands would just postpone the inevitable: the brat finally being hunted down and killed by the Dark Lord, or, worse yet, joining him, only to be betrayed and killed (or worse).

This Harry taking responsibility and reforming was the only chance he had of fulfilling the prophecy in his favor, and to make him face the consequences of his actions was the only chance this "bureaucrat" had of effecting that.

************ He owed them not to commit murder, for one thing. I don't understand why you are so sympathetic to this particular version of Harry. He is, by all accounts, a terrible person whom you would never befriend in real life.

*** And then get fucked hard in the ass by dark lord just like before a 1.5 yr old baby survived his killing curse.

Harry gets rescued by Voldemort when Voldemort frees his people. This time Harry is not naive like he was when 11 year old and joins hand with Voldemort to make people who sent him to worst hell possible suffer.

** I seem to recall numerous stories where sending Harry to Azkaban was all part of MustacheTwirling!Dumbledore's plan to make him strong enough to fight Voldemort. Also all the other ones where it was clear that the author had just read The Count of Monte Cristo in school and thought they were cleverly alluding to it.
