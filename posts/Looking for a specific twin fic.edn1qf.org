I don't remember the details but basically like this; Harry and his twin (who is also BWL? I think) are close , and James and Lily care both of them equally. If I remember correctly, Harry transfers to Durmstrang.

and if there are similar fics, please recommend it. where harry's oc brother is good, and no bashing.
