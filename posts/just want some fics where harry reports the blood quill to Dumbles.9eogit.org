** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11102515/1/Uncle-Quentin-s-Spy][Uncle Quentin's Spy]], linkffn(11102515): Since one's blood was essential for lots of rituals in this fic, Harry stunned Umbridge immediately and reported it to Dumbledore, who then modified Umbridge's memory and covered the things up, for the time being.

***** From your description it sounds like Dumbledore is needlessly covering up the torture of a student of his (for reasons unknown, I haven't read it). Sounds like a typical Evil!Dumbledore story.
