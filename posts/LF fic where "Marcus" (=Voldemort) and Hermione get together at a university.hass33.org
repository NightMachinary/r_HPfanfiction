:END:
At the end of the war, Voldemort mysteriously disappears, and despite Harry and the aurors looking for him for years, they cannot find him anymore. Voldemort disguises himself as a person called Marcus something. He and Hermione are neighbors at this magical university and eventually they have sex and have some kind of magical sexual connection that makes it /extremely/ enjoyable for both of them. This is because Voldemort is doing a ritual that acquires more magical power through sex.

By the time Hermione realizes that Marcus is Voldemort, she is pregnant with a child. Because she eventually cannot get away, she convinces Voldemort to not aspire for violent world domination, then they marry and have more children, one of whom becomes the Minister of Magic in the epilogue of the story.

I remember the last line in the epilogue of the story, which is something like [after their children are gone] "Now let's fuck!'

I searched the top few pages of "Hermione G." and "Tom R. Jr" or "Voldemort" on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] but I cannot find this story anymore. Maybe only Hermione is tagged because of the disguise of Voldemort?... But I think the reader is informed about that in advance.

Also, this might not be the same story (maybe I am mixing two stories up here) but I think that the way they (Hermione and Draco, who is also at the same university) eventually recognise that Marcus is Voldemort, is that in a dueling lesson, Marcus routinely dodges curses "exactly the same way as a certain Dark Lord they knew". Then eventually Draco gets kidnapped and tortured because he knows Voldemort's identity. If I am mixing up something and this is a different story then please help me find this second story as well! :)

  It all started when two normally clever individuals both had a really lousy day.
