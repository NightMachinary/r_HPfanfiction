** Well, there's linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents by CreatorZorah). In it, Harry is semi-permanently stuck in his animagus form, and definitely feels less comfortable being human. Please be aware, it is for all intents and purposes an incomplete story even though it is marked as complete (the last chapter is an extended synopsis of what would have been included in the story).

** linkffn(Basic Needs by Dinkel) Harry spends a good amount of this fic in his animangus form comforting Greyback, however they do become more than friends so I'm not sure if it's you're cup of tea but it's one of my fav fics (along with it's sequel, Basic Wants).

  Eventually, the constant denial of the essentials, such as sleep, water, food and human contact, got to everyone in Azkaban, even the infamous Fenrir Greyback. However, one full moon and an unexpected visitor might just change everything... HPFG, SLASH

** I think it's a common trope in fics involving primarily Harry and Snape. You know, because they hate each other so let's make at least one of them not realize who the other actually is as a way for them to befriend each other.. It wouldn't appeal to most people around here but for some it might be worth looking into. I might edit if I happen to find a collection
