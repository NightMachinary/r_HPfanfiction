:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Anyone know of this fanfic of a little Harry has cancer and Mrs. Figg calls Snape to see him, although he refuses he goes next to Lucius and they see Harry in the hospital and they find out about his dealings with the Dursleys and he has cancer.

They end up treating him and taking him to Hogwarts despite everything.


** This is certainly not the fic you were after, but I forgot in the last couple of discussions on fem!Harry to mention linkao3(5372018), which is fem!Harry dying of very long term cancer while battling Voldy. It ends up (most likely, it is WIP) as Snarry, but it is not half-well written.

  There was a more sinister reason for Hero's short temper in fifth year than adolescence and excess stress. When she has a seizure while gardening outside no. 4 Privet Drive, in full view of the neighbors, the Dursleys have no choice but to take her to a doctor. The devastating news will affect all that is to come.Sorry, this isn't a great summary. And I know this sounds really depressing, but just go with me, alright?

  Harry is a very sick young boy, and Arabella Figg is one desperate woman. With Dumbledore ignoring her, she has no choice but to take drastic measures to ensure the child's survival. So she goes to the one person who might have a hope in hell of helping her. Severus Snape. Even she couldn't foresee the consequences of his help. TMR/LM eventual TMR/LM/HP when he's older. ON HOLD!
