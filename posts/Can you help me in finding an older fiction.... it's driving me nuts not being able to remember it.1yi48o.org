Hey all! I'm looking for a HP fanfiction that's a few years old. Here's what I know:

-- Location: I know I read it on fanfiction.net...

-- Time period: Post War, ignores for the most part the epilogue.

-- Pairing: Hermione/Snape

-- Language: English

-- Length: Long! Maybe not novel length, but certainly a good novella.

-- Summary: I know the story started with Hermione running into Snape unexpectedly in a train station. She then tracks him down and he's living in a muggle trailer park. He's suffering from long term nerve damage due to the cruciatus curse, and she eventually convinces him to come back to Hogwarts (where she teaches)... It goes from there. I distinctly remember it ends with Hermione becoming headmistress, and there's a particularly striking scene where Snape shows three Hogwarts students his memories of the war as a form of punishment because they drew a Dark Mark on a student's arm.

I've tried to give you a few of the things that stuck out in my mind about the story, in hopes they trigger something in yours. I've searched the ff.net archives but I can't find a lick of it, and it's really starting to piss me off, like when you have a song you can't remember the name too!

Thanks in advance!

*** As user [[/u/Beelzebuddy]] pointed out, the fanfic is /Post Tenebras Lux/ by Loten on Fanfic.net. :-) Enjoy. I loved it.

** This sounds so similar to a story I read that I was questioning if I remembered the events in the story correctly because one or two events in your description didn't sound familiar. But, it's not the same. Just another Adult-Hermione-finding-Snape-living-in-the-Muggle-world fic. :)

**** Here it is. It's called [[http://www.theburningpen.com/NB/prologue.htm][A New Beginning]] by Ruth Solomon. It is graphic, though, so if you're not into that... Fair warning.
