  Following the Battle for Manhatten, nearly all of Percy's closest friends are dead. Grieving and left as the last Greek hero in New York, Percy is confronted by two goddesses who desperately need his help. Miles away, a young wizard is unknowingly inching closer to the end of the prophecy that has defined his entire life...the only problem is that he doesn't know it yet. AU.

** Of all the crossovers I've read, these are the best I found, unfortunately, because I wish there was more... linkffn(Consul of the Underworld; The Unrelenting Frozen Seas; The Ever Twisting Wind) All 3 are fem!Harry and mostly are OoC, not even close to canon in personality. Its more PJU-centric than HP, but it has a good flow between both.

All 3 stories are based on 3 aspects of each of the 3 Big; A cunning and political daughter of Pluto; A firecracker with serious anger issues daughter of Poseidon, and an airhead daughter of Zeus. According to the authors, they wanted to make "child>teen>adult" aspects for each of the stories.

I don't remember the pairing for "Wind" but Consul is fem!slash and Frozen so far is bisexual. Probably will be pure fem'slash eventually. No-one likes the dude she's with.

  A child of the Rich One rises. Wielding a smile masking a plotting mind. Carving a righteous but dark path through a world more vast and mysterious than ever imagined. In this game of gods and men, it's her time to shine. Fem!Harry.

  The Sea has many moods, many faces. This is mirrored by its children greatly. The icy seas shift and tide against the shore of a difficult path. Watch as a small ripple becomes a mighty typhoon in the world of monsters, gods, and demigods. Fem!Harry. Years One-Three, complete! Thanks for the support guys and gals!

  Anguished soul tumbling though the wind, continuously searching for a place where its fame is its own. Once more, pushed into a new world, with new challenges, new threats, testing the mettle of her resolve and ability to survive. Fem!Harry.
