If you haven't seen the movie The Prestige (which I highly recommend, one of Nolan's best films) it's centered around a deadly rivalry between two men and the dangers of oneupmanship. Are there any fics out there in the same vein? Main characters can be anyone.


** Dotting this to come back to. The prestige is my favorite movie, it gets better every time I watch it. If you like inception you'll like the prestige

*** Have you read the book? It's good and manages to be creepier than the movie!
