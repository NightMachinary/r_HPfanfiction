I'm looking for Dumbledore mentor, Flamel mentor, founder mentor or Merlin mentor fics

No dark!Harry

No slash or fem!Harry please

Please over 80k words

Prefer the fact that Harry has a mentor makes him semi-OP and stuff

Can have time travel, but I have read linkffn(founding of happiness) which I highly suggest so IF you have another fic similar please do tell me

So, light mentor fics.

Thank you!


** Harry Potter and the Four Heirs, linkffn(9048823)

It's Merlin, but it's kind of a time skip-y mentorship. And memory dump kind. Evil Dumbles, Ron/Dumbledore bash.

  Merlin, not happy with how the future unravelled for the life of Harry Potter, intervenes early to set the course of history back on track. Implied Pairing Only. Smart!Harry Bash!AD Idiot!RW

** As of yet the relationship hasn't truly developed, but trust me, it will very soon. It will be updated quite frequently as I am quite far ahead. The story will include all years.

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater.

**** I don't have a set schedule but at least once a week until chapter 15 is posted, which will be the last of first year. After that, we'll see how far ahead I still am.

** Linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom)

It's mentor Voldemort but it's not a dark!harry story and does a great job creating and flushing out a new magical art.
