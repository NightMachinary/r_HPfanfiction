I'm on a mystery/surprise kick today, and I'm curious what fics there are that do that sort of thing. So, I'm looking for fics with relatively well-founded plot twists or surprises (ie. you read it once and get to the twist and you're shocked, then you reread it a second time and see foreshadowing references/the development of it over time).

=o=o=o=o=o=o-o=o-o=o==o==o=

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** I loved [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29310402][A horse with no name]]. No smut. It totally surprised me at every turn but the reread showed me the foreshadowing pieces. The author's Pandemic series overall is full of surprises and plot twists but written really, really well. If you are ok with slash I definitely rec the main story. Some amazing world building there.

*** So long as I don't have to read about people fucking, I honestly don't care what the sexuality of the protags are. It's all the same to me, but I'm ace so smut is boring to read no matter the genitals of the participants. :D

I'll take a look at the full series, definitely. Thanks for the rec! :)

** I mean I'm reading a fic where Voldemort looses patience and kills Draco's mum sixth year and the fallout from that. It's slash but the author full points out they're working with a mix of fanon/canon Draco (it's the only way things work).

**** One Mistake by AstridEstelle (a03) full warning it has slash tendencies like a slight feminization of looks but only in the beginning, after the first two chapters it gets better.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Since you said you're into self promotion, imma throw my story in. It is not smut (some sexual content but nothing explicit) and isn't focused on relationships or romance. I've been told that parts of it read like an action thriller. It is a murder mystery Auror story that takes place between the wars and follows Charlie's class and a bunch of OCs. There are a few plot twists. The whole idea basically came from - hey. What if apparition was a little more...weaponized? I can let you know which chapters have the ahem racy scenes if you end up checking it out. It is a WIP but I update frequently.

*** Ooooh, interesting! For a fandom based entirely on kid-mystery stories, there certainly haven't been that many mystery fics that I've seen, so you're already a step-up there. :)

I don't mind seeing racy scenes, just reading them when I don't have to. I'm ace, so racy scenes are about as interesting to me as football (soccer) - and I fell asleep at the last match I went to. :D

**** Awww well thank you! It is definitely a dark murder mystery story at heart :)

I totally get that! I am aro and one of my good friends (who has been reading my fic) is ace! I totally zone out for romance and don't get it. So I decided my fic wasn't going to dwell on it. I totally made Charlie aroace even. Anyhow, if you do end up checking it out I think the racey scenes are in Chapters 43, 60, the very end of 69, and the very end of 88.

Indeed. Always nice to read a good semi-gen fic. :)

I took a flick through your first chapter and I'm definitely bumping it up the to-read list. Good characterisation, some interesting events, and some fun writing! A thoroughly excellent start :). Literally the only note I had is my personal dislike of onomatopoeic inserts like 'CRRRACCCCKKKKKK', but that really is just a personal nitpick. :)

****** Yay! Enjoy hehe. I am excited it made your list.

Oh no. There will definitely be more sound effects. I think they are limited to spell casting and apparition though so hopefully they don't make you too insane!

I mean . . . I didn't plan it but uh worked out nicely numerically ;)
