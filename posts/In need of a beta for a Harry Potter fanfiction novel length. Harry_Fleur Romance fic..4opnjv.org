I would need a beta with good grammar skills. Style wise I'm mostly okay.

Summary:Harry has it all star Quidditch player skinny though handsome the girls love him,but even with all this, Harry is still lonely longing for a companion someone more than a friend someone he loves. More confident/funnier Harry,Harry/Fleur pairing romance and fluffy chapters will happen! Please read and enjoy If any of you saw yesterday's attempt I promise this is much better.

**** In the last 7 days you posted about your story / your search for a beta for said story *7 times*.

For example, I haven't posted this often in a year. And every one of those posts was on a different subject / a different request.

** Please state the following:

What type of beta do you need? Grammatical, Stylistic, both?

Provide a summary of your idea.

If possible, add possible tropes and/or cliches you might use or consciously try to avoid.

** Just a quick tip on grammar: have a space after the comma (and colons) "Summary:Harry" should be "Summary: Harry", "girls love him,but even" should be "girls love him, but even", "Harry,Harry/Fleur" should be "Harry, Harry/Fleur". Basic grammar errors like this are picked up by most writing programs (Word, Google docs etc) and so aren't really acceptable to expect a beta to correct. Think of it like this, if you don't correct basic spelling and grammar errors which Word highlights, why should a beta waste their time doing so? It shows a lack of basic care, it isn't that hard to read over what you have written and right click to change the errors.

****** Personally? No.

I had some contacts with people willing to beta for me, but that's about it. Im a style / plot beta myself, but I'm shit at grammar so of not much use to you.

As in: I am no longer in contact with them. Also, as they are all visitors of this sub, chances are they already saw your plead and either chose to ignore it or may answer at a later date.

********** - Post on forums. (Which does not mean that you should from now on post every three days on this sub!)

- Don't stop writing because you haven't found one yet. Chapters can always be re-uploaded.

- Provide as much information as you can

- Do as much of the work as you can on your own. (Correcting Word correction on your own, for example)

- Be *very* patient
