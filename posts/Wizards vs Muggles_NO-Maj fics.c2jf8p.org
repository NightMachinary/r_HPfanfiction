Looking for fics where the wizarding and Muggle worlds collide resulting in war. Fantastic Beasts and the Pottermore writings briefly touched upon this subject but I think it can be taken even further. Would prefer fics that take place in the United States as it would in-universe be the most likely place for such war to ignite.

The supernatural vs technology trope is nothing original as it has been numerous times in X-men, Legend of Korra, Narnia, etc but it is too interesting of a concept to ignore.


** All wizards vs all muggles would be pretty one sided as the muggles would have no way of finding where the wizards are and wizards can just imperius and memory charm important muggles if subtlety is required or release fiendfyre if not.

It gets much more interesting when the muggle side has a few muggleborns that can break hiding charms, check leaders for imperius, etc.

Linkffn(Justice, Justice shall you pursue) has a competent muggle prime minister recruiting some muggleborns to form a wizard/muggle combined army under the control of Her Majesty's Government and using it against Voldemort's puppet ministry.

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined ; Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution) have some muggles and muggle weapons involved in magical war, but not full muggle vs wizards.

**** Probably because muggles aren't that great as assassination weapons since they have trouble with simple hiding magic. A trained house elf on the other hand could would be an almost unstoppable weapon.

Muggles are better for huge armies and massive firepower.

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** All wizards vs muggle fics would be one sided, the muggles would swamp them until they win.

Given the setup of the Statute and the background we have on muggle-wizard interaction, it would be safe to that any individual muggle would be doomed, but the wizarding world couldn't recover from the '1 in 10000' lucky break, simply due to the size difference.

If anything, that difference would have gotten worse since the statute was enacted. It might be 'can enough ants kill a bear' situation, but yes, enough can.

Now, clearly this is an 'us vs them' situation: wizards do something to unquestionably unite the muggles against them. The best explanation I have heard on why wizards would win is it would take just a bit of magical deception to throw the muggle powers against each other. The problem is this bites both ways: it is easy to see the wizarding world's institutions as foundationally weak and easy targets for experienced operators. Once you move beyond us vs them you are into very contextual territory.

Edit: I Guess for me it comes down to the setup of 'hidden world vs normal world'. In that setup, you either have the 'hidden world is so advanced it is hiding itself to keep from damaging/spoiling the less advanced', like what you see in a lot of sci-fi serials from 'pacifist' aliens, or a 'this is an effective defense against what would happen if we were revealed'. Nothing in the HPVerse suggests wizards are anywhere near altruistic enough for the first one.

That leaves Wizards hiding because 1) They may win a war, but they would take so much damage they would want to avoid it or 2) There would be no winner or 3) They would ultimately lose if they didn't hide.

Note that in each of these cases, the wizards are vulnerable to muggles. Maybe not a lot, but it doesn't need to be a lot.

And as I stated before, it stands to reason any positives ancient muggles may have had against wizards had have gotten better over time, while we are given very little reason to believe modern wizards would do better than ancient wizards.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. Now complete! Sequel: Nymphadora Tonks: The Last Auror.

  A young Harry Potter, abandoned on the streets, is taken in by a man with a mysterious motive. When his new muggle tattoo suddenly animates, he is soon learning forbidden magic and planning to infiltrate the wizarding world on behalf of the "ordinary" people. But nothing is ever that black and white. (Runes, Blood Magic, Parseltongue, Slytherin!Harry) (SEE NOTE 1st Chapter)
