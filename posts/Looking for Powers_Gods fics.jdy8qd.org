Can anyone give me fics that feature The Powers? Referring to the use of godly beings in HP.

Ones I have read are the Black Princess series by Silently Watches, The odds were never in my favour by Antony444 and All According to Plan by LysandraLeigh.


** Well King of Magic has Harry being the heir of multiple Olympian gods but I warn you that it contains all the tropes that people around here hate nowadays... and the inheritance test... now that's a long one.

Also NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series contains some immensely powerful lovecraftian creatures that can be tamed using an unexplained form of superior magic which is initially attributed godly interventions. This one gradually gets really good as it progresses but it's seven books and the first two or three are a little less action yet you still have to read them in order for later ones to make sense.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, & the TWT in a way you have never seen. Alterate Universe.
