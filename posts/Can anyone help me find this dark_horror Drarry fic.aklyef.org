I don't remember much, but I remember the ending really, really well.

Harry and Draco are trapped underground and to get out, Lucius says one of them has to die. Harry dies, and then there's a clearing-ish thing on the walls - Draco digs through the wall and eventually comes to the surface through the grounds of Hogsmeade. He's covered in dirt, looks like a monster. Draco then screams.

This was explained so, so badly, but it was - from what I can remember - a really good fic with a great, dark atmosphere. I can't find it anywhere, though :(


** If no one here knows you might try [[/r/HPslashfic][r/HPslashfic]] or the tumblr @justdrarryme

** Sounds familiar...does it start with Harry being captured and kept in Malfoy's basement and Draco has to keep watch?

*** I think it might, yeah. The ending is what really stuck with me, I can't really remember much less, but that does sound like it
