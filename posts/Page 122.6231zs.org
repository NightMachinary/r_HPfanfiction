Hermione Granger always knew what to do when one of her idiot friends got into too much trouble. In first year, she knew the second that Harry's broom started to buck, that it was time to set a motherfucker on fire. In second year, she had known exactly what was terrorising the students, but had had the bad luck to be caught by it before she could go get someone to set the motherfucker on fire. In third year, Draco Malfoy (motherfucker) should have been set on fire, but she settled for a punch in the face (to avoid expulsion). Earlier this year, she cheered when that French motherfucker was on fire (dragons, fuck yeah). When Harry returned, bleeding, with the triwizard cup in one hand, and Cedric in the other, she knew exactly what to do. An obscure spell, from a not so obscure book, and it was some recently resurrected motherfucker to be set on fire.

As the charred corpse of voldemort sank to the ground in front of the stunned crowd, and her maniacal laughter subsided, Ron Weasly was the first to pluck up the courage to speak. "Blimey, Hermione! Where did you learn a spell that would summon you know who, and burn him with magical fire?"

" Honestly Ronald, it's in Hogwarts, a History, page 122.Just because you never read past the bit on page 11 about the first school Quidditch cup, doesn't mean that noone else did." She turned to the professors in the stands, "Although. I'm surprised none of you ever noticed the spell?"

Professor Mcgonagall looked sheepish, "I tried, but someone dosed my bookmark in catnip around page 43, and I never got further"

" I must confess, " squeaked professor Flitwick," I only ever stood on my copy, never read it"

"A venomous tentacular shredded the first half of my book when I was a young girl"

"My eye sees straight through paper"

"Potions stain"

She turned to the headmaster as the teachers muttered their excuses," surely you, Professor Dumbledore, you've read Hogwarts, a History? You're in it! "

" Alas, miss Granger, the whole of my chapter 9 was removed when I was a young man, and replaced with a series of powerfully erotic poems, a result of a rather charged switching spell from a young lad in my class"

Hermione Granger sighed. Some motherfucker needed to burn for this.


** I'm surprised no one has taken this and run with it before. Hermione played with fire three times in the first book. For heating at Christmas, on Snape's robes at the quidditch, and against the devil's snare at year's end. Whole epic fics have been written on less ammunition then that. Would totally read Pyromaniac!Hermione with like, twelve different types of fire spell or whatnot. Bluebell, Firestorm, Everlasting, Fiendfyre, Incendio --- Hell, even floo transport and the goblet of fire!

*** OMG I KNOW!

Sorry, but I totally think that Hermione and fire need to be tied together more often.

Ooh, a plot bunny just caught fire!

And don't forget about Dolohov's purple fire curse NOT killing her. [Yes, I know he was silenced.]

** You forgot that in her second year, she was planning to set Draco on fire after interrogating him in Polyjuice disguise, and only her mishap with the potion saved him.
