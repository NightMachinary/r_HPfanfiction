Will the person who made the horcrux have 2 bodies? Will the 2nd body be indestructible? Will the 2 bodies have a telepathic connection like Harry and Voldemort or will it essentially be 2 bodies 1 mind?


** Judging by the one solid example we have of a Horcrux soul-splinter getting its own body (Diarymort in /The Chamber of Secrets/), it's clearly established that it's two separate minds no matter what. Harry and Nagini had a mental bond with "Voldemort Prime" through their Horcruxes, but that's because they were living beings with their own souls; I don't think there would be any such link between the Horcruxed Inferius and the original warlock, as an Inferius, although it is made from a corpse, is fundamentally no different from a robot --- the corpse is just the subject of magical puppetry to make it /behave/ a little like a living, thinking thing.

So if Lord Voldemort had made an Inferius into one of his Horcruxes for whatever reason, the likely result would be that this would have created a "second" Voldemort controlling the undead body, whose mind would be distinct from the original's and not have any soul bond with him.

** I don't think there is enough canon magic to say what would happen, but I can say how I'd write it.

Voldemort would make this a big deal, he would carefully choose a victim that would become this horcrux. I imagine he would carefully torture this person's body into a perfect form, human transfiguration is difficult and dangerous after all. He'd perform dark rituals and spells to strengthen the body and give it extra defenses. Then he would finally kill the host, using their death to create the horcrux. It's not clear how immediately after the killing the horcrux must be made, if there is time I'd imagine he would cast the spell to create the inferi first and then create the horcrux, otherwise he would just work quickly. Once the horcrux was in place he would place it in a form of enchanted sleep and begin casting more spells (the kind that wont work on a living being) to further empower the horcrux.

I can not imagine that Voldemort would allow for two of himself to be in operation at the same time. This horcrux would be different in purpose to his others. He would craft it a magnificent tomb and place it inside, enchanted to awaken only under certain circumstances involving the destruction of Voldemort's actual body. Inferi are magical puppets that follow the commands of their master. This horcrux is intended to resurrect Voldemort.

Some years after his body is destroyed by Harry/Lily, Lich Voldemort awakens and must face contradictory desires. It is compelled to resurrect Voldemort as an inferi following thr instructions of its master, but being Voldemort knows that he will either be consumed in the process or put back into a death like slumber. Obviously mister afraid to die isn't on board with this, and isnt this perfectly crafted body better anyway? Lich Lord Voldemort is here to stay and he isnt going to let Voldemort prime have any choice about it.

** Horcruxes aren't nearly as resilient as fanon has made them out to be, or at least the objects that are made into horcruxes aren't: the reason you need something like fiendfyre or basilisk venom to destroy them is that the objects themselves need to be "destroyed beyond magical repair," not that the containers are made more powerful by having a soul piece inside them.

With that in mind, as I see it, one of two things would happen: either the horcrux would posses the inferius, and it would essentially be a copy of the creator's mind at the time of creation in a separate body, like the diary horcrux, but without needing a middleman, or it wouldn't, and the inferius would just be a normal horcrux that happens to be shaped like a person.

*** From a canon(?) standpoint the prompt is far less fun. Given that Inferi are weak to fire and according to a statement given by JK, Inferi will always be weak to fire as there is no spell or enchantment that can protect them from it.

If an inferi has such a weakness that is known to people that pay attention in Defense and definitely known to trained Aurors, there is just no way Voldemort would take that risk.

** Remember that an horcrux by itself is not nearly indestructible, it is the enchantments placed after that make them nearly indestructible.

The inferi don't seem indestructible, and if voldemort could make them tougher, he would. So I assume that a horcrux inferius would be relatively vulnerable

*** I'd dispute that "if Voldemort could make them tougher, he would". Inferi are useful to him as a horde, not as individuals, so he needed to make a whole lot. It's perfectly possible that if he was willing to spend years, and probably a fortune in magical ingredients ,on a single Inferius (like, say, if he wanted to Horcrux it) he perfectly /could/ make it as indestructible as the other Horcruxes in canon, but it just wasn't the effort to give that kind of protection to every single "goon" Inferius.
