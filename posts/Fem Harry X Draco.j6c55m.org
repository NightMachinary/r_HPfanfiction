Can you guys give me a Fem Harry X Draco fic. Preferably one that is decently long, complete and has them in a relationship early on cos I dont want to read 50k words to see them get together. I'm not picky though, so give me what you have.

Thanks, love you all (not in a weird way)


** It is certainly not my cup of tea, but I heard that “Snape's Daughter by Tribi” linkffn(7618752) is the classic in this area.

  Bill was scanning her too, no doubt checking for curses, "it's as if," he suddenly mused aloud and startled Snape, "as if all of the James was drained from her..." -Harry becomes a girl and Christmas comes early for Draco. fem/Harry AU Book 6

** This is fem!harry x Draco but it's AU. linkffn(8519173).

I don't know if the bot's working so here's the link:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8519173/1/Harriet-Potter-and-the-Minister-of-Magic][Harriet Potter and the Minister of Magic]]

This is Harriet Potter and the Minister of Magic. Basically Lily dies and James' Minister. He can be a better father I guess. Not much of a slow burn but a few chapters where you just wish they would get together already. She's a pretty good author with a bunch with the same pairing. I hope you check it out! Let me know if you like it!
