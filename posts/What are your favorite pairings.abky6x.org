** I don't even read slash, but calling a large swath of the fandom idiots isn't very conducive to a discussion.

** While I am the first to agree that most of the popular slash pairings are garbage, that is not due to the fact that two men are paired together. Shipping Harry with the racially motivated terrorists who murdered his parents and/or tormented him for years is bad taste regardless of the bits involved. Fem!Harry/Voldemort or Fem!Harry/Snape is just as bad as the same story as m/m version.

**** you for real? yes, there are a lot of shitty slash fics but there is a shitload of shitty fics in general. not all of them have lgbt politics. can you imagine being gay and just being disgusted by all these strange het fics? do you also think of two men walking hand in hand as unnatural?

**** All else aside, are you assuming we are all straight guys here? We are not all straight guys here.

And most of us aren't homophobes.

**** It's not disgusting your disgust is disgusting. As another straight guy can you please not claim to speak on behalf of us?

Please don't claim to speak on behalf of all straight guys again, because I have a feeling it would make us all seem like morons who are insecure about our own sexuality.

**** Serious question, what is good about [[/u/Avatar-The-Last-DoDo][u/Avatar-The-Last-DoDo]]?

100% of his rambling is garbage, always forcing his antiquated views down our throats.

What decent human being could not see how disgusting he is?
