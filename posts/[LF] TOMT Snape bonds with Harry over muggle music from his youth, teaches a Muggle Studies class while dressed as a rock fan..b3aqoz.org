Large sections of songs were written verbatim in several chapters. The Muggle Studies outfit included wristbands because Snape had OCD or sensory issues and couldn't stand not having the feeling of sleeves around his wrists. I think Snape made up with Remus and the end of the fic implied that Snape and Harry were entering a romantic but nonsexual relationship.

I'm pretty sure it's not /Allergic to Potions/ by Cordria, but I think it started the same way (with Harry convalescing at Hogwarts over the summer and Snape deciding that having Harry stay in his quarters for observation was the most convenient course of action).
