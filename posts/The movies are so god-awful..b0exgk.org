So I decided to watch moves 5-8 at long last, after a long period of avoiding them.

I don't even like the books. But even from the perspective of an adaptation, the movies are absolutely terrible.

I'm sure people have mentioned the terrible direction, the acting, all these things. I was really annoyed when apparition became flying with fancy dark trails... during which they can apparently cast magic. Ok. Whatever.

No, the moment I realized the extent to which these movies suck and just how much of a pathetic money grab they area, is in the middle of the last movie (what should actually be the end, but whatever).

Snape's repeating the same line we've heard over and over again, that Harry has his mother's eyes.... As Harry looks at him with Blue. Fuckng. Eyes.

Timestamp 1:11. Watched the scene on my 3 different monitors to make sure.

Amazing. So much wrong with the books *and* the movies, but they couldn't even get this basic bitch fact that was emphasized over and over, in what was one of the final and most important scenes from the book.

Sorry for the rant, I'm sure this is nothing new. I just needed to vent after seeing this waste of time and money for the first time.


** Are you complaining about Harry having blue eyes, or Harry's eyes not matching Lily's? The older Lily actress from PS's Mirror of Erised has blue eyes, while the child Lily in Snape's memories had brown eyes. Daniel Radcliffe himself has blue eyes, and when they tried to give him color contacts to make them green, they found out he was allergic to them.

Just consider the movies as a fanfiction of the books if you want to stay sane. They're as canon as the video game tie-ins. And hey, at least HP's movie adaptation isn't as disgusting as Avatar the Last Airbender's. Or Eragon's.

And at least OotP's Voldemort possession scene gave us [[https://i.redd.it/62pnknxksml01.jpg][/this/ glorious still frame]]. If you pause at the right moment, you'll see it. Best moment of the film.

*** And the video games gave us such glorious lines as:

Ron in CoS (At like 12 PM after /just watching/ a game of Quidditch): That was exhausting! I'm going to bed!

Ron in Goblet of Fire PC: A bean! (Said while running for their lives and dueling Death Eaters)

Oh, and HBP the video game is self aware. Seriously, go watch a let's play of those, preferably CallmeKevin's, they're beautiful.

** The movies are not great, but I feel like most people dislike them for their depiction of their favourite or least favourite characters.

I know half this sub hates them for what the directors did with Ron and Ginny. Honestly, I don't care about Ron. I am completely indifferent towards him. Ginny got the short end, but she was not a good character in the last two books either.

In comparison, my biggest gripe with the movies is that Snape and Malfoy come across as too likeable and are half the reason we have so much atrocious fics with them as the pairing. Which is definitely a rarer sentiment than the Weasley one.

However, even that is relatively minor compared to what I feel about the missing Shire scenes from Return of the King. The HP movies are not great, but other than the eye colour thing I never feel like they dropped the ball. Which is a lot more than you can say about many of the recent movies (Star Wars 7+8, anything with superheroes past Iron Man 1).

*** Honestly, the fact they left out the scouring of the shire made me sad. It's a perfect way of pointing out that even when you win a war and come home victorious there is still work to be done. Just because you kill the bad guy doesn't mean that all corruption and horror is suddenly gone with him.

*** I just want to let you know that, despite having written many, many words of Draco in romantic pairings, I haven't even seen the movies past the third. I just like writing about horrible people. Do TRY not to assume everyone who writes about the villains has a secret yen for the actor. Some probably (ok, surely) do, but lots of us don't.

At least you acknowledge that. Most of my forays into Malfoy-centric stories (sorting by favourites) ended with closed tabs after the authors either make him an angel who cannot do wrong or go down the "Death Eaters did nothing wrong" route.

***** The "Death eaters did nothing wrong" only works if the author creates a heavily AU story and makes that clear, where A) the leader isn't a sadistic megalomaniac, B) there's a legitimate ideological goal beyond "be evil for the sake of it", C) there's an ideological goal that is supported by some evidence or rational argument, and D) that goal doesn't directly necessitate murder for the sake of murder, or evil for the sake of evil.

I've yet to read a fic where this is actually pulled off. Sometimes Voldemort isn't actually that insane, or sometimes there's a half-assed rationalization of why they believe the things they do... But it's always followed by "muggles are inferior, they are animals, it's fine to torture and murder them, as well as anyone who opposes this".

Which is, quite frankly, absolutely ridiculous. That mentality is fine for a line villain, but a for a half-way popular group with support of regular members of society? Absolutely ridiculous.

Those are not mutually exclusive. I mean, just look at the NSDAP or Stalin's government. Both of these had widespread support. As did Mao. I mean, it does not make them the good guys, but they certainly weren't just evil villains hiding in the shadows.

******* Yeah it is. As much as we can look back at what happened with communist Russia or Nazi Germany in hindsight, the support of the people and those positions of power weren't gained by a platform of nearly indiscriminate murder. Even when Hitler was making his speeches about the Jews, he was talking about facts and things that the common German mostly agreed with, like the fact that Jews were vastly overrepresented in areas of life that Germans either A) wanted for themselves or B) considered degenerate.

Even up until and after the start of WWII, despite all the anti-Semitic rhetoric and propoganda, there still wasn't open talk of genocide, and Hitler never issues any such public order.

Same goes for Stalin, although his purges were much less focused on any group, and were much more arbitrary.

Point is, if either of them tried to ascend to power on an open platform of murder, the wouldn't have gotten anywhere near where they did.

******** Mein Kampf was pretty open about Hitler's goals. As was his goals of waging war again (Lebensraum and overturning Versailles). He still got elected, probably because most people didn't think he'd actually follow up (and because they didn't entirely understand what he was ranting about).

Also, he openly attempted a violent takeover and most people did not hold it against him later on. The judges certainly didn't.

********* There's a marked difference between what was said in Mein Kampf, and what many people seem to think was written in Mein Kampf. Hitler was open in what he wanted, he never said how exactly he wanted to achieve that - and I believe that something like the Holocaust was not a foundational idea.

********** The Holocaust was not intended to happen, the original idea was to simply deport all Jews far away. The Holocaust happened because the war did not allow for "safe" deportations. But the war on a European (and therefore global) scale was always part of the plan unless the Allies would miraculously agree to drop Versailles and restore Brest Litowsk.

*********** Yes, this is generally true, I would add that supplies of all nature were also becoming increasingly scarce for Germany, so the conditions for everyone in the camps - not just Jews - took a steep dive, so to speak.

On the lebensraum and expansion - much of this has been misunderstood, the intent was to reclaim traditionally German lands lost under the treaty of Versailles. Hitler's main ambitions of expansion were geared towards the east, which is why a conflict between the USSR and Nazi Germany was almost inevitable. From what I've read, Hitler didn't actually anticipate England entering the war and setting off that chain of reactions. For all he was, he wasn't an idiot - one country can't fight off half the world.

Going back to the original point, I hardly think that people would have such an opposition to the "Death Eaters" if all they did was deport muggleborns to France, for example. Hell, that's kind of what the British did to their undesirables with the penal colonies in Australia.

*** Eh, to be fair, I developed an intense dislike for the books after probably my first million words of fanfiction, so I don't have any particular attachment to them.

So to that end, I was more evaluating the movie as an adaptation first, and its own work second.

That being said, I did have a good mental picture of the characters from the ridiculous number of words I've read in this fandom over the last decade, so yeah, not everything was as it should be :/
