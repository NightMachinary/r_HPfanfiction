Someone requested a fic like this a week or so ago but the only response was a list of threads about Harry being a professor to other people. Looking specifically for fics where an older Harry either time travels or hops dimensions either intentionally or unintentionally and ends up mentoring Harry or becomes a Hogwarts professor.

I've read a few of these and I'm craving for more. Thanks!


** Linkao3(23702959), is on my to-read list, so I don't how good it is, but according to its summary, it is what you are asking for.

  Finding himself in another universe, Harry makes the perfectly logical choice and adopts his younger self, destroys this world's leftover Voldie pieces, and tries his best to avoid happy goblins.

  Harry and several others he knew ingested love potions; great---he could deal with that. But knowing that he found this out before and the people he trusted erased his memory and sent him back in time to relive his worst nightmare, again and again?

  Certain that he'd been about to die, Harry is mystified to find himself alive and healthy, and somehow in 1981. Disillusioned to Dumbledore's meddling in his life, when he discovers his fifteen-month-old self in a basket on the Dursleys' doorstep, Harry does the only thing he can. He takes the child with him.WARNING: This story is a W.I.P. It is not finished. It may never be finished. Updates will be sporadic. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
