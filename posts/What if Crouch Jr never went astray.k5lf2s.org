We know he was very smart, which makes me wonder what he could've done with his life if he never joined the Death Eaters.


** He would probably be just like his father. Ruthless, cruel, extremely powerful, and fervently against the Dark Arts.

*** I think he would be far more charming then his father though

so he would be insanely popular.

i imagine if he had not become a death eater, by the time of the second wizarding war he would be one of the candidates for war time minister

** I enjoy his portrayal in yesterday is tomorrow (everything is connected).

He has this manic energy, an intense dislike for his Father and a HARD loyalty to our protagonist. You can see him becoming a Death Eater, if the protagonist wasn't involved.

** To be honest, we don't see much of Barty Crouch Jr at all, except as Moody - which was actually great acting skills, there's almost no difference between real Moody and fake Moody. [None that i noticed]

He would have been either a secret dark wizard or a powerful politician at the Ministry. He has the skills to do both of them.

+He would be a great actor.+

** I've always wondered if he was manic before the Death Eaters/Azkaban or if he was creepy even at Hogwarts. Like those kids you make jokes about shooting up the school.

** Without Crouch Jr being captured as a Death Eater, his father likely becomes Minister eventually. Also of course (if nothing changes until then) the plot to resurrect Voldemort will not work.
