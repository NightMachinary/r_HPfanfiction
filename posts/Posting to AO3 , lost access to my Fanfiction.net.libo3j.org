Moved over to AO3 I lost my fanfiction account because of troubles with my email, feel like an idiot for it, anyway .. I am very excited as I started to rewrite this story because of a very kind comment a reader left

I've got a much better sense of where I want to take this story and if you like Witcher related things I will be integrating things from that series as well.
