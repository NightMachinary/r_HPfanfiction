  In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

** This is one of, if not the, best fanfics I've ever read. It's really beautifully written, got a great story, amazing characterization of Harry and Hermione, and it plays with your emotions. Harry and Hermione are the two main characters but it's not Harry/Hermione, it's pretty gen.

Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour."

** I also love time/dimension travel fics. Here are a bunch of my favorites.

Three's the Charm-Time Travel fic. It's the end of the Battle of Hogwarts but the price has been high. The Golden Trio dearly wished that they could have done more to save lives and fate decides to grant their wish. Follow the Golden Trio as they redo their years at Hogwarts, starting from First year and work to make a difference in the wizarding world. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8326928/1/Three-s-The-Charm]]

Delenda Est- Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est]]

And its sequel, Para Bellum- An ambitious Voldemort prepares to lead his armies into the Delenda Est dimension to topple Minister Black III. But, he has lost the element of surprise, and there is a Pre-OotP dimension in between his dimension and the DE dimension where he will have to fight Minister Black's armies, spies, and civilian meddlers, not to mention two Harry Potters and the infamous Black Triplets.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum]]

C'est La Vie- A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie]]

Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past -The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past]]

Timely Errors -Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4198643/1/Timely-Errors]]

Across the Universe- Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4180686/1/Across-the-Universe]]

Also, there's this list. I think a bunch of them are slash though. [[http://blinded-hp.livejournal.com/5314.html]]

**** Okay, then.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The-Moment-It-Began][The Moment It Began]] has to be the most well thought out and awesome Harry Potter time travel story I have ever read. Not Slash but still beautiful.

Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters.

Next is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2427084/2/The-Abuse-in-a-Violently-Different-Dimension][The Abuse in a Violently Different Dimension]]. It's been some time since I've read this one but it is more or less regularly updated (about twice a year) and all around enjoyable.

After finding out yet another secret that has been kept from him, Harry blows up Dumbledore's office only to find himself -how clich√©- in an Alternate Dimension where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. AU & Slash.

Then there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6820445/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Phoenix-Burning][Harry Potter and The Phoenix Burning]]. Where Harry goes back in time after DH and gets adopted by James' Parents. I just finished it a few weeks ago. It's really quite beautiful.

Harry dies at the same time as Voldemort when the killing curse backfires the second time and is sent back to Kings cross station. Now however Fawkes meets him there and sends him somewhere all together different than the Hogwarts he knows.

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5921269/1/Hanging-by-a-Thread][Hanging by a Thread]] and the sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5926398/1/Dust-in-the-Sky][Dust in the sky]]. These are crossovers with Dr. Who, slash and slightly anti!Ginny but also (mostly) canon compliant.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7683642/1/To-Recollect-the-Future][To Recollect the Future]]. I don't remember much about this one TBH, but it's in my favs so I must have liked it at some point.

Hindsight is 20/20, but when Harry's last steps into the forest set him back further than he'd ever thought, he never realised how grateful he'd be to have Snape there to help too. Mentor/guardian fic, time travel, but not cliched.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6953581/1/Continuing-the-Cycle][Continuing the Cycle]] is rather dark. A crossover with Naruto and one of my favourite fanfictions of all time.

Harry thought he would die; had anticipated it, even. So now what will he do in this new world, one without magic? Not to say that there isn't power lurking here... With snakes calling him 'Lord', and everyone else saying 'Abomination', is it any surprise that he's not going to have an easy time settling down? Subtle HP AU. Eventual Naruto AU. Slow paced.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8884893/1/Transliterations][Transliterations]] is a bit of all three. Dimension travel, time travel and crossover. With the Avengers. Where not Odin but Harry adopts Loki.

He had attained the rights to be the Master of Death, and it was his obligation to steer the fates away from destruction whilst she reaped the souls to fuel Life. (Rewrite of Rewrite. Pun intended.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9348546/1/Ink-Stains][Ink Stains]]. Descripion says all.

In which Harry was sealed inside Tom Riddle's diary during his second year and tossed into another world, upon where he finds himself in Bruce Banner's lonely hands. With the life Banner leads, he supposes that he shouldn't be surprised by this "Harry Potter" kid somehow sealed in a "magical" diary. Besides, what's better than having a friend that can fit in your pocket? NO SLASH.
