The topic of House-Elves is a multifaceted one, with a lot of nuance to it.

- In canon, House-Elves are somehow bound to serve a family, possibly even automatically upon birth. The act of giving one clothing to own, most likely as a symbol of independence to the elf, frees them from this binding.

- They are also bound/conditioned through magic to keep their master's secrets, follow their orders and protect them from harm. Their magic is different from wizards, and can bypass things like the hogwarts anti-apparition field.

- Once freed, some fall into a deep depression for various reasons (winky, despite working at Hogwarts, still longed for a family) or thrive (dobby).

This paints a bleak picture, to be sure. Conditioned slaves who want to be enslaved and violently protest being freed. Any resistance bred out of them through the ages, molding them into perfectly subservient beings.

In fanon, this problem is often "solved" through saying that they need to be enslaved, or else they will wither away and disappear. While a neat "solution" to the problem, it isn't really as "well the ethics don't matter then" as many people believe, because a situation like that isn't natural.

Symbiosis exists, yes, like with mitochondria and cells, or certain kinds of moss, but not as strange as the house-elves are often said to be. Symbiosis means both benefit and become more, not that one benefits and the other dies if they're not in it, that wraps back around to dependency and slavery.

Furthermore, a situation like that doesn't just arise naturally, and the ritualistic act of giving clothing to free an elf reeks of foreign magic to accomplish the enslavement. Some sort of curse or spell that passes itself down through the blood, causing this slave-bond to be formed. The clothing is a failsafe, a way for the human to get out of the spell if it goes wrong.

Now, we get to the aspect that most concerns our community.

Elven slavery is wrong, and it is unnecessary. The neat solution most fics employ is poorly thought out and uncharacteristic most of the time, and outright "justification of american slavery" level apologetics.

I can count the fics where someone even attempts to research this bond on one hand, and know of only one single one where it's actually removed.

Justifying slavery in our community is an abhorrent thing to do, regardless of what justifications you come up with. Dobby's entire character is destroyed if you bind him to Harry, and solving Winky's situation like that is like giving an alcoholic in withdrawal a bottle of vodka so the pain goes away.


** imagine if the elves were a hivemind playing the long game, in which the contract between the elf and wizard results in the parasitism of magic from the wizard, and upon the wizards death, their magic get taken for the use of the elves. and not knowing how long the elven lifespan is and how easy it would be to fake a death with magic, coupled with the fact that wizards pay almost no attention to the elves...

** Part of it is that house-elves are based on brownies from folklore, small fae that would do odd jobs like mending shoes or whatever, but they'd get insulted and leave if you tried to actually pay them.

My take when writing house-elves is that they're not human, and therefore think and feel differently from humans. Their values and thought processes are alien to us, though thankfully not to the degree of some of the less benevolent fae. Doing work, being helpful and productive, and especially taking care of someone else is what makes them happiest and proudest. They'd respond to being paid for their work the same way a loving grandparent would respond to being paid for showing love to their grandchildren - confused and insulted. Getting clothes is like a combination of being fired and divorced/disowned; elves like Dobby who were miserable and abused beforehand are happy about it, but those who still loved their family like Winky are heartbroken.

Humans perceive this relationship as slavery, but to the elves it's familial. Some families are dysfunctional or abusive, but we don't condemn all marriage and childrearing because of this.

How is this not classic symbiosis? One benefits from the work, and the other benefits by being able to survive.

Now, I will fully agree with you that this probably isn't /natural/ symbiosis. By all evidence we currently have, this is totally synthetic, and it's horrific.

That said, that's the original conditions. The current situation is bad, but potentially not quite as horrific.

Trying to draw neat parallels to the European slave trade is cute and all, but unlike actual historical slavery, where we were using other human beings, so far was we can tell, House Elves aren't human, or human based. Trying to apply human morals to a culture that aren't biologically human is asking for trouble. This is a classic [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality][blue and orange morality]] situation.

That said, House Elf morality shouldn't change how the human acts, and the Dobby/Malfoy situation was clearly evil, and the Winky/Crouch situation was cruel. The Charles Napiere quote on customs applies here. Assuming that the house elves actually want whatever bond/relationship/whatever that they have with their master or family, the human has the moral prerogative to treat the elf with dignity, and respect.

On the other hand, if all house elves are secretly deep down jealous of Dobby, and want to be free, /then they totally should be/, and this discussion is moot.

That said, there is room in the source material for both interpretations, and it is up to the author and their worldbuilding to decide which way they should go.

** In my opinion the best handling I've seen for House Elves is that they used to be a brownie like creature that enjoys helping people and taking care of them. I usually like a partial symbiosis explanation where they live off the ambient magic of an area. Original brownie elves lived in magic forests like the Black Forest and would leave to do odd jobs for nearby humans at night.

Humans are dicks though and saw something they could take advantage of, offering the brownie elves a magical home to live in and as many chores and little tasks to take care of as they wanted. As long as they agreed to a little magical contract. Some sort of blood magic that bound the race to humans, enslaving them.

Slavery is bad. Full stop. Hermione's heart is in the right place but she needs to account for centuries of conditioning and possibly magical affects of the contract that make house elves fear freedom. If cleaning and fixing and doing little tasks is what a house elf wants to do, it is their joy and basically their reason to exist, then they will obviously not want to lose that.

Now imagine that they live in a society where freed house elves are "bad" house elves, and no wizard will take them in for them to do what they want, and they have forgotten what they used to be, they don't even realize that they can do what they want without being bonded to a human. It explains their reactions to clothes. It explains their reaction to Hermione. But it doesnt mean that keeping the status quo is right. Hermione needs to start by helping unbreakable their spirits and realizing that there is another way.

** I completely agree with you - I find that the 'lesson' people take from the whole house-elf setup in canon is terrible (ie, that they're happy being enslaved and should just be treated a little better and it'll be perfect :) ), and fanfics take that and dial it up to a hundred - usually as a way to power up Harry, or to just insert him into wizarding culture as it exists without much critical thought towards the elves.

To me, the whole situation reeks of some ancient spell /forcing/ this bond, like you say - and then reinforced through centuries of slavery and conditioning until it seems natural to all involved.

The magical world treats non-humans horribly - and canon, with its (politically) milquetoast ending on the subject, seems to not have a problem with it. I'd love to read more stories where there's a long, hard look at the issues of slavery, species-ism, and all the other discrimination we see in the WW - and getting rid of them. The only one I see usually discussed like that is the issue of muggleborn, because we see that up and center in the narrative with Hermione and partly with Harry (halfblood) - and because they're human.

** I guess it's the typical philosophical question whether it is worth it to sacrifice the freedom of choice for ultimate happiness.

In this case, you have (barring Dobby, who is consistently shown as an insane exception) happy elves with families serving as essentially slaves but being happy about it

Or you could theoretically free them from the slavery, thus ending their servitude at the cost of their happiness

*** This would make more sense, but you'd have to change up their mechanics somewhat.

For instance, you'd have to make them choose a house to bind themselves to. They're some sort of spirit until they choose a building, manifest, and begin to take care of it.

The elves bound to actual people, then, could be the ones enslaved and freed by clothing, but not the actual house-elves. Make it a part of the dark arts to force an elven spirit into personal servitude, and you've created a handy divide between house-elves and enslaved elves.

** Two out of three elf named characters we see (Kreacher, Dobby, Winky) are extremely unhappy serving their masters. Kreacher might be conditioned to believe that house-elves' place is to serve, but he hates his own master's (Sirius's) guts, tries to find any loophole possible to circumvent his orders and eventually willfully contributes to Sirius being killed. And he doesn't even feel compelled to punish himself for it like Dobby.

Just because some slaves are ok with slavery, it doesn't mean slavery is ok. House-elves are conditioned to believe it's the right order of things, because of course they are. Wizards are benefiting from it and don't want to give up free slave labour.

** This concept in cannon bothered me for a long time until I thought of the analogy of pets, especially ones you can train for tricks or work, like dogs or horses. There are abusive pet owners who should not own pets, and it should be easier and quicker to get the pets away from them, but the vast majority of people would think it was excessive and even cruel to force dogs away from their homes in the interest of freeing them. The equivalent of “giving clothes” is difficult in the analogy, b/c the closest thing I can think of is removing a fence and/or collar. If we did that, I think most dogs would act like Winky and cry at the back door to be let back in. Unfortunately, even some pets that had been neglected or mistreated may act like that. Some dogs might happily chase squirrels away from the house, but then only a tiny population would be happy to be lost and out of the house when it rains or is cold or their dinner bowl isn't filled.

That said, house elves seem to be more self-sufficient, like cats, and I believe more pet cats would be able to survive if kicked out. Some dogs (or other pets) would too, and be like Dobby, reveling in their freedom. It's probably an interaction between level of domestication, level of self-sufficiency, and level of care from the owning family that determines the morality of keeping another species dependent on you.

There are more aspects of the analogy that I could extend or describe as exceptions, but I didn't want to make this too long. Ultimately, we don't know from cannon if any justification actually applies, so I think it makes sense that this makes us (and Hermione) so uncomfortable.

******** It really depends on your characters. I mean, in my exemple, for gryffindorks, killing is a no-no, so it is really out of character for them to avada anyone. But put them in a situation where they have no choice, kill or being killed, and then write about how they manage to move on with their choice, and see how it affect them, is not out if character of you do this right. I could see Molly kill to save her children, Pansy wouldn't blink and wouldn't need any reasons, but Ron would have to be in a very desperate situation, or really pissed off, for exemple.

For me elven slavery is just like miss treating muggleborn. You know it's wrong. Muggles and muggleborns knows it's wrong. But for someone who have lived in the magic world for several generation, was taught that elves are born to serve and can die if you cast them out of your house, and have never had any reason to question this choice... It might not seem wrong. And that person has the laws on his side. Laws can be unfair. Laws can be change. It depends on your story.

Back to the subject, I would say that for exemple, in my headcannon, Kreatur serving Harry is not slavery, it's more like that little kid you adopted, that wants to make you happy by preparing your breakfast each morning to thank you for saving him, he is happy to serve and Harry is happy to treat him with respect. Plus Kreatur is old and have never done anything but leave that way, and Merlin knows how it can be hard to change old people habits or opinions. But again, Pansy wouldn't hesitate to treat an elf like a servant. And the law is on her side,

It really depends on your story, like I said. Not everybody wants to make a political statement out of their fics. Not everybody wants to think of every aspects of the political lore and social customs of the world they are creating in their fics. And it's ok.

And don't forget that Hermione was muggleborn so this particular cultural reality came as a shock to her. And she didn't even go about it the right way if u ask me. She forced her beliefs on everyone, tried to forcibly free house elves by leaving concealed clothing all over the place, which in turn caused them to despise her and refuse to even clean the Gryffindor tower, let alone listen to anything she had to say. Constantly dismissed Winky's emotional state by assuming it was all a consequence of being brain washed and not considered that regardless of being dismissed by mr. Crouch, Winky still saw him as her master because she genuinely cared about him after all the years they've spent together and especially because he trusted her with his darkest secret. If she had not taken such an aggressive approach, she'd probably achieve more and sooner. Rowling used the concept of slavery in her story very well imo, furthering the plot while also raising the moral question. It's not about what you write, it's about your execution. But to assume or even suggest that a person is a supporter of such things in real life based on the concepts they are willing to use in fiction is not only wrong, it's straight up rude.

******** It's firmly in the territory of fridge horror. You can't even use the excuse that people raised in the Wizarding world are so used to slavery that they do not understand the objection, because there are a /lot/ of muggleborn students at Hogwarts who spend eleven years in a culture where slavery is considered evil, and we don't see them flocking to the banner of abolitionism. What about the parents of muggleborn kids? What about previous generations of muggleborns who preserve some ties to mundane Britain? What about people who navigate both worlds?

There isn't even an abolitionist movement on the fringes of Wizarding politics, not even one made up entirely of muggleborns. Taken to the logical conclusion I can only assume insane circumstances like the Wizarding world magically brainwashing everyone who comes into contact with it to accept slavery, or that anyone who objects too strongly is thrown out and obliviated.

** Okay first. Using something in a story does not mean you endorse it. Do people who write fiction about Alien invasions or Nuclear holocaust endorse mass genocide?

Next I'd look at this from a story perspective. Surprise surprise. Why would wizards potentially bind elves to their families? Well, the typical answer that I've seen is one of two. Neither one which I have much of an issue with overall.

1. The elves tried to kill them at some undetermined time in the past, and the wizards upon winning bound Elves to their families and made them into commodities with a forced symbiosis. Basically, the symbiosis is because without it they'd not have magic anymore and slowly die.
2. The Elves did a big bad magic that ruined them and their magic. Causing them to after a while seek out wizards to bind themselves to when they realised that they were losing magical energy faster than they could recoup it.

** Unless the Elvish slavery is the punishment for some kind of massacre/ethnic cleansing or similar, it is wrong. If it is a punishment, it would fit right into the judicial beliefs of a world where thiefs are starved to death by the bank and the Minister of magic can carry out summary executions without consequences. So at least from a thematic point of view, house elves could fit the HP universe even as slaves. It would simply be a life sentence with forced labour. After all, we don't even know if House Elves reproduce or if they were enslaved at some point and slowly die out. The books give us no information on their background. Nothing at all. For all we know, Dobby could have singlehandedly slaughtered three villages, as unlikely as that'd be.

Now, if they were enslaved in the more "traditional" manner (after being conquered by someone), out of debt or as punishment for a just action, freeing them would be the right thing to do. They could still stay at their families, but would have the ability to leave if they wanted to. To paraphrase a French philosopher, slavery is not a state which benefits the slave and is therefore evil by default. A slave gains nothing from their state but loses everything because they can't quit at will.

Honestly, House Elves are a can of worms which is better not touched because slavery is quite problematic as no one but Hermione seems to be worried about it, painting a bleak picture about the morality of the HP world.

Gonna disagree right here purely on the basis that you can't punish a child for the sins of its parents. Even if the elven ancestors were punished with enslavement, continuing said enslavement through the generations to innocent descendants is abhorrent. (edit, just read the rest of this - That could honestly have happened, but I doubt that house elven genocide would be something that's just brushed off. And considering the "punishments" levied on offending races by the wizards, enslavement seems unlikely)

And I'd agree here. dealing with House Elven slavery is an area that requires a lot of thought, and a specific kind of fic. For example, I can understand why it's not addressed in canon, it just wouldn't have fit thematically, but a fic that's about the protagonist slowly reforming the world politically definitely needs to deal with it, otherwise they're either a hypocrite or disingenuous.

In any case, I wrote this post mostly out of disdain for the "house elves need wizard magic so slavery is totally ok" trope that's used to justify harry 1-upping hermione/harry getting an army of house elves without needing to worry about the implications. I really dislike both of these justifications - the first implies that Hermione wouldn't totally read literally everything available on house elves immediately after learning of their enslavement (which is what she would do, and apparently that information is known to every 'pureblood' (god I hate that term), so it would be mentioned somewhere; the second is ever so slightly baffling to me, seeing as how it's often used as a justification for Harry bonding Dobby, which not only destroys his major character arc but could also just have been accomplished by Harry asking him.

Like, if you write a fic about Harry leaving the wizarding world behind and flying off in a Goa'uld Tel'tac he found crashed in the woods and restored and want Dobby as a sidekick character, would you really believe that Dobby wouldn't be /fucking thrilled/ to go on an adventure with Harry?

**** You misunderstood the first part. We don't know how fast the House Elves age. For all we know, their average life expectancy is 500 and those in slavery are there as part of their punishment from 300 years ago. Maybe their "curse" even prolongs their life unnaturally so that they can toil longer.

And yeah, pureblood centric fics have many issues ranging from indifference towards genocide to slavery.

Which is /exactly/ what Hermione did in Goblet of Fire when she learned that Hogwarts also used house elves. She spent several days at the start of the year eating as fast as she could at meals and then researching in the library. And based on that information, she founded SPEW.

** Well, the most similar mythological being to a Potterverse house-elf is a /Nissi./ Some Norse spirits that appear around your house and exist only to maintain it. They are just house-elves by different names, but they can get really annoyed if they see the owner doesn't actually put effort into maintaining the house, and they then leave. I think you also leave treats around the house for them on Yule.

​

It's a personal choice if you want to have your worldbuilding go with the literally slave race that spawns into existence only to obey a household or if you go with a mighty fallen race that got enslaved by wizards. They are /not/ humans. It's possible that their very purpose in apparating to life/being bred is servitude. If that's the case, you'd have to genetically/ritually re-engineer them so much in order to free them that they may as well no longer be called House-elves.

​

Point is, the canon makes no actual reference whatsoever. I'd say it tacitly leans towards the Nissi-link, but that's just me.
