** There is of course /Harry Potter and the Distaff Side/, where everybody (except Luna) gets turned into the opposite gender, but perhaps that's not what you're looking for...

** Draca Malfoy (Malfoy as a girl) would be more different. It would probably change the book.

Draco was a target because he was making himself sound like a death eater. Draco also was telling everyone his family was all in Slyeryn. He took advantage of other people, like Crabbe and Goyle. Draco was on a broomstick, all the time, apparently.

But... Draca(or whatever name)might not be too open to broadcast all of that plus Hermione never road a broomstick and not most girls did ride. So if she doesn't ride, Harry wouldn't be Seeker

To sum it up, Draco being a girl would ruin the book. GOOD BYE DRACA!!
