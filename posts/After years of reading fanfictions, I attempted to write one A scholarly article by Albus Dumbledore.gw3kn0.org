Albus Dumbledore is always referred to as a scholar. So I have attempted to write a story about how an article by him would look like.

No beta read is done. And English is not my first language. So please pardon my mistakes.

Feedbacks appreciated!

** You need a Beta, that's for sure. Also, I think the references to the many other wizards and witches is a bit too much. Have Dumbledore recount his own experiences along the course of his lifetime. Instances where he used transfiguration in his duel with Grindelwald can be mentioned.

*** Clearly you haven't read many academic papers. Overall, I'd say that the primary deficiency is formatting and references.
