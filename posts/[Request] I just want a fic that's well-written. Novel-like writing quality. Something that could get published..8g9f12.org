I don't think I'll ever stop recommending this one. Its a Harry Potter Venetian AU that somehow, someway is absolutely believable. The writing hits on your last paragraph completely. The quality of writing is in my opinion at the very least well written. Enjoy!

** Denarian Renegade is a low bar for writing quality. And while using "publishable quality" as a shorthand for good writing and all that it entails, being published is by no means a mark of quality. The fandom boasts some very talented writers (joe6991, Newcomb, Taure, Swimdraconian) and professionals have published some truly atrocious things. If you put a gun to my head and told me to say who imo has better prose between say, joe6991 (present day Joe, not Wastelands Joe from 8 years ago) and Brandon Sanderson who is pretty much the second biggest name in genre fiction today after GRRM, I'm gonna say Joe.

Perhaps not "publishable" like they are, but I'd still group Shezza with those writers when recommending well-written fics.

Edit: I see what you mean here. The "all other things held equal" doesn't really work without parsing the entire fic.

In that case, there's a more subjective measure to be had - if the first chapter of a fic is terrible, then it in a sense lowers the quality of the whole work, not just the first chapter. Consistency in writing quality is an important factor and a terrible first chapter is an entirely valid reason to disregard a work.

I won't argue that. This is absolutely true.

#+begin_quote
  Nah, you're arguing semantics
#+end_quote

I'm not. I find faults in you reasoning and I point them out to you. Now I'm no perfect so I could be wrong, but saying I'm arguing semantic is wrong.

#+begin_quote
  and completely missing the point here. Substitute "perfect" with "good" and the analogy works in the same exact manner.
#+end_quote

That's not true. You can do better than good, you can't do better than perfect.

#+begin_quote
  Such a concept can also be expressed equally clearly with mathematics; the first chapters of each fic perform at 9/10 and 1/10 respectively. All other things held equal, the former is objectively going to be a better fic.
#+end_quote

What you miss is that things are nowhere near as clear cut in literature as they are in mathematics. You're never going to be able to fairly rate a fic that way, because you're never going to be really objective. Especially not if you liked one fic and not the other.\\
And even less so if you have only read one chapter of one of the fics. Then, one can wonder on what criteria you're basing yourself to compare both fics.

Depending on the criteria you choose you can perfectly reach one conclusion or the other. 'I had more fun reading Fic A so it's better' and 'Fic B is better written and heve more description so it's better' are both valid criteria to base your judgement on.

Here, your apparent criteria is 'first chapter of fic B isn't as good as fic A, so fic A is better'. This isn't really serious.

I don't doubt that you have better arguments to back up your claims, but this is the fundamental issue of your reasoning.

Now, as I said before, if fic A was objectively perfect, it would work. Then again, if fic A was objectively perfect, why would you bother reading anything else besides? Fic A would already contain the best possible and only that, no other fic could bring you anything more (otherwise your fic wouln't be perfect in the first place).

Edit: I didn't see your edit. That's the point exactly. And indeed, if the fic was perfect, the point would be moot. All that being said, that the first chapter of a fic is terrible is a pretty good reason to drop it in my opinion.

** linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds by Seselt) fits rather well, even though the author somewhat flaunts the vocabulary (but that may be a net positive, considering).

** linkffn(Forbidden by Savageland)

One of the neatest AUs I've read -- has a lot of really cool mythology stuff going on, and the attention to detail is great. The pairing is SS/HG.

  Ten years after Harry Potter defeated Voldemort, the Wizarding World seems safe: until two Hogwarts students disappear without a trace in the Forbidden Forest. Strangely linked to this incident is Severus Snape, who died in the Shrieking Shack. Or did he? When Hermione Granger is pulled into the investigation, she discovers the unimaginably dangerous truth. Complete.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
