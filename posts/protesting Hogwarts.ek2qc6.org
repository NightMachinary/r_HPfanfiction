This is sweet delicious crack. It starts with Harry, then Ron and Hermione are infected. Then goes down the twins. And then the avalanche really starts there. By the end of the fic, three out of four houses (just guess which...) are sitting in their common room watching their new magical television of their ongoing pranks against the staff.

Staff bashing? Adult bashing? There's bashing going on, but it's creative for the choice.

Also, how they got rid of Voldemort was gold.

** It's an interesting concept I've not come across before. That fic you linked is horrifically written though...
