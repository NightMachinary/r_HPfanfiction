Are there any?

Can be any character, doesn't have to be Harry.

****** It's nearly impossible to write such a fic in the HP universe because magic removes the "struggle". Polyjuice is a thing, as is human transfiguration and metamorphmagi. While not something taught in the first year, someone of McGonagall's calibre would be able to turn your cock into a cunt within seconds and give you a nice rack free of charge (or the other way around). While not a 100% conversion (as you don't alter DNA), it would still be a lot better and faster than what medicine can do today.

There might be some social stigma, but honestly, after winning the second war against Voldemort basically singlehandedly, neither Harry nor Hermione would care about such trivialties since rude remarks are nothing compared to actual magical Nazis enacting the Holocaust 2.0. Tonks can already shift her sex (if you can do a pig nose you can do a cock as well), no one would care what Luna does, there are already five/six Weasley boys so no one will notice one more or less and every other women is so underdeveloped you might as well call them OC in fanfiction.

******* If you write it that way of course it isn't a struggle. But that doesn't change the character's mental struggle and their process of affirming their gender identity.

Polyjuice isn't permanent. Metamophmagi are rare. Human transfiguration is difficult, and if you want to make it more difficult, explain you need to understand the biology of what you're transforming in order to have your new body part working perfectly.

Harry, Hermione, Tonks, and the Weasleys aren't the only characters. Any traditionalist can be reasonably written to not be accepting, and people do care about what Luna does, considering she was bullied.

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.

  Growing up as the middle child of war heroes is already hard enough as it is. How much harder can it be when everyone seems to think that you're a little girl? That's what the second-born child of Neville and Hannah Longbottom asks all the time, as he's the only one that knows the truth: he's a boy, no matter what everyone else tells him. He is Dean Longbottom. This is his story.
