I was wondering if the Chudley Cannons reputation as the worst Quidditch Team ever (as in never won a match in at least 50 years worst) was truly canon or just some fanon fic that caught on.

The only mention of the canon I remember from canon is from CoS where Ron tells Harry that they are something like 9th of their league. Which is pretty bad but not stuff of the legend bad. So I was wondering if I forgot others?


** Ron mentions that Dragomir Gorgovitch, who transferred to the team for a record fee, holds the record for most Quaffle drops in a season.

Dumbledore, when he asks Snape to kill him, says "death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley cannons will end up bottom of this year's league".

*** When your team is so bad, that even otherwise not much sport obsessed Dumbledore uses them as a proverb, it is bad.

  The Chudley Cannons' glory days may be considered by many to be over, but their devoted fans live in hope of a renaissance. The Cannons have won the League twenty-one times, but the last time they did so was in 1892 and their performance over the last century has been lacklustre. The Chudley Cannons wear robes of bright orange emblazoned with a speeding cannon ball and a double “C” in black. The club motto was changed in 1972 from “We shall conquer” to “Let's all just keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best.”

From "Quidditch Through the Ages". So i guess they are pretty bad.

** Well, what I heard was that the Cannons were playing the Bats and the Bats were leading 560 to 0.

That was when the Bat's Manager noticed that one of his reserve players had come down with Splattergoit and immediately quarantined his entire team.

Just 27 plays later, the Cannons scored.

*** Afterwards, the league commission decided to end the game. Bats won 570 to 0.

** From the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Chudley_Cannons][wiki]]: "J. K. Rowling, when asked if the Chudley Cannons would ever win a game, replied that 'they'd need to replace the entire team and down several cauldrons of Felix Felicis.'"

** Its my head canon that they're actually cursed like the defense position at Hogwarts was.

** They're ninth in a league that's 14 teams strong in book 2. That makes them lower mid-table.

Not nearly as bad as they're made out to be, but definitely an average team.
