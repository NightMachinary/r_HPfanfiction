linkffn(What Would Slytherin Harry Do? by Big D on a Diet)

I want to read more of the fic, but obviously that's all there is. So I'm looking for the next best thing; other fics like it.

The one thing I could do without is that bit about how he'll never be nearly as powerful as Dumbledore/Voldemort. I don't need him to be ready to 1v1 Voldemort by the time he's 16 or anything close to that, but Harry having way less total potential than them just bugs me. This isn't a strict requirement though. I'll take what I can get.

Any recommendations?

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five
