A few of them continue to operate outside the trunk as well, transporting it to new places to protect it and add plants and animals to its environment. Literal world-building.

Alternatively, Hermit!Harry tires of people worshiping him post-war so he builds an old-school wizard's tower in a trunk and moves there.

​

Just a strange idea that popped into my head while eating breakfast. I feel that the magic expanded trunk is often overused but underutilized. I'd like to see a fic where the trunk takes center stage, as opposed to being a shiny new toy mentioned in the obligatory shopping trip and then hardly ever mentioned again.

Note: I've already read the story where the DA find a spaceship with the room, D.S.S. Requirement I think its called? Also, I've read Seventh Horcrux, where Harrymort lives in a trunk.


** I can't remember the name of it, but there was a fic where pre-hogwarts Harry had an escapist dream of a fantasy world and documented it all in a notebook. Upon being taken to Diagon Alley by Hagrid, he loses the notebook and it's picked up by the various shopkeepers who collectively decide to build him this fantasy world inside an expanded trunk as thanks for saving them from Voldemort. The story almost entirely focused on the high jinks they got up to during its construction.

** I never understood why nobody ever goes the next step and disconnects this space from the outside world. As in, pocket dimension you apparate into and live inside of, which may be tied to the universe, but can't be accessed in any way except apparition or portkeys

*** Expanding off of this: how many wizards and witches have built entire self-sustaining worlds inside their expanded spaces and then fully and entirely cut it off from the outside world? As in even apparition and portkeys don't work because it's an entirely separate universe. Just setting off to be the gods of their own little realities.

And if that's possible, I wonder if it's possible to /reconnect/ to the universe at large after doing that. Perhaps you could use an expanded trunk space as a ship to sail between parallel timelines/universes/times. Rather than stories that go "magical accident, poof, Harry's in a new universe/timeline/whatever," you could have a story where the goal is to build a ship that could sail between spaces and times to do whatever.

BRB, my creative juices are flowing, gonna go write more on this...

***** Wrote a tiny little snippet because I got inspired by this.

--------------

The world had ended.

Muggles discovering magicals had been bad initially, but tensions had steadily risen until all-out war had broken out. And, as it turned out, magic itself hated its user being slaughtered in droves. The first war had resulted in so many muggleborns spontaneously appearing that, within two decades, the magical population of the world had /doubled,/ in sheer spite of the magical genocide.

The second round of the anti-magic war was even worse than the first. They saw us wizards as a pest, an infestation that had to be stamped out. They didn't understand that we didn't cause the surge in muggleborn births. They thought we were raping and impregnating their women. True, some of the most discpicable people in our culture did do that - I won't lie and say we didn't; we are only human - but the /vast/ majority of new wizards and witches were born precisely because the old bloodlines were being slaughtered.

They didn't care. The muggles rallied around the idea of us as an infection to be purged. The wars escalated. Technology and magical knowledge entered an arms race. Our best war mages grew ever more powerful while their war machines grew ever more resistant to magic. They trained countless soldiers. We learned how to magically clone ourselves with homunculi.

Then they dropped the nukes. London was lost. Much of the UK was glassed. But the worst came when the bombs started falling on our South American bretheren. One bomb, a little bit of feindfyre, and the largest semi-magical rainforest on the planet made for a disaster on a scale the world had never before seen. The ash blotted out the sun. Crops failed. People were starving. With so many people on this planet, even the magic we had could only go so far. We were going to die, and it was to be a cold, dark death.

Then came the Arks. An almost trivial modification to the spells we used to expand our luggage and our closets turned it into the greatest hope for humanity's survival. With it, we could leave this world, this doomed reality, and sail between time and space itself to reach distant worlds, paralel universes, or times in the far future or distant past.

Hermione Granger, the brightest witch of her age, became our hero overnight.

Prerations were made. Arks were constructed by the thousands. Spell inventors and Arithmancers worked together to craft the beacons, magical artifacts that would let us navigate the astral ocean of the multiverse and communicate with the other arks. Courses were plotted. Captains were selected. And as perhaps the last grain harvests ever on Earth were brought in, we made our final preparations.

With Ron Weasley, my first mate, by my side, I strapped myself into the chair at the helm of my Ark. It would take all my strength as a wizard and all my skill in flying to pilot us to safety, but if I had anything to say about it, the /Hope of Gryffindor/ would fly us all to the days before the beginning of the end. We swore we would stop this. We swore it would never happen again.

My name is Harry Potter, Captain of the /Hope of Gryffindor/ and leader of the Temporal Exodius. Today marks the end of the apocalypse that will never be.

****** (This was amazing, I hope you don't mind, but I continued it a little bit.)

There was a mighty rumble within the winding corridors of our Ark, as a set of engines that resembled a multi-dimensional crystal lattice more than a traditional rocket engine spun itself up for the first time outside a testing ground.

The last checks were called.

"Disassociator green!"

A work of art, that engine. Officially named the /Dimensional Disassociation and Temporal Disloaction Engine/, it was based on a fact on magic discovered only a few years prior. In essence, the lines of magic, leylines they are often called, which had previously been assumed to only exist on Earth, were proven to also expand into space. They connected our planet to all others, then to the Sun, and from there into a network linking all stars in the galaxy together. From the center of our galaxy, then, we theorized another step - linking our galaxy to the greater cosmos, and from there, all other universes in existence.

"Portus ready!"

Theoretically, the dimensional veil would take tremendous amounts of energy to breach. Such a thing had only happened once, in the distant past, at the site where the Ministry of magic had stood before the bomb had dropped on London.

"Life support?"

"Ready!"

Portkeys were the object which had found its place as the heart of our project. An ordinary portkey works by turning all passengers into a charge of magical energy and then flinging that charge along the Leylines toward its destination. The spinning sensation and rough landing was because magical humans had an awareness of magic, and the rough movement at impossible speeds through such an environment played havoc with their senses.

"Structural Integrity!"

"Holding!"

In our quest for escape, we'd researched safer methods, refining our portkeys to be much more efficient, and eventually, we'd arrived at the Disassociator Engine. It would turn our vessel into an intangible, paradoxical construct of magical energy, preserving space-time within, but being nothing but energy from without. This charge would then be flung first along the Lines of Earth, joining the Solar-System's Lines at Antarctica, and then flow into the Intragalactic mesh and barrel at ungodly speeds toward the Saggitarius Constellation.

"All Systems nominal. Engage Portus!" I shouted through the Sonorus charm on my throat. All those aboard whom could cast magic (some non-magical family members had to be rescued from "dissident camps", arrested for sheltering their magical children, brothers or friends) cast our customized variation of the Portkey charm at the same time, charging the super-portkey at the heart of our ark's Disassociator Engine and bringing us out of sync with the material universe.

The approaching bombers sent toward our building sites saw nothing but thirteen great flashes of light, and arrived at empty, but obviously used shipyards. The secrecy charms had fallen with our exodus.

All those within the arcs could do nothing but hold on - once the destination is set, a portkey cannot be stopped. We watched in wonder as first the Earth got smaller, then the sun's light grew blinding. Our trip from Sol to Saggitarius A* took three days, despite the fact that we travelled at many times the speed of light, the muggle's "universal speed limit".

"Attention all hands! We're now approaching the center of our galaxy! I advise you all to hold on, and look outside. This will be the sight of a lifetime."

The Ark, as both a cloud of magic and a physical construct at once, quickly approached the dark spot our muggleborn comrades would have called a Black Hole, but which we all knew was really an opening, an entryway for a bundle of Lines to exit our universe. The darkness grew, and with it, a cold more terrible than a thousand dementors made itself felt throughout all thirteen arks. We watched helplessly as one of them, the /Pride of Babylon/, attempted to disengage and was scattered into nothing.

Then we broke through, the lines and angles of our universe breaking apart with iridescent shards and fragments spiraling around us, and the remaining arks were flung into the great Blackness beyond, hopefully into a better future for us all.

******** Can I super kindly suggest that you two do a collaboration effort on this? I would absolutely ADORE seeing this become a longer story. I could see this going kind of like the Doctor with wizarding Arks crossing from one fandom to another and creating an arching multiverse sandbox for the story to play out in, and maybe there's forces beyond the pale of our simple cosmos which would take notice, or perhaps affront, to creatures tapping in to a deeper wellspring of power.
