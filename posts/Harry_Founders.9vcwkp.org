Is there a L/F where Harry trains the founders? NOT trained BY them but trains them instead..


** He would totally end up creating all of the ridiculous things about Hogwarts purely for nostalgia purposes. (like, Hey Harry how do you think we should sort the students? And Harry just goes, SINGING HAT)

I would love to write that if I had the time, but I don't. The closest thing I can think of is 'Of a Linear Circle'. It's a whole fic series, but one of them involves Harry in the founders time, and while he's younger and less experienced than them its more of a learning experience for everyone rather than the standard merlin-is-shocked-and-horrified-so-he-sends-harry-back-as-a-child-to-learn-then-harry-returns-to-the-present-and-is-badass. Sorry it's not what you wanted, but I do think you'd enjoy it. I believe part III is the one in the founders time. The other books center around a sarcastic asshole named Nizar Slytherin who is offended by the quality of schooling these days.
