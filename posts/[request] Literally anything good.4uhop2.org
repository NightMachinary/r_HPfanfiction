So pairing wise im not interested in slash main character if its a secondary character sure. Don't really like a Harry who gets walked all over (even by teachers) but not to the point where he has no respect and does what he wants. Im home for the summer and want a distraction from my family.


** Patron is definitely one of, if not my most, favorites. Great action and the stakes are always high. Also probably most evil and intelligent Voldemort around. I have a few gripes with it here and there but for the most part I forgive them.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Christmas, 1993. Harry Potter is spotted in the company of wanted fugitive Sirius Black, and is forced on a dark, treacherous path. He is pursued from all directions by a Ministry intent on capturing him, and a seemingly immortal Voldemort always looms in the shadows. The road ahead will be dangerous for Harry, and the toll will be higher than ever before...

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
