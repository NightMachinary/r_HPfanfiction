*** I've read it and thought it was pretty damn funny and I know almost nothing about Warhammer40k. 4 part series so far (I think) and still updating.

*** It's a gem. The recent books are still funny, although not as much. Carrow series is probably one of the funniest and best written crossovers ever.

#+begin_quote
  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.
