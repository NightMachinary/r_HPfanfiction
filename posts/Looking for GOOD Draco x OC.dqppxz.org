Maybe I'm even looking for the most clich√© Draco romance, I don't know. I just want a story where Draco falls in love and the girl helps him redeem himself. BUT I want realistic, canonical characters. I don't want a Mary Sue or "Sex God Draco". I would like to read a deep story with all the feels and fluff. And it would be great if the fics are completed.


** This one definitely has redemption but not as early on, definitely made me cry so much. It's the Malfoy redemption thar is realistic, (ie, not immediate and slow burn). My favorite thing about this fic is the length and the character development. Also, the author takes great care to balance out the ofc and make sure she has major flaws to counteract her abilities. I finished this about ten minutes ago and it is ~1500k words.

Ok so this one is recently completed, really long, and well written.

However it is a sequel. The first book is James potter/OFC and my favorite fic of that type.

You don't need to read it in order to read the draco/ofc but it does help to an extent. (And it is an AMAZING and long fic)

Then the draco /ofc is based on the ofc being the daughter of the ofc from the first book.

My all time favorite draco/ofc series is sadly, unresolved. However I have re read it more than any other fanfiction and I'm usually picky about WIPs. They are well worth the read cuz they are so well written with a really good subplot, AND they are slow burn / there is some frustration cuz stupid teenagers are stubborn. The author did recently say she's ready to update. This fanfiction is the best I have ever read.

** I wrote one if you're interested. I was complimented really nicely on my OC so maybe that means she's not a Mary Sue :p
