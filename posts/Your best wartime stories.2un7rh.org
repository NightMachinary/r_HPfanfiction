Give me your best HP war fics. Looking for lengthy, hopefully completed fics. I'll take in progress if it's a long read though.


** For a well written, wartime sort of dark trilogy I would suggest Promises Unbroken, Promises Remembered and Promises Defended. Sirius Black remained the Potters secret keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry goes to Hogwarts and Voldemort remains.

*** I'll give this a shot. I'm relatively sure that I haven't read it which is a plus

Edit: I did my best to get into this but gave up near the end of the first book

  Remus is having disturbing visions.

Is this a yet another story with prophecies/vision-prevented bad outcomes (just making sure)?

**** Not in the traditional HP fan fic sense. Remus is given a gift that allows him to see visions of things that could be but not given the ability to predict so much that he can alter it. I'll stop there or I'll spoil it.

***** /(spoilers)/

I have another question, if you don't mind.

I am at the 37th chapter of the first book at this point, and the good guys have managed to miss opportunities on killing one of the two elite DE killers, both of the Lestranges, and Voldemort himself. Can you tell if the whole series is going to be like this, with the “good guys” usually only stunning/trying to capture their opponents and nothing more?

****** I can definitely see how that would appear but no. The first story is quite a lot of setting the scene and explaining details for the bigger picture. Things get moving a bit quicker in the second story. But I will agree with you that it feels like it takes forever for things to really get going.

** I just finished reading this one.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution]]

It is post Hogwarts, with magical world heading to a world war/ or kinda like Arab spring for wizards.

It is not perfect, but I would give it 6.5/10

#+begin_quote
  This story chronicles the rise of Harry Potter, the right hand of the Dark Lord Voldemort. Features a dark Harry in Slytherin, from pre-hogwarts to the end of the war. Harry knew nothing of the wizarding world until a teacher from a mysterious school visited him and told him the tale of his father, catapulting him into a world of intrigue, politics and Power.
#+end_quote

First half is about Harry's time at Hogwarts, second half about the war. It's finished too.

** I want to recommend Hogwarts Battle School, even if it isn't quite what you are looking for :-) Also, I'm not sure if you're thinking magic vs magic or magic vs muggle?

Instead, other stories you're probably aware of:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor]] (Author looks to have a few that might be relevant)

*** Technically speaking, HBS wouldn't fall under this category as it is not actually in a wartime phase...
