That's filtered using the "Viktor Krum/Harry Potter" tag which is also supposed to include results with the name changed. Sorted by word count, complete, in English.

Don't know about quality since it's not a ship I've read, so I don't have any personally to recommend. But I figured I'd give you this link since someone else posted the one for FF.

** World Enough and Time by salty-sarah On the night four names are drawn from the Goblet of Fire instead of three, Viktor Krum spies the figure of young Harry Potter and makes a decision that will rock the entire wizarding world. Canon till the Tournament. Viktor/Harry. 31K but a favorite of mine.

Break Me, Shake Me by DaggersBloodPain What would have happened if Harry Potter had been broken by the muggles around him? Would things still be the same if he came to Hogwarts with Social Anxiety Disorder? Take a look at this very different Harry and see how he copes with disability. Harry P. / Viktor K. 43K but incomplete.
