** I'm fairly certain Dumbledore stopped Harry's mail somehow when he was growing up with the Dursleys. As a celebrity in the wizarding world, think how many people would have wanted to write to him and thank (or threaten) him for getting rid of Voldemort. We can also assume his address was secret, therefore Remus wouldn't have been able to write to him the muggle way.

The weirdness of Lupin not contacting him doesn't really start until after third year, and I think we can assume Lupin was feeling a lot of guilt over turning in front of the trio and almost eating them, not to mention being the cause of Pettigrew getting away. He may have assumed Harry wouldn't want anything to do with him after that, and also that Harry had Sirius now, so he wouldn't need Remus. Also that he would likely see Harry through contact with Sirius.

** I don't understand people's expectation that Remus should've written to Harry. Why? Remus Lupin was James Potter's friend, not Harry's. Sirius cared about Harry because he was his godfather, but Remus wasn't.

If any of my friends ever have kids I don't think I would care all that much about them. friends don't come packaged with their family.

** Firstly, Dumbledore could have kept Harry's location secret which made it difficult for Remus to contact Harry. Secondly, Remus was under no obligation to contact Harry as he was not related to him.

** Here's my take on why Remus didn't write to Harry: why should he? Consider this: prior to the deaths of James and Lily there were suspicions of a spy working for Voldemort within the Order of the Phoenix. While nobody could prove the identity of this spy, it was known that Remus was interacting with the werewolves, likely trying to sway them away from Fenrir Greyback, and ultimately Voldemort. Combine this with the Ministry's stated anti-werewolf stance, and the fact that Voldemort was at least pretending to be pro-werewolf, and you have a situation where the suspicion over who the spy inside the Order is would invariably include Remus Lupin near the top of the list.

With such a suspicion, it's only inevitable that he would become aware of everyone's thinking, and a confrontation (possibly of the friendship-destroying kind) would be the result. At the end, I could quite reasonably see Remus walking away from the Order, and his now former friends, feeling angry, hurt and betrayed that they think he'd side with werewolves like Greyback over the people that he spent seven years sharing a dorm with.

** I dislike Remus a lot, but uhh...

No one wrote to Harry before Hogwarts. Given that Remus ​did his best to avoid striking up a relationship when they did, that's fine.

There's a lot more to Remus and Snape than Remus being a willing bystander and Snape being an unfortunate victim. I don't think too many 15/16 year olds are going to go out of their way to help someone who at best tried to get them expelled and, at worst, tried to get them killed. ​

We see this once and there's no indication that Remus was even in the house.

** I got puzzled myself about the letter thing when I first read the books and it was funny cuz I ended up having this dream about Remus being allergic to owls and a great number of birds so he ended up having to use the Muggle post system and when he stayed with the Weasleys he bribed gnomes to take the letters to Harry, why there was such an abundance of them at the Burrow. Since in my dream they can teleport like house elves. And I woke up laughing to Ron with a gnome with teeth locked on his hand screaming and Harry wide eyed storms his way into Remus' house with a prepaid phone from a Muggle gas station and chucks it at him telling him to contact him that way and Remus not pressing any buttons or anything tries talking to Harry only having to hunt down a Muggle old lady who lives on the edge of his block to explain the odd button coated block.

I do agree he didn't really have a backbone in the series and I guess was meant to be the match to Pettigrew, he wasn't so afraid he turned his friends over to Voldy but he let his friends do things that equaled what the DE did to innocents and just tried to bury it in the past while James and Sirius are both similarly brash and out to go after what they want no matter who is in their way with varying moral compasses.

Still love writing him though and how he grows from that to be stronger when he's an adult and helping to raise my oc, Harry and Neville with Regulus' and disguised Sirius' help.

Death Eaters were murdering and torturing people. From Snape's own memories we know Junior DEs like Mulciber took their bullying to a different level. Given that Snape was a willing bystander who found these things funny, he was no "innocent."

**** Hanging a child up in the air and removing their clothes and publicly humiliated them would count as worse to allow to happen than letting one person kill another in my book. No matter what Snape did to ‘get as good as he gave' as so many people in the fandom say he still was a child and didn't deserve that. And worse there was no punishment at all from the school mentioned about them doing that to him.

****** Legal age in the books is 17, they're all considered children legally, which if you want to equate that to crimes in our world would have a higher grade of punishment for assault on a minor, not to mention adding in the removal of clothes that would shift it into the sexual targeting categories for forcibly stripping a child, as compared to accessory to murder and failure to aid the victim being murdered, the former would carry heavier degrees of punishment.

But I suppose in the magical world where they don't care students are running around stripping each other by force sure, murder could be worse. After all Umbridge did make it pretty high with her crimes against children ‘for the greater good' under Fudge's regime. Not even mentioning the whole targeting fellow partial Muggle born Wizards like herself.

****** Newt Scamander got kicked out for taking the wrap for a magical creature Leta brought that harmed another student but no, publicly stripping students who are assumed to be or proven to be DE is perfectly acceptable and lands you a hero auror status when you grow up apparently. Great life lessons for children.

As long as you do it to a ‘bad' guy it's perfectly fine.

** Fanon Remus seems to fix..a lot of the ..not problem but flaws. Remus wanted to help Harry. Was scared of commitment but came off as a guy who's gotten so used to not being well treated by the universe. He wasn't trying anymore. The marauders were long way laway by either POA or HBP. So its been years since he had friends likely.

Fanon explores his background more usually. Makes him more relatable then just pop in and out of Harry's life. I like that.

** You forgot one: not telling Dumbledore about Sirius being an Animagus. He thought Sirius was a mass murderer out to kill Harry, and did not tell anyone about the secret passageways into the castle or about his ability to turn into a dog. Not even after he managed to get into the castle with a knife!
