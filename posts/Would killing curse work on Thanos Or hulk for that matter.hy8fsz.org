** I would say yes. It would. It doesn't seem like that is based on size or power. However, I guess you can invent justifications and exceptions for just about everything on a fanfic

** Hulk? I don't see why not.

As for Thanos I think the killing curse would work on him if he doesn't have any infinity stones. However if he has the power and reality stone then he could just alter reality so that magic either no longer exists or it no longer affects him specifically.

(Assuming that he's not a dumbass with the stones like he is in the films that is)

** The only thing we know for certain about the killing curse, from a scientific perspective, is that one British coroner active during the 1940s couldn't find a definitive cause of death for Voldemorts' muggle relatives.

** It's fanon. We can derive at least a hundred reasons it will work and a hundred reasons it won't.

** Neither of them has any inherent magic, so most certainly yes.

** But just looking at canon the curse kills on eveyone but Harry so from that viewpoint I would say yes that the killing curse would kill Thanos and the Hulk as long as you believe that they have souls.

Of course as stated earlier fanon can take whatever path it wants.

*** In comics Wolverine fought with the Angel of Death a few times for the right to keep his soul or something. I didn't read comics, but saw a scan of it. If Wolverine can fight and win against the Angel of Death, so can Thanos and Hulk.

**** If the killing curse targets the soul then anyone possessing the soul stone can survive the killing curse.

***** Nothing suggests the Killing Curse targets the soul. As far as we know it just kills.

** I see no reason it wouldn't work on the Hulk. Thanos had some mystical type powers in the comics even when he wasn't sporting one or more infinity stones. So that could go whichever way you wanted for the story.

*** Well given how it's been established Hulk works now in Ewing's run, even if it does kills him it simply will. not. stick.

** I'd guess probably, but Thanos could counter in various ways if he had the Infinity Stones. He could create a physical barrier or portal to intercept it, slow time and dodge, maybe negate it completely with the Reality Stone.
