Does anyone know if there are any fics that have Loki actually being Salazar? I love MCU crossovers and I thought that it would be a super cool concept. Like, Odin sent Loki to earth to teach him a lesson or something, and he ends up meeting Godric, Helga, and Rowena and they create Hogwarts together. Maybe Harry and co meet Loki and find out about his alternate identity, maybe they don't. But still, I think it would be cool. Any stories like that out there?


** Loki is Salazar and Thor is Godric in this oneshot: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/224284][Hogwarts: A (Marvelous) History, or: Thor and Loki's Excellent Adventure]]

** Huge MCU crossover story in this. Loki was around during the time of the founders in this one.

Loki is the Patron God of House Slytherin due to some of his blood saving Salazar from dying from some kind of Frost Giant poison. It's only a minor background fact but I also just like to rec this story. Tom Riddle and Steve Rogers teaming up in WW2 is just cool.

  It begins in 1943. Tom Riddle searches for his place in the world, and ends up getting captured by HYDRA. After being saved by a crazy muggle in spandex, he must learn to adapt to the new playing field, and have some odd friendships along the way. AU. Soldier!Tom Riddle. No pairings. Starts in CA:TFA but will spread to the other films.
