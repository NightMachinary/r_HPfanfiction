I have a thing for betrayed Harry, through the Goblet of Fire, Azkaban, etc. It's suprisingly difficult to find fics where Harry is COMPLETELY alone. Authors tend to feel the need to shoehorn Neville or the Twins in.

Romance because of this isolation is welcome, but not mandatory.


** linkffn(No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim) Everyone thinks he's a squib because he can't do magic with a wand (It was a wand he found in a coat pocket, and was not a good match for him in any way.) His only friends are Hagrid, Fluffy, and the Basilisk. He does become a master of wandless magic, and at one point ends a scuffle between Neville's Trio and Draco's group by knocking out every combatant and nearly killing Neville, who finally starts to respect him.

  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.

The eighth and tenth one-shots in this collection ("Just a Weapon" and "The Enemy") might have what you're looking for, but be forewarned: AUs that have what you're describing tend to be VERY dark and disturbing.

  My own collection of one shots and partial ideas. Many have already been published; this is just a place to keep them all. Also, most of the writing in here is terrible. Beware.
