Are there any fanfictions like forging the sword? Something that happens that makes Harry and co. train harder in the beginning. Maybe even pre-hogwarts or a different housed trio? Thanks!


** *Patron*, linkffn(11080542): very AU, but Dumbledore, the Ministry, and Voldemort were all SIGNIFICANTLY stronger in this fic. Voldemort was particularly cunning and scary.

*Ruthless*, linkffn(10493620): a little short, but very good.

*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382): nice Harry/Multi fic. Bonding with Hermione early has great benefits for Harry and most good guys.

*Unspeakable Things*, linkffn(6473434): Lockhart was DoM special agent Adonis, started training Harry/Ginny right from year 2.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
