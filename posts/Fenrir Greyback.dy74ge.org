Forgive me if this request is a little too grim, but I was wondering if someone could recommend a fanfic where Fenrir Greyback is killed off or tortured to the point of mortal damage.

I'd also settle for Lucius Malfoy, Bellatrix Lestrange or any "bad" character.

Pretty good powerful Harry fic. Time travel back to Voldemort's first rise.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.
