** George is sitting at Toms pub a month after the final battle, the rest of his siblings are there as well worried as he continues to knock back drink after drink. After his sixth shot he looks at Ron and Bill his face scowling in thought.

"Am I Fred....or George?" He looks at his empty shot glass "God I don't know..."

"Ummm George I think it's time for you to stop drinking"

"But how do you know I'm George?" He tears up a bit as he slams the glass on the counter hard enough to crack it, cutting his hand and causing the other patrons around them to jump at the sudden sound "mayhaps I'm Fred and I just never knew it!"

** Fred and George had never met someone that could tell them apart. That should be sad, considering they do in fact live with their parents, but with that many kids they doubted they'd be able to tell each other apart either. As it was, it meant that who was Fred and who was George was always a very hard question to answer.

Especially for them.

** They don't know themselves who was born Fred and who was George. Their parents were always mixing up their names when they were children.

When they were on the train for their first year at Hogwarts, they decided to open a chocolate frog between them. Whomever it hopped to would be Fred, and the other would be George.

The first time they introduced themselves to someone, that's who they would say they were. It was that person's job to tell them apart. From there, they would mess with them and make up names like Gred and Forge. Their true friends would know the difference, the rest would be the rest.

** When you're treated as an amalgamation by everyone from such a young age, it's hard to know where one starts and the other ends and if you even have any differences. This reminds me of that one case with those two little girls who were twins and could basically read each other's minds and feel any pain the other did and it was super codependent unhealthy until one of them died.

** It's late at night and outside it's storming. He doesn't care as he feels the weather outside it's an appropriate representation for what he is feeling inside. He raises the glass of firewhisky to his lips and takes another sip, he's already past tipsy and he doesn't intend to stop. Not tonight. "To Fred" Ron calls out as he raises his own glass, Bill, Charlie, Harry and Percy alla raise their glasses in answer. It's been exactly a year since the "Battle of Hogwarts" as the papers are referring to it now. His parents organized a great feast at the Burrow for the family to gather together, even Charlie came back all the way from Romania where he had returned a few months prior. Dinner had been tense but mostly a joyful occasion, after all it's hard to feel sad when you see a hyper active baby with tourquoise hair drooling all over Harry's shirt. Teddy had gone home now though, he had left with Andromeda shortly before his parents decided to go up to bed, followed by Ginny and Hermione. So here they were, the Weasley brothers, slowly getting drunk on a bottle of their father's firewhisky. He laughed, that caught the others' attention. "What?" snapped Ron as he kept snickering, "What 're you thinkin' bout George?" He pressed. " I just thought about something really funny" he laughed again, the others, now fully turned in his direction, looked at him as if he was crazy. He continued "It's just... you know how you keep calling me George? Well... well I'm not really sure you're right" at that he let out another bark of laughter. The others where now staring at him confused "What do you mean, George?" Bill's tone was a mix of confusion and amusement. "That! Exactly that! You keep calling me George but what if I'm not?" his face suddenly lost all traces of laughter "What if I'm not?" he repeated quietly to himself. "You're off your rocker mate" Ron again spoke "you should bloody stop drinking" he glanced at the almost empty glass in his hand. Bill though didn't accept that explanation. "George, hey what- what are you saying?" "You know how everyone always mixed up our names and even mum and dad couldn't tell us apart? Well-" he paused as if to admit a big secret he'd never told anyone "When we where kids we liked to mess up with everyone so we just woke up and... decided who was going to be who for the day." "You mean..." Charlie turned really pale "...you-" he couldn't finish the sentence. "Yeah, we messed up so well that, that... we were not really sure who was who at that point so we just started referring to ourselves as Gred and Forge. It was our secret, our biggest prank." He paused "When we got to Hogwarts eventually we just decided I was going to be George and he was going to be Fred...I mean I think I'm George, I'm just not 100% sure" he concluded. The rest of the room was staring at him with horror and confusion on their faces. "But that's- How could you possibly not know!" Percy got to his feet incensed, George just shrugged. Harry that to that moment had kept silent gasped "The Marauders map!" he exclaimed "The what?" Harry ignored Charlie "It must have shown you on the map, with your own names!" George just shaked his head "We thought the map settled the problem for a bit, but-" his distant expression suddenly got very sharp "we found out we couldn't rely on the map, after your third year" he looked at Ron and Harry "you see the map shows the name people go by, who they think they are, not who they really are." "What does that even mean?" Ron looked suddenly sober "We believe that's why Peter Pettigrew never appeared on the map before third year, before Sirius escaped reminding him who he really was and why he should be afraid, he was just Scabbers the rat." Ron had turned a sick shade of green as he did everytime someone reminded him of his pet Death Eater. " I need more Firewhisky" he croaked. "Mum would have a fit if she found out, you know" Bill looked really worried "That's why she'll never know" George concluded then he flicked his wand and their glasses all refilled with alchool, "To our brother" he said "To Gred".
