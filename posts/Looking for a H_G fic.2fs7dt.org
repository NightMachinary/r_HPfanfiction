Hey guys, hope you can help me with this. I tried the method from the side bar but nothing came up.

Anywho.

All I can remember is that Harry was neglected in favor of his twin, Ginny was his girlfriend and they both had multiple animagus forms. At one point Harry decides to claim the Slytherin line as his own and Fudge doesn't believe him.

Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
