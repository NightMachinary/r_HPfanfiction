How the prophecy could be interpreted, AKA, How Dark!Neville could be cannon.

/The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches../. --- Harry Potter.

/Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies.../ --- Neville Longbottom, whose parents denied becoming Harry's Godparents, would not care for him after James and Lilly died, and something...

/And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not.../ --- Neville accidentally gives Harry a scar during DA. Harry has some power Neville doesn't.

/And either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives.../ --- Prophesy

/The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies..../ ---Prophesy

Anyone else know of an alternate interpretation of The-Prophecy-That's-Way-Too-Vague-And-Doesn't-Even-Rhyme?


** "The prophecy said that my parents had to defy you three times... how could this possibly work?" Neville asked, confusion written all over his face as he pointed his wand at the Dark Lord and Traitor, Harry Potter.

As the Fourth Battle of Hogwarts was raging around them, Harry contemplated this question and replied:

"Your parents knew me and must have visited my parents. They probably didn't give me toys or candy three times in a row, or something similar.‚Äù

Neville's confusion went, as he thought about that answer... it seemed logical, "Oh... wow."

** Well, one reinterpretation can be based on the fact that the prophecy was /heard/ and not /read/. The word "borne" (meaning "carried") is a homophone to "born". So, it could be that "the one" is actually someone who was transported to those who have thrice defied the Dark Lord at the end of July or September (from the "sept-" prefix).

** In the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][Last Mage of Krypton]] series (Harry Potter is Kal-El/Smallville-era Superman), the letter "e" is added to the word "born" (birthed) to turn it into "borne" (transported).

When Voldie discovers Harry was blood-adopted, he assumes that the prophecy did not apply to him & Harry after all, until he and Grindlewald do a ritual to scry Harry's past and discover that Harry was carried to Earth in a pod, hence with a spelling tweak, the prophecy still applies.

In an amusing note, they deduce that Harry is the Last Son of */Atlantis/* as it fitted with everything that they knew or thought they knew.
