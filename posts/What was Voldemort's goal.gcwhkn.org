I mean it's clear that he just loves to have power over people but he is not interested official positions of power. If he only wanted the Ministry he could have become Minister of Magic, according to Slughorn, considering how charismatic and charming he was as Tom Riddle. Also if he wanted to have control of the Ministry while him being in the shadows, he had enough influential people within the Ministry or with a strong pull to do it quietly. Actually it only took him like two months to do it in book seven. Even if one may argue that Dumbledore was what was stopping him, in book five, we see how easy it was to use Malfoy's influence over Fudge to discredit and ostracize Dumbledore. I could understand that there might have been critics but he could have silenced them through discreet assassinations.

So then what do you think was the purpose of the First War? Why raise an army of dark wizards and creatures to overthrow the Ministry? Why carry out all those terrorist attacks, when in the end all it took were a few well placed Imperius curses within the Ministry.


** I always see him as having two main goals -- immortality and becoming the most powerful wizard alive.

Immortality is rather obvious.

The most powerful wizard -- I see it as most powerful in every way possible -- most powerful magically, most powerful politically, etc.

I see Riddle as someone who wanted power for the sake of power. He wanted to be better than anyone else. He wanted to be special. The point of getting the Ministry wasn't to install his own laws and beliefs, but to show everyone that he could and no one could do anything about it. Sure, he probably had his own opinion on everything, but installing those opinions wasn't his motivation for power, more of a bonus in gaining it.I actually don't see Riddle as having any set views and opinions that cannot be changed. I don't see him as a genuine anti-Muggle and anti-Muggleborn radical. He just exploited these believes bcs purebloods held them and were must useful to him. As someone who grew up in Muggle London during WWII and was supposed to be brilliant, I don't believe Riddle thinking of Muggles as of stupid animals. He may dislike them by association but I never thought he actually believed in all the ‘muggle and mudbloods' drivel.

*** Actually, I'm on the same line of thinking. Realistically JKR probably just created him so that the story had an antagonist. But then after HPB when she does a bit of character development on him, it's quite clear that he just wants to be 'special' as Dumbledore calls it. As an orphan muggle he is the lowest of the low and he is happy when he gets invited to Hogwarts. But then wizards become quite common to him. So I always kind of thought that he wanted to ascend to the level of god or something like that, where he would be regarded with fear and adoration and he could control every single aspect of his subjects, without him necessarily occupying an official position of power.

** I usually view his goal to quickly either diminish and murder/enslave muggles. Because he knows that muggles can. And will kill the wizards if they found out about them. Nukes. Kinetic bombardment. Or to cease the traveling to the muggle world. And control all and every government in the world. (Puppets). And to take the entirety of great Britain and the Irish territories. and slowly build wizard population. And take muggleborns when they are young. If and when gbatit over populates. He'll have a big enough population to take over Europe (excluding turkey [if you count it] and Russia.) And do the same thing. Then. He'll have a big enough population of to conquer the world. And confine all muggles to "Pens" for the sole reason of producing more and more muggleborns. Which are then taken to the wizarding world to become wizards. Any and all hatred of muggleborns I imagine before the plan is simply because muggleborns try to join the wizarding world and fuck up all sorts of traditions and shit. If and when the plan is put into action. The only humans left are wizards. Muggles are in "pens." That's my theory.

** As a child, we are told Voldemort liked watching people suffer. People are too frightened to rise up against Voldemort's possible return (as he did it in the shadows early on) based off his history.

Possibly people would also have looked too closely at his family history if he went into politics, but I do believe that overall he wanted to be THE leader - the sort of person who can control rich and powerful families like the Malfoy's through fear/punishment. People branded to him.

Politics, on the other hand, involves a lot of being nice to people - or at least convincing people that you're on their side. Over and over, eventually something will come up and someone will overtake you. His initial followers are a select group of his school mates, but I expect it would be far harder to persuade their parents and grandparents to follow him, given the structural discrimination of muggle borns and half bloods. The Gaunts weren't thought highly of by that point.

** I think his primary goal was immortality. If he wanted to take over the wizarding world or enslave muggles, there were far more direct paths he could have taken. Either he was stupid, or that wasn't his primary goal. And he was the top student during his time at Hogwarts and was seen as extremely bright, so it wasn't the former.

If his primary goal was immortality, it makes sense. He likely needed unfettered access to dark arts to obtain eternal life, which explains why he gathered so many dark families into his fold. That power also gave him the added benefit of being practically untouchable in a legal/law enforcement sense. An average joe-schmoe dabbling in the dark arts would likely be arrested and Kissed pretty quickly. A Dark Lord with the backing of some of societies darkest and most powerful families? Not so much.

His followers, of course, needed something to occupy them, which is probably why he allowed the seemingly pointless terror campaign. This further served to bind them to him (committing crimes together is a pretty solid way of binding underlings together) and helped make his name even more feared --- which lessened the chance that any but the most powerful wizards would try to kill him.

He likely did have world domination aspirations eventually, but since he knew he couldn't die, there was no need to rush. He could have been laying a decades or centuries long plan. But splitting his soul likely caused some form of madness he didn't plan for. I think toward the end he was increasingly paranoid and unstable. There was probably some part of him that kept bringing up doubts - was he really immortal? Were his underlings plotting against him? What was Dumbledore planning? - so when he heard the prophecy, he acted out of paranoia and it cost him.

I think being paranoid probably cost him in time, too. If he had told even just his most trusted followers how to resurrect him, he could have been back within the year, but he didn't trust anyone enough for that.

When he came back, I think he was honestly just insane. He had lost his humanity. He had spent years completely alone as a shade, possessing lesser animals while their bodies rotted around him. He had only a fraction of his soul. Even his form wasn't exactly human anymore, which probably only served to mentally destabilize him more. Dysphoria is a bitch.

I don't think seeing how he acted during his second reign is a good estimate of how he acted when he was first rising, and was sane, human, and extremely powerful.

I view him as a man whose overwhelming fear of death was his driving force. Everything else came from that.

And honestly, as an orphan growing up in WWII era London, that doesn't seem far-fetched.

*** I think so too. He sought to overcome the human weaknesses and had this God-complex. I mean you can see it in his monologues towards the end of DH. He refers to him in third person. He calls himself merciful to those who serve him and so on. He basically thinks of himself as Jehova or something.

** As the oracle said in the matrix reloaded

“What do all men with power want? More power.

That's Voldemort to a T with a little bit of genocide thrown in

** For First War specifically, I'd say it was most likely to rule over muggles. Some people posit that the reason was the same as the Second War--blood purity--but it's implied this is not the case. According to JKR, Snape joined the Death Eaters partly to impress Lily, and Voldemort tried to recruit Lily (and James) during the First War (their refusal was part of their "thrice defying" him). If blood purity were the main purpose of the First War, neither of these would make sense. It's possible that Lily is actually the reason why blood purity became so important.

Anyways, I think it's reasonable to assume wizarding superiority was originally the main goal, given that none of his followers seemed to have any issues with the goals of the second war. It's not a huge leap from one to the other, either; if muggles=bad it's not too far of a stretch to say wizards related to muggles=bad, especially if blood purity sentiments already existed, which seems to be the case.

** In universe: some men just want to watch the world burn.

Out of universe, J.K. Rowling needed a big bad evil person to act as the opposition in the plot, and I don't think she had fully worked out what he had as goals other than immortality and power.
