The fanfic is Harry/Daphne in the end. I've literally been googling non stop for 24 hours. I'll write down all I can remember. first of all, its in 8th year (Harry coming back to finish his 7th year after the war). I remember Harry, Ron and Hermione not being friends anymore. Don't remember why. I think maybe Ron is trying but Hermione is being a bitch. Everybody is on Harry's side I think.

Harry possibly has an animagus form? Something shadow ish. All the 8th years is sharing a dorm. Harry is starting a company during the school year. I think he brings Neville along. I remember the two of them looking for rare potions ingredients. I think there was an incident in Africa where they ended up helping a firm that used to be the best.

Sometime during the school year Susan Bones asked Harry why he didn't kill Voldemort sooner (specifically before Susan's aunt got killed). At the end of the year Daphne Greengrass asked if he needed an assistant/secretary. Harry helped a lot of 8th years to get jobs, and other businesses to thrive. I think he helped Dean Thomas become a magical contractor, and Seamus Finnegan a wandmaker apprentice with Ollivander. I think Neville and Harry started the company BIG after they were done with school, and possibly hired Luna Lovegood for their research/Magical creatures department. Or possibly press? I think it was something with the quibbler.

I remember a specific conversation in the leaky Cauldron where Hermione asked Kingsley Shacklebolt about if the Wizarding world had laws against monopoly? Kingsley had been warned beforehand from Harry about Hermione.

In the end someone tried to kill Harry, and Susan Bones ended up kidnapping him, but he escaped and she ended up on trial on attempted murder charges. She felt Harry was at fault for her aunts death.

I also remember a specific scene where Harry and Daphne finally got together, when Harry fell out of the floo (because he's no good at it), eland they ended up making out on the floor. George was stopping by and saw them, and went back to the Weasleys, who had all bet on when it was going to happen, where, and who saw them. In the end all the Weasleys won, because everybody had one thing right (who took initiative, where, when etc).

I think George, Harry and Neville placed a curse upon Hermione an Ron, so they could not work in the magical community. I don't remember the specifics, but they placed it on Ron's Chudley cannons jersey. The curse on Hermione was that she never won any trial as a magical lawyer, so they moved to Australia and she became a muggle one.

Whooh.. I've literally googled every single thing I remember, in every single wording. Hope someone can help me! This is also the first time I've tried reddit, so I'm not sure where this ends up or how it works.. Any help is appreciated!

(I cant find the "flair" thing to mark it right..)


** Please help. I don't remember if it's a good fanfic or not, but I literally can't get it out of my head..
