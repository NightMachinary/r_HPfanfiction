I keep reading through them, and they'll have something like Harry having been raised as a ninja, or Harry going to Ninjalandia, and both of them have massive plot holes- the fact that in both situations, any skills and magic in the Harry Potter universe pale in comparison to the powers of the Naruto-verse.

I'm a few fics away from tearing my hair out because of it. Authors try to justify there being some sort of actual conflict, when in reality any chunin-level ninja could solo the entirety of Hogwarts, should they be allowed inside. There is no magic in the Harry Potter series that would really stand up to the power of chakra and full-out ninja powers, except maybe wards (which actually aren't even named such in the books), and the Fidelius charm, which only could really help hiding.

So when I see some story like Kakashi or Itachi coming to Hogwarts and not instantly destroying a threat to Harry's life, I cringe. It's like the author is trying to pretend there could be some sort of plot in the story, when in reality they just wanted to write about their favorite Naruto character being in Hogwarts and interacting with Harry Potter characters. Which I would be fine with, except that they try to hide it behind "Oh Kakashi can't chidori Voldemort faster than it takes the dark lord to say six syllables". Kakashi could already do that without chidori when he was 7.

And vice versa! Harry Potter in the elemental nations is going to get bitch-smacked without immediate training! Literally a genin like Sakura could take out Harry Potter with the canon level of skill he had.

Obviously I'm precluding the possibility of a fic where the HP universe has greater-than-canon levels of magic, or where the Naruto universe is much weaker. I'm fine with this. These authors just shouldn't pretend like these canon universes could really interact well in combat.

TL;DR- Don't cross canon-HP with canon-Naruto in combat unless former is buffed or latter is nerfed

** For the most part I completely agree, However, I think support wise wizards would break the elemental continents. Mind reading, portkeys, invisibility cloaks, apparition, broomsticks, transfiguration for prisoner transfer, potions (luck potion, drought of living death, pepper up potions), hell they have the ability to regrow bones. A few wizards could pretty much decide which Hidden Village prospers.

****** I actually think that Naruto/Hinata us far better than Naruto/Sakura. If Hinata was creepily obsessed, at least she was creepily obsessed for a good reason... while Naruto did the whole passive-aggressive "nice guy" thing in exactly as obsessive a way - and it isn't like he even tried anything with someone else. Hinata liked him when he was decidedly unpopular when she is frickin' royalty - so she gets some credit here. Naruto not manning up and giving someone else a chance would have been the lamest thing ever.

Also, Sakura is annoying as hell. WTF Naruto?

Ginny on the other hand (book Ginny) goes through a subtle transformation from a glorystruck fangirl into her own woman, gets over her obsession, and only when Harry mans up she gives him a chance. In the few lines she gets, she shows rather interesting development (that people ignore /because movies/).

Fortunately, there's at least one that fits the bill. I really recommend Effloresco Secundus by Romantiscue. linkffn(8525251) See the DLP reviews of it [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=31027][here]].

Dragonball, Naruto, One Piece, Sekirei, Soul Eater,...

In all universes wizards would get roflstomped immediatly if the author would recognize the blatant differences between the two scales of power.

The only reason I can see wizards winning are things like the Imperio curse, Legilimency and Obliviate. Mind-magic and just straight up Avada Kedavras.

** Even without a crazy power difference, I think speed would be the factor that would give the Naruto universe the win. Wizards run, duck and wave their wands just as fast as normal humans (you know, nomajs'!). They still have to aim, fire and hope the target doesn't move out of the way. Yeah theiris apparating but iit's not good for flickeribg through a fight (splinching). That is my two cents.

***** Hey, if you liked it, leave it in your favorite list.

That said, I despise Liliko and The Shinobi Teacher. The Shinobi Teacher read like a student being forced to write a paper, and that paper was a fanfiction crossover. The author just went on long brief summaries of what Harry did. If a part was so boring to write, they should have just skipped these parts with a brief explanation. Fanfiction allows for this, but the author didn't take advantage of the medium.

Liliko I despised for the same reason. I wasn't reading a story, I was reading the aftermath of one. I was reading Kushina talking about how she had been dicked over for years and years. If you're going to have evil Dumbledore, you should at least depict him being evil properly, and not explain it like a history lesson.
