The one's I've found are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/1/The-Snow-Queen][The Snow Queen]], where Hermione is basically mini-Mad-Eye Moody/Batman, Odd Ideas [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/133/Odd-Ideas][#133]], where an 11 year old Hermione ends up thinking that a drow is a reasonable role model, and the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/546831/kyaru-chan][Harveste Addams series]], where Harry is taken in by the Addams family and Hermione does her best to emulate him.

#+begin_quote
  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

At that stage, does she show any initiative or have any goals different from Harry's?

**** It's hard to say how much of what she does is directly caused by Harry. But she certainly shows a lot of initiative. She and Ron lead the Hogwarts Defense Club, conduct a secret prank war against the twins, attempt to banish Binns several times, and conspire with others to steal back a confiscated book about the dark arts from McGonagall.

Though she clearly is a side character in the story.
