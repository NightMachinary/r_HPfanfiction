#+begin_quote
  Sort of a sequel and a companion piece to Dudley's Memories. Harry is finding a healthy outlet for his "saving people thing" in the form of one damaged little boy. In doing so he finds himself thinking about his old teacher, quite a bit.

** This one linkffn(4703843). Though it is HHr and pretty much purely fluff. Takes place after DH and has them both adopting some orphans including Teddy Lupin later on. Imo has some of the best characterizations of children, each one with their own quirks.

  An old house sits at the end of a lane. Abandoned and forgotten, no one would have guessed who was going to buy it... or how full a life that old house was yet to live. Harry/Hermione

** Blank space by Keira Marcos (only available on her website) is a neat story with all of her usual foibles. Harry blood-adopts teddy, which is sort of like super adoption, and the core of the story is a Harry/Hermione romance

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.
