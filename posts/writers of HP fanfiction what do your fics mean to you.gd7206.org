** Fanfic serves 3 purposes for me.

1. To write the fics I want to read. My fanfic tastes are very particular, especially around worldbuilding elements, and I find myself unable to read most fanfics - like, I'm at the point where I only read like 2-3 fanfics a year. So I have to write the fics I want to exist, because it seems no one else is going to do me that favour :D

2. To promote ideas I wish were more prevalent in the fandom. I've written lots of essay-type bits and pieces about the HP world, but essays have a limited audience and just don't capture the imagination in the same way an idea does when it is embedded within a story.

3. To practice writing skills for original fiction. I have a few original story ideas that I want to write but don't feel ready to tackle - I'm still learning things with every chapter I write, and I look at stuff I wrote 6 months ago and see how I would have done it differently if I was writing it today.

*** I love that. Writing what you want to read is sometimes the only way to get that story into the world. & You're right. It's great practice!

** I started writing fanfics in order to prove to myself that I am capable of writing stories a story from start to finish (I had a tendency to quit anything halfway). My longest story is now 545k and finished. It felt like something that I needed to do before I started working on a real novel.

Aside from proving something to myself, writing was (and is) still very therapeutic to me. It helps me to process things in life, both good and bad, in the same way that dreams do for us. My fics mean a lot to me because of all of them contain the happenings and experiences from my own life retold into a story.

*** I love this. I feel very much the same way. Fanfiction was a way to prove to myself various things about writing--that I could write a scene, create dialogue, make characters, etc...

I'm glad writing is therapeutic for you too!

**** Thank you :)

Turns out that writing (stories, diaries, blog or otherwise) is one of the most commonly given advice by psychologists to help their patients set their minds in order. Writing has been proven again and again to help battle depression, deal with grieve and loss, and also to help you remember all of the good things.

Basically we should all be prescribed a daily dosage of Writing.

** They were an emotional outlet for me when my mum was ill and when she eventually died. They let me be creative without pressure or expectation, and they let me write what I want to read - I'm quite particular about canon compliancy so a lot of the time it's just quicker for me to write what I think happened than wade through a bunch of similar stories to find the exact moment I'm looking for.

** It will sound weird, but it gives me just enough emotional satisfaction to prevent me from going insane for good.

I promote my fanarts with it, which is a win-win. I have some illustrated stories in works, too.

I write in Hungarian, but I have a drabble collection that I always translate to English to practice writing in this language.

I'm a pretty casual writer, honestly.

** I started writing fanfics as escapism from a very shitty point in my life. Nowadays I write purely because it's a very good way to practice writing. The world and the characters are already there and the way to get them right is to study canon intensely (and some fanfics as well: why do some work, why do others don't?). What also helps is that there is a big potential readership (although they have yet to discover my fics :/) who can give you instant feedback on your work.

That's why fanfic is an ideal way to practice your writing and your understanding of fiction as a whole. I've got plenty of ideas for original fiction, but they're all fairly ambitious and so I've put them on the shelf for now, until I've honed my writing skills here in fanfic land.

*** Yes! I totally agree. Fanfiction was definitely escapism for me in some really trying times as a preteen/teen. I like the idea of using fanfiction to hone writing skills!

** Writing things I want to see. Contributing to the fandom in some way, even if it's just to an audience of 10K people. Putting my imagination to use. Feeling like I'm useful for once. Also, I kind of use my WIPs as a crutch because I told myself it would be rude to leave this earth before finishing them for my readers. So no matter how bad things get, I can't leave if even one fic unfinished. I do this in hopes of finding something else to stay around for in the mean time.

** I've had ideas percolating in my head for a while, always kinda assumed that no one would like them. Fanfiction has proved me wrong got the drive to start writing a pilot for a sit-com I've been sitting on for about 8 years.

** I've been planning a vast fantasy story of my own for most of my life. Thus far I've only written excerpts from here and there, many notes, and plot summaries. I once wrote a 900+ pages long book, but since then I've come up with so many new plot points that most of the book is currently outdated.

This project is mentally very taxing, and in November 2018 I decided to take a break. I began writing a Harry Potter fan fiction, because when I don't need to create my own world and characters, it's so much easier. The project became bigger and bigger, and I've learned much English. The story also allows me to reflect some things in my own life. I've felt quite apathetic for many years, and my main character has a personal quest of finding meaningful purpose in life.

Sometimes I've got little inspiration to write, but I've planned such a captivating end twist to the story that reaching it motivates me even if nothing else does.

** Aside from the simple joy of bringing a story out of my mind and onto the page?

Training for being an author. Putting my writing out there to be picked apart by bored dudes on the internet is a lot cheaper than a writing class, and a lot less prone to false praise than showing my friends or family.

** To try in my small way to contribute to the greatest fandom I've ever found. There are so many awesome fics out there, but when I find a thing I want to read that doesn't exist yet, it feels like I just ought to write it so that the next person to look for it will have at least something.

Posting online gives me the motivation and accountability to come back to old stories that I otherwise would have abandoned. I'm currently working through planning the second arc of a saga I would have dropped if not for how much I hate unfinished stories and don't want to leave a legacy of incompletion for future generations of fans.

And the HP world is just so big and full of potential. There's no way we could ever explore it all, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try!

** For me, it's basically a way to get plotbunnies out of my very crowded brain. I have tons of ideas, some of which I'm quite proud of and/or would desperately love to see written up, but that's hardly an uncommon state among fic writers and not many people go looking for plotbunnies and concepts like that. Several of my fics boil down to me saying, "Well, if nobody /else/ is going to write it..."

Unfortunately some of my favorite ideas are definitely beyond my skills/knowledge as a writer.

** I like to write because a few years ago, I made a deal with myself: I could only procrastinate if I was being productive in something else. Writing fic totally counts. :D

Really, it's become something I enjoy just for the sake of it. Playing with words and characters is fun, and doing that within an existing framework is even better. It's a low-stakes creative outlet, like you said, where I don't have to be focusing on big-word topics or complex concepts or important issues, and I won't be judged for some self-indulgent slash. We have no shame in this house ~

** I've been an avid reader for years and was always told what good writing skills I had but never even considered trying my hand at actually telling a story. I've had multiple ideas come up over the years for things I'd want to read but never thought in a million years I could effectively pull it off.

Characterization, reasonable pacing and plotting, interweaving main character and secondary characters effectively, coming up with an ending...it was all too intimidating to me.

But then I finally came up with an idea that wouldn't leave my head and started writing it down and my enjoyment grew and grew and grew To my astonishment I actually pulled it off and was able to tell an honest to goodness complete narrative. I'm not saying it's any good but the fact I did it provided a tremendous sense of accomplishment for me and has given me a hobby I never knew I would have.

** I found HP fan fiction and had a lot of fun reading it, and started having ideas. I read many stories.

I started writing something I wanted to read. It got bigger and bigger.

I started writing other smaller bits and pieces, again, for my own amusement.

I thought, hey why not put it out there and let other people read it.
