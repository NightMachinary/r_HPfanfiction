** Linkffn(harry is a dragon and that's okay) Linkffn(breath of the inferno) Linkffn(don't tickle a sleeping dragon)

I'm really not sure about that last one, I haven't read it and I don't even know if it's a real fic

Edit: apparently it is a real fic and sounds pretty good, you've now lost me to a fic, goodbye

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  [Development Hell] Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi

  Harry begins his final year at Hogwarts as he struggles to master new powers he has aquired before his final meeting with Voldemort. Little did he know that along the way he would discover a power even greater than he had expected.

*** Heh. Well, feel free to come back when you're done and tell me if it's any good. Either way, thanks for the recs! Your first is a classic, so it speaks well for your taste in the other two. :)
