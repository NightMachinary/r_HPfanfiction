:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fic a year ago and lost track of it! The details could be a little off.

Post battle and in an alt universe where Voldemort won. Draco is the owner of a brothel type manor and Hermione is the latest addition (I believe to pay off some sort of debt). Draco doesn't actually make Hermione provide services for any of the customers. There are several other girls that live in the house and they all slowly realize that Draco spends more and more of his time with Hermione. She gets quite comfortable spending every night with Draco until he gets a bit too aggressive and they get into a fight.

I also remember Draco leaves the manor and has some sort of argument with his father about keeping Hermione.

  After Voldemort wins, the wizarding world realizes he's not quite the best choice for a leader and the community falls into chaos...economy crumbling, crime and violence. Hermione Granger is caught embezzling funds from Lucius Malfoy's accounts and thrown in jail. Draco comes to offer her a chance at freedom if she agrees to come work for him...at The Shattered Dragon...a brothel outside London.***WINNER!

** linkao3(Manacled) has a similar story but I don't think it's what your looking for?

This is more of a Handmaid's Tale story? Malfoy does own Hermione?

  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve until her mind can be cracked. Now illustrated by Avendell.
