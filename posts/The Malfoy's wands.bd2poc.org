I just remembered something. In DH, Lucius Malfoy loose his wand after giving it to Voldemort for the 31st July's ambush, where it's destroyed. Draco Malfoy loose his during the Trio escape of Malfoy Manor during the Easter Break, and Narcissa loose hers after lending it to Draco, who probably loose it during the fight in the Room of Requirement since we laster see him begging a Death Eater without a wand on him.\\
So my question is, since 2 of the Malfoy were without a wand, and the only one who had one was on the site of the battle before its beggining, what were the Malfoy senior present at the battle. Did they ask to come to try to help Draco or were they just meat shields? And, other numerous crimes aside, could a tribunal comdamn them for their participation at it if they were without wand and so uselss?


** I feel like it would be uncharacteristically careless of Lucius not to have a stash of spare wands (possibly acquired in less-than-legal ways) somewhere in Malfoy Manor.

*** And yet, Travers was surprised to see Bellatrix with a wand when they tried to rob Gringott and Draco has to use his mother wand when he returns to Hogwarts.\\
Even if Lucius did have a stash, I think Voldemort either used them for more meriting Death Eater, or they still had some spare but he just refused to let them use it as a punishment (he did like to humiliate his servants and was really pissed).

Bellatrix isn't a Malfoy. With her in jail, there's no reason to assume Lucius would have arranged to have a spare wand matched to /her/.

***** It may be a headcanon but I always considered that, when Voldemort came back and started to live in Malfoy Manor, he treated all of their possessions as his (probably did the same with other servants).\\
Even if Bellatrix is not a Malfoy, she still lived at Malfoy Manor (or at the very least spent a lot of time there as the HQ), and Bellatrix ranked way higher than Lucius in the Death Eaters (at least during DH, after the several mistakes of Lucius almost killed him).

Since I consider that a bad match is better than no wand, and that Bellatrix would have gotten a wand before Lucius, I believed that a wandless Bellatrix meant that Lucius had to be wandless. I may have been wrong though.

** I find it really hard to believe that A) a family like the Malfoys doesnt have old/spare wands available. B) that Ollivander is the only wand maker in the entire country.

*** While I believe a spare wand is a possibility (for example ancestors' wands if they are not burried with) and there are other wandmakers (though canon say they are not as good), I was more thinking about a punishment by Voldemort.\\
Voldemort is living in Malfoy Manor, any sparewand they have could have been availiable for him when he needed one, but he took Lucius' one. And Draco returned to Hogwarts with his mother wand, not any other one. Considering the importance of wand for wizards, I don't understand why Draco would take his mother wand if he had any other wand to use (even if she could potentially offer it, he would refuse).\\
But considering Voldemort like to humiliate people, that there is not a lot of things more humiliating than losing your wand, and that the Malfoy did a massive blunder, he could forbid them to use wand.
