Despite me publicly explaining that it won't be appearing, I'm still getting a handful of reviews asking me why veritaserum isn't being used in my suspense story. I suppose I could have thrown in a half hearted excuse from a character, but it doesn't seem honest when the reason I'm not using it is because I really don't know why anyone would.

It's completely overpowered and was only introduced to save time in GOF. Am I the only one who thinks this? It was introduced so there didn't have to be a long scene drawing the right information out of Crouch, and so Umbridge looked extra evil in OOTP. Beyond that, it has no affect on the plot, even when it would have been useful or devastating - like when the Death Eaters were trying to establish whether it was Harry at Malfoy Manor. The reason it was ignored later is the reason I prefer to imagine it doesn't exist; it removes suspense and intrigue, it dramatically shortens the plot, and just generally feels like a massive cop out. Even when you accept the suggestion in canon that "it can be beaten", it still leaves a easy route for characters to take.

Clearly I should have thrown in a character mentioning it, if only to make people who don't read authors notes stop asking me about it. But during the climax of a story it feels disingenuous at best to throw such a jarring scene in there. Am I right? Or should I have bitten the bullet and made it some excuse for my characters? Is it too late to throw it into the last chapter? The constant focus on it is really getting me down, to the point where I'm thinking of not bothering with the sequel I've planned out, because no doubt people will constantly ask about it there too.

Edit: Thanks for all your advice, I'm going to edit a previous chapter. Sorry if I've been a bit snappy with people - I'm sure you can all understand that it's pretty disappointing to get negative feedback on something you've worked hard on.


** I think it's a weak (lazy even) plot device. It's a bit of a deus ex machina; maybe to save time, maybe so that the good guys don't have to resort to torture. But it's there and it's firmly canon. If you don't use it when it seems the obvious thing to do, then you probably need to present a reason not to use it.

** I like to believe that it's hard to make and is very, very expensive. Severus Snape can make it as he's talented and able to make his own, but not without expense. I dislike that people can beat Veritaserum. In canon, Severus states that one (or three) drops would make even Voldemort spill his deepest secrets.

So, yeah. If I want to avoid a 'just use Veritaserum' scene, I just have a character state that no one can brew it and that unless x person wants to cover the cost, then it's not being done.

Edit: I do agree that it is 'overpowered', but it's like the Killing Curse. It depends on your characters. If you have a character that would toss the potion down someone's throat, then go for it. You could even make said character attempt to brew it and ruin it, almost killing the other person. Then, it could be banned and decided as an 'illegal potion'. Actually, that's not a bad idea, making the potion illegal.

Is this for your Aurors fanfic? I haven't read it yet, but it is on my 'to read' list. I'm not sure of your characters, but you could have one of them state that they think it's morally wrong to use it. A few lines discussing it as they walked towards the interrogation rooms would be a good idea, as well.

I personally try and avoid Veritaserum as it's, as you said, overpowered and it can jar certain scenes. Nothing worse than having what could be an intense interrogation ruined by a potion being poured down a throat.

******** Well yeah, think about it; the Ministry is a very controlling government, especially in the wake of the first war with Voldemort. The Ministry keeps records of everyone's birth and has a magical Trace on them until the age of seventeen. They control the press to a frightening degree. Travel outside of the country, unless you used muggle means, would involve a Ministry restricted Portkey, Apparition License (limited by personal power to travel extreme distances) or the Floo Network, which is monitored. Then you have the Auror Corps, who have authorization to step outside Ministry regulations in order to fulfill Ministry directives about who is or isn't a Dark user. You have Legilimency, which can pluck the thoughts from your mind and display them to the court, as well as an entire corps of Obliviators who are trained in making people forget anything and everything, as well as crafting false narratives that wouldn't be able to be cracked without special training in memory charms.

Now, on top of all that, you have people who have high amounts of Hubris and Self-Righteous behavior as well as the stuffiness and pettiness that regularly infuse Muggle bureaucrats. This would make /anything/ that could compel the unadulterated truth to come out to be restricted as highly as it could, since it could lead to the entire government collapsing because of whatever leaked.

*The Ministry might seem like a bungling group of cowards, but a Ministry which turned all it's guns on you would be a very scary thing indeed.*

I actually think that could work. I'm not sure how you could work it in, but there's plenty of ways that you could make the substance banned.

However, it's not fool proof and can be beaten by people with Occulmency skills, strong mental discipline, or training. So accompanying evidence and witnesses are still necessary.

In your current story, I would still have Harry and Co dosing him with Veritaserum, but with little success as the guy was resistant for whatever reason. Of course they could still weaken his defenses through things such as sleep deprivation, but they didn't have the time.

Why? As you yourself have established, it can be beaten. Not to mention it would probably be highly unethical, and I've made it clear that Harry is trying to remove dodgy behaviour and shady dealings from his department. Drugging every suspect completely removes bodily autonomy, a human right we give even our worst criminals. You can argue that the wizarding world is different, but I would argue that I've made it clear in my fic that Harry keeps to the straight and narrow.

No, they didn't, and this is what I don't understand about the criticism. I can see the reasoning and logic during the final interrogation, but canon suggests that it's so highly controlled that they wouldn't have received permission to use it immediately, especially not in the middle of the night. But the other times people have suggested I use it were ridiculous - you'd think they expect Harry and Theia to be carrying it around with them, drugging people on a whim.

Again, it was mentioned in canon that Veritaserum was not all mighty. Yes, it was very useful and should be used, but it also failed in many cases. The aurors should have simple test and trick questions to determine whether the potion worked or not. In your case, they simply found out that guy lied right through his teeth.

On the contrary, I think Harry was very much in support in using the Veritaserum because it greatly enhanced the odds of separating the guilty from the innocent. Veritaserum could be just used as a mean of self defense as opposed to an interrogation tool. Wrongful convictions would be cut down dramatically, and that was something Muggles dreamt of having.

Honestly, I fail to see a problem here. Canonically, Veritaserum is "controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines", so it would make sense that any request to use Veritaserum would need permission from the wizengamot, or would need permission from multiple sources which would bury it in bureaucratic red tape.

Given false memory charms, occlumency, wandless magic etc, it isn't hard to see why Veritaserum isn't admissible evidence in courts either. A good analogy from the real world would be lie detectors. Just because they exist doesn't mean that interrogations and law courts are irrelevant.

For Veritaserum, I'd just make it so it is very easy to trick. The questions have to be very specific, and it is easy to tell half truths. For example, if Harry had been behind the attacks in the Chamber of Secrets and they'd interrogated him with "Are you behind the attacks?" he could say no because it was the Basilisk, and he is only controlling it. If they asked does he know who is behind them, he could say he doesn't, because while he knows it is the Basilisk behind the attacks, he doesn't personally know the Basilisk's personality, how he was created and stuff like that.

***** Yep. No idea why people want me to use it so much. The plot is already complex enough.

I'm very aware, rereading this thread, what an arsehole I look like. I honestly do appreciate everyone is giving me valuable advice and I can accept I need to make a few changes. All I can say in my defense is that it's crushing to write a complex story with suspenseful interrogations, conflicts that are fuelled by whether people are telling the truth or not, moments of action with clear and horrifying deadlines....... and to wake up to a review saying that they're not sure if the author is an idiot or the characters are for forgetting about a potion we see used once in canon.

Veritaserum, Polyjuice, House-Elves with their apparently very powerful magic, Moody's eye, and the Goblet of Fire's power to force people into a magical contract.

And so very underused in the books considering how powerful they are.

Drown all marked Death Eaters in Veritaserum, impersonate the bad guys to disgrace them, use House-Elves for more than cooking and cleaning, let Moody check trunks and post for dark items, throw Tom Riddle's (and Voldemort's, to be on the safe side) names in the Goblet of Fire and wait for him to turn up or lose his magic.

Polyjuice would probably be dead easy to get hold of, considering how immensely popular it would be for sexual purposes, both legal and illegal. Polyjuice would be cheaper than Harry's loose hairs...

** Regardless of if it's stupid (I personally feel it's alright - could be a little pesky, but Dumbledore did mention in HBP that it's not foolproof or all-powerful, not to mention it's supposed to be a hassle to brew or even obtain), it's in the books, and it's an established (and rather significant) part of canon, and therefore you should already be planning against that if you're going to write a fanfic set in the universe. Personally it's rather annoying when an author says "I know what you're thinking, but I just don't like that part of canon, so I'm going to plain ignore it" without warning the reader beforehand and without giving sufficient reason other than "I don't like it". And if you're going to pretend it didn't exist, you better have a damn good reason why this thing doesn't exist in your AU, and not just because it's convenient this way and otherwise it'd debunk your whole plot. Erasing a part of canon just for the sake of plot is rather uninventive and lazy writing, not to mention completely unconvincing and jarring.

I can accept that I should maybe have written a throwaway reason for them not to use it, but I really don't see why it's a big deal. I don't see how it's lazy to omit something that would have been a giant, overpowered short cut for the characters.

**** Why it's significant: it's a rather visible potion in the series, one of the most well-known, up there with Polyjuice. If you ask readers of the HP verse what's the most powerful, potent potion, a good portion of them are gonna answer Veritaserum. In-universe speaking, it's important, and even more so in war times. It's repeatedly mentioned - Snape threatened Harry with it as early as in second year, and it's only made more repeated appearances since then. People remember that stuff, and they're gonna think of it when they're trying to work a solution for the suspense, which is what readers are supposed to do and a rather important part of the reading process, and something writers are supposed to take into consideration.

You don't have to go into tons of details - all it really requires is /some/ explanation. You could say they don't have the money for the ingredients or to buy it. You could say the crop for a particular ingredient that's required is short this year, and it's been ruined by excessive rain or galloping gargoyles or something - just have a character mention it, takes two lines, tops. You could say they tried brewing some before, but it was sabotaged, and someone died in the resulting explosion and they're not trying that shit again anytime soon. You could say most of the competent potions brewers are dead, and the remaining ones are either arseholes or unwilling to help or both. Man, there are countless choices here - just give the readers /something./

As to timeturner - that's a different matter as obviously it's a more restricted substance/machine than Veritaserum, and you can't very well create one yourself with a handful of ingredients, some dedication, and a working potions lab. Plus it's well-established wizarding knowledge that you don't mess with time just-cause. Not to mention in canon, that shit's supposed to be gone after the MoM debacle in fifth year (don't know when your story's set in, but say it's post-books, then this works. No explanation needed. If any of your readers ask "why don't they use a timeturner?" then they're either idiots or not very careful readers of canon, and that's not your fault. Not providing reasoning for the sudden disappearance of an established aspect of canon, however, will be. It's not even like it takes a lot to do it.)

The reason why I personally see this kind of thing as lazy writing is because, like I said above, this thing is visible in the series, rather very visible in fact. I don't know the context of your story, but I imagine it could be that your readers were too nitpicky, or too out there with what's really feasible in the story, but it could also be that they have a point. However, just saying "this shit is stupid and should never have been in the series to begin with, it's just a stupid plot device, I'm gonna ignore it" doesn't really cut it for me. If I knew the context of your story, I could come up with a reason myself if I were reading - say, maybe the Aurors excluded the potion from the procedures at some point prior to the story's beginning. That's fine, if you make it clear that the Aurors system is different from what's in canon, then I could be fine with that. If the Aurors system looks much the same as it did in the books, however, I'm going to question why you chose to ignore some things while keeping the others.

If it's a bunch of unauthorized personnel trying to dig around themselves, then it's only natural they don't have access to it. Death Eaters? Maybe Snape was bullshitting to get out of brewing it, fine, but it should at least be brought up.

Canonically, it's allowed to be used in court cases. So if your character didn't use it in interrogation or investigation, then whatever, it's likely that it's illegal to do so. But if there's a court case, or if the Aurors are supposed to be rather immoral and doesn't give a shit except for finding out the truth, then it should be within their options to employ said potion. It all depends, and without the context of your story I can't say more. Just that, with what you wrote in the main body of the post, it sounded like you just would rather ignore it than give some reasoning to your ignoring it, which could be off-putting for the readers. Assuming it's not your readers that are being unreasonable, of course, like if someone suggested "just steal a time-turner and correct everything!!!jk".

Edit: and also, if you're only posting here to rally support for your view rather than gathering opinions, then you should ignore this, because obviously we aren't going to agree on this thing. Not saying you are. Just. You know, in case, cause I get rather tired of arguments if the other is already convinced of the thing.

I did, I told them I wasn't going to use it. My issue is that as a concept it's completely overpowered and feels very much like when people say stuff like "why doesn't Harry use a gun". The vast majority of my readers have continued to enjoy the story and haven't mentioned it - it's a small group of very persistent people who just can't let it go that I'm not going to use it. It's nitpickiness, and it's wanting an author to use overpowered and lazy plot devices at the expense of the story.

A certain new story disagrees, but I appreciate that's not really regarded as canon.

I'm not picking timeturner specifically - you could say the same for why doesn't Harry carry around a sneakoscope the whole time, or why doesn't he use a foeglass, or why doesn't he use Muggle technology or, as one reviewer mentioned, why hasn't he mastered legilimency within three years. There are plenty of times in the canon books when veritaserum or multiple other objects that have popped up along the way would have been useful, but JK Rowling didn't feel the need to run through each and every potential scenario and why it wouldn't work. It's ok to keep the pace of the story going by not mentioning things that aren't relevant. I haven't mentioned Veritaserum for the same reason Rowling didn't mention it when Harry and Co were at Malfoy Manor. The action is happening and it's jarring for characters to suddenly launch into issues of sourcing potion ingredients. Like, sure, you can imagine that as an alternative method, but that's not what the characters have done, and as long as what they are doing makes sense, that's fine.

People do this all the time. It's the basis for a huge number of fics. It's why people ignore the epilogue and Cursed Child. It's why people completely ignore Quidditch. It's why timeturners are constantly used even when they were meant to be destroyed in canon.

#+begin_quote
  That's fine, if you make it clear that the Aurors system is different from what's in canon, then I could be fine with that.

It's unbelievably frustrating to build up a detailed and complex plot, to make it clear to people that veritaserum will not be used, and to wake up to reviews calling you an idiot and saying "yeah I saw your reasoning but still veritaserum". It doesn't feel like constructive criticism, it feels like "GOTCHA!" and it's particularly hurtful, after so many months of effort, for someone to call you lazy for making your characters actually work to solve a mystery.

#+begin_quote

See, personally as a reader I hate that stuff. Just saying in the AN "okay, I know how canon went, but that's not how it goes here. No reason, just cos I don't like it." That feels like deus ex machina. Just because you say so, it is so. That's liable to jar me out of the story. What I'm saying is, even if you feel it's stupid - and believe me, I have some issues with some aspects of canon, too - what's written is written, and what JK wrote is already a part of canon, and what people accept as rules in this verse. If you want them to accept a different set of rules, you should ideally do it in the story, not in an AN. That's telling. The fact that it's an AN doesn't excuse it, only makes it worse. What does it take to retcon cannon with a few lines in the story? Personally I've been convinced of far, far more outlandish things than the absence of Veritaserum when the writer makes the effort to convert me within the text. I suppose an AN might be sufficient for some readers, but others (like me I guess) will just feel like it isn't enough.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not picking timeturner specifically...
#+end_quote

You make some good points here. Yes, I can see your reasoning. Without having read your story, however, I can't really make a judgement as to whether or not it was illogical for Veritaserum to have not made an appearance in the story. For the sake of argument, however: there are good and easily imaginable reasons for why Muggle technology, Sneakoscope, and Foeglass aren't used regularly (goes against wizarding customs/wizards aren't knowledgeable about it/etc., unreliable and you won't know why it's squealing only that it does, and Foeglass as seen in Moody's office is rather cumbersome to carry around.) Malfoy Manor - they didn't have it on hand, maybe Snape's been putting off brewing it by begging Headmaster duty. Even though I personally think it's stupid, but it seems in canon that other than Slughorn, the only one in England with the capacity of brewing it was Snape, so supply would naturally be short, and even if Voldemort has it, it isn't likely to be in the hands of a bunch of disgraced Death Eaters, a werewolf, and some lowly snatchers.

#+begin_quote
  I completely disagree. Veritaserum is barely used in canon, and it's not lazy to make life a little more difficult for your characters.
#+end_quote

I guess this is part of why you and I disagree. It left a strong impression on me from my times of reading it, but I guess it didn't do the same for you. Also - making life more difficult for your characters isn't lazy, but it should also at least make sense within the universe. It needs to be convincing for me. If available magic in canon simply disappears, just to make stuff harder, then it isn't convincing for me. Do some explaining, then I'll buy.

I'm with you on that it would probably be wise to mention the illegal thing earlier in the story. (But again, without having read the story, I can't say if it was really necessary or otherwise. My original argument stemmed purely from your text post.)

And - changing part of canon's *happenings* as a premise for the story is different, I feel, from simply changing its *rules* without adequate reason (but even in the case of the former, the suspense of disbelief only goes so far for each person. It would depend on what the author is changing.). If you're doing it not for a premise ("What if Veritaserum was never invented, and Barty Crouch Jr. never spat out his secrets in book 4?"), but simply for the convenience of it (e.g. so that this way they'll have to go through various obstacles to achieve a certain something), then that could be frustrating. I've seen it happen before.

From your descriptions it sounds like your story would have been fine on the three instances where readers think Veritaserum should make an appearance, but my disagreement rests mainly on the AN that states "Veritaserum doesn't exist here." I feel it would have been better if you provided actual reasons that would work within the story, instead of "what I say goes." (I know, you're already planning on doing that, it's a moot point.)

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote

Thing is, maybe it wasn't that clear to the readers that it won't (since you were aiming to make it appear as though it's not even there), and the reason for /why/ wasn't all that clear. I don't know. Some readers like myself prefer to have a reason and explanation for every change made to canon happenings and rules unless it's a complete AU, and the presence of Veritaserum in canon was a lot stronger in our minds. Some of your readers didn't share a headspace with you - most of them won't, in fact, and it's why I prefer to think an explanation beforehand is always preferable when it comes to erasing and rewriting canon rules.

I guess it would also be interesting to post a survey asking "Which potions made the strongest impression on you from the HP canon?"

** I don't think it's all that stupid, to be honest. Badly played, sure, but it does not have to be badly played.

I mean, thinking about it, it is nothing more than a potion that forces the one to whom it is given to answer the questions asked them with what they think is truth. Nothing more and nothing less. And what this means is that without properly formulating questions it is possible to get answers that are true and yet completely useless, and it also means that it is not wholly reliable because confounding or obliviating oneself before taking it can be used to change what the person thinks the true answer to be; the same about occlumency, in that one does not know if the answer really is genuine or if it's some rubbish the person basically self-hypnotised themselves into believing to be true. The glazed look could also suggest that the person's actual consciousness is, at the time right after taking it, so foggy that the person isn't really capable of acting on their own other than simply answering the questions and nothing more than that.

For example, I like to imagine that if someone actually asked Sirius, right after his capture, if he “killed the potters”, the answer they'd get would be “yes” as Sirius's immense guilt and not exactly stable state of mind would have led him to believe that his decision to make Peter the secret keeper killed him and as his decision it makes him directly responsible; after that, nobody would bother with asking how it is his fault or why he thinks so. Remember, the potion stops you from lying, not from saying what you think is true due to your own bad emotional state and the associated delusions if it just happens to not be the objective truth.

So really, all those scenes in fanfiction where it forces the characters to tell the truth and makes them incredibly eager to confess everything but does nothing to their mind, or where it acts like some sort of weird truth detector for confessions are, in my opinion, crap written by people who either don't know or don't care how veritaserum works. It could be used in stories well, as it is a plot device with clear purpose and fairly clear strengths and weaknesses, but when people ignore those because it's more convenient for them of course it will feel shoddy.

Also, I like to think that it is a fairly difficult potion to brew. I mean, they hadn't learned it in the first six years, whereas even something like amortentia (which is a heck of a potion) is covered in sixth year, so it is at the very least a NEWT-level thing and quite possibly something going even beyond that.

You don't ask "Did you kill the Potters?" and then stop after hearing "yes"; you ask for details. You ask for motivations. You get the whole story.

When I use Auror investigations, I generally have them focus on finding the suspect. Sifting through memories in a pensieve (and checking for signs of memory modifications by checking other memories). Getting witnesses. Finding clues. Veritaserum generally doesn't play much of a role, mostly to confirm suspicions - finding and arresting the people you want to use it on is the challenge.

See: Sirius Black's case. There wasn't even a trial. I won't be surprised if during the first war, all Crouch did if he ever used Veritaserum was ask "Did you or did you not have a part in the torture/murder of who and who?" and then if it's a yes, then to the Dementors with you.

Of course it all depends - if your Auror's supposed to be a smart one, then sure, don't stop there.

That said, my point with the question to Sirius was that it's possible to get answers with veritaserum that are incriminating and yet could not be further from the truth as far as the actual crime and stuff go; someone like Barty Crouch, if he'd actually bothered at the time, would have taken it as sufficient because of the (fabricated) evidence of guilt already found ... which is exactly what happened in canon but they took Sirius's ramblings as truth and didn't even bring out veritaserum.

**** Not at all. Here's a small quote from the book:

/“Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat, expressionless voice.”/

There's no cheerfulness there, and though he talks quite a bit, all of it is related and all of it counts as answers to the questions he'd been asked---meaning there is not a single thing he says that is not an answer to something he'd been asked and said of his own initiative---and furthermore one could argue that the time he spent under the Imperius curse could have caused the effect of veritaserum to be a bit more pronounced on him in that regard (or, alternatively, he might have actually wanted to tell for whatever reason; he was not exactly sane, after all).

I do not know where you took the “cheerfully confess everything” bit from, but I assume the movies, and in any case the answer is “no”. The one important bit is that you are dealing with an automaton of sorts as far as the person under veritaserum's answers go, and how much information they give when asked is up to you as the author; but they have to be asked to say things, which is the point that so many fanfic authors are missing, alongside the fact that it's a controlled potion and that it takes at least a month to brew and is not the easiest one at that.

I'm sorry that you've been getting hassle about it, even after mentioning it in at least one AN. It's not something that'd ever bother me, as I'm completely fine with authors picking which parts of canon they want to include in their story.

With regards to veritaserum and canon (it's been years since I read the books and this might be contrary to something stated by JKR), I'd imagine that it's something one builds up a resistance to very quickly. As in, one or two uses on somebody at most. It's also expensive to brew, requires specific, rare ingredients (which require a legal permit for each transaction) and a complex recipe, so most people capable of brewing it are unlikely to do so without the Ministry noticing.

I'd also imagine it is like sodium thiopental IRL, in that its effectiveness is over-estimated by the general public, and that it's a fine line between using enough of it to get the truth from someone, and poisoning them. Umbridge is an idiot who buys into the whole automatically-spill-all-secrets thing, whereas Snape plays on public perception of it to intimidate Harry.

Finally, I, for one, love 'The Aurors' and really hope to see a sequel!

** I think it's hard to make, expensive, and very time consuming to make. However, I think the Ministry would have quite a large stock of it made by their own Potions Masters or people they contract. Remember, the Ministry doesn't spend its entire existence waging wars and using potions stocks in large quantities daily. So I believe that the Ministry's stockpile of Veritaserum under a stasis charm would be very sizable and I believe they would have enough to, at minimum, dose hundreds of people.

We have differing opinions on it. In OOTP, Snape says it would make even Voldemort spill all of his deepest, darkest, and most cordoned off secrets. In HBP, Dumbledore says it isn't all powerful. I prefer Snape's point of view, if Veritaserum can be defeated, then what is the point of using a difficult to brew and expensive potion in getting the truth out of criminals who've gone through quite a bit of trouble in avoiding the law? If it can be resisted by even the most talented Occlumens, then in my mind, its effectiveness should be put into question. After all, if it's not all powerful or too expensive to make, then surely some people might put some effort at remedying it? It is a truth potion. Yes, it is said that it is the strongest one out there, but it would be questionable to me if it wasn't truly effective.

I think an "all powerful" Veritaserum is fine, if it isn't used on everybody. A slightly flawed Veritaserum, while it bugs me, seems to be more reasonable in the context of the stories I read.

On the other hand, imagine the damage a minister could do if they dosed the 100 most powerful and influential people and got all their secrets. I doubt pure blood wizards would risk that. (hell, maybe that happened in the past, resulting in a limit?). There is also the possibility that Veratiserum use is considered immoral, since you force a suspect to confess. In the muggle world, forced confessions aren't admissible in court.

Considering this, you could say the ministry has only 3 vials of Veratiserum in stock. Enough to use in life or death situations [[/s][The Aurors Spoiler]] but not nearly enough for normal day to day use.

Then its just a matter of destroying this small stockpile (sabotage, ingredient scarcity, ministry incompetence?).

In the case of The Aurors: [[/s][Spoilers]]

I can understand not wanting to use Veratiserum especially since The Aurors is a great story but it is, unfortunately, a part of the world of Harry Potter. Ignoring it doesn't remove it from the memory of reader. It made the ministry, Harry included, seems a bit incompetent by "forgetting" and that the outcome could have been better if someone just remembered it existed.

** Haven't delved through all 90-something comments yet but have you considered the idea of a counter-agent? The 'bad guys' get the sense that Veritaserum is going to make their clandestine actions much more difficult, so they order Snape to come up with a cure. Since the counter-potion is equally rare and expensive to make, and still won't counter the potion until the two get to mix, he takes another tack- finding something that will neutralize it before the truth-telling effect would take hold. The best he could find was an inoculation of [obscure but common creature gland]; if the inoculate is given Veritaserum, they'll die within seconds as the two substances turn toxic.

The first time the Aurors discover this is post-war when capturing one of the ex-Death-Eaters on the run. He retched and turned orange within five seconds of the first drop entering his mouth. Only by autopsy did they discover the cause, and the Healers have no way to tell who has been exposed to the substance that would cause the toxicity. Therefore use of Veritaserum is a possible death-sentence without any truth in the bargain.

** In a crime mystery suspense story, I agree it probably doesn't make sense as its a bit OP. I would just put an authors note in the beginning saying that it doesn't exist in your universe. No reason you have to have everything be exactly the same as canon. I don't see a problem with using it in other stories though where solving crimes and thus interviewing suspects isn't central to the plot.

It could also be an interesting plot device if you(not you specifically for your story, but someone in general) modify it so while it requires the person to literally say the truth, they can say something that will be interpreted one way, but means something different and lie by omission. So the user would need to pay very careful attention to their wording of the questions they ask and the person being interrogated's wording of their answer. Like with the Aes Sedai in WoT.
