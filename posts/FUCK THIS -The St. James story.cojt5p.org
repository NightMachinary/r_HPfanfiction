This is an idea for a fanfic series that has been floating around in my head for a while . I am going to post a bit of it. I would like to get people feed back on the premise and if anyone would accurately read it.

Marco Augustus Octavian St. James stared blankly as the smoldering ashes of his Ancestral home. His brothers battered an bleeding around him, his father screaming for help from the flames. Aquamenti would do him no good with this blaze, fiendsfyre had started this blaze.

Marco was numb, an icy cold had Desended over his very soul. His father was burning to death before his eyes and he could do nothing. Dad was as good as dead. Dad was dying, DAD IS DEAD. Came roaring from the depths of his mind. Those asseating carpenter munchers KILLED MY DAD .

“FUCK THIS!” The only words spoken by any of the brothers as they watched their home burn and there father parish. Marco screamed it again and turned away from the raging inferno. He made eye contact with Bastian and repeated himself again. Bastian still shaking nodded once and whispered “Fuck this”.

It was a declaration of war as well as a sob of agony. The St . James clan was pissed.

Harry Potter May have won the war but he wasn't the only one fighting it. Voldemort actions Roused a hydra, with seven heads, each more vicious than the last. The death Eaters saught to slay an enemy before he was a threat, they cut the head off the hydra , but seven from the next generation grew in his stead. The St. James boys were out for blood.


** Aguamenti not aquamenti.

** Based on canon Fiendfyre, none could have survived. Throwing that out of the window, that has to be the shittiest OC name I have seen in quite some time. Marco does not fit the rest of the naming scheme (Marius would be more fitting). The triple first name comes across more snobby than Malfoy. The Saint prefix is generally bestowed upon by the pope (or equivalent orthodox authorities) and is not hereditary either way. With those formalities out of the way, what exactly is the purpose of that fic?

If you want to write ruthless revenge, Harry will go down better than OCs. If you want a family working for revenge, kill off Molly and Arthur in 81 and have the Weasleys go dark. If you want next-gen revenge, Teddy works just as well. Who would be the target for them? Because as much as I detest the existence of Scorpius, killing him for what Draco did does not really seem appropriate unless you go full "Mafia" and execute his entire family one by one in front of Draco, but even then that would be rather evil.

The way you set up your idea also leaves little room for creativity since you have Voldemort himself and not Umbridge (and by extension the Ministry) responsible and as future targets. Hunting down collaborators one by one has not been done in fanfics very often, Voldemort and his Death Eaters as opponents have been sucked dry. And after the second war, there aren't that many possible targets around (I am assuming that this is post Battle of Hogwarts since after the first war, the only attack was on the Longbottoms)

*** This is a portion of the first chapter. I am going for an OC pureblood family that was more a middle of the road family if you have the dark grey and light canon wizards in some fics. I am thinking a family that was neutral until Voldemort demanded there father kneel to the dark lord or be destroyed kind of premise. As for fiendfyre the post says Ancestral home. So they are a Malfoy style family. This is an OC fic where a normally political neutral family that is push to the point the say fuck it and this has gone to family. They are out for vengeance against the death eaters and Voldemort and want to end the war and the blood shed any way possible. This more of an OC (Dark Mauraders) fic kind of vibe I am going for . But If the name doesn't fit I might change it.The fanfic would be very OC character wise, but using the Harry Potter setting more than anything else

**** Then you are contradicting yourself when you bring up the Harry bit. If Harry has already won the war, there is not much left to do. Otherwise, why would you bring Harry up?

**** That's a pretty unusual last name for the UK. I've never come across anyone with the word 'saint' in their surname - very occasionally you hear about St. John being used as a first/middle name but it's pronounced 'Sin-jin'. I'm going to be honest the name of the character feels fairly ridiculous and Gary-Stu like.

****** Blackwell is much better. I would also keep it to one middle name if I were you, or at least resist revealing them all from the start. We didn't find out about Dumbledore's many names until OOTP, for example.

** You should absolutely write this, because literally any story you want to write is better than not writing at all. It being a first draft means it will be absolutely terrible, since first drafts are, but can be revised into something better. Then write another story and so on... Eventually come back to this, see if it has merit and went somewhere interesting, but even if it didn't, writing it will have taught you a whole lot.

It may not be received with joy, but one of the reasons some people write is to end up with stories no one else will write for them. That means sometimes you end up with a story only a handful of people will ever like. Sometimes a 'terrible' story will turn out to be actually popular. (The snippet posted needs a great deal of revision but I have seen /so/ much worse, and the point of the first draft is to tell /yourself/ the story, then you can clean it up later.)

The fun thing about this particular one is that, with a little rewriting, it could end up as an original work. That frees you up to use non-canon magic and make up your own names for spells. If canon ends up feeling like a straightjacket, consider going that route.

If you end up with an audience of one, you're still way, /way/ ahead of anyone who writes nothing at all.

** It's an interesting perspective but might want to look at making it less revenge and more that want to stop the insanity of war without waiting on. Harry to do it. And allies kind of deal instead
