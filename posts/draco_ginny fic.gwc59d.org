:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to remember the name of a fanfic from fanfiction.net that I read in like 2013 or something. The fic was really dark and it was a romance fic between Ginny and Draco. I remember that they started dating after re-meeting at a country club that Ginny worked at over the summer. I also remember that throughout the fic, Ginny would have dreams about Tom Riddle. I never finished it so I don't know how it ends, but I'm kind of curious about it. Thanks!


** It's called Envy and Manipulations by rrabbit. It's not finished. Happy reading.
