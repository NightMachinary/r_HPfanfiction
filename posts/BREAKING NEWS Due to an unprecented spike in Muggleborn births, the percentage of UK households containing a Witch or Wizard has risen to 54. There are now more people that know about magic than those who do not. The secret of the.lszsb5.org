** Minister Hermione Weasley was a tough old bird as the kids would say.

In her 55 years of life (39 dedicated to her people), she had always primarily thought through situations with steely logic, analysing each scenario from three dozen different angles. She had steered her country through decades of incidents and turmoil with extreme efficiency.

Tonight however she was utterly stumped on how to handle this new situation. No matter what alternative ideas she attempted to formulate in her mind, she knew that there was one, inevitable outcome to the recent statistics on Muggleborn births. It had to be done.

With a flick of her wand, her otter Patronus materialized and was sent away with a message comprising of just two words

/It's time/

In less than a minute following her Patronus' depature, the fireplace crackled as her husband walked into her office, their best friend stepping in through the door almost simultaneously.

"Boys." said Minister Weasley. They weren't boys, hadn't been since they were 14. Their lives had been dark and difficult. Together, they would ensure no other magical child ever had to go through something like that ever again.

"The students are afraid. Their parents are afraid. It's December and we're still trying to track down a quarter of the Muggleborns given letters this past year." said Ron, uncharacteristically solemn.

"Bigot rats are assembling as we speak. They lounge in their manors, telling each other how these children are opressing them. That they need to be taken care of." said Harry, shaking sligthy with pure rage.

Hermione sighed. The world she had grown up in was about to be destroyed, for better or for worse.

"People will want us heads for this. May be years before we can go out in public again, in either world..." she said

"So be it." said Harry.

"Best not keep the man waiting." said Ron throwing the powder into the fireplace and shouting out the name of their destination.

Together, the Minister Of Magic, Headmaster of Hogwarts and Head Auror stepped into the fireplace and walked out in front of the Muggle Prime Minister. The man had clearly not slept for a long time.

"Hello Jack." said Hermione

The man let out a deep sigh that sounded as though it came from his the depths of his soul.

"Suppose this had to happen eventually." He picked up his phone. "Moira, schedule an emergency press meeting for the next half hour. Take over every ruddy channel in this country!"

It was time for magic and muggle to unite. It would be a long time before all was well

** This could lead to a lot of problems. The first problem would be that the statute of secrecy wouldn't hold. They would have to come out to the world.

And if 54% of households now had a witch or wizard living in the home would mean a huge increase in the wizarding population. A population that was once in the thousands (in the uk) would suddenly sky rocket. Can the would even support that many wizards when it comes to supplying wands and magical equipment

No to mention the social effect that would be hand. Muggles would still out number wizards, and every country would be scrambling to take advantage of the fact they now have walking weapons available to them. Not the mention the laws that would be rushed through to control the wizarding population.

** It was the late June of 2008. The students were gone for the summer, and it was time for the Hogwarts Transfiguration Mistress and newly promoted Deputy Headmistress Hermione Granger to do her most solemn duty.

She savoured the sense of history as she walked up the steps of the hidden tower, to the room where the Quill of Acceptance and the Book of Admittance worked in their thousand-year partnership, to find the magical children of the British Isles and bring them to Hogwarts.

She paused before opening the book, thinking back to what had brought her to this moment. How, in the summer of 1991, then-Professor-now-Headmistress McGonagall welcomed the obnoxious girl who loved books into this world. How she made friends with Harry (now a pro Seeker) and Ron (now working for the Ministry like his father and brother) and had three years of death-defying adventures. And, the harrowing Triwizard tournament of their fourth year, and its bizarre conclusion.

Harry and Cedric (now heading the Department of Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, following in his father's footsteps) had disappeared with the prize cup, only to reappear half an hour later, Cedric unharmed, Harry a bit anaemic, and neither having any memory of what had happened.

Dumbledore had taken the matter in stride, disappearing for several hours, only to return, oddly subdued. Alastor Moody was found in his trunk. He was ultimately persuaded to teach Defence in their fifth year.

Life went on. Outside of Hogwarts, there was a Death Eater breakout attempt from Azkaban---with no survivors. "Sirius Black" (according to the Ministry) assassinated Lucius Malfoy, and then went down the list of Death Eaters who had avoided Azkaban. The Ministry tried desperately to catch the murderer, but all in vain. A few months later, the murderer ran out of victims, and disappeared. (Actual Sirius denied responsibility vehemently, and never did return to England. He had spent the prior decade and a half visiting every tropical paradise in the world. Every winter, she and others would receive letters with photographs and tempting offers to join him.)

But inside Hogwarts, it was a very ordinary year. She and Harry made Prefect, and Harry declared his intent to play Quiddich professionally; Ron as well. Hermione was not sure---she wanted to go into politics to save house elves from their lot, but she didn't exactly have an "in"; she had to raise consciousness first. And, looking at Professor McGonagall across the desk, she knew what she had to do.

She asked, and her favourite teacher became her mentor. She even got an animagus form before her OWL (an actual owl of all things; public and registered, of course).

In her sixth year, Snape (whom the mysterious assassin had spared) taught Defence, then retired from Hogwarts to do research and brew Potions for an exclusive clientele. Last she heard, he was getting married.

She had made Best Girl. Draco Malfoy, of all people, made Best Boy. She had discovered then, that all too many people thought that it was a Hogwarts tradition that the two date---and received no end of teasing about it from Harry, Ron, Parvati, and Lavender. Fortunately, Draco thought as little of that tradition as she had, and was just as annoyed. He had even apologised to her for his past words and actions; he seemed sincere. They had been able to work together wrangling the Prefects well enough.

Hermione continued her Transfiguration studies. She even managed to make a contribution or two to the field, establishing her bona fides to be a Professor at Hogwarts.

Dumbledore retired, handing the headmastership to McGonagall, creating an opening for the Transfiguration Master. Hermione applied, and got the position. It /did/ draw accusations of favouritism, but she couldn't let that affect her. /She/ knew she was the best of them, and that was what mattered.

Before he left, Dumbledore called in Harry, herself, and a select number of younger Order members and told them what he knew about Voldemort; about his horcruxes, in particular.

"Do we need to destroy them?" asked Harry.

Dumbledore surprised them. "I think that going after Voldemort would be counterproductive and cause far more harm than good. Harry, I know that he killed your parents, and you are not obligated to forgive him, and yet, I believe that you should stay your hand. I think that he has found his own kind of redemption.

"After you and Mister Diggory were returned, I searched for the site of your abduction and found it where I expected: in Little Hangelton, where Tom Riddle's father was buried. There, I found traces of an old restoration Potion, as well as the bodies of Peter Pettigrew and Barty Crouch Junior---a young Death Eater who had impersonated Alastor Moody.

"I knew then, that he was back, but I was also puzzled by his intentions. There is a prophecy, Harry, one that ties your fates together; that predicts that one of you shall destroy the other. He had you in his power; he could have easily destroyed you then, yet he had taken no more than he needed to regain a body; and he killed only his own servants. The murders of the years that followed---which spared Severus and Sirius, yet struck those who served him in earnest but claimed to have been under the Imperius---solidified my view that Voldemort was making a peace offering to us.

"I have been monitoring England---and many other places---over the years for evidence that he was once again gathering forces; and yet there was none. I pass this knowledge to you all now so that you can keep watch when I am gone."

And so the Order of the Phoenix continued, in a new form. Many wands made light work. (Also, it turned out that Sirius had been a part of Dumbledore's international monitoring efforts all along---which hadn't stopped him from enjoying every minute of it.)

A few years later, she volunteered to take on Deputy Headmastership, which brought her to the present.

She opened the book, and counted off the names of children who had turned eleven between 1 September 2007 and 31 August 2008.

She paused when she reached two hundred, and conjured a chair to sit down.

Her own cohort, conceived in the worst days of the civil war, had been small (about forty students) and disproportionately Muggleborn (whose parents had been blissfully unaware of the war). The subsequent cohorts were bigger, reaching about eighty in the prior year, encouraged by the pro-natal incentives of the recent government. (If Arthur and Molly had their seven children today, they would have received a stipend from the Ministry for each child, and have had their wand and Hogwarts supplies paid for.) A fringe faction, calling themselves "Exogamists", were also raising a ruckus, arguing that the world could be improved by interbreeding with Muggles and thus endowing more people with magic.

But this could not explain the over a hundred Muggleborn wizards and witches she was seeing. Sure, an enterprising Exogamist a decade prior might have done something, but that would predate the movement by years, and the sheer number suggested a whole conspiracy.

She continued counting, ending up at a total of three hundred and sixty. It was an auspicious number, only five days short of a year.

The only question was, who could do this, and not get caught?

McGonagall heard her report and ordered all hands on deck: Exogamist or not, they were children who were entitled to magic, and the Professors had a lot of introducing to do.

The parade of dark haired, quick-witted, articulate children---girls and boys both---with handsome, aristocratic features; their stories of controlled accidental magic; and their Muggle parents' whispered stories of psychopathic traits in all too many of them, told her everything she needed to know.

The Ministry was in panic. Delegates to ICW from other countries were accusing them of raising a halfblood army to wage war. Ollivander and his apprentices worked nights, as did Potions ingredient suppliers. Hogwarts braced for the biggest cohort in its thousand-year history---and Hermione, having checked the next several years of the book, knew that it was only the beginning.

She could already see what was going to happen. Simply put, outside of the few who chose incest, most of the half-siblings sired by Tom Riddle would not be able to find partners among wizards, forcing them to seek partners among Muggles, bringing even more into the fold, creating exponential growth.

And he was immortal, able to do this for as long as it took.

Lord Voldemort had chosen a different form of immortality---and a different way to eliminate Muggles.

** We should have been prepared. The rate had steadily been rising - had anyone important cared to look it up. Even stranger were tangentially related reports (only some of which held up under intense scrutiny) of known squibs performing accidental magic. They'd become supremely good at hiding themselves, though - either assimilating completely into the wizarding world or completely vanishing into the muggle one.

As it always did, the wheel of politics refused to spin quickly enough. The problem was shelved, debated, fear mongered and finally it grew too large for any newly started measures to have any hope of containing it.

By the point the politicians noticed, wizards of "pure blood" were swiftly becoming a swindling minority. No amount of propaganda could radicalize a population against itself, and no measures to quantify the purity of muggleborns gained real hold. Yet still, no measures of integration were actually passed. The government simply carried on as always, even as the economy crashed around them - too little space, not enough liquid currency, no expansion permits for old wizarding spacws or construction permits for new ones.

And eventually, it reached the breaking point, and snapped. It happened almost exactly as one third of the world population was identified to be magical. Old institutions simply... broke against the might of the people. There is little one can do when one's power rests in a squad of 100 aurors up against a hundred thousand armed, starved, disenfranchised revolutionaries. The smart ones laid down their weapons and surrendered... the dumb ones were quickly subdued.

When the old government had been dissolved and its key figures forcibly retired, a new government grew from the ashes. Little remained of the old system - a magical democracy based on the model of magical switzerland's measures to emulate the muggle version was created, and britain's magical world experienced a period of expansion that was unprecedented. Thousands who'd been barred from work found jobs creating the new world - large cities were constructed under veiling magics, which was more of a courtesy for the rapidly falling Statute than any real concern for secrecy.

When half of all humans on earth were magical, with the occasional adult muggle developing arcane potential, a vote was put forth at the ICW and swiftly shot down. "It's tradition!" they cried, hiding their heads in the sand.

When the nation of Iceland reported that all its inhabitants were magical, the vote was reopened, and still shot down, but more quietly.

When three quarters of all humans were magical, and ninety percent of all humans were aware of magic, the vote was opened a final time.

The fallout was not as large as could be expected - one of the largest communities unaware of magic was a cult based in north america, which attempted to have its members commit mass suicide to escape their fate of becoming magical themselves, but was quickly dissolved and its members treated for indoctrination by the rapidly evolving police forces across the planet.

When the last human on earth began to show signs of the Seer Blood, humanity celebrated as one. The age of steel had ended; and the age of magic had begun.

** Okay, can someone make a no-maj-centric (but not no-maj-wank, more of a sidestory kinda thing) fic with this? My contribution is that the first gens of Hogwarts find this out and decide to take action to make their own pseudo-secret community of just families of first gen and no-maj-raised. Like the kids at Hogwarts come up with a universal system of passphrases to tell their parents to ask in conversation to see if the other conversational partners are aware of magic so they can talk freely with each other.

I say pseudo-secret because they don't particularly care if the wizards find out, but do have to abide by the Statute of Secrecy so they have to make sure it stays a secret from the no-majes.

PS-Yes i use no-maj while talking about a fic that is most likely set in Britain, I'm American so I'll use American Magical word conventions.

*** There's a fic called "A Wizard's Guide to 'Banking'" that's basically about this - some muggleborns, mad about the fact that most of their classmates who stayed in the wizarding world got killed by blood purists, tampered with a major sperm bank in the UK to ensure all the muggle sperm was swapped with magical sperm, with the end result of the year below Harry's year seeing the number of muggle borns jump from like 10-15 to a few thousand, radically flipping the demographics.

Or is it more stretched out, as in 1965 5% of all UK houses had a muggleborn baby and over x amount of years muggles kept getting muggleborn babies in such a rate that, let's say 12 years later, 54% of all UK houses had a muggleborn living in it?
