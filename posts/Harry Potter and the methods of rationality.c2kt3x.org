Has anyone read it? It's so amazing right?


** Just in case you're not joking, HPMoR is probably the most controversial fanfic out there.

** It's got some amazingly good and absolutely terrible properties.

It's quite well-written, the humor is quite good, it's got action, good worldbuilding, creative use of spells, a Voldemort who isn't a complete idiot and actual foreshadowing and clues.

But the main characters are all eleven year olds who act like young adults, and Harry's a complete jerk.

If you're willing to overlook the issue of firsties casting advanced spells all the time and discussing quantum physics, it's a pretty damn good fic.

*** Especially as their discussions about quantum mechanics are mostly unproven theories or just plain wrong. This would normally not be an issue, but the writer puts so much emphasis on this "rational" thing, that it feels bad to read, as he gives an illusion of being educated in a way he is definitely not.

** /Pikachu surprise face/

It's certainly the first fic I read and got me hooked but I think it's mid-tier at best

** What @thrkleon was saying: there are people for whom it is THE BEST fanfiction ever, or perhaps the only fanfiction they are willing to read. There are other people who didn't like it for various reasons. I am in the second category (not overly aggressive, there are some parts which are interesting), but whenever I say it aloud, I am attacked by herd of wild gnus for desecrating their beloved story.

** Both times I've tried to read it, the 15 chapter long Azkaban sequence drains my will to live and I drop it.

I can tolerate an obnoxious main character who is an author self insert that speaks like the front page of [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]] all the time. I can deal with the Ender's Game nonsense, even the Moste Ancient Blade shite. I can even bear the whole "Quirrell is obviously a bad dude yet Harry continually stays close to him" thing.

But when you stretch a sequence that needed, at most, 3 chapters into being essentially a novel in its own right? And when you accomplish this mainly by having unnecessarily long internal monologues and page after page of ranting about transhumanism and dementors or nuclear weapons as an allegory for the author's opinions on AI research? Then you lose my good will and I give up trying.

It's a shame. The first third or so, where a smart science loving Harry applies scientific principles to magic, works on getting Draco to prove pureblood supremacy is nonsense etc was super promising. But then it essentially abandons that idea in favour of becoming Ender's Game and then becoming a weird Prison Break story.

**** But that's fundamentally my point. 30k words for something skippable, just for the author to pat himself on the back endlessly. That's where I lose the will to fight through the other smaller issues. I'll probably read the last section one day.

... You know it's more than just a section, right? That 30k words is 30 out of over 600, 12 chapters out of 122. The end of the Azkaban arc is just over halfway through the story.

****** Sure. Like I say, one day I'll read it. But the Azkaban sequence drains my will to spend time in the HPMOR world, since it's a microcosm of everything bad about the story
