** Someone she meets later in life after Hogwarts.

Very non-committal I know but even if it was a character from the series the whole school romance subplot felt very "out of left field" for her character development up to that point.

I still think she'd end up being someone who married a Muggle really given her personality and political viewpoints.

Harry & Ron > Harry or Ron

But of course it all depends on story writing, for example I tremendously enjoyed her with a non evil Bellatrix in extreme AU “Murder Most Horrid”.

Or I don't think she should get together with Ron in that fanfic written by Steve Kloves, aka the Movies.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

******* It's an assault, certainly, and I support prosecuting it, but I wouldn't call it a sexual one, thus I wouldn't label it "rape".

Suppose I grab your hand and slam it down on a sharp object, injuring you. I have compelled you to do something that you wouldn't consent to, and I should be charged with assault. But it's not the type of assault that we call "rape". It's not /intimate/ enough, not a violation of your inner privacy.

Now, suppose that, instead of simply Confunding the examiner, Ron used Legilimency to delve into his memories, identify his psychological triggers, and manipulate that to trick the examiner into giving him a passing mark even though he didn't deserve it. Maybe working out how best to gain the examiner's sympathy, or how best to distract him from noticing errors. That would be much closer to rape, in my opinion, because of how it invades and exploits the person's innermost thoughts.

** It depends on which dynamic the author chooses.

I am fond of someone "corrupting" Hermione and pushing her to her limits (although not beyond it). Fleur and Tonks both work very well for that, Tonks seems more fun and outgoing in canon while Fleur's haughtiness can lead to entertaining scenes. Obviously, those do not work well in fics which focus on the war, so they are best suited for AUs (eg Voldemort is defeated in the DoM) or postwar fics.

For a more natural grow, Harry, especially if they get together during the hunt out of desperation (the need to feel some kind of human emotion other than despair) when it was them two against the world.

H/Hr/G is intriguing, but I haven't really found a good fic for that, so it is mostly theoretical (postwar environment, finding comfort together or simply waking up together with a hangover but no clothes).

Although to be honest, I am open for any lesbian pairing with Hermione as long as the partner is within ten years of her. I hate the fanon for most male characters, especially Neville, and the few interesting guys (Moody, James and Sirius) are not exactly what I'd consider good shipping options. Meanwhile, the only annoying fanon girls I can think of are Daphne and SeerLuna. Although I wouldn't say no to Hermione/"male Muggleborn name-only" either.

Harry was miserable because not only was he deserted by most of the students, but also by his best friend. What you perceive as "bored" is him feeling alone and betrayed.

#+begin_quote
  The next few days were some of Harry's worst at Hogwarts. The closest he had ever come to feeling like this had been during those months, in his second year, when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow students. But Ron had been on his side then. He thought he could have coped with the rest of the school's behavior if he could just have had Ron back as a friend, but he wasn't going to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron didn't want to. Nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all sides.

  He could understand the Hufflepuffs' attitude, even if he didn't like it; they had their own champion to support. He expected nothing less than vicious insults from the Slytherins --- he was highly unpopular there and always had been, because he had helped Gryffindor beat them so often, both at Quidditch and in the Inter-House Championship. But he had hoped the Ravenclaws might have found it in their hearts to support him as much as Cedric. He was wrong, however. Most Ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name.

***** Thing is - Harry still had Hermione's support through that period. And he appreciated it. And yet he was still miserable, because much as he respects her skills and values her company, she doesn't make him happy by her presence. She's not the most important person in his life, even though she's in the top 5. He might well be willing to die for her - that's the kind of person he is, for his friends - but he wouldn't be happy living with her.

I have my doubts about Ron/Hermione, too. I didn't see any particular attraction between them. Ron does pay more attention to her life than Harry does, but that's a /really/ low bar.

I like to see how the authors work with the dynamics to turn them into relationships that are at least semi-healthy and work.

I noticed other people in this thread who like these pairings are being downvoted for their preferences.

I guess there are a lot of young boys here who can't fathom there being people with different preferences. At least I hope... Thought policing seems to be more and more widespread and accepted and it's super scary. Just the other day I was reading an article about how Cathay Airlines HK workers' phones were put under surveillance for dissenting thoughts.

****** Fanfiction is all about "what would happen if x thing happened differently" or "how could x happen in a believable way". It's all speculation and trying to find solutions to issues that seem impossible is a lot of fun. It's fanfiction, things that happened in canon never happen, or the characters are completely different. I read almost anything and I have yet to find a fanfiction where the negative actions you're alluding to were presented in a positive light. But you have to say this, otherwise it would just be a case of "what I don't like=bad".

The only thing this is about is trying to silence people who want to read things you don't like. I don't think you'll argue with me on that.

Ironically, it's how the original nazis did things too. And now we see it related to the HK protests. But it happens everywhere, most people don't like to think other people have different preferences than them, sexual, fictional, or any other kind. And those who do things like that, going to other people and trying to control how they think and what they say, never think they're in the wrong.

He has no one but himself to blame when he picked his wannabe Death Eater friends over Lily. She gave him more than one opportunity to chose a different path. His heart is not abused, it is self-mutilated.

So he can live longer in prison for statutory rape. Because that's what you call a teacher sleeping with a student.

I never understood this argument in relation to Snape/student ships. Sure, a fifty year old and a seventy year couple could work fine, but I don't see how living longer makes a relationship between thirty-something year old Snape and a teenager ok.
