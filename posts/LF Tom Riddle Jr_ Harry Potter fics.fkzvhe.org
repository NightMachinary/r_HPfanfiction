Idk why but I've come to long for these so much-- I don't really want any where Harry's older (like harrys 30) and most preferably they'd both be in Hogwarts and going together.

I read (and okay I'm remembering these names from the top of my head) Tie A Locked Around My Throat (grrr I know it's the wrong name) and Blurred Realities (?) and Full Circle and so anything similar would be good.

SIDENOTE: im specifically looking for TOM and Harry NOT Voldemort /Harry. üòä

#+begin_quote
  When Harry goes to Hogwarts, he finally understands that having a d√¶mon is normal. Only, the wizarding world never anticipated that Harry's d√¶mon would be an 11 year old Tom Riddle. AU Harry Potter inspired by His Dark Materials.

** My first recommendation would be ***1)‚ÄúTo kill you with a kiss‚Äù by Paimpont the author uses a very flowery language and the relationship between Tom and Harry is absolutely beautiful they truly love each other and best of all Harry isn't ooc. Honestly everything written by this author is gold.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6655266/1/To-Kill-You-With-A-Kiss]]

***2)Teaching History (is Old News) by You Light The Sky is also a very good TR/HP fanfic although they aren't students they are still very young and their dynamic is written beautifully! Harry is a seer in this story and the humor is also very good.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11973276/30/Teaching-History-is-Old-News]]

***3) Earning His Notice by Lomonaaeren Description: A series of fics where Harry Potter has traveled back in time to Tom Riddle's youth, and has managed to avoid Tom's notice at Hogwarts by pretending to be an ordinary Muggleborn and then working in an apothecary's shop thereafter...a plan that comes crashing to the ground when one of Tom's Knights attacks the shop where he works.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1174940]]

4)a boy so pretty (such a pity) asterismal (asterisms) A cute one shot were Harry is oblivious and paranoid and Tom is just in love. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19316050]]

5)When in Rome by XblackcatwidowX its a unique story were Harry and Hermione accidentally go back to Tom's timeline.

6) Falling slowly series by Flufferdoodle is Another time travel fic short sweet and to the point. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/638393]]

7)History Rewritten by FreezePride Harry is a sort of mentor but he is still young and it's very well written.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13590255/chapters/31195569]]

8)On Your Best Behaviour by duplicity Tom's diary was never destroyed so once the final battle is over he becomes fascinated with Harry. What I like about this story is that Ron and Hermione are loyal through and through. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21568204/chapters/51420952]]

9) But For You, I Did by duplicity a one shot story were Harry de-ages himself to set a good example to Tom its from the same author above.

10) The Perfect Murder by QuillOfFortune its a bit inspired by the movie strangers on a train. It's not a school fic but I think it's still worth recommending.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3885466/chapters/8687344]]

11) To Seduce A Gryffindor by DarkkBluee Description: Tom and Cedric both have their sights set on the oblivious Gryffindor Harry Potter. Who will end up with the prize? And what lengths are they willing to go for it?

12)Running Up That Hill rightonthelimit its a one-shot alternate universe were Tom is deaf it has no magic but it's cute and I would recommend it if you want to try something different.

13)The Puzzle of Harry Parker by TheFeistyRogue another time travel fic that is a one-shot

14)Times of Peace by conquerorofheaven Summary: Harry is drinking his life away as usual. Suddenly, he's back in the past, 1943 to be exact. Harry's given a whole new chance at life as Harrison Evans and this time he's not planning on saving anyone. He is only a bit older than the students but not 30

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5648098/chapters/13007620]]

15) Into the Diary by Aquamarine_Weasley 12 year old Harry goes into the diary but this time as a twist he doesn't know that Tom is Voldemort.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19486330/chapters/46386082]]

16)Don't Fuck With Florists (They'll Fuck You Up) by MayMarlow it's a funny one shot were Harry the MOD decides to become a florist in Tom's time.

17)Matchmaker, Matchmaker by Watermelonsmellinfellon Summary: Nagini acts as a messenger for Harry and Tom, carrying insulting messages between the Slytherin dungeon and Gryffindor Tower. Eventually, Nagini gets bored and starts making up stuff, and the messages just become confusing. Nagini becomes a matchmaker. Unwittingly.

18) Bzz by Wolven_Spirits Harry is a hummingbird animagus and Tom is the in love florist.

19)Three sugars and a splash of daddy, please by aroundloafofbread, Wolven_Spirits I know the title sounds off putting but trust me it's really cute!

20)Son of Magic by PurplePebbles another time travel Fic with Harry as the master of death.

***21)This is one of my favorite HP/Tr stories out there its called What He Grows To Be by Severus_divides_into_H its a Harry raises Tom story in which he is the MOD but it is so beautifully written that you have to give it a chance especially Tom's love and obsession for Harry is written exquisitely

22)***Chasing The Careless Traveller by Arliene Harry is a badass Time traveling Unspeakable and they make a great power couple with Tom even though Harry is a bit reluctant at first.

23) I Have Seen Your Heart by Arliene its completed and If I weren't so tired would explain why its so amazing. Its post war but I hope that doesn't deter you.

***24)The intruder by Arliene is a one shot but worth reading. Harry again is badass

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10911494/1/The-Intruder]]

25) *******you belong to me (i belong to you) Child_OTKW its not yet written as Tom|Harry but regardless you haveeeeeeee to read this its a badass Harry who somehow ends up in Tom's world and doesn't take crap from anybody you'll feel amazing while reading it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11270490?view_full_work=true]]

26) My last recommendation is a Voldemort and Harry fic but I really wanted to recommend it it's written in the style of a fairy tale and it's beautiful in my opinion. I Waited For You, In The Shadows Of Time By watchingvfall_n_drown

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6921907/chapters/15791038]]

*** Thanks for recommending this! I was a bit iffy about the whole "Harry is immortal and Toms literally 14" but the story was very well executed üòä

Also I love deaths characterisation and MOD! Harry and the pairs easy camaraderie.

I also like how easily Harry fell into arms with Potter and Co without a whole moral conundrum, yet there was still a connection there.
