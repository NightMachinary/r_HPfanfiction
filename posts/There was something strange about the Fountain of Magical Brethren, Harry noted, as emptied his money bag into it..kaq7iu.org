There was something strange about the Fountain of Magical Brethren, Harry noted, as emptied his money bag into it. He looked up at the statues once again. The way the light glinted off their eyes, it was almost as if they were alive. He moved closer, and saw a very worn inscription at the base of the fountain:

‘Yma mae Arthur Pen Ddraig.'

(Here lies Arthur Pendragon)

In which Arthur is entombed in the Fountain of Magical Brethren. The Golden statues keep a vigilant watch over Britain, ready to awaken the King in Britain's Darkest Hour.

** A hurried man of greasy hair hurries into the headmaster office.

"Albus, it worked. That stupid fake fountain you made is grabbing all of Potter's money and moving it to your vault. Trust him to be that stupid!"

*** I'm picturing a long con. Dursleys that put a lot of stock into wishing on a star, or birthday wishes, and Harry buys it.

He can't help putting change in the fountain.

He can't help noticing Skeeter and constantly shooing her away for good luck.

He can't help that Professor Quirrel had an eyelash on his cheek and died when Harry tried to grab it to blow it away.

** Harry runs into the ministry in the middle of the night and begins bashing a sheet pan with a cast iron skillet.

“Wakey wakey Arthur! I hope you enjoyed your centuries long nap but it's time to get up and save England! It's three hours until end-times o' clock and I don't know what everyone expects a hormonal teenager who's greatest combat skill amounts to shouting yoink and trying to take one person's weapon!”

Apparently Merlin or whoever preserved Arthur was an ass, because instead of some glorious golden resurrection or arc of the covenant scene, the wizard in the statue turned from gold to people and the King of England was dropped unceremoniously into the dingy fountain water.

For a moment Harry was worried he might have just accidentally committed regicide, but then the soaked and bedraggled king rose from the water much like his old sword had, only far less gracefully and with fewer disembodied women's hands.

This line is gold.

(Insert references to watery tarts, farcical aquatic ceremonies, and mandate of the masses here.)
