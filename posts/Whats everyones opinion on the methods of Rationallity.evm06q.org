Ive started reading and to be honest im not really sure what I think. Ive its controversial

​

what do you guys think of it?


** It's honestly alright, like most fanfiction, it's best to read it with a heavy dose of salt. I don't dislike it but I'm not a fan either. It was the first fanfiction I ever read so despite me not liking it I cannot hate it either. (Forgive the horrible grammar, need coffee)

** Most people on this sub hate it and a couple of people who like it tell those who don't that they are just too stupid to get how great it is. I think that summarizes it. Personally I didn't like it because Harry is just so incredibly unlikeable in it.

*** i dont know. I seem to flip flop. I think its a very interesting alternative universe BUT it feels so different to the main HP universe that it feels like origional fiction. I like how it explores the HP universe and explains how it works BUT since it rewrites so much of the canon anyway its not really explaining Rowlings world its explaining its own universe

​

as you say the characters seem unlikable

**** Better than the Mary Sues of many many other fics. iMO MoR's Harry is funny. And i dont see him as a normal kid (spoiler: >! he is not ffs he is a merge of adult riddle and harry . Read the fucking story!<) He is like Rick and Morty rolled into one person. If you cant handle that kind of thing then dont read it. Its not for everyone.

** I thought it was decent at the start - the premise of a 'scientific' Harry exploring the magical world and doing research and poking fun at the parts where canon doesn't exactly make sense on the subject is one that I think is appealing (at least to me), and it was written competently enough.

However as the fic went along, the plot derailed heavily for my taste, and it became more and more overtly a mouthpiece for the author's personal brand of 'rationalism'. I found that what I thought was the original premise was not actually being delivered - and what was there instead just didn't work for me.

That being said, the fic does have quite a large fan base, and plenty of people do enjoy it through to the end. But what I'd say is, if you dislike it - just drop it. It's unlikely to really convince you otherwise later on.

** I started to read it but after a few chapters I realized that I would get more enjoyment out of ironing socks.

So now I don't know how it goes (besides what I've picked up simply by being on this sub) but I have comfortable socks.

Do I feel like the trade off was worth it ? Yes, absolutely.

** It does some things really well and some things really badly.

Depending on what you're looking for in a fic you either love it or hate it.

Personally I really like how it does time travel. I haven't seen any other fic that implements time turners in a way that isn't completely broken instant win item. And the consistent time loops are nice.

Rocket brooms are a nice idea but terrible execution. Crewed SRB vehicle just six years after Challenger? Are you serious?

** Thorfan I do not like it except the first few chapters which were funny. :( The Harry Potter in it is a big arrogant jerk and I cannot read about him. :( I like nice and kind and empathetic and comapssionate and humble protagonists! Like canon Harry asking Dobby to sit with him and Dobby breaking down about getting treated like an equal, or Harry saying he doesn't care about Hagrid being half giant. Or even when he empathized with Tom Riddle during HPB flashbacks. "Are you possibly feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort?"

** I love the universe. It's much better thought out and more consistent than canon.

Harry's character is a little strained. I've got a few nitpicks with Quirrell too. Some of the pop culture references are less than artful as well.

Despite that, It's probably my favorite fic so far.
