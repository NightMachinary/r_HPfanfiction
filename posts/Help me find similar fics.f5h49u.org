Essentially a fem!Harry Time Travel fic. Interesting in the way it's been written, different than any other fic I've read since. It's a story told in pieces. Mc is transported back in time thousands of years and has lived all the way back to present- all the while searching for a way back. Things progress and she must invent magic that she had taken for granted and never learned. It's not all spoon-fed and you kind of jump between the timelines, learning more and more while things start to make more sense.

It was a fascinating read. I would reccomend a read-through even though it's not finished. That being said, do you have any recommendations for something similar? It doesn't necessarily have to be the exact thing, but something written similarly, it dealing with time travel, or a good MoD/fem Harry story would be nice. Something about traveling back that isn't necessarily Tom Riddle time or explicitly founding Hogwarts, preferred.

I would reccomend CarnivorousMuffin. She has quite a few fics, they are all unique, and they are well written.


** Man, I know how you feel. Sadly, I don't have any recommendations for you, since I'm still in the search myself. I read that back in 2017 and I've been waiting --- hoping --- it will be eventually updated again. Until today I haven't found anything similar.

*** I've seen some similar stories- there was a MoD/Death Harry where he was basically the boogey man of the wizarding world. Due to time travel + dark Harry. I'll go look for it, but you probably know it already. I've seen it suggested here several times

** Linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower)

This one is a slash fic but it does have time travel elements and from what I remember was well written. It also jumps back and forth through time like you mentioned.

Last I heard it was still being updated but there are several parts of the story complete and for those who can't handle slash as far as I can recall it was in the background. MC just happened to be gay, it wasn't in your face about it and wasn't explicit in any way.

*** Sounds interesting. I wouldn't go out of my way for slash, but I don't hate it. Your description kind of reminds me of [ [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11907443/1/]] ]

Wrong link I guess lol

**** That link made me chuckle. Honesty the author of the fic I mentioned does a good job with world building, imagery, and interweaving nuggets of history into his fics. The only weird part is I think he writes in the present tense and it took me a while to get used to it.

**** Actually, mobile is when the bot is especially useful, because it's harder to do links without it. You just use linkffn, making sure it's lowercase, and let the bot guess. linkffn(A Long Journey Home)

Or, if you've copied a link anyway, you can use ffnbot!directlinks to make the bot detect it.

** I know few similar stories. My favorite is {[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8337871/1/The-Wizard-from-Earth]] } by Morta's Priest. Not finished and hasn't been updated in years but really good read.

Another, much shorter is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5414209/1/The-Fifth]] though it's also Highlander crossover.

I hope this is helpful.

  Harry is the girl who wanders in and out of time. Tom knows nothing about her, and despite the fact she has whisked him away from the orphanage to live with her, he's starting to think he never really will either. Regardless, he is determined to never let her go, not even in the face of time, space, or dark lords. timetravel
