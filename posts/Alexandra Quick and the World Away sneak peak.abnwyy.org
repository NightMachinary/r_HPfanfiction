Inverarity has posted [[https://inverarity.livejournal.com/340265.html][the first chapter]] of Alexandra Quick 5 onto his blog as a sneak peak.

The book itself is still in the editing stage. Based on current progress, [[https://inverarity.livejournal.com/340086.html][Inverarity estimates that the book will be 100% finished around spring / early summer]], though this is obviously subject to change. Tantalisingly close after such a long wait.

In other news, the series has also been uploaded in full onto [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1211079][Archive of Our Own]].

Finally, a reminder that [[/r/alexandraquick]] is a thing.


** IMO the best series to grace the fandom.

** For newbies like me, it's a novel length story set in the Wizarding America, started in 2007 on archiveofourown.org. From the summary of the first part of the story:

#+begin_quote
  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

**** Thanks, I didn't know that. Since the post (and even [[/r/alexandraquick]]) hardly described what Alexandra Quick was, I just wanted to provide some context.

*** An advice for people encountering AQ for the first time. Don't rush to judgement if you don't like a character. I personally never had this problem so I can't understand it well, but I think you should give it at least a few chapters before you stop because of "character flaws" - this is apparently a very popular take on AQ.

*** It was originally posted on Fanfiction.net I believe

linkffn(3964606)

But yes, the Alexandra Quick series is a series of novel-length fics which follow a cast of entirely OC's as they attend Charmbridge Academy, an American wizarding school. The books are very well written and have probably the best depiction of Wizarding America in existence.

Currently 4/7 books have been completed, with Book 5 seemingly just a few months away.

** Is there a detailed summary of the other books somewhere? I don't really want to do a full reread, but have forgotten a lot of the details since I read them like 4-5 years ago.

*** A reread might be worth it if it was that time ago, though. I'd do it myself but I've read them a much shorter time ago. This stuff is great quality, I'm sure it reads very well a second time.

Indeed. I couldn't believe how much stuff I missed on the first readthrough. The amount of foreshadowing and dramatic irony is amazing.

***** I second this.. I've reread aq just short time ago and there are some amazing and funny parts, that you won't notice in the first read because you don't have enough information. This one is my favourite:

“Why did you do this?” Alexandra asked.

Ms. Grimm eyed her appraisingly. “I thought you deserved to meet your sister.”

“Like hell.” Alexandra clenched her teeth. “Are you going to take me home now, or is there another sister you want to take me to see and mess up her life?”

Diana Grimm stood there for a long, thoughtful moment, but said only, “I believe it's time for you to go home.”

** Alexandra Quick is the greatest Harry Potter fan fiction I have ever read. It was also one of my first(I read his Hogwarts story first - strangely enough, I find it as lackluster as the other Hogwarts stories on this sub, doesn't compare to his AQ). I wish anything came even close. Maybe it's the writing style, and the author is certainly extremely talented, which makes him seem legitimate in a sea of amateurs compared to many other fics. Or maybe it's the fact that literally the only two things linking this to canon are one or two sentences in which Voldemort is mentioned, and the Rowling magic. This could easily have been a stand alone published novel, had it been allowed to sell books in Rowling's universe, and it would have done very well.

All that being said, I'm not sure I want to torture myself by reading just one chapter. Perhaps I'll wait until he posts all of it. It's certainly great that it's coming.

If the author ever publishes original work, I am sure it will be just as great, if not better. If he's reading this, I encourage him to do it. I suspect he'd have a lot of success. I've read a lot of popular original novels that were far less interesting and enjoyable than Alexandra Quick.

*** If it helps, this chapter seems to be a pretty much standalone prologue.
