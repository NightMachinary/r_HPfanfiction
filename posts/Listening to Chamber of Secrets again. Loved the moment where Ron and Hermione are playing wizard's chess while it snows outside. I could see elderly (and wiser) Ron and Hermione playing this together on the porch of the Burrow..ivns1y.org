#+TITLE: Listening to Chamber of Secrets again. Loved the moment where Ron and Hermione are playing wizard's chess while it snows outside. I could see elderly (and wiser) Ron and Hermione playing this together on the porch of the Burrow.

** Hermione shifted her weight to her right side receiving a displeased 'mew' from her lap as she did so. She stroked the tabby cat in her lap to comfort the little fellow. The cat looked over the chessboard, then out the window before setting its head on top of his paws.

Ron, on the other side of the board, was stroking his beard in contemplation. He bit the inside of his lip before reaching forward and moving his knight forward. His white beard brushed the top of the pieces as he moved forward.

"Dear," Hermione softly spoke drawing her husband's attention, "Is there a reason you're growing you beard out? The holidays are over, don't you want to trim it?"

"Still deciding on a style," He chuckled watching his wife's hand move over the board before recalling it. She leaned down and whispered to the piece who struck down his black pawn.

"As long it's not anything ghastly like that terrible handlebar mustache you and Harry sported last winter. "

"Samantha liked it," Ron argued.

"Samantha was two and like anything, she could touch."

Ron motioned for his queen to move forward. "Check."

He sipped the cider from his mug and watched his wife look over the board as she stroked the feline in her lap.

He watched as she moved her king. He watched as she realized once her move was over that she was in the path of his bishop. Quickly, he wiped her piece of the board, succeeding in the match.

She leaned back in her chair and watched as Ron moved forward and cleaned the board. Her gaze then moved outside as she watched a steady stream of flurries starting to fall.
