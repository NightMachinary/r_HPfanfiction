Okay, so I understand that the Dursley's did not treat Harry very well. We've seen him get hit upside the head by a frying pan*, locked in a cupboard under the stairs, and generally targeted with a lot of verbal and emotional abuse. None of that is acceptable in anyway.

However, there are lots of children out there under much, much worse circumstances, and none of the Avengers, or the DC Heroes, go around adopting every single abused or orphaned kids they see.

I guess I just don't think someone running into Harry, whose abuse, compared to what others have gone through, is light all things considered, and taking on the responsibility of raising and supporting a child. Especially these high profile secret agents or superheroes, who have way too many enemies to be able to casually adopt left-and-right.

I guess to summarize my feelings: Harry, while a precious gem, wouldn't seem special or important enough for some random protagonist from another series to adopt him (unless A.) This canon character actually does have a history of adopting/ taking in those kinds of kids or B.) They saw Harry's accidental magic or something similar, but in that case this relationship is clearly about his powers and not about him).

I think at most, a character might drop a line to a local CPS agency, but even then most of these people probably have somewhat of an idea on how that actually goes and wouldn't want to aggravate the situation and make a neglected kid's situation go from bad-to-worse.

Again, I don't think any of the Dursley's actions are acceptable (they're horrid), I'm just saying that it could have been a lot worse.

Edit: *Petunia swung at Harry with a frying pan in GoF, but Harry dodged it.

*** Astonishing vocabulary is short for "I can't write kid"

Simply assume that a normal child will have a topic that he knows 10000x more than you. Often this is something like dinosaurs, Star Wars, ponies, or Disney princesses. Then assume they know next to nothing about anything else, and bam, you have an instant 5-8 year old.

** If you want to read and enjoy the story, you just accept it for what it is: a Plot Device, or a Central Conceit.

It's the same for every non-crossover fic where Harry is adopted by someone who isn't the Dursley's, like Alastor Moody or Dolores Umbridge. Moody is a near-retirement Auror who would be a horrible parental figure, not to mention he's probably messed up mentally from just fighting in the front-lines of the war. Umbridge collects kitten plates because she thinks they're cute, and real life kittens are too unhygienic for her taste. She'd never want a human baby. The only out-there adoption that seems kind of realistic is Lockhart adopting Harry, but only for his fame.

That doesn't stop "Harry adopted by Umbridge" fics from being written, like The Daring Win. linkffn(12005755)

*** I think there is a big difference between canon characters adopting him vs non-universe characters. For example, while a stretch, it makes far more sense that Moody might vs, say, Tony Stark. In universe characters who are magical can at least understand the importance Harry holds within the wizarding world. To someone out-of-universe, he is just a kid which no more significance than any other kid.

Option 2: Whoever adopts Harry knows he's the BWL and does it for the fame. Example: Gilderoy Lockhart.

Option 3: Whoever adopts Harry does it because they want to help him after randomly meeting him. The adoptive parents usually aren't that famous. Example: The Grangers.

** In my experiences, most "Harry is raised by crossover character" stories do end up showing that the crossover characters are pretty lousy guardians in their own right, even if the author wasn't intending that. Since the stories seem to be little more than excuses to have Harry be more badass from the get-go when starting Hogwarts, they tend to have the crossover characters taking Harry into danger and giving him "training" that you REALLY shoudn't subject a preteen child to. But that's okay, because now Harry isn't going to be the neglected miserable child that that manipulative old bastard Dumbledore can mold into a perfect weapon against Dumbledore or whatever.

There ARE "raised by crossover characters" stories that work, but they tend to have a slightly different set-up... it's not just the crossover character discovering a baby on the Dursley doorstep, or seeing Harry being treated bably by the Dursleys, and going "welp, I'mma adopt that kid!"

Batman. That is all.

But seriously, two important questions you should ask:

1. Does it all mesh together well enough that I don't care about what's out of place?
2. Is it meant to?

As someone literally writing this kind of fic right now, I can honestly say (at least in my case) that it's half wish-fulfillment/half scratching a literary itch that won't go away.

** I don't usually read crossovers, but I don't think this is a particularly unrealistic scenario. Yes, many kids have it worse, but they are just sad statistics for your usual Tony Stark. Meanwhile, if he stumbled across Harry being abused, however this might happen, he could want to help this particular kid because he felt personal connection looking at those innocent emerald orbs(TM).

** To be fair, the only crossover fic I've read that has a character adopt Harry is the Katarn Side, a Star Wars xover, where the Jedi Master senses a high force count in a young HP.

But like 4ecks said, it's a plot device. A huge number of fanfics have plot devices that sometimes don't make much sense, but have these events serve as a divergence point in their storylines.

*** Another one was Invincible Technomage, where Tony Stark adopts him...after he survives an explosion caused by Dudley randomly pressing buttons at some Stark place, that explosion killed the Dursleys.

but yea, it's a plot device... provides good enough reason for out of context powers to be gifted Harry.

I would also add Culture Shock, where Harry teleports from the cupboard far far away, and ends up being integrated into The Culture AI society thingy only to return to attend Hogwarts, as a similar excuse to adoption.

It could be a combination. They feel sorry for Harry and want to help him. If he was normal, they might just call the proper authorities and leave it at that, but if they know he's got powers it's no longer so simple. He won't fit well in the usual system, and they don't want some villain kidnapping him for experiments or to be raised as a weapon.
