:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm searching for a fic, and I can't remember the title. I only remember certain details of it.

Harry somehow helps Tom take over - I can't remember if it's by way of contract.\\
Once Tom wins, Harry runs away because he feels unneeded/completely alone.\\
There's a time skip, and then they run across Harry with a foreign man, using a different name and just seriously dark.

If you know the story I'm talking about, pls let me know. Thank you!
