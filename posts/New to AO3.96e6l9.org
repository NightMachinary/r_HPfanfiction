I've been on FFN and Wattpad for a while. I recently joined AO3. Is there a way to upload a word document on there? Or do I have to copy & paste or type it all out again?

Edit: Thanks, everyone! I am sure I will be giving AO3 another shot!!!


** Just copy and paste from the word document. Thats what I do.

*** Man, I hate doing that because it pastes it as a giant block of text so you have to go in and fix it. When it is already a 66K word story, that's very tedious.

**** I have done that for one of my storys that has more than 29 chapters, just do it in parts. Put up say a certain amount of words a week or day. If the whole story is that many words, do it as “part 1” “part 2” and so on.

*********** Yeah. Over 90% of fics use that system so when (to use an example from another fandom) you get SiblingA/SiblingB, Sibling A/GirlfriendC, Sibling A/SidekickA, SidekickA/GirlfriendC you start to wonder what kind of fic it is. Until you read the rest of the tags and summary.

************* Besides the / and & note. The only thing I know is to only tag notable things. For Harry Potter that'd be like "AU-High School" or "AU-modern timeline" (because people find it difficult to use the 1990's for whatever reason), or to note things like Manipulative Dumbledore, Good Snape, Mpreg, basically whatever is different than the canon or canon things you highlight in your story. Just don't make things such as "I have no idea what I'm doing", "I wrote this at 3AM instead of sleeping", "- Please send help" (Sometimes attached to the previous one). tags as they're just space stealers.

Besides that, just don't overtag or undertag. But undertaging is preferable by most rather than overtaging.

******** Ao3 is also much nicer to readers, with integrated "download fic" options. Tags get excessive at times, but the organization is better overall.

****** I think its worth it. They have a more accepting content policy. So you cant get kicked off or have your work removed for commonly accepted adult themes like sex, abuse etc. Obviously you put the appropiate rating and tag any triggering themes.

Also I do get more kudos and comments than on ff.nt.

Also has a better repuation (aparently ff.net isnt very favoured by the fanfic community...they treat it more like its a garbage dump...I dont understand that myself).

******** At a guess.. Maybe because the amount of stuff you have to look through is vastly reduced if you set up your search parameters sensibly.. also.. most people only review if they feel strongly about something.. if it's merely "alright" i think a lot of people just move right along.. whereas if it turns out to be either, the best thing since the blowjob, or an unrepentant piece of garbage, in the eyes of the reader, they'll let you know.. also.. hitting the Kudos button is much easier than putting words down..

********* I really need to learn how to properly use tags.

That isn't much different from FFN There are favorites, follows, and reviews. However, by clicking "favorite," it saves it to a list. I've actually gotten a lot of responses on my FFN, not so much on Wattpad though.

******** I like the review system on ao3 because you can actually have a conversation with nested responses, both with the author and other reviewers, I think it makes it a lot more interactive and some people are more likely to review because of it.

** Yes it took me a while to figure this out when I joined AO3! Before you copy and paste into the box, switch it from HTML to Rich Text format and all your spacing, line breaks, italics, and bold will be preserved!

** You have to copy paste it. HOWEVER, be careful. The default textbox ist for HTML usage (which will cause your text to be unformatted) There are two button on the top of the textbox, one labeled as HTML and the other... Well can't remember lol, but that's what you wanna choose.

** You do have to c/p but honestly, I think it's worth it. No shade to ffnet, but especially for some of us who remember all the drama on it, it is a much easier to use system. It helps us engage with readers, and we do get more involved commenting from people there.

** I upload first to FFN and later if I feel like it port to Ao3. If you go to the document editor in FFN and copy the whole text (Ctrl+A) you can paste it into Ao3 in the rich text mode (button above the text box) and the formatting stays true apart from center tags for some reason.

YMMV but I found this to be the easiest solution for Ao3, hope it helps!
