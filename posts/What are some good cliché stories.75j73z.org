There numerous fanfictions that use the same clichés. You know which ones I mean; the ones where the Dursleys are very abusive, where someone other than Harry is believed to be the boy who lived but it is really Harry, where Harry is a girl etcetera. In my experience most of them are not very good, but there are a few good ones. I have recently been reading Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, and I liked it. What are some of your favourite stories (or maybe guilty pleasures?) that incorporates one or more cliché but is still good thanks to good writing, originality or something else?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): Very abusive Dursleys, Animagus!Harry, Dan and Emma Granger, Lord Potter, manipulative!Dumbledore, and 11 year olds doing politics. But it's pretty good apart from canon rehashes in Years 1-2, and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(12088294), is even better.

** "Nightmares of Future Past" has almost every Peggy Sue cliche you can think of, except for Daphne Greengrass. In fairness, NoFP likely started the lot of them in the first place.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

*** I'm not sure what you're trying to say here? Are you saying the actual act of changing Harry's sex is not creative, or the fem!Harry trope itself is not creative? Because I disagree with the latter. There's a lot of variety in fem! stories.

** Searched up shampoo after seeing that shampoo post recently, and found this ... interesting way to look at the "Snape uses shampoo and is suddenly the most attractive ever" cliche.
