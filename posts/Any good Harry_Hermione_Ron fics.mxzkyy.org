I've always felt that something fundamental was missing in Harry/Ron Harry/Hermione Ron/Hermione etc fics, and I think it's the third person. I'd be looking for either a fic with this relationship in the background or a fic centring around this relationship (how it came to be, evolution, etc). Most of the fics I found by just filtering it were porn, and I want an actual fleshed out relationship. I'd be glad to find any proper fics in this genre! Thanks

  An unexpected confession makes them all change course.

  We need somewhere to learn to fight... he thought. A place to practice... somewhere they can't find us... “...A place to fight the Ministry...” Hermione's voice whispered. A place to learn how to protect people... Ron's lips mouthed. A heavy wooden door appeared, the ageing wood so ancient it appeared almost black -- if not for the single bright unaged golden design embossed upon its surface. A strangely stylised A without the middle bar, the base of the letter spiking out in only to curl in again like a pair of tongs, beneath it an almost bow shaped underline with three notches spiking out along its length, all contained within a circle. Three different desires blended into one open a different door to a new future, new possibilities, a new war, and the revival of a forgotten Chapter of the Brotherhood. It's about time the Wizarding World got a little freedom forced into it.
