Something along the lines of Hermione Granger, Demonologist would be nice or even something like Six Pomegranate Seeds. Don't actually care about who the main character is but PLEASE no romance, smut or whatever as the main plot. Manipulative MC is preferable, but not required. Trying to be open with my asks, thanks if you do answer!


** linkffn(On the Way to Greatness): Harry sort of becomes dark by necessity, and because he is canon-Harry in Slytherin no one feels the need to really correct the situation.

linkffn(The Crown of Metis): Voldemort is the MC, basically an interesting oneshot of how he got the diadem from Albania.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11585823/1/The-Art-of-Self-Fashioning]] This one has a dark-ish Harry. He still has good intentions, but his methods are pretty dark.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12021325/1/Antithesis]] Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived and Harry is neglected by his parents. Harry decides to seek revenge. However, unlike some similar fics, things do /not/ go that well for Harry in this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning]] For some reason, I can't get into this fic, but I know some who like it. Judging by the first chapter, Harry definitely seems pretty violent and brutal.

*** Violent and brutal doesn't even begin to describe the Harry in Circular Reasoning. Though he does refuse to eat the roast infant later on.

  Dark magic, Death Eaters, politics - and in the middle of it all, Harry Potter. Tested against enemies old and new, he learns that power requires sacrifices; revenge, doubly so. Book One of Dark Triad Trilogy.
