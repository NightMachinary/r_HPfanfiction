I have been bingeing a lot of time travel and rebirth fanfics recently with a lot of different protagonists: The trio, Harry, Hermione, Severus, SI, OC etc.

However, I can't seem to find any stories where James Potter is the one who gets sent back in time or reborn. Considering James gets killed by Voldemort, he seems like a prime candidate for a protagonist role in a story where he dies and wakes up reborn an infant or time travelled back in time to his first day at Hogwarts.

He would be more mature, jaded by war, have inside knowledge of Death eaters from his operations as an Auror tutored by Moody, aware of Peter's betrayal and enlightened to the futility of Dumbledore's methods of waging war. Also he would be driven by the assumption that at the point of his death or time travel, Lily and Harry were about to be the Dark Lord's next victims. He would have a drive to see the future rewritten and gear the mauraders to a war footing much earlier and more ruthlessly.

Anyone able to recommend me any stories with a similar premis that I have missed?


** linkffn(the lie I've lived) it's the only fic that I know that fits your premise there are a couple where both he and lily come back to life after gof or at the start of first year

*** Yes, I remember this one and even read it. Not really what I was after. The sort of part of James possessing Harry idea was odd. That and the interpersonal interactions with the marauders was just awful. The cheating etc. Just nope.

Thanks for the suggestion though.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

****** No, of course not. I meant to say that had he just continued the sequel, we as readers would have been glad to even pay him.

But he chose to continue as an original author and written many books indeed. You can check him out on his website.

** I too would welcome such suggestions. James seems to get an excessive amount of hate due to one little prank on our resident dungeon master, completely ignoring the extreme issues with the other person and how he might have given as good as he got and then some.
