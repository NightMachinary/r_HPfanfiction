Well, I am not writing fem!Harry, instead I wanted to try a oneshot of sorts where a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter has been ignoring his female counterpart until he thinks she has the hots for Malfoy. After that, he goes all out to show her a better option.

Yeah, I know misunderstanding comedies are cheap and you clicked on this due to a misunderstanding. Lol.

--------------

Anyway, I wanted to get some info since this will be my first HP Fanfic since... a long time.

+In a fem!Harry story, would she be proactive in getting a date? Harry in 6th year is interested in Ginny, though I don't recall him asking her out and he spends more time stalking Draco.

+Dumbledore's Army? How would fem!Harry manage it different from canon!Harry?

+How easy would it be for a attentive bystander to mistake the rivalry(?) between fem!Harry and Draco for sexual tension?

+How interesting is Canon!Draco from female perspective? Also, what aspects of his personality kill all such interests?

+Also since this is a dimensionally displaced MC! fanfic, what changes could Harry inflict from the background unnoticed? He is 2 years younger so he wasn't present for Book 1 & 2.

Finally, kindly rec Fem!Harry fanfics that get to year 6. Also rec oneshots that take place in year 6 please.

He called for genocide at 12, showed sadistic tendencies at 13 (he wanted others, Hagrid and Buckbeak in this case, to suffer), started a bullying campaign at 14, became a war criminal and a terrorist at 16 by joining the magical Waffen-SS and was frankly said a spoiled brat.

**** Initially, good looks. If Draco was given a bit more charisma - take a page from the movies rather than the books, here - he could pass off his extremism as trying to be edgy, and cultivate a bad boy rep (all the better for manipulating others.) Combine those two with wealth, and it's entirely reasonable for a teenage girl, who doesn't really know him all that well, to develop a bit of a crush.

No. She'd be spoiled for choice as the girl-who-lived. She'd be invited to plenty of Hogsmeade Dates. Her reaction to that depends of course how you write her.

Very hard. They hate each other's guts, changing Harry's gender shouldn't change that. Draco is not just pulling pigtails, he wants to see Harry/Hermione/Ron dead.

#+end_quote

There's always a certain attractiveness of a bad boy. Though his arrogance and unpleasantness should make it hard to like him for anyone who isn't already in the Malfoys favor. In case of Harry or Harriet he/she would have a pretty hard time appreciating a guy who's best buddies with the terrorists who murdered her parents. Kills the libido quick I'd assume.

**** While they are rather boring to read, changing Harry's gender wouldn't really make a difference besides making him like Ron less (the things he says about girls are not very nice). The biggest change could be Snape's behaviour should fem!Harry look like Lily, but even that wouldn't really influence the plot that much.

***** Really? If you wanted, you could have a Snape with a different attitude easily be a major divergence point.

Besides the obvious (Any competent adult should have put a stop to a ton of what was happening in the series), A non-hostile snape would not have been a suspect in the first book, would have had a very different direction on coaching the mental stuff, requires a different teacher-antagonist to be inserted for drama.

I think there were several points where Snape was shown to be blinded by his history where if he had believed the trio things would have happened very differently...

******* If that was your only point of divergence, a lot of the plot-points of cannon would still have to come up, but it could easily be a major divergence point. You could easily envision the plot unfolding radically differently with a friendly Harry/Snape relationship:

- Harry suspecting someone else for the Sorcerers Stone
- Snape telling Harry of the Prophecy early
- Snape shuttind won Slytherin bullying
- Harry's appeals about Sirius having some effect
- Snape being more serious about the attempt to kill harry via the Tournament
- Snape not scaring away the Trio when they want to tell a teacher about the Basalisk

I'm someone who likes single-point-of-divergence stories, and I do get turned off by stories where too much changes (or it is set up as a small change and suddenly somehow that means 40 other unrelated things change). Using Snape's attitude as a point of divergence is something I could swallow pretty easily.

Harry isn't spoiled for choice, is that due to shyness of Hogwarts girls? Also, Love Potions would be a total no-no in a fem!Harry fic right? (Romilda Vane)

***** It would be less acceptable as a story-point from a literary perspective.

The further into speculative fiction and sci-fi/fantasy you get, the more freedom authors get to explore topics without pushback. The closer it is to realistic, the more careful authors have to be about depicting the topic. If only because the fiction could be read as commentary on real-world happenings.

Male-on-Female and Adult (male/female)-on-Boy are more more... visible problems than Female-On-Male, thus the difference.

It is the same reason that sci-fi often comments on racism using [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism][Fantastic Racism]]. Often it /is/ real world commentary, but the more distance there is, the more freedom from the real world baggage there is,

**** If Harry was among the oldest in his class rather than among the youngest, I'd have said Cedric; eighteen dating sixteen (even with one out of school) isn't an issue, that's a high school senior dating a sophomore.

How about Krum? He's already shown he'll date young, Durmstrang's reputation qualifies for edgy, and famous dating famous gives an easy way for the relationship to have started.
