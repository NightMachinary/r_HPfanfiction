** It's extremely rare to see Voldemort struggle in a real sense, outside of one on one dueling situations with main characters. I'd also be interested in such stories.

  Nuclear war breaks out and Voldemort casts a spell to stop time. He and Harry alone are left to defuse the missiles and prevent the war. Voldemort's radiophobic. Oh joy. LVHP. Spoilers for HBP, none for DH.

** In other words, a story where Voldemort proves that he isn't just a coward who sits on a throne while his stupid minions go out to get beat by a teenager and his friends while their parents try to shelter them because they aren't old enough to take on a group of full grown adults...

I too would also like to see a Voldemort who proves he's not the "the most feared Dark Lord in Living Memory" just because of shock-and-awe terror tactics.
