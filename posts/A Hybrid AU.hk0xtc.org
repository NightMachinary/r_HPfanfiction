So. I've been working on this thing for a while now. No, it's not a creature fic, it ties into one of my more fleshed-out ideas but you don't need to understand that one to get this one.

In this universe, beings called "hybrids" exist. They are a mix of human and creature, and there are many ways to become one, but the most common is being cursed.

Hybrids operate as a semi-secret society. This is maintained because most hybrids are innately able to hide the fact that their hybrids.

Hybrids can be almost any creature.

Hybrids gain certain aspects of the creature side of them, which, sadly, includes heat cycle stuff(I haven't really gone into that yet though. Don't wanna deal with it) and A/B/O style stuff. However, there are a few changes. Betas are the most common, and are usually just treated normally. Alphas are less common but are payed more attention to, as the natural leaders and as possible mates. Omegas are rare, but are treated lovingly as they are basically the future for their race. Alphas don't usually try to force an Omega to be their mate, as they generally consider it a form of rape. The negative emotions can also affect any pups.

There's not really such a thing as monogamy in the hybrid world. Omegas tend to need more than one Alpha to tend to their heat, because they will need to be fucked at all times.

Heat suppressers exist, but have negative health impacts if taken often, and usually reserved for when someone needs to go on a trip and won't have time to deal with a heat.

So now that we've got that out of the way, onto the story thing.

In this universe, both Harry and Hermione are hybrids. There are more at Hogwarts, but they don't know that yet. My end goal is a harem fic, because why not.

Harry's an Omega, bc I like to see him suffer and my versions of Harry tend to be on the shy side.

Hermione's an Alpha bc she's not going to submit to anyone.

I sorta really want Harry to be a kitsune, bc Kitsunes are always female, and my Harry is more feminine due to the Omega thing.

I just want to discuss what to do with this and how to make it work. Keep in mind I've been stewing on this for the past few weeks.
