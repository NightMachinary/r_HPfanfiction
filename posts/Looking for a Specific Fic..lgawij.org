:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic on Ao3 about harry traveling back in time and creating an orphanage (that i think was illegal) for wizarding children in need of a place to stay or like muggle borns who are orphans. I don't remember much of it but i do remember that there was no shipping and one of the major themes was that the house would change and add rooms and move things around because of magic. It was apart of a series i think. Thank you.
