Let's say Harry or who ever, is transported back into his first year. Too many stories don't just deal with Quirrel-mort. Like oh hey, my head is hurting, it's really weird; but it only hurts when I'm at the Defence Against the Dark Arts class, and sometimes the Great Hall.

Harry could use this to his advantage, and get rid of Quirrel-Mort sooner.

He knows that the Ravenclaw's Diadem is a Horcrux, why doesn't he destroy it? I'd say destroy as many Horcruxes as possible, before Voldemort even has a chance to come back.

You can destroy so many Horcruxes, you still want conflict? You can still make some sort of conflict. Death Eaters escape Azkaban sooner, maybe a Death Eater acts in charge until Voldemort comes back. I'm sure that there are ways to make conflict.


** The answer is that these authors are either incapable of developing an original plot or having an unhealthy fascination with the canon plot.

That's why I'm only recommending time travels that throw away canon plot at earliest convenience.

** Time Travel is odd. It can be written many different ways, all with differing results. Indeed, an author trying to create a 'mystery' where "Harry's scar goes 'oof' in DADA, and he doesn't know why" whilst the reader already knows, /as well/ as the character already knowing, is completely useless towards telling a story.

Unless the author wants to make you suffer, then TimeTravel!MC should remember what Quirrel is, so unless MC was Obliviated in zie aforementioned stories, I don't see how the author would present it.

Onwards with that point, perhaps Harry is patient and "Wants to wait for the right time to strike." This can be viable, I guess, but I'd never write it. Might not wanna reveal his knowledge as well.

I want to reinforce one thing as well, to anyone writing fanfic, look at the unique divergences in other fics you've read, and then try and make it a rule not to use it. Once is innovative, Twice is Nice, but 3.6k Indy!Dark!LordPotter!Harry can go eat a mice.

Also, keep in mind Author might be dragging out the story for romance, weird reasons, or sadistic pleasure.

I bid you adieu and a good readings,

*** I'm currently writing a fic that has the same sort of issues as time travelers, but instead of a traveler it's a person with book knowledge. My OC is concerned with both preserving the readability of the books (just in case, heh) as well as wanting to help with things she sees as fixable, such as rescuing Moody from the trunk some months early. The graveyard scene is going to still occur (thanks to Fudge fudging things up), but I definitely agree with you that divergence isn't always to be avoided!

​

I think a lot of authors are afraid that if they diverge too much, readers will accuse them of being unrealistic, or they're not 'there for' the purposes of fixing as much as finding a way back (once the relationship the fic is written for is established, heh) without fucking up as much as possible in the process. It's also just plain difficult to think up the ripple effects of changing things.

​

In the fic I mentioned earlier, by rescuing Moody you have the issue that Crouch might not be around later to make the trophy cup into a portkey, for example. He also wouldn't be giving Harry hints about the tasks. I have this covered, but it's easy to see how dismantling large plot points in the books can lead to a mess that's just not fun to clean up. That might be one of the issues, too. Someone who started a fic so they could put two characters into a unique romantic situation may not want to bother with such large, consequential changes. I know I'm a bit sad that I love my plot changes so much but they're in an OC story that isn't the sort of thing most people like to read.

**** There's absolutely no fucking need to preserve the timeline. Canon good guys only won through an atrocious amount of Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, and multiple “Lucky Hero” tropes. Even then, the bad guys completely took over, carried out genocides against Muggleborns, murdered who knows how many Muggles, tortured hundreds of Hogwarts students with Cruciatus, and finally killed off another 50% of the good guys before losing to JKR's (Words of the God) many shenanigans.

Good guys had it best a Pyrrhic victory. It's just awful.

Anyone who wants a repeat of that total cluster fuck is one big fucking coldblooded negligent shit head.

There's no need to let Moody suffer even a single moment.

There's no need to let Voldemort gain a body.

They know where Voldemort is hiding during the TWT. They know Voldemort is still very weak in that homunculus body. A raid led by Dumbledore will see both Voldemort and Wormtail captured, and Nagini destroyed.

Then they would be able to:

- Force Voldemort to spill all his secrets, his Horcruxes, his minions, his resources, his plans, and just about anything.
- Obliviate Voldemort back to his infancy. Even if he should escape in wraith form, he would wander the mortal plane as a confused and harmless spirit until the eternity!
- Dose Voldemort with Draught of Living Death and lock him behind wards stronger than Nurmengard.
- Exonerate Sirius by putting Wormtail on trial.
- Arrest every Voldemort minion that are still free, beginning with Lucius Malfoy.
- Begin Horcrux Hunt and find a solution to Harry's scar.
- If the above is successful, execute Voldemort.

** I think they want the satisfaction of re-doing everything correctly, fixing the canon, which is impossible if you go straight for the kill, so to speak. You'd have to make up entire new plot, up your villains game and so on.

The fear of changing timeline too much and loosing the war makes sense, there is no guarantee that new path is gonna lead to victory like the old one after all. But yeah, it's getting a bit old. Especially since most authors don't quite manage to stick to the path they choose. They change things selectively and plot just stops making sense.

This actually caused me to drop the last fanfic I've been reading. Harry is adamant that future must not be changed and he must not interfere, so he doesn't nothing help his parents and the "good" side. But at the same time becomes a Death Eater to save someone he barely knows.

No, you go in, fuck Voldemort up and go home to enjoy the weekend. That's your story. In, out and pay up. That is the logical conclusion of a planned trip through time. You make up some plan and execute that. With future knowledge, the Death Eaters stand no chance. Your divergence is the time traveller, not the Death Eaters turning from Joseph Joffre after 2 bottles of wine into Erich von Manstein or Omar Bradley. Why would the Death Eaters suddenly be competent after the time traveller is halfway done messing them up?

** ...All I'm wondering is what type of tremendously boring, stale, uninteresting time travel you're reading. Granted, it's usually a thinly veiled power fantasy, but in almost all the time travel fic I'm aware of Harry (or whoever) uses future knowledge to either leverage themselves into a more powerful/influential position, or starts making immediate moves against Voldemort.

Honestly, that does not work well in the HP universe because the Death Eaters are not an existential threat like a Reaper invasion or similar scale mass-extinction events. If you have future knowledge, you will inevitably bugger the Death Eaters, who are shown to be rather stupid. I mean, they made a mass charge against a fortified hilltop across hundreds of yards of open ground and only won because the defenders had moral qualms about killing and failed to utilise their super effective killing machine (Mandrakes). The French tried something similar in early 1914 and it ended in 27000 Frenchmen dying in a single day (August 22nd). Suddenly making them cunning tacticians feels like randomly generated tension which should not be there because it has no reason to exist. Your divergence is time travel, not smart Death Eaters (as they would not have lost the first war had they been smart).

  In time traveling stories why don't writers deal with the bigger issues?
#+end_quote

If "bigger issues" means The Third Reich and the Soviet Union in Riddle-era fanfics, the issue is that you basically have to reinvent half a century of history. Say you do the generally popular thing and kill Hitler. Either someone else takes over and it is mostly business as usual or you just signed over Mainland Europe to Stalin unless you somehow give Poland nukes and bombers capable of delivering them to Moscow. Also, that chap Grindelwald is still around doing god knows what.

Now the next question is what you do with Europe. Do you take care of fascism in Italy and Spain, what is your take on the Treaty of Trianon, the Danzig question (the city is mostly German, the surrounding areas Polish), do you drive millions of Germans from Poland to recreate modern borders, what to do with the Middle East...

You see why this is getting very complicated very fast.

If you are merely referring to "sticking to the timeline", that is mostly bad writing. The much bigger unaddressed issue is that you suddenly have an adult in the body of an 11-year-old. There is no way to really befriend them. Even if the other children do not notice, can you imagine listening to a bunch of preteens 24/7? You'd go crazy after a week.

*** I disagree with your last sentence because most time travel/body time swap stories involve people who already *know* the students they're going to spend time around. There's a pre-existing relationship in the head of the older brain in the younger body. That helps ease the frustrations, wouldn't you think? Also in knowing what some of the events that are going to happen are, they'd probably find it interesting to pay attention to talk they didn't remember happening the first time around.

If anything, that makes it worse. You know these people as adults. Now they are acting like idiots. The disconnect between your memories and the reality will be heartbreaking 24/7. Hermione is no longer the calculating right-hand who had no issues with leaving Umbridge to the Centaurs, she is back to "or worse, expelled." And unless you manage to recreate everything down to the last random person walking by, they will not grow up to be the same people. Without the adventures, Ron and Hermione would not be the same. They might even become unrecognisable as time goes on. You have to choose between fixing the timeline and retracing everything so that your friends will grow up to be like you remembered them. The butterfly effect is a bitch.

And to add insult to injury, all your happy memories are just that, your memories never to become reality. Especially when you interact with your later spouse. You might remember all steps on the road to marriage, but the other party is 10/11. Grooming suddenly becomes an issue, even with the best intentions.

******* I do not read any stories that involve time travel to such young ages. I'm not interested in them, and that's one of the reasons why I said I don't think we have the same mindset about this at all. Ordinarily I would be happy to get into a discussion but this is so far from anything I'm interested in that I'm just not driven to talk about it at all.

I stand by my statement that I think caring about people and seeing them at a younger age are not incompatible with each other, especially platonically. I'm not gonna start hating my friends just because I see what they are like when I am older and they are kiddos.

******** OP asks about first year time travel. Which is the whole issue. Half of the problems with HP time travel fanfics is the age.

And I never claimed that you wouldn't care about former friends. But you'd feel the need for adult conversation and as much as you would care about them, a bunch of children isn't going to cut it when it comes to that category. You'd think of them as children in your care, not equals. Your problems are centered around preventing a civil war, a corrupt political and judicial system, widespread racism and magical fascists. Kids care about games and school.

** There /is/ valid justification (perhaps the time traveler doesn't want to diverge too much too early in order not to lose the advantage he/she gets from a re-do), but it makes for more boring plots. Better when fics diverge early and becomes more original.

** Yeah, time travel stories which are basically an excuse for characters from different generations to hang out with each other, without changing anything, annoy me. The Debt of Time is a prime example. The plot is stuck in canon except Hermione gets to sleep with hot young Marauders.

I'm working on a story in which Hermione fixes the whole damn 20th century (and still gets a hot guy.) The plot is a lot of work of course. I can see that not everyone considers this sort of thing fun. I mean, both wizarding and muggle history are going to be totally different, and some major characters won't even be born, while I have to make others from scratch. It would be much easier to write, say, yet another Hermione/young Remus ship fic, but I figure the internet doesn't need another one of those.
