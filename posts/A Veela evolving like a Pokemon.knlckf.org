Like Harry pulls Gabriella out of the lake and then she starts flashing between forms with the music that happens when a Pokemon evolves in the game and then when the evolution end have someone to the this were they announce that x evolved it x.


** Actually, this could be an amusing AU: magical creatures evolve like Pokemon -- this technically includes wizards and witches, but because they rarely do anything 'worthwhile' to evolve, such occurrences rarely happen.

Harry is baffled when after killing the basilisk, he gains enough "xP" to evolve.

*** Hey that is an interesting idea. Would wizards and witches evolve based on the enemies they defeated or on what they did? It would be ironic if harry evolved into some kind of basilisk hybrid.

On the other hand, imagine if his evolution involved him fusing with the sword of gryffindor and gaining quite a bit of swordsmanship skill.

**** I dunno: I'm trying to think of witches/wizards as animals/creatures evolving, not people (think of going from ape or chimp to human) -- what would they look like?

Alternatively...

"Why, 'ello zere," said a breathy voice that tickled his ear.

He winced.

Crap.

Slowly, Harry turned to face that Odd French Witch that'd stared at him in fascination the moment she'd stepped off Beauxbaton's carriage. He beheld her smiling at him coyly, and was slowly inching her way into his personal space from the side. He wings flared on instinct, and he was utterly confused as to whether it were a threat display or a sign of attraction.

After all, she was a pretty young witch, and he was a teenager!

Her pupils dilated slightly as her eyes roamed the colourful, intricate decals on his feathers.

Great, these bloody things must be like catnip.

There was a slight gasp of surprise behind him, and he winced: of all the girls determined to stay close to him, a suddenly and overly sweet Pansy bloody Parkinson was not one of them!

** So Gabby switched in to steal some of Harry's experience from the task?

And let's be honest; most of the time, Veela puberty is such a sudden thing that this might as well be what happens.

*** The prompt is pretty much about making fun of the Veela puberty trope.
