#+TITLE: LF fics in which Harry has a realistic training arc before dueling Voldemort. Not like in most fanfics, where he has problems taking down two Death Eaters one day and then next week duels Voldemort himself to a standstill or something similar. Are there fanfics where the growth is realistic?

** Linkffn(Honour Thy Blood - Remastered By TheBlack'sResurgance) Has him training for months before facing Voldemort.

But harry being able to catch up to Voldemort at all is unrealistic, being a prodigy with 50 years worth of a head start just puts him so far ahead it wouldn't really be possible without some sort of deus ex machina.

  A remastered version of the original. Literary and Grammar errors fixed, making the story much more palatable. Rated M for a reason. No slash, HP/DG pairing with an independent Harry. See original for description.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

  Snape never wanted anyone to know of his promise to Dumbledore, but has realised that he can protect Potter much better by taking a less passive role in the boy's training. Actually liking Harry Potter has never been part of his plan. mentor/guardian.

** Linkffn(Harry gets motivated) can be considered realistic as in, while at first glance chronologically the time frame is small for Harry to go from cannon end of sixth year to the point of crumb-stomping Voldemort the author actually did provide a good method for him to achieve such, used well the given resources and made the victory more to do with good planing, strategic thinking and all in all not going for a direct confrontation at all (and this is one of the few examples I see of such that didn't degrade in muggle-wanking).

The most realistic training-montage I've ever read, one of my all-times favorites and confirmedly bash and excessive angst free. Don't get to recommend it nearly enough.

  Harry finds a way to get motivated, really, really motivated. A super!Harry oneshot. Post HBP, AU, No DH.
