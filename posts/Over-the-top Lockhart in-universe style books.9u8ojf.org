I recently had the idea to try writing Lockhart's books, with an obviously exaggerated style. Has anyone already done this, or something similar? I think it would be hilarious. Would anyone be interested to read such a thing?


** I would definitely be interested in reading it.

And just think, Lockhart must have fanfiction written about him in-universe.
