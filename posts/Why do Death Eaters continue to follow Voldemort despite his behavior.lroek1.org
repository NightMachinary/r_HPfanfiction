I don't understand why someone would follow a leader that regularly tortures or kills his own people for failures or if he is just feeling like it. Is it because they think they can't escape, or perhaps they believe they are already "in too deep" and leaving would only bring them harm? Do they think the risk is worth it in exchange for keeping or elevating their social standing? I don't remember if the fact that Voldemort is a half-blood ever gets spread to his followers in canon but if it did, why would they continue to serve someone who they saw as inferior to themselves? Anyway I'm kind of confused, so I wanted to see what you all thought about the situation. Thank you (:


** I saw a pretty good explanation that I agreed with. I'll try to say it the way they did. You see, the thing is, Tom Riddle was charming at first. He was charismatic, and I'd say that most of the Death Eaters /liked/ him. And when he really got the war going, people probably joined him because of pressure from their families, or because they wanted to be on the winning side, and couldn't just drop out for fear of death.

*** That makes sense. He probably realized that he wouldn't gain any followers if he didn't lure them in first. Thanks for commenting (:

He doesn't. The only times he regularly killed his followers or had them killed were when they betrayed him (Regulus, Pettigrew, Karkaroff). The only other Death Eater he killed was Snape, and that was an exceptional circumstance.

He does sometimes torture them for failures, but not nearly as often as many fics would have you believe. He might torture for a major mistake that ruins his plans, but not for just bringing him bad news or spilling pumpkin juice on his robes.

It does. He talked about his muggle father in front of them in the graveyard, and none of them seemed surprised.

He may not be a pureblood, but he is a major proponent of their causes, /the/ descendant of Slytherin, and a lot more powerful than them. The Death Eaters might be prideful, but they're also practical.

**** Did he though? He would have known that Dumbledore and the rest of the good guys weren't going to kill Draco, even if he walked up to Dumbledore in the Great Hall and tried to curse him in front of everyone.

And if he failed, maybe Voldemort would have killed him, but I could just as easily see him "deciding to show mercy" to keep the Malfoys loyal to him. Besides, Draco had plenty of help available to him, so his task shouldn't have been that hard.

***** Well Draco technically failed his mission, even getting a Death Eater killed, with his plan. Yet the Malfoys, while they did fall in disfavor with Voldemort, were alive and well. Hell, he didn't even kill them when they lost all his prisoners, including Harry.

  The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room; the kneeling goblin rolled over, dead; the watching wizards scattered before him, terrified: Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell, and those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news, for hearing about the golden cup ---

DH---The Final Hiding Place

The impression I get from this passage is that Bellatrix and Lucius are both quite familiar with the scramble to get away from an angry Voldemort.

**** I don't get the impression that Bellatrix and Lucius are familiar with the scramble. And it says that he at least partially killed them for hearing about the cup. While I still say he doesn't make a habit of killing his loyal followers, his horcruxes are more important, so he'll kill followers to keep them secret. And he probably let Lucius and Bellatrix go because he already trusted them with some of that knowledge.

***** Also, I'd argue that that was the moment that he realized that his most hated living enemy knew how he'd made himself immortal, and was actively seeking to undo it. It should be little wonder that Voldemort became apopleptic.

***** Bellatrix and Lucius weren't the only ones left alive, only the people who didn't get away in time were killed. He wasn't doing this to keep a secret, it is clearly intended to be a moment of rage.

Also, it literally states that he was killing them for bringing him the news.

As for Bellatrix and Lucius being familiar with running away from him, this is also informed by the many past scenes where they've been terrified of displeasing him.

****** It doesn't specifically say whether or not anyone else got out.

It also literally states that he was killing them for hearing about the cup.

And yeah, he does rule through fear. But that doesn't mean that he kills or tortures everyone who fails or displeases him. I'm sure he does occasionally, in order to keep everyone afraid, but not knowing if /this/ will be the time he decides to punish you probably leads to more fear than punishing every time. And we know that he does sometimes go for more unusual punishments, like sending your son to kill Dumbledore.

** Why do bullies have large followings of "friends"? Those friends only get inducted after being bullied themselves.

Even after being friends they get treated like shit. They treat others and outsiders worse, but yeah they still get treated like shit.

I can't explain it, I'm not good with psychology, but it's just that it's more common than you'd think. People voluntarily put themselves in bad positions and stay there despite knowing it's bad.

** He used to be very charismatic, that's how he first gained followers. We don't know much of how he behaved during the first war but we can assume he was in better spirits while on the brink of victory, and they probably didn't expect the crazy lunatic of the post-resurrection era.

Because said politician is on their side of that one specific hot button issue they care deeply about, and because often they've invested so much time and care into that politician they don't want to admit they were wrong.

** I sort of always saw his relationship with the Death Eaters as that of an abusive lover but with out the sex. He can be really nice one second and then next second just completely shatter your ego. We especially see this in his relationship with Wormtail whom he calls a useless idiot and the next moment he tells him that he'll honor him with a task that many would give their right hand for. Or when he tells Wormtail that he has to suffer while the guy is bleeding and then gives him a beautiful silver hand. Or with Bella when he tells her that her opinion means a lot to him only to continue to humiliate her about her niece marrying a werewolf.

However I don't think he really punishes the Death Eaters with direct torture only in case of major failures such as when they lose valuable prisoners or when it comes to Harry, or when they betray, he kills them. Instead he chooses more passive aggressive ways of punishing Death Eaters for fuck ups such as withdrawing his favor towards them or setting them up for failure or making empty threats (he tells Dolohov he'll kill him while torturing him when he loses Harry after the wedding).

Also Voldemort doesn't really get involved in ruling Magical Britain after he takes it over but pretty much allows the Death Eaters to rule it as they please, while they have the benefit of a powerful figure behind them that prevents open rebellion. So all in all it's more of a toxic relationship kind of vibe rather than the curse-happy (well he is but not to the Death Eaters) tyrant fics show him to be.

** Most Death Eaters are just as bad as voldemort and if they had the power voldemort has they would be the leader.

just look at the world cup when they attacked and nearly every other person ran way like frightened children when they outnumbered them completely.

** When it was written, you could look to history to find a lot of examples of this happening; the 'why follow him if he's a half blood' could be applied to 'why follow hitler if he's a non-aryan, non-german (born in austria)'.

Now, you could look at current events. Why follow a leader who constantly turns against his own followers, who doesn't follow or respect laws or regulations and who came to power by uniting people against inferiors? IDK if you're from the US, the UK, or any of the multiple countries currently seeing a massive rise in the far right, but...

** Why did naive volunteers seduced by rhetoric and a cool uniform that girls liked remain in the SS? It's the same question, and the same answer.

Any rumours of Voldemort being a half-blood are easily dealt with. "That's an outrageous lie and the evidence is fabricated". But even if you accept that he is a half-blood "he's the only one to stand up for us, and that he does it despite his background only shows that he is a selfless man, a true servant of Magic itself, worthy of our loyalty".
