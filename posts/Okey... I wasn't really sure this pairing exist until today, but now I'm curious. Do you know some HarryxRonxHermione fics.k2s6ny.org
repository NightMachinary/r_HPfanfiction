I mean, not Hermione with two guys at the same time, with Harry and Ron never feeling anything romantic towards each other. (This is why I thought this kind of pairing didn't exist.) I'm talking about the three of them in a relationship, Ron loving Harry and Hermione, Hermione loving Ron and Harry and Harry loving Ron and Hermione.


** there is one, but I can't remember the title. it's post capture at malfoy manor and the first few chapters are /very/ dark, essentialy harry is made a death eater plaything to "save" Ron and hermione from the same fate, some how they get free and hermione and Ron get together and it becomes a triad to help harry heal from the trauma of both the war and their captivity.

** Almost all of the ones i know are oneshots, but they're all pretty good-

1.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637][tell me whether he is dead]] :

#+begin_quote
  Harry suffers a few side effects from dying but not dying.

  "Hey, can someone help me with this? The mirror in the bedroom's stopped working for me."

  “What do you mean ‘the mirror's stopped working'?”
#+end_quote

This can be read as Harry/Hermione/Ron or as a platonic trio friendship fic.

​

2.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16957743][for as long as you need us]]:

#+begin_quote
  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.

  “We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”

  With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses.

3.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22124083][All I Need (is you and you)]]

#+begin_quote
  Lavender keeps asking nosy questions and rumors have reached Harry's ears.

  /Don't you ever want to make other friends? Don't you ever get tired of them?/

  How can you grow tired of people who are your everything?

  A short, sweet getting together fic.

4.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13593345][Bedknobs and Courtship Rituals]]

#+begin_quote
  The Trio start repairing Grimmauld Place after the war, and find themselves updating their relationship along with the wallpaper.
#+end_quote

5.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5783971][Table for three]]

#+begin_quote
  Ron and Hermione and a first date that feels entirely...wrong.
