  Expectations are funny things as the Wizarding world learns when introduced to a Harry that has inherited James' confidence and Lily's charm and a complete disregard to anything that doesn't affect him. Who cares about rocks and stuttering professors when they've got dragons and godfathers who didn't wait thirteen years to break out of prison to play with?
