It's something I've been thinking about (yes I do have a very boring job, thank you very much): As the parents of college-aged daughters, Harry's muggle grandparents were probably in their 40s, early 50s at the oldest when their daughter died. What the hell happened to them? Are there any fics that address this, or have the Evanses as characters? I'll also accept fics that have Harry's Potter grandparents in them, because I don't think I've ever seen that either.
