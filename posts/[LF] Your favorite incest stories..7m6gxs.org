**** First cousin marriages used to be favored in all parts of the world, until the eugenics craze picked up in late 1800s. While [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage][first cousin marriage]] does increase the risk of birth defects, it only entails a similar increased risk of birth defects and mortality as a woman faces when she gives birth at age 41 rather than at 30.

So, is it really that bad?

It's legal in most of Europe and half of US states. The only major country that completely outlaws it is Communist China.

No, sibling incests will result in catastrophic rate of birth defects compared to children born to first cousins.

According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage#Genetics][this source]]:

#+begin_quote
  In April 2002, the Journal of Genetic Counseling released a report which estimated the average risk of birth defects in a child born of first cousins at 1.1--2.0 percentage points over an average base risk for non-cousin couples of 3%, or about the same as that of any woman over age 40. In terms of mortality, a 1994 study found a mean excess pre-reproductive mortality rate of 4.4%, while another study published in 2009 suggests the rate may be closer to 3.5%. Put differently, a single first-cousin marriage entails a similar increased risk of birth defects and mortality as a woman faces when she gives birth at age 41 rather than at 30.
#+end_quote

On the other hand, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest#Inbreeding][sibling incest or parent-child incest]] will result in:

#+begin_quote
  Children of parent-child or sibling-sibling unions are at increased risk compared to cousin-cousin unions. Studies suggest that 20-36% of these children will die or have major disability due to the inbreeding. A study of 29 offspring resulting from brother-sister or father-daughter incest found that 20 had congenital abnormalities, including four directly attributable to autosomal recessive alleles.
#+end_quote

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_St%C3%BCbing][case of Patrick Stuebing]] showed that birth defects of children reached 75% in that particular instance.

To equate first cousin relationship with sibling incest is extremely wrong and misguided. There is very good reason why first cousin marriages are legal in most places of the world, while sibling incest is illegal everywhere.
