Basically what I'm looking for is Harry Potter 2.0. What happens after the battle of Hogwarts? But with a new set of characters/OCs, not centered on Harry's/Hermione's/Luna's kids or anyone like that. McGonnagal and Hagrid, teachers that stayed at Hogwarts are fine, of course. A new group of kids to follow through their school year and shenanigans. Nothing too dark and weird, please.

A nice bonus would be some queer/poc rep and no slytherin prejudices. :)

I hope that makes sense haha.

Does anyone have some good recommendations?


** Okay, so this meets some but not all of your requirements. linkffn(Rebuilding by Colubrina) has major characters and definitely a focus on draco & hermione but it really shines in dealing with what happens after the war and all of the impacts on both smaller characters we know as well as a whole new crop of younger characters that are OCs. Also there's some excellent queer/poc representation.

  Hermione Granger returns to Hogwarts to help rebuild the shattered castle the summer after the war. She and the other summer resident - and eventually their friends - have to come to terms with how the war broke more than just the walls of the building. Follows multiple Hogwarts students through '8th year' and one additional year of early adulthood. COMPLETE.
