#+begin_quote
  In the village of Godric's Hollow, the Dumbledore family is falling apart. Kendra Dumbledore is dead, and Albus is the unwilling guardian to his wayward brother Aberforth, and Ariana, their mad sister in the attic. But everything changes with the arrival of Gellert Grindelwald, violently charming juvenile delinquent with an obsession for the fabled Deathly Hallows.

** Neville/Hannah: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3867967/1/Asking-for-Roses][Asking for Roses]] is a sweet canon compliant story (as in it works well within canon) that focuses on Hannah and Neville. 130k words.

linkffn(3867967)

Also definitely read Let Perpetual Light it's easily one of my favourite fics. Although I don't think Dumbledore/Grindelwald is technically canon (not yet anyway).

  Neville thinks his summer will be much like any other: working in his grandmother's garden and other lonely pursuits. After leaving Hogwarts many months before, Hannah Abbott believes she is trapped and isolated for good. They're both mistaken. PreTDH.
