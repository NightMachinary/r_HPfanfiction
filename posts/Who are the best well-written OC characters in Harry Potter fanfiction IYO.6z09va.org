  Lily Luna Potter years 3-7. Why is she stuck with a Little Malfoy tag-along? What do the coming years hold for them and everyone else? How will they change and grow, what will happen as they do, & who will end up with whom? Eventual femslash. Multiple pairings. Lily/OC. Also stars Scorpius Malfoy's OC little sister. Not T until Chap 29, really not until Chap 32 & nothing too major.

***** I have read the whole thing now... and it kind of does start that way, but i believe it's meant to. [[/u/Pandorasboxen_]] is correct in saying that the fic is not at all in first person. It is actually third-person that switches point-of-views so you are reading from a character's perspective.

Honestly, i think you just need to get through the first five-ish chapters and it gets better. It's almost like the writer changed their mind on the direction they want to go, and it makes the characters more authentic.

Up to 220,000 words now and from the writer's profile, it looks as though another 10,000 chapter is coming out in the next two days. Hopefully, it is good!

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

#+begin_quote
  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

  She had electric blue hair and emerald green eyes that twinkled with mirth at their surprise, but what put her even more out of place was her clothing. She had no robe or House emblem, nothing Wizardly about her at all. The halfblood beamed at the Poltergeist of Hogwarts and brightly spoke words that had never once been said: "Hi Peeves, it's nice to meet you!" (A Next-Gen fanfic)
