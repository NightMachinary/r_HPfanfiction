Have you had a look at the Harry runs a cafe stories? There are a few, but the focus is never really the business (more relationships). I mean like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10867705/1/Starborn-Caf%C3%A9][Starborn Caf√©]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8208936/1/Wanderer][Wanderer]].

  Harry Potter knows that money can give you power and influence. He has learned that from a young age on, seeing how his relatives get away with many things. And others having way much more than you do can be a problem. Thus he starts his path to cause a small revolution in its own right. No matter if Dumbledore doesn't like it. Two-shot.
