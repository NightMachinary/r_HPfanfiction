I'm not sure if this is allowed or not; I couldn't find the subreddit rules or disallowed content, if someone could link it here that would be great.

The story so far is a mix of romance and mystery. I was always fascinated by the Ravenclaws and wanted to know more about them, so I've just made some stuff up!

If it is allowed and you would be interested in reading please give this link a go.

I would love for someone to read it and reviews would be an added bonus.


** I've only just started it but I have to tell you, the main character's name annoys me to no end. The writing is good enough, I suppose and it looks like there is going to be an overarching plot too, which is great. There are very few fics with a good mystery so I'll be following this fic.

*** Thanks so much for your insight and for giving it a read!

The name has come up repeatedly in reviews - everyone finds it very annoying! Is it the full name, or is Sapphire irritating, while Sapphy is ok?

The funny thing is that I have a friend named Safi so I think I'll be keeping this whole thing a secret from her to spare her feelings :P

**** I haven't checked out the story yet, but as far as the name goes...

Is she a lesbian? If so, the name 'Sapphy' is a bit of an anvil in the realm of subtle hints. If not, it sends the wrong message.

***** I know, I've thought about that. I may change it to Saffy? I'm pretty attached to the name so probably won't change it completely. Thanks for the input and I hope you like the story if you do give it a go :)

**** Don't know about outhers, "Saphire" is okay (not good, but okay). Sapphy (or other diminutives) just sound bad to me. Nothing against your friend, but ...
