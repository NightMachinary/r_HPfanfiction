It can be them like in Harry's time or before just as long as its after they graduate hogwarts.

Im looking for either Sirius centric or it can just focus on them as a group.

Focused on relations with each other and Lilly. Ideally friendship focused. It doesn't have to be though

If it romance focused I would prefer people within the marauders group with each other. If it any Marauder x someone who not a marauder I prefer that more as a side ship not focus of story like really minor.

Slash and threesome pairings are ok
