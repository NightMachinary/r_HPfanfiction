every single time that the trio are not froends there is some huge reason for it. Why can't they simply grow apart as time goes on and they make other friends. If they were mever friends to begin with why does it need to be because Hermione is a bookish bitch and Ron is a snot nosed bastard.

I prefer Harry when he isn't apart of the trio but I hate the bashing if Ron and Hermione. LF anything where they aren't together but aren't enemies either


** I don't think the average fanfiction writer knows how to write change without there being drama. For them drama is the smoke to the changes fire.

** I would love this. Obviously, they would still remain friendly because I find it hard to believe that they would stop talking entirely. But it would be nice for them to grow apart and find their own friends.

** Can you realistically grow apart from your friends in a boarding school without a fight? They are in the same house, take all (or most, in Hermione's case) of the same classes together. Cliques formed in boarding school are really hard to break off without something big to grease the wheels.

The only real chances for this is the end of year 2, where they pick electives. That would open a distance for Ron. But Hermione? That would be rather challenging. Maybe year three where everyone else is in Hogsmeade? But then everyone else in his year is in Hogsmeade. That leaves the younger years.

Or clubs. But really, Ron or Hermione would join them with him anyway.

The trio break up after an argument/fight. It doesn't descend into bashing. Harry ends up making more friends, picking up a hobby, and forms a club. They become friends again, but not the same dynamic as before. And before anyone says bashing, there are plot reasons for the splitup/people acting weird.

*** Of course there is likely to be an argument or differing opinions that cause people to grow apart but it doesn't mean that you change from bestfriends to mortal enemies.
