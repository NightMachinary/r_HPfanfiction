I recently read a story, "Need" by iluvfanfics [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=127333]] and fell in love and now I'm looking for anything similar that anyone has read. Preferably something with a really strong Harry/Ginny relationship..


** My own story, Harry Potter And the Bonds of Time series. First book is 91 chapters, second is a WIP, now 94 chapters, just updated today. There will be a third in the series.

- *Summary:* During the memorial party marking the third anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, Death Eaters attack the Ministry of Magic. In the skirmish, Harry and Ginny Potter wind up in the Time Chamber, a part of the Department of Mysteries and fall into a mysterious pool of water. When they wake up, Harry is eleven years old again and back on Privet Drive, and Ginny is ten and back in the Burrow, but they have their memories, thoughts and magical knowledge of their older selves. Stuck in the past with no way back, they decide to change the future for the better.
