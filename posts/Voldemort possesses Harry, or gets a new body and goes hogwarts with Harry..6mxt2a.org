someone know a fanfic like the seven horrocrux but more serius. I never read it completely, I do not really like all that humor.

I like something like linkffn(Yes, I am Harry's Brother) If you have not already read do so, is a 10/10. And preferably a pairing with voldy, no slash plz.

  "A pair of familiar eyes stared widely back at him. And it was at that moment, Harry finally realised, that he had never been free." A dark spin on the last chapter of the Deathly Hallows, 'Nineteen Years Later'. One Shot! Complete!

** He doesn't quite possess Harry, but in this the piece of Voldemort's soul in Harry wakes up and mentors Harry (mentor isn't really a good word for it, but I'm having a brain fart and can't think of anything better)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux)

and it's sequel, currently ongoing

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chrysalis)

  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay. A continuation of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
