******* Nope that's already impossible on so many levels

1; we don't know if the patronus is actually taught ever in hogwarts we only know that Harry learned it from Remus and that those in the DA learned it from Harry so it may not even get taught in Hogwarts

2;the patronus is a depiction of your inner animal so a human would probably be impossible and even if it wasn't then there's no frikin way it would be your best friend

3;we don't even know if they could perform the patronus charm so that's already a questionable thing

4;tampering with someone elses patronus is impossible if you don't slip a friking love potion into his drink but otherwise any possible way to tamper with someone's patronus is out of the question

So there you go, the whole thing has been destroyed

Why would it not be your best friend? Patronuses can reflect your feelings. See Tonks.

Example Severus /Lily

The patronus will change to be the same as the patronus of the one you love

************ Oh I'm not saying a patronus won't be an animal. I'm saying it won't always be YOUR inner animal. Maybe I didn't explain myself right.

There's no reason a patronus can't reflect your best friend, your lover, or yourself. Or your familiar, for all we know. I don't think it has to reflect your inner animal at all.
