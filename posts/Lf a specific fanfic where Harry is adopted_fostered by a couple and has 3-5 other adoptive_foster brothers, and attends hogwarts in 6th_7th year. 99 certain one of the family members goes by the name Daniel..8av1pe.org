**** If you're looking for a specific fic, the proper tag is 'Fic Search', not 'Request'.

****** Still, it is listed in the options section when you click on the "SUBMIT TEXT" button.

#+begin_quote
  *Request* - for a request for fanfics meeting a certain crieria i.e. Hermione-centric (example)

  *Fic Search* - for searching for one specific fanfiction that you cannot remember the name or link of (example).

******* That seems to be a web reddit/official reddit app function. I use primarily reddit sync which doesn't have the options section when making a post.

******** I haven't actually made a thread looking for a fic, so I don't have first-hand knowledge.

But there was a stickied [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/80jkjt/post_flairing/][thread]] a month ago, about post flairing. I don't know why they didn't make necessary changes in the sidebar though.

*EDIT:* Rule 7:

#+begin_quote
  Request threads are for recommendations. Fic Searches are for finding a specific fic. Make a discussion thread if you want to express your opinions about the thing being requested. Flair accordingly.

*********** Just checked, you're right. The mods should really fully update the info for flairing, they've got multiple posts saying different things.
