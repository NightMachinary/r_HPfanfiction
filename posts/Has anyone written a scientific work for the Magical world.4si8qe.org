I'm interested in languages and linguistics (and studying the latter in college), so I was thinking of writing a fic almost like a textbook/reference of the languages in the magical world.

So I'd feature stuff like Parseltongue and the way House Elves speak (I'm open to suggestions). Basically think Quidditch Through the Ages or Fantastic Beasts, but for languages.

But I was wondering if anyone's done something similar (done like a scientific analysis of the magical world) I can look at as an example?


** Taure's analysis of magic system: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/edit]]

A one-shot that emulates textbook for dueling: linkffn(8861649)

And also HPMOR, but it's mostly focused on showing why magical world shouldn't work than why it does. And it's not canon-compliant.

That's all I remember, sorry. Good luck with your own fic.

  Hey, kids. Want to learn how to duel in tournaments worldwide? Gotta start with the basics. You can't build a house from the roof down! (Well, you can with magic, but that's irrelevant.) I'm Dalton Desulgon, current world Dueling champion and Transfiguration Professor at Hogwarts, and this is how competitive dueling works. I wrote this for the Wizarding magazine Jiggery Potpourri.

** There is a bunch of blogs on specific topics, most of which no longer updated, but have a lot in archive:

[[http://departmentsofmysteries.tumblr.com/][FIELD NOTES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES]] is little like a cross between [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/][SCP]] and Harry Potter. It isn't 'science' as such, but worth a look.

[[http://wizardhistory.tumblr.com/][WIZARD HISTORY]] has some great 'explanations' of magic aimed at a muggle audience.

[[http://livesandliesofwizards.tumblr.com/][Notes from the wizard world]] is more blog then text book in feel, but again, might be worth a look.

[[http://thepostmodernpottercompendium.tumblr.com/][The Postmodern Potter Compendium]] may be a little too flowery in prose, but it might help too.

[[http://themonsterblogofmonsters.tumblr.com/][The Monster Blog of Monsters]] is pretty self explanatory.

Probably not what you are looking for, but there are also a number of wizard fashion tumblrs as well: [[http://amortentiafashion.tumblr.com/][Amortentia]] is the largest I think, but [[http://wizardfashion.tumblr.com/][Wizard Fashion]] still updates.

*** I second all of these, [[/u/Straw_Boats]]. The chick who runs MBoM is really great and she has a lot of interesting sections. She also runs a couple of other sides. Here is the link to her main: [[http://essayofthoughts.tumblr.com/links]] with a listing of blogs and descriptions, she was working on an encyclopedia so you can check that out too :)

** It's funny to think, but there are people out there doing serious academic research into the Harry Potter series and the world it presents. Here are a paper and a lecture by one such academic: [[http://www.academia.edu/1444893/The_Magic_of_Social_Control_governmental_media_control_and_deviantisation]] and [[http://www.academia.edu/284252/Speaking_ill_of_the_dead_a_moral_exploration_of_Sirius_Black_from_the_Harry_Potter_series_of_books]]
