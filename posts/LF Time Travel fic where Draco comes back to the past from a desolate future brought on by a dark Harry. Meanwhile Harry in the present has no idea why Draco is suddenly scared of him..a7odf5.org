** Hmm...I've seen something with that description, but it was only a one-shot in a collection. I can't find it in An Incomplete Potter Collection or Bolts From The Blue or From The Mind of Dunuelos...

I think this particular one-shot had Draco describe future Potter snapping, slaughtering Voldemort's forces and putting their heads up on pikes at Grimmauld Place (where his friends were murdered, thus causing him to snap)?
