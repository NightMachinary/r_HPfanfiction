** As far as I know, that's the most common type of Peggy Sue fic. Which ones have you already read?

My personal favourite is Nightmares of Futures Past, for the way it balances Harry's strengths and weaknesses, and focuses on the people rather than just the events. But it's incomplete and FFN took it down. You can still get most of it online at various sites.

#+begin_quote
  When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.

** Recommending my own fic here. Hope you enjoy it!

It's a fic where Harry Potter and Theodore Nott are Auror partners three years after the Battle of Hogwarts, and during an investigation of a criminal coven of witches and wizards, are sent back in time to their eleven-year-old bodies by an old Egyptian ritual. They decide to try and save as many people as possible while researching the ritual that sent them back in time and they change things up along the way; starting with Harry being Sorted in Slytherin.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
