would be nice if there was some romance involved be it Femmeslash/single pairing/harem. As long its not Slash its not really my thing.


** Hunger games crossover: linkffn(the snow queen by darklooshkin) rose Potter is trained as a career tribute for the Hunger Games before being summoned by the Goblet of Fire. Very messed up person. Femslash.

Linkffn(learning to breathe by onoM) Harry is a child soldier ordered to attend Hogwarts after defeating Lord Voldemort. Romance/some plot. Harry/Ginny

Linkffn(escapologist Harry by racke) Harry tries to run away constantly from the dursleys and eventually Hogwarts. Dumbledore keeps dragging him back. Comedy. No romance.
