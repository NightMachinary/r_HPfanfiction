This one is a crossover series with the MCU' verse where the story is centered around Luna Lovegood. The series is extremely underrated. I just needed to at least attempt to spread it considering I absolutely adore the writing. It's like looking at a painting except with words.

A really basic non spoiler(ish) summary: It starts off with a young, four year old Luna encounter with Loki. Afterwards tragedy strikes, and she ended up with some truly dreadful people. She then goes through the process to become the next â€˜Widow'. In a typical Luna fashion, she does not break. Then step by step she met others.

The Under the Moon series starts off with a chronological series of one shots or two shots that eventually turns into a multi chaptered fic. This series is written by MerciaLachesis or on Ao3, Mercia. Here are the links to both sites.

  There's a man in green and black pyjamas that Luna knows but won't remember. Whilst on a Red Room mission as surveillance and response, Luna sees someone from her past. DRABBLE. PART FOUR of the Under The Moon series. I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed a few times since then. -Lewis Carol (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.)

  Everything about today started off as normal. Expected. Luna has a mission. She needs to go to America. She lies. She meets some strange men. She re-evaluates. Madame Yelena is hesitant. So... normal. But nothing about this day has been ordinary, she realises finally. Neither will tomorrow. Really everything has changed because of today. PART SIX of the Under the Moon series.

** Why is it in so many parts? That alone is a huge negative. Recommend the author to fix that if he wants more readers...

*** I'm not sure honestly, but if it makes it easier I suggest reading the parts on AO3. I assume the author first wanted to write a couple of one shots or two shots that happened to be in chronological order before deciding to actually write the multi chapter fic.

However, the story itself is quite unique so I wanted to recommend it anyways. The plot really is underrated.
