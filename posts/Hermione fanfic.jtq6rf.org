:END:
Hey! I'm looking for a fanfic that im pretty sure is on FanFiction.Net It's about Hermione accepting a scroll ( i think) from Dumbledore and because of that she gets engaged to the Malfoys ( as in both of them, i think) so Hermione learns about pureblood traditions. It has one of the Greengrass sisters engaged to the Notts in the same way. And Mcgonagall and Molly Weasley were her â€˜mentors' in a way i guess. Oh and this starts in Hogwarts not sure about the spesific timeline. Thats all I can remember about it, ive been looking for it for a while. Please help I'm desperate ðŸ˜‚
