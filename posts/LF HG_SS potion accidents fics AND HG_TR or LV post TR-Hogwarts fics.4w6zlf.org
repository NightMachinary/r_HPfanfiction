** So, not exactly what you're asking for, but I just finished reading this HG/SS fic, and it's probably best I've read (the author has another novel length HG/SS that's just as good). Anyways, figured I'd suggest it in case you haven't read it.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)
