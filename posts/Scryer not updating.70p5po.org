I tried to look up some stories on [[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net/][DLP's Scryer]] today and I didn't find any stories newer than about 11 days old. I even tried with non-obscure characters (i.e. Harry and Dumbledore) and still did not see anything newer than 11 days. FF.net is still adding new stories, so there's no problem there.


** DLP has recently migrated to new forum software, and Scryer's been acting a little wonky since then. If you want to know more, [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/scryer-dlps-ff-search-engine.32979/page-5][look here]].
