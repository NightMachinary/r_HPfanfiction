"How can that be?" you ask? Well if we think about it in some way, shape or form you could say that not just Umbridge was Prof for the DADA position but Harry as well.

That would explain why a, as far as i at least can gather, pretty decent duelist died in such a... dumb... kind of way.

Why would Sirius die instead of Harry? as far as we know the Curse doesnt specify that the person holding the position of DADA Prof. dies, but just that in some way something bad does happen to them and they do not continue to be Prof. for another year. In this case one doesnt may lead to the other, but both still fit Harry has something bad happen to him in the form of his last "Family" dying and he doesnt continue with the DA after the end of the year, even thou it would still have been incredibly usefull for him and his friends to continue it.

We could even take this thaught one step further and say that the other people that were "Professors" for the DA or at least founding members of it also were affected by the Curse.

In adition to all that we would also have a reason why Harry was the only one not needing to visit the hospital for a longer period of time as the curse didnt affect him personally but through his godfather, while the others were affected themselfs.

This could also explain why (as far as i can remember) of all the order members only Sirius died. Voldemorts Curse affected him in Proxy of Harry.

What are your thaughts about this idea?

Kudos!


** On that note, Sirius was technically a founder since he encouraged Harry to go through with the plan.

However, I think the explanation is much simpler. They were at war and Sirius was a victim. Also neither Lockhart, Lupin, Moody, Umbridge, Snape or Carrow (presumably since he was taken out of the fight before it began) die while holding the position. And Harry didn't continue with the DA because, despite his opinion of Snape at the time, considered him competent enough. He actually says in the books that with a competent professor there's no need for DA.

Maybe Snape finally got to teach Defense because the curse removed all other options in order to stop Harry from teaching the DA again.

*** One could argue that Lupin, Moody and Snape died later, though Moody did not teach defense, it was Barty Crouch JR. (who did get the kiss immedietly after).

One could also argue that Lockhart and Umbridge did not die, because neither actually taught any defense. Umbridge just had them read from books, while Lockhart just talked about himself.

Not sure about the Carrows though

** [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/l1agq6/any_good_explanations_out_there_for_voldemorts/gjyqkqa/][I'm very much a fan of the idea]] that the curse on the Defence position at Hogwarts applied to Harry and that it is not always lethal. My own theory suggests that the nature of the curse is to confront the prospective teacher with their worst fears, in order to prove that they would make a better professor than Tom Riddle. In Harry's case, his worst fears involve being betrayed, being caught by Umbridge, leading his friends into danger where they suffer and he doesn't, losing Sirius due to his own mistakes, and facing Voldemort.

I think it would have been great if a sideline moment at the end of the book or the beginning of book 6 suggested that Harry would skip running the DA again out of fear of the curse hitting him again.

*** I really love your idea that the curse could be some sort of "test"!!! and it would fit to all the teachers i guess!

1.) Quirrel: Failed to help his master and died in the process\\
2.) Fraudhard: Wanted to be famous and known by all -> Cant even remember who he himself is\\
3.) Remus: Never wanted to attack anyone as a Werewolf and wanted it to be kept secret from everyone (even himself if it were possible) -> Got outed and attacked Harry and Friends

Next one is special as in it did happen for someone just for accepting the position

1. 1 ) Moody: Never wants to be caught of guard by enemies and be bested -> Thats just what happens to him and then he is locked in his trunk for a year\\
2. 2 ) Crouch Jr.: Wanted to see his Masters glorious return and triumph over harry -> Never saw His master in full form again and saw harry having escaped Voldemort\\
3. 1 ) Umbridge: Hated every Muggleborn and Half/Mixed Blood and wanted them Tortured/killed -> Got captured by "dirty Mixedbloods" in the form of Centaures\\
4. 2 ) Harry: Wanted a Family and to Live with his godfather -> His godfather and in my opinion last living Family (dursleys excluded) gets Murdered "because of him"\\
5. ) Snape: Wants to help kill Voldemort and Forgiveness for betraying Lily -> Gets called a traitor by Lilys son and has to return to Voldemorts side\\

not gonna comment on Carrow as i cant really remember what exactly happend here and we didnt get to know this character in any real way
