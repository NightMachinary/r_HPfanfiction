Writing a story and there is a point where Lily (a muggleborn) tried to explain to James (the pureblood) that her parents just barely understand the grading system in the Magical World. I was going to write "Well, muggles use a system with A's, B's, ect..." But that got me wondering about British Schools. Do they use a similar system as the US (100-90=A, 89-80=B, 79-70=C, 69-60=D, 60-0=F) and I'm confused by what I found on google. It said that 100-70 is a Distinction, 69-60 is a Merit, 59-50 is a Pass, 49-40 is a Tolerated Fail, and 39-0 is a Fail. Is this true?


** It gets a little complicated because it is, or it was when I was at school, ranked in terms of certain criteria that are, no so much subjective, but down to the teacher's discretion. My secondary school used grades from the age of about 15 and up, but prior to that it was about achieving certain levels, the expected standard of which rose with age. So, when I was 12 I was very good at history, and my teacher believed I showed "great understanding of turning points, cause and effects and the ability to undertake deep analysis of sources to establish why certain events occured", so my report said I was at 'Level 7'. Meanwhile, I was abysmal at maths, so generally got a level 4 or 5. Once it got to the age where grades were used instead, you could generally work out that if you got over a certain mark you would probably get a certain grade, but it was compared and adjusted across the country - so if it was a tough paper and everyone did badly, the grade boundary would be lowered for everyone. Exams like GCSEs (O Levels during Lily's day) would use grades like A, B, C, and so on. You can also get U which means ungraded, which is basically if you didn't do the paper or got every question wrong.

Bearing in mind, at primary school although levels were used, our reports and parent's evenings generally focused on 'effort' and descriptions of skill rather than specific grades or marks. The grades you have found regarding distinctions and merits generally apply to universities and colleges more than standard school.

Note: I was born in the early 90s, I don't know how it was in Lily's day.

*** Thanks. I'm trying to stay away from Americanisms and I was worried A's and B's were one of them.

**** No, they're not :)

Although bear in mind it's unlikely that Lily would have ever received a grade in that way. A good piece of work when you're under 11 is marked with a gold star and a nice comment from the teacher; I've never heard of anyone getting grades.

***** I got levels in primary school (4a, 5b, 6c), if you count those as grades.

***** It's really that she's explaining the mindset of her parents. She's saying that to them, an A is just average while to her parents an A is great. A big part of it is that James doesn't really get it because magic is just normal to him. It's similar to, at least in my story, History of Magic is incredibly boring to him but is fascinating to her. It's just normal history to him while it's history with fantastical creatures and /magic/ to her.

** The way it works now for GCSE's (age 16 exams) and A levels (age 18 exams) (though it is being changed for the next year) is the A*(100-90), A(90-80), B(80-90)... system. However, what Lily would have experienced to the best of my knowledge is the level 3, 4, 5 system in which a level 5 is a high level of attainment for an 11 year old, this includes sub categories of the numbers of a, b, c with 'a' as the highest. It may have changed back then though since the government seems to change the whole system once a decade.

** Current secondary school exams in UK are GCSEs (graded G-A*) which came in in 1988.

Lily died in 1981.

The secondary school at the time (and what her parents would understand) were O-Levels.

They were graded 1-5 pre 1965 (which her parents would have taken) and A-E from 65-88.

** Thank you.

Thank you for taking the time to actually do a little research and ask questions instead of just using the American system like most authors would, it's a breath of fresh air!

** Fortunately, Lily grew up in England, so the other comments are accurate. Otherwise, if it was Scotland you're getting into Standard grades, which marks 1-8 (equivalent of GCSE) and then Highers and advanced Highers with marks A-F (equivalent O level's i think). I don't know how Wales and Ireland work...

** when i was in primary school we had levels that constantly went up. so getting a high score at 6 might get you to 2, then when you leave school you'd probably have a 4. i think we had to carry on the first half of secondary to 5 or 6. then gcse's later.

** mm, in general an A would be 80%, a B 70%, a C 60% in the UK. There may or may not be other grades added on below or above that to distiguish, but that depends on the location and time.

A C is often the lowest passing grade as well but once you get to higher levels of education, your last two years of highschool, D and E tend to count as low-achieving passing grades too. So a bit different to the US system!

In general I guess, our 'high achieving' threshold is lower, but our 'minimum pass' threshold is higher.

** Short answer: for the purposes of your story, the American and British systems are the same. Britain has grades going lower than an F, but if this is just an offhand thing then you don't need to know that.

** I have never heard of that. From ages 12-16 we do GCSEs, where it goes A/, A, B, C and so on. Same for the Sixth Form (college 17-18), just different boundaries. Typically around >90% A/ >80% A, though there is a uniform mark scheme. It's different in Scotland too.

**** They're also grades for BTEC courses, which afaik are GCSE equivalent? And there's a type of vocational course whose name I can't remember that you can take instead of A-levels that's scored the same way.
