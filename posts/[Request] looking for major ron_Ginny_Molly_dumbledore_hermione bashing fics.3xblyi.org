*** isnt the whole fanfic genre about canon harry bashing ?

i mean the canon version is pretty bad so any fanfic is an improvment.

seriously the guy got issues, naming his kids after the 2 ppl that ruined his life is pretty obvious Stockholm syndrome.

******* Even if there is no sane way possible to get a Horcrux removed from one's head, things could have been improved dramatically if Dumbledore had just shown his hand to Harry.

- If he had just told Harry or Hermione about the Hallows instead of giving Hermione a book she had to manually translate they wouldn't have had reason to go to Xeno. A meeting they barely got out of with their lives.
- Snape (an apparently loyal spy for over a decade) would have been far less likely to die if he could have just dropped his cover when Harry came to Hogwarts with backup. Instead Dumbledore gave Snape vague instructions regarding Voldemort keeping his snake close (what if they'd manage to kill it in Godric's Hollow, oops?), which led with seconds to spare to the plan being kept alive and Harry thinking he's going to be marching to his death, feeling betrayed by Dumbledore.
- Dumbledore knew/suspected Ron was going to abandon Harry, as evidenced by the deluminator. If he had at least explained its secondary use they could have been reunited faster.

Dumbledore planned his death for nearly a year, he had plenty of time for any of these things. And those are just the first three things I came up with regarding his final plan. Regarding his entire treatment of Harry there are many more things that he could have done better, even with the knowledge available to him at the time.

******** 1) This is literally mentioned in the book. Go read it.

2) It was far more dangerous for Snape to drop his cover than to keep it. Also, he didn't even get a proper chance, McGonagall started dueling him before he even /met/ Harry. He had no idea where Harry was at that point; it wasn't safe to drop his cover by then.

3) You really think Ron would have kept the deluminator if he knew what it was for? He'd have probably chucked it away before leaving or something.

Both unfinished fem!Harry stories. Although Hermione is being redeemed somewhat in Ancient Contract and Hermione/Ron's behavior has an external cause in Forks (Twilight crossover).
