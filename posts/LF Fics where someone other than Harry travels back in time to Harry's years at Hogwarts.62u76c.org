I don't want a marauders-era or Tom Riddle-era fic. Someone other than Harry goes back to help Harry or stop Harry or whatever. Preferably on purpose but accidentally works too, and I'd also prefer if it's not a regurgitation of canon with a character who knows more. So preferably no "keeping the time lines as close as possible".

Bashing, slash, Crossovers and dark!characters are fine. Please no genderbending, harems, romance/smut-centric plots, mpreg or pottercest. Thank you!


** Far Too Many Time Travelers by Lord Jeram.

You wanted someone other than Harry to travel back in time? In this fic, pretty much /everyone/ other than Harry travels back in time.

** linkffn(3081161) Secrets in the Room of Requirement.

A little unusual since it's not really "going back", but features James and Lily who go forward in time in an accident that involves the ROR.

Imo, it's an unique fic. Started out good, the middle is a little weak but the whole story was wrapped up nicely.

*** Also there's the "Backward with Purpose" series, specifically book 2, that has what you're looking for. Though without reading book 1, which is only Harry going back in time with a little twist, you won't understand anything.

It's well written though.

**** I'm not dyslexic but I literally thought that was the name of the fic until just now. My life is a lie.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
