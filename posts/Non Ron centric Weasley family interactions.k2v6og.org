Does anyone know any five that focus on the relationship between the weasley kids. I have read a lot with Ron being the main focus so if anyone knows any fics focusing on the others I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you so much!

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** I've got a couple, actually. I love reading sibling dynamics in fics. I have a brother and aisster and there's really nothing more complicated than a sibling bond.

I just recommended this on another post. Focuses on what Percy did in the war. The second one has one of my favorite quotes about Harry:

There's also one this one, where Ginny actually dies in the chamber and goes to king's cross:

This is a SI into Percy, but it's short and centers around the Weasley family dynamic:

  He knows, knows deep in his soul, that if Potter ever wanted to take over Britain, he could do it, and most of them would probably just cheer along.

  angelsarenamederika asked: "Have you ever written any works about that clean, empty train station Harry ended up in? Or rather, what that place may have looked like for other people?" At eleven years old, Ginny Weasley almost died on the cold Chamber floor.

  Harper Weasley does not belong to this world, and she knows it. (But that doesn't mean she'll let a madman tear apart her family.)
