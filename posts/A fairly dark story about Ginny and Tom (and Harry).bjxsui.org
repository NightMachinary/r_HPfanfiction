I'm looking for the story [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2633738][In dreams]] written by inlings/pumpkinpasties (?) . I'm not sure if I should mark it as Ginny/Tom or Ginny and Tom, but it's a quite dark story about Ginnys communication with Tom, and also how it affects her relationship with Harry.

The story appears to be deleted, and I can't find it anywhere. If anyone has a link or a copy, please let me know.
