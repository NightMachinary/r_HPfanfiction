The fallout between Dumbledore and Grindewald was a ruse, carefully crafted by Gellert Grindewald to implant his first and most loyal follower inside the British ministry. His idea was, should the war ever go downhill, Albus would take the mantle of his defeater, allowing Gellert to retire into a life of luxury behind the walls of Numengrad under the disguise of "imprisonment", safely away from those leaders of magical europe who wanted him dead. Meanwhile Dumbledore would use his fame to influence the insular nation towards their ideals and viewpoints, creating a safehaven for their followers.

Their plan partially worked and Dumbledore started raising and recuiting the second generation of Storm Wizards from the muggleborn population of Hogwarts, appealing to their sense of wonder and their resentment towards british purebloods for scorning them away. Only people who knew the full extent of their plans was Dumbledores inner circle: The Order Of The Phoenix.

The only fluke in their plan was Tom Riddle, who Took advantage of the resentment of entitled, petty pureblood heirs for Dumbledores favoritism for "Mudbloods". Tom Riddle appealed to their sense of superiority and played on their paranoias created as a result of their generations of sheltered lifestyles. He styled himself as Dark Lord Voldemort and wage war against those who didnt follow his ideas.

Dumbledore however was much more cunning than Tom and seeing Toms ideas did not allign with his, he created a cunning plan to eliminate him. He created a fake prophecy to lure Tom into a trap and asked for volunteers amongst his inner circle as bait. He send word of the location of the the couple who volunteered to be bait through Pettigrew. Dark Lord expected to find two light alligned wizards cought offguard and defenseles, he did not excpect two dozen wizards strike him down with killing curses and torch the house down with fiendfire to erase all evidence.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12177140/1/Phoenix-Corrupted]] kinda fits your prompt/request of Grindewald and Dumbledore faking a falling out. Also I've gotta say that while people make fun of the name death eaters, it's still way more intimidating than storm wizards.

*** There is more to a name than intimidation, though. What if Grindelwald was more interested in choosing a name that would inspire and unite his followers rather than scare children?

**** Would you feel particularly united by "storm wizards"? There's nothing that evokes feelings of inspiration and unity in the phrase. Acolytes and Alliance have themes of uniting for a charismatic leader, uniting for a common goal, and is respectable by one's enemies. I would straight up refuse to become a "storm wizard". What am I? An idiot who likes to chase storms on my broom?

***** For those who might actually want to be part of an army to conquer the world in the name of racial superiority, I'd think the name is an easy sell. Storms are unstoppable forces, made up of many smaller pieces, that fill the sky, cover the ground, and strike their targets dead faster than the eye can follow - but at the same time, the rain they bring is essential to renewing the land. A man like Grindelwald would have no trouble spinning that.

** This sounds just a bit like linkffn(Albus Dumbledore, Accelerationist) - Dumbledore and Grindewald aren't quite working together, but Dumbledore's still very sympathetic to Grindewald's views.

  Many have criticized Albus Dumbledore for not taking adequate steps to undermine Tom Riddle's plays for power, rein in Severus Snape's behavior toward Gryffindors, and see to Harry Potter's welfare... but what if that was the point? 'It is in this revolutionary sense alone, gentlemen, that I vote in favor...' (Manipulative!Dumbledore. Oneshot. Crackfic.)

** Not a bad idea. You might be interested in reading these two stories that show how Dumbledore and Grindelwald never really separated and still believe in many of the same things.

Try reading Broken Bonds by Broomstick Flyer has Dumbledore together with Grindelwald.

linkffn(10877032)

Lord of Darkness by AngelSlayer135 has Dumbledore working with Grindelwald against Harry.
