During Voldemort's resurrection ritual Pettigrew uses "the blood of the enemy forcibly taken", but Harry has Voldemort's horcrux in his forehead, so wouldn't that mean that by doing that Voldemort is not only naming Harry as his enemy, but himself as well?

How do you think this might affect the plot / are there any fics that explore this idea, and develop it further and how it might affect Voldemort's actions ?

** I don't think that the Hocrux inside Harry's head are integrated to Harry's blood. So the ritual won't declare the scar as Voldemort enemy.

***** If you just want a fluffy SoL story you don't let Voldemort try to come back, you say he's dead and that's it. Keeping the resurrection scene is just initiating a bad plot device that you nip in the bud, and it's infinitely worse and more frustrating than just "yeh he ded since 1981 no worry bruv"

** Voldemort carried his muffle father's name. I kind of assume he hated himself on some level. After all, he did everything he could to change who he was, destroying all connections to his past.
