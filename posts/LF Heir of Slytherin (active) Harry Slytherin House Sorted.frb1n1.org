Hi Is there a fanfiction out there where Harry is the rightful Heir to Slytherin and is sorted in that house in first year ? And where Dumbledore manipulation fail at each floor. Yes I do not want those where he is in Gryffrindor and discover that he has a ligneage by some deus ex machina after Sirius died or told by Sirius what he did not research on his own about his ligneage.


** I have a really good one, but it's only on wattpad I'm pretty sure, and wattpad is a joke around here so..
