I just remembered a story I read a while ago, but the only thing I can remember is that it plays at least partly during the tournament and that, when Harry gets his Golden Egg from the Dragon, all except for on egg are trampled and he kills the dragon (before knowing it is a mother, by fighting fire with fire) and when he notices that, he gets the sole remaining egg, wants to smash it in his fury as he thinks it would be better for the orphaned egg and shouts at the jugdes that they made him murder the dragon.\\
Charlie takes the egg from him and tells him he'll care for it, Dumbledore first wanted to give Harry 6 points but flips his card (why were they even using cards instead of writing with magic..) so that it is a 9 instead and Harry throws his golden egg to him, saying he doesn't want it.\\
I think that all happens in one chapter, but I can't remember anything else that happens in the story, not even if it was complete.. and now it's bugging me. If anybody read it and remembers what it was called, please let me know.

  (4/7) Harry Potter is Slytherin's Tri-Wizard Champion. Witches want him. Wizards want to be him. Death Eaters want to kill him. Even though Harry's selection is an attempt on his life, Harry doesn't see any reason not to enjoy the benefits of being a Champion... especially when that means snogging shapely witches. But will Harry become distracted from his primary goal: survival?
