:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I recently had my internet history deleted and lost the Hermione/Tom Riddle or Hermione/Voldemort fic I was reading and I can't remember the name.

Basically Hermione had a one night stand with a disguised Voldemort. She ends up having a daughter and going to university where Voldemort ends up a professor. They live across the hall from each and eventually move in together. Their daughter can speak parcel tongue like Voldemort.

I can't remember anything else as I wasn't that far into it. Any help is greatly appreciated as I need to know how this ends!!!
