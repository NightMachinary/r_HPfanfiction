#+TITLE: Are there any fics where Harry goes into the chamber of secrets and instead of a library from Slytherin or Slytherins portrait there’s a bunch of books and notes from parselmouths that have found the chamber before?

  The writing on the wall said she'd been taken, that her skeleton would lie in the Chamber, that no one could find, forever. Everyone believed it because they still had no idea where it was. Ginny/Harry. Slow Burn.

** Not Harry, but Ginny finds a lot of Voldemort's old journals in Chamber Girl when she gets stuck there. (basic story: The Trio never figure out where the Chamber is. The Diary Horcrux is killed by sheer dumb luck because the Basilisk is hungry enough to drip venom and it lands on the diary. Ginny remains in the Chamber until Harry's fifth year, surviving on her wits.)
