I'm looking for fics where Sirius has a child that is around Harry's age. I just finished reading As Black as Night and its (currently incomplete) sequel, The Brightest Star, and I'm wondering if there are any other stories out there of similar quality (I would prefer longer stories as well).

** here's one, while he's not a main player per se, if it wasn't for Sirius son in this series harry wouldn't be able to do half the things she does. It's a fem harry story, no pairings so far and the author is still updating. though it's only up to book three at the moment, they're fairly long and interesting however, deals a lot with potions and magic. very plot heavy as well.
