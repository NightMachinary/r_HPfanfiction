Like if you write a pureblood character in and they have such a normal name, kill me everytime.


** yeah we need need pure-bloods with weird names, like in canon. for example James Potter, no muggle would ever be called James Potter

** Stop changing Harry's name. Fem!Harry being Harriet or Rose or something is fine, but Harry's name is not Hadrian. Even if he's evil, or in Slytherin. Nothing kills a fic faster.

** I particularly notice when authors insist on picking names that aren't really logical because of the context. Like authors who use names they are familiar with but who wouldn't be commonly used at the time and in the country the story is in, without an explanation on why.

I also notice self-inserts disguised as AU when the names of some characters are really out of place. Particularly fem! AU.
