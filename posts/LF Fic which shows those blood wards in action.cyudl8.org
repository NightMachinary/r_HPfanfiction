:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Actually is there /any/ fic, where some Death Eaters/other bad people attack 4 Privet Drive and they are thwarted by those blood wards? The only two stories I can think of where those wards are at least taken into account is a crackfic linkffn(Testing Defenses by canoncansodoff) and they are not successful in the chapter 7 (actually a rather sweet, in contrast what I think of the latter development of whole story) of linkffn(The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs).

I would love to see some Death Eaters burnt to cinder or something like that. Is there anything?

  What if Dudley wasn't an only child. What if a gift of Lily to her sister, along with the wards protecting Harry resulted lots of children in a household full of love instead of resentment. What if the wards were more powerful the more family that lived under them, What if the protection imparted by Lily to her son, also was imparted to those new magical children
