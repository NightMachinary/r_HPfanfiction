Looking for a fic I read a couple of years ago that I can't find it myself. It was an OC story about a girl who can speak parseltongue, set after epilogue there's a Humanoid Snake monster in Hogwarts. Auror Harry and I think Ron and Hermione end up investigating too. That's pretty much all I remember, the story stood out to me because it was one of the future OC stories that had an interesting premise.
