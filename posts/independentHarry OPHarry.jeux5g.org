Dumbledore is running for minister on his platform of senior support and Greater-Good tax increases, with the support of the Phoenix Party, he thinks he has what it takes to win. Voldemort wants to lower taxes but has an evil agenda with his Dark Mark Party that includes the legalization of Horrcrux making. The Wizarding community is torn, on one hand they know Voldemort's schemes are evil, on the other, he wants to lower taxes.

When the Wizengamot, in charge of deciding the election, faces a tie and a government lockdown, no one knows what to do. If they don't elect someone quickly, Wizengamot speaker Umbridge is going to be declared the new Minister.

Suddenly, someone finds out that the Potter seat at the Wizengamot is still valid and Harry Potter is sent to the foreground of the political battle. However, Harry is a true independent part of an Outside Party and is unsure who should earn his deciding vote. Join him in the two most chaotic weeks of his life as both Dumbledore and Voldemort try to earn his vote.

** Why would Voldemort want to legalize Horcrux making since that was his little secret to outlive everyone?

*** Maybe not? This Voldemort may have found out that Horcruxes makes the creator insane and instead decided to have everyone else make one so he has an easier time controlling them as /'the only (supposedly) sane person around'/ now having every magical in Britain as his immortal servants.

***** Which Voldemort only discovers when he is giving his campaign speech (fine-tuned to appeal for a bunch of rabid psychopaths) when he runs for minister... Lucius is /soooo/ getting crucioed for this particular blunder on Voldemort's part...
