looking for a fic where Harry doesn't go to the Dursley's or is rescued from them before he goes to Hogwarts. preferably he grows up with Sirius and it must be complete including any sequals.


** There are lots of such fics, but the real trick is to find ones that don't rehash the canon:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): James and Lily got Voldemort with a nasty trap and raised Harry by themselves. This Harry has never gone to Hogwarts and has never made friends with the usual suspects. It's a dark war epic with a very original plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): Harry was adopted by Grindelwald when he was ten. He only turned up for Hogwarts in Year 7.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): Harry is raised by his BAMF archeologist aunt, Dr. Petunia Evans. She, Sirius, Bill, and Fleur did the heavy lifting against Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): Harry ran away at age 6 and was adopted by the Grangers. He and Hermione grew up as siblings.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005755/1/][The Daring Win]], linkffn(12005755): Harry is raised by Dolores Umbridge, and that has a major effect on his personality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Lucius Malfoy emerged as the big winner following Voldemort's defeat in 1981. Dumbledore and his remaining followers retreated to France, and Harry is raised by Sirius there. He went to Beauxbaton with Neville and the Weasleys. 18 years later, they are going to have their revenge.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/][When in Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363): Gilderoy Lockhard found baby Harry on Dursley's doorsteps. Consequently, Harry has become a cunning memory charm expert.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** The Dogfather by hollimichele. The Dursleys call the cops and pretend they don't know who Harry is. The only piece of the note left has Harry's first name on it. Harry is adopted by a loving muggle couple and the fic covers from this to the end of his first year. Like the name suggests, Sirius gets involved early. Wolfstar, subtle at first, then not so subtle.

** Well, the requirement for sequels to be complete rules out "Innocent" by MarauderLover7, I guess. Although there's a million words already written, and book five is still active, and it really does explore the impact of him living with Sirius (notably, Sirius who's still a fugitive).
