:FlairText: How's my Draft?
:END:
Here's my current draft for my story's prologue. How do you guys like it? Hopefully I fixed all of the formatting, as I pasted this from Word.

*October 31st, 1981*

Godric's Hallow was a quaint little town of old, brick houses with prominent chimneys. To the surrounding towns, it was also known as the town of weird people. Of course, they didn't know a large majority of the town's population was really made up of pure-blooded wizards and witches, whose forefathers had called the town home for nearly a millennium.

Lord Voldemort walked slowly up the lane to the Potter's Cottage. He was a tall man, of six feet five inches, with glowing red eyes.

He'd originally planned to kill the Potter boy. However, two of his older followers pointed out that a conditioned Harry Potter was more useful than a dead Harry Potter, or worse, one that lived. He had no idea where Arcturus and Abraxas had come up with such a ludicrous idea, and he'd been quite tempted to Crucio both men for the first time. He decided he'd withhold prospective punishment until after he'd seen the results of tonight's excursion. They were among his most useful followers.

He silently opened the gate to the cottage, and walked up the door. He contemplated just blowing the door up, but having Potter open the door to see him would be more in the Halloween spirit. He should have glamored himself to look like a snake.

/Knock! Knock! Knock!/

The door opened.

"Hello kidd-FUCK! LILY, GET HARRY AND RUN!" James yelled.

Lily Potter launched herself out of her seat, grabbed Harry, and raced up the stairs. Idiots.

He decided to start the conversation with a nice opening line.

"Hello, James. How's everything going?"

James growled. "A bit worse since you've showed up. Terrible costume, by the way."

Voldemort chuckled. "A bit irritable today, are you not? Then again, I can't blame you, since Grindelwald took over France today."

"And you're allied?" the younger man pressed.

"Of course. Not that you're going to get the word out. /Avada Kedavra!/"

Given that only a few feet separated them, James Potter had no time to dodge the jet of green light. He fell to the ground like a marionette whose strings had been cut.

With the first part of his task accomplished, he walked up the staircase to the second floor of the cottage. The first door was rather obviously barricaded and as magically shielded as one could make a door in the span of a minute.

/Bombarda! Bombarda! Bombarda Maxima!/

The final blasting curse overcame the barricade, blowing up the door and some of the surrounding wall.

"Don't take Harry! Please, kill me instead! Don't hurt Harry!" the redheaded woman shouted.

"No thank you, Miss Potter. /Avada Kedavra! Avada Kedavra! Avada Kedavra!/"

Lily Potter showed marginally more cranial capacity than her husband. She dropped Harry into the crib, threw herself onto the floor, drew her wand, and snapped up with a flurry of curses.

/Pop!/

Voldemort apparated a few feet to the right, and cast half a dozen stunners, which Lily reflected back at him.

/"Lumos Maxima!"/ she screamed.

Unfortunately for Lily Potter, the age old trick of temporarily blinding somebody with a powerful light spell didn't work on somebody with ritually enhanced eyesight.

/"Avada Kedavra!"/

Lily Potter fell to the ground, dead.

He turned his attention to the infant in the crib. The crib and Harry were miraculously unharmed.

"Dada!" Harry said, mistaking him for James.

Voldemort chuckled. "I'm your daddy now, Harry."

He conjured a baby basket and placed Harry in it. He then grabbed one of Harry's blankets and placed it over him to keep him warm, as the cold Halloween air was now seeping into the room.

With a quiet pop, he disappeared into the night, just as Albus Dumbledore reached the top of the staircase.

Hollow. Its Godric's Hollow.

Do you remember the pet peeve thread from yesterday? Yeah... that's exactly what we talked about there. You may have some errors, in both grammar and typos, but at the very least get the names right.

Also, these "Voldemort adopts Harry" stories never made sense to me. The prophecy is pretty clear.

#+begin_quote
  The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies...
#+end_quote

It doesn't make sense for Voldemort to keep Harry around. Voldemort's entire scheme builds on the fact that he's top dog. Why would he nourish and raise someone prophesied to have power dangerous to him and his rule?

This doesn't mean you shouldn't write this, don't get me wrong. But it does require some additional reasoning as to why he doesn't just kill off the nuisance of a potential threat to his power.

** Voldemort chuckled twice. Why is he chuckling? He's a mass murdering psychopath with a horrible high-pitched laugh.

In general, it feels too light-hearted for such a dark moment in canon.

These don't quite match.

James isn't the straight man here or he'd start with curses instead of banter. It's not outrageous enough for Lily to be the straight person with everyone else being bonkers.

Tone consistency is hard.
