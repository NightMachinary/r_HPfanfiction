If anyone knows it that'd be great, all I remember is that Harry gets stuck in another world and finds out he has wings and can teleport

It's good fantasy but has little to do with Harry Potter.

  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.
