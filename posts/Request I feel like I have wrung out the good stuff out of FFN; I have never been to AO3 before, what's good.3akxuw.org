I have been reading HP fanfics for ages now, but only on FFN. I have come across I rather worrying problem, /everything I come across now sucks/. Now I /just/ stumbled across this subreddit today. I have looked through the top posts for a list like this, but my search has come up barren.

- *What do I need to read at Archive of our Own?*
- *What are the hidden gems at FFN*
- *Any other good sites*

I would prefer not to have to slog through the refuse to find something that I enjoy, so any help would be appreciated.

Things I don't like

- Weird crossovers
- DM, LV, SS slash
- Pedophilia pairings (like HG/SS or HP/LV)

Things I like

- Interesting and fresh pairings that work
- Really long fics
- Pretty much everything else

EDIT: I don't dislike slash or oneshots, just slash with the characters above


** If you don't like slash or one-shots, AO3 will be of limited utility to you. It was initially mostly populated by exiles from the M-rated porn slashfic purges a few years ago on FFN. It has diversified some, but not that much. Mostly, it is where people put stuff beyond FFN's "M" rating. Let me check my bookmarks...yep, almost all "explicit" rated shorts. Oh well.

On the other hand, popular stories on AO3 are actually usually good, and you can filter out slash by putting

#+begin_example
  -"m/m" -"f/f"
#+end_example

in the other tags field. Same thing works for any specific pairings you want to remove, as well as crossovers. Just find the tag, minus and quote, and it should work. That's a huge thing over FFN. Shame it isn't more popular with HP fans, though it is getting a lot of traction with new movie and TV show fandoms.

*** This. From a technical perspective, AOOO is much easier to manage. Unfortunately, there's also much less good to find, and all the tricks can't make you find anything that isn't there. FFN is just so large that it collects most of everything by default, whereas AOOO is very definitely focused on a niche.

** I prefer Ao3 in terms of appearance and ease of use, but wading through slash, smut and crossovers is one of the downsides of Ao3, as others have said. Also, as you have said "weird" crossovers, but not what qualifies as weird I don't really have much to recommend in terms of Ao3, as crossovers and other fandoms are all I've got on Ao3.

Perhaps not a hidden gem of FFN, but it's one of my favourites, and I've yet to see it mentioned here;

linkffn(The Code)

It's long, quite well-written, and the pairing/romance doesn't happen until the third book. The only downside, as usual, is slow updates.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is abruptly thrown into a different world upon receiving his letter from Hogwarts. Danger stalks him at every turn, light and dark are locked in a constant, eternal battle, and weaving it all together is this substance called magic...

  Story cross-posted from fanfiction.net (under the same name). The chapter notes between the two websites are identical. POV changes are (hopefully) broken by line breaks. If they are not working, please let me know."Speech"Thoughts~Paseltongue~/Mindspeak/ As of now (March 2015), I'm editing and re-posting all of my stories (also on Fanfiction.net, if anyone's interested, same username). The story is exactly the same, I've just polished up some of the grammar to make it easier to read. I've also tweaked a few details here and there to make the chapters more consistent with one another.The biggest change in this chapter is that Sebastian speaks Portuguese. In the previous version of this story, he spoke Spanish. This is mainly because he used the work "amigo" in the books, and I knew that word meant "friend" in Spanish. Turns out, it also means "friend" in Portuguese, which is the national language of Brazil which was where Seb was heading. So, hence the switch. [This is what I get for taking French instead...]The other big change is how I've written the Parseltongue. Between writing this story and now, I've read lots, and lots, and lots of Harry Potter fics. Most of them tackle the "talking to snakes in writing" problem at some point or other. I've seen things that work really well, and things that epically failed. The writing with a ton of "ssss" thrown in? Looks really cool but makes it almost impossible to read. So, new technique. I chose to denote the Parseltongue speech with ~...~ because ~ looks like a little snake.Finally (sorry for the long note), to clear up some things:1. The reason Harry didn't meet Draco (or Professor Quirrell, for that matter) was because he went to the Alley on a different day than in the book. So, technically, they wouldn't be there.2. The spell Harry casts wandlessly is a simple glammer spell. The reason he can do it is survival: if it's necessary to survive, then he can cast it, although not easily and only under extreme stress.

  All Harry knew that day was that his Aunt Petunia had begun to scream. When he came from his cupboard to see what was wrong, he found her sitting pale and distraught on the spotless kitchen tiles. She was gibbering as that evening's three-kilogram chicken dinner did a rather acrobatic tap-dancing lap of the room, squawked loudly, and then fled through the window and out into the back yard. In which Harry Potter animates the dead. Dumbledore disapproves. Other forces... not so much.

  I've been working on this fanfic for a little while, and the lovely exoscopy has checked it over for me... sometimes.

  Harry expected to die when the wards fell on their tent. He never thought he'd end up in an alternate reality, expected to win a war that he had already lost.

  Disclaimer: This is a work of fan fiction using characters from the Harry Potter world, which is owned by J.K. Rowling. This story is for entertainment purposes only, and I do not make any profit from it, other than the reader's enjoyment.Rating is subject to change. It is currently rated for language and dark themes.This is Part Three of a series. Part Two is not needed to understand this, but Part One is.

  A note on tags: I'll add characters/descriptors as they occur. There will be NO pairings for Hermione; like canon, Harry will have crushes, but not act on any. Any other pairings included are background and canon--James/Lily, Arthur/Molly Weasley, etc. I'm also being purposefully vague and/or secretive about a lot of things. Be patient. I don't want to give anything away, but if you are terribly confused, let me know and I can try to be a little less so. Update Schedule: this one might be more random; probably once every two weeks, by Sunday evening. Or so depending on my inspiration. So, the next chapter will be posted on or before 3/01/2015.

  Before Harry's sixth year, he never thought a great deal about how wizards Sort others: by blood, by allegiance, and by House. When those strictures begin to crumble, Harry must find his own way without relying on prejudice or presumption, aided by Severus Snape, Remus Lupin, and an increasingly enigmatic Draco Malfoy. This story is now COMPLETE! <3 Thanks so much to everyone who read and reviewed!Join me in the sequel starting in December, Geas of Gryffindor. For those of you new to the story, yes, this part does come to a distinct end. ;)-K

  I will be posting a chapter a day, as life permits. :)

  "Death is not... It's the absence of presence, nothing more ... the endless time of never coming back ... a gap you can't see, and when the wind blows through it, it makes no sound..." - Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, by Tom Stoppard

  Harry has been able to see ghosts for as long as he could remember, and when he learns about magic, he thinks he has his explanation. But Harry is still unique in the magical world, and with enemies closing in from all sides, he must learn how to gather the support he'll need. Trusting the living is no easy thing.

** Implying that readers of HG/SS, HP/SS, HP/LV and 50 other pairings are pedophiles is extremely offensive. Pedophilia has nothing to do with age difference, it is sexual attraction to /prepubescent children/.

**** Please, I understand why someone wouldn't enjoy reading about 16 year olds having sex with their teachers - the dynamic of such relations can be very toxic - but this is just unnecessary.

Pedophilia is a medical term, not a legal one. It doesn't matter if someone is still in school.
