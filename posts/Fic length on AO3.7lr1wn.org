Is it possible to set up search parameters like on FFnet so i don't have to look at 3 million sub-1500 word stories to actually find something that will last longer than 90 seconds?


** Type words>1500 in the 'search within results' box.

*** I so wish Ao3 would finally add drop down menus for the most common categories/tags/characters.

** I think the syntax in the search within results box is: Words:>1500 (although personally I'm more of a words:>50000 kind of girl)

You can sort by word count too. But of course then you have to scroll past all the epics.

*** At the time of writing i was wondering if any new Life Is Strange stories had popped up so i figured that 1500 or 3000 words would get rid of drabbles and the like.. Otherwise i'm right there with you..
