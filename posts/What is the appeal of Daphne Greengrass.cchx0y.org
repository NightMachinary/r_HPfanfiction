** This question has been answered a thousand times already. Her popularity is BECAUSE of her status as a blank slate. Writers can mold her personality/background/history to anything they like. There is no canon they have to adhere to. Combine that with the fact that she is in Slytherin and you have a playground for different routes in regards to the character.

** You just answered your own question. The only thing I would add to the fact that she is a blank slate is she is also a Slytherin which opens up a whole new set of avenues to explore. That is why I chose to write about her.

** You answered your own question. She's a blank slate.

If your ideal match for Harry is sarcastic, cold and blonde - she's that.

If your ideal match is ditzy, buxom and beautiful - she's that

If your ideal match is cynical, intelligent and passionate - she's that

If your ideal match is clever, quiet and considered - she's that
