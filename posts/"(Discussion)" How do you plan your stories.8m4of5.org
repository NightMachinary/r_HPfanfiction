If you write multichapter stories, how far ahead do you plan? Not just the end, but all the steps in between? Do you know the important plotpoints and character developments before hand?

Do you write those ideas down in some form or do you keep them in your mind? and if you write it down in what detail? Do you know what should happen in each chapter or just what should happen all over?


** I... have absolutely no plan. I mean, I've got a set of things I want to happen at some point, and keep coming up with more as I go along, but I mostly make it up as I go. I do have a ready-made epilogue to march in Rowling's noble footsteps, though.

** Usually I start with a large quantity of drugs and alcohol.

Just kidding, they usually start as day dreams I have that I develop later on with quick sketch or outline then flesh out from there.

** Seat of the pants right here. I get an idea for a story, usually with the major beats--beginning, middle and end--in place in my mind and then I have at it. I'm trying to be better at writing a sort of outline and notes, but that's kind of hit and miss.

For example, I have a story where Ginny has to sort of re-home a ghost. I knew there was a ghost and that she was going to be successful, but other than that, I didn't know anything until I started writing. Turns out the ghost was a young British Revolutionary War soldier who fell in love with an American girl and ended up haunting her and her descendants until the last one died. What was a wizard doing in the military? Oh, hold on, he was a squib! Just enough magic to become a ghost. The girl he loved was thoroughly Muggle and was never able to see him as a ghost. Ginny is in Boston at a conference and buys Harry a gift--the item that the solider was tied to and so is stuck with helping him move on. Many hijinks ensue.

I did not know any of that before I started. When I start a new chapter, I'll make a few notes for what I want to achieve in that chapter and sometimes those are met and sometimes things veer off into another direction. It's always a voyage of discovery!

Er... sorry, but squibs don't have "a little" magic. Rowling has made it extremely clear that they are not magic at all in any way, shape, or form. They're indistinguishable from Muggles at face value; they just carry an inactive copy of the magic gene that they /may/ pass on to their descendance.

I mean, that soynds like a pretty neat story otherwise, I don't mean to come across as mean, but just... "Squibs are /kinda/ magical" is an unnervingly common misconception. So go forth and Magic-Squib no more. As you were!

**** I needed a reason for him to be able to become as ghost and that's what I came up with because why would a wizard be in the British Army? No need to feel like you're being mean--I'm aware of the contradiction. And yeah, it is a pretty neat story. :D

** I divide my story into parts. Each part is divided into arcs. And each arcs are divided into mini plots. Then for each arc and/or mini plots, I write what I absolutely want to see. The rest is improvised. But I'm not a pro and often abandon my stories so... :p

** I keep an outline in a Google Doc so I can add to it whenever something comes to mind. I have the overall premise of the story there and briefly detail the overarching plot, some important characters and their planned developments, names for spell ideas, etc.

It almost writes itself at that point, when I have time to anyway.

** I definitely make sure I have my ending planned. The events, the location, where the characters are personally and in relation to others- the more the better.

I also make sure I have at least three events or important moments plotted out- not necessarily a climax. But certain points that I want in the story, that will effect the characters.

Having these planned out keeps me on track, and also something to work towards. It breaks a large story down into smaller, more manageable parts so I don't feel overwhelmed. Having the ending planned just remind me where I want the story to end at, so I don't write myself into corners and helps with pacing.

Aside from that, it really depends on the story how much further I plan. One fic I have, happens alongside the main one, so I need to have my timelines down- lots of notes on that one. Another story is essentially a continuation from one point that has very little to match up with, so I just have a few main points plotted out and am just filling in the story to get to those points.

** I've come to the conclusion I will abandon my Fanfiction unless I write my whole story before posting it. I end up getting caught up with the beginning and end while completely neglecting the middle. Or, I write myself into a hole.

Instead, I've decided to write my 18 chapter fanfiction first, and once the rough draft is done, get some beta readers to go over it, and rewrite whole sections of it.

Once I am satisfied, I will post it chapter by chapter, using each week to polish up the upcoming chapter as well as start on book two.

Since March I've written 8 out of 18 chapters and starting on the 9th. If I continue this pace, I shall be done by the end of the year. :D

** I write out an outline of what I want done, and then I try to connect point A to point B.

This usually turns into a dozen extra things that I need to account for if this story is going to make any damn sense at all. Rinse and repeat for point B to point C, C to D, D to E, and so on.

I mostly keep it in my head, and it keeps mutating. Fine by me, gives me something to dwell on during my day job.

** I'm just busy writing my first multichapter story. I've generated a document and added all the planned chapters. For each chapter, I've created a table containing a brief description of each planned scene for this chapter.

For each plotline, I've inserted the needed scenes to the table in the corresponding chapter, and then I started to write. At this time, at least 80% of the plot was planned out in the tables of the chapters. I do not necessarily write in chronological order. If I'm not satisfied with a specific scene, I skip to another chapter, and come back later when I have a better idea for the scene.

Every time I have a new idea, I add the needed scenes to the tables of the corresponding chapters. I won't post the story, if it's not at least 3/4 completed, completed means ready for beta reading. Until then, I've proofread all the chapters at least 10 times myself.

** Ideas and bunnies run around in my head for awhile, and eventually something will make enough noise that I'll write it down. Actually write it. I can't go from brain to computer. Somethings gotta be on paper first. Some bits are just an outline format, then maybe a generalized paragraph...THEN I'll try and get things together in Bibisco.

** I think it depends on the story type. Mysteries or Political fics should probably be thoroughly planned out. You want the readers to see the crucial details from the beginning of the story. I'm writing a comedy right now. I have a tone that I'm sticking with, and a few scenes that I really want to work towards making happen, but I don't quite know what I'm doing with Quirrel, even though he's the ostensible 1st year antagonist. That said, my tone really invites readers to accept the improbable so I have a little more leeway with that regard.

** First, the story has to come about for a reason. The main idea, whether it's a new take on a divergence point or whatever, that gives you a starting point where you can try to figure out what the changes are further down the line.

Or, if your idea is just a specific interaction between characters, I just write down every idea that comes to mind. Even if I'm starting first year and the idea is for something that happens in the third year, I write it down, because that might slightly influence how I want to get there.

** I only start to write a story (past a prologue/prompt) when I have the ending in mind. I make notes about the plot and background, usually keeping them at the end of my current chapter docs, and add small notes about specific scenes as I think of them or - more often - as the need for them becomes apparent during writing. So, I usually have a rough roadmap, but I'm very flexible while I write the actual story, and the farther in the future, the less detailed my planning is.
