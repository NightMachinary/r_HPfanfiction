  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

**** It's probably because either

A) People are angry that that story is only Harry/Emily from Harry's side, or

B) People are angry that you would suggest that should be a pairing in that story you sick freak, he's like a badjilion years younger than her, practically a child, she's not a pedo (just a psychotic murderer sort-of-but-not-really seducing her prophecised opponent), or

C) People don't like that story, period, because it doesn't align with their vision of what should happen.

******** Are you new to the internet or here in general? Seriously, don't bother thinking why as it would only trouble you for nothing AND most of the time the answer to that why is ridiculous. Just move on.

**** If you count someone who's basically bipolar as the best, yeah, I guess. I'll consider her well written if she truly ends up as a master manipulator of Harry and doesn't really give a shit for him. Otherwise, it's two different people in the same body and I find it incredibly jarring to see Emily be all kind and loving and then kill innocents the next chapter.

***** I had hoped this diary thing was a cock and bull story Voldemort was feeding Harry in order to manipulate him. I'm pretty sure that's not the case now.
