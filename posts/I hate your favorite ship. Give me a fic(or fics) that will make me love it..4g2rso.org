is how i feel about a lot of snape ships. if i wanted to read about normative and healthy relationship dynamics and characters, snape wouldn't exactly be my first choice

  "We don't deserve her," the Head Boy answered thoughtfully. "None of us do. Not even me. Not because she's perfect. She's not. Sometimes I think she's even more disastrously flawed than the rest of us combined. And not because she's beautiful, even though she is. Certainly not for being lovely because she never was.We don't deserve her because she's so much more than we'll ever be"

Unfortunately, he could also be rude, thoughtless, spoiled, and cruel. Finding the balance was the tricky part. Author note: James is a jerk. Please don't be surprised.

Those are probably my top 3, /The Pet/ I haven't read in ages, but I remember thinking it was romanctic ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

There are some really lovely (and shorter) stories that I hold very dearly, but they are a little bit too far removed from canon (Non-magic AU etc).
