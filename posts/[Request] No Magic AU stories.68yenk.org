This is something i've not really thought that much about if i'm honest, but now i am curious.

What is your favorite stories where magic is not a thing?

(Preferably not short stories)


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived.]]. Hogwarts is a School for James Bond-Style spies, and Q-style tech replaces magic in the setting. The Weasleys are the Wellesleys - yes, those Wellesleys (fitting, since the Family was originally named Wesley, and the duke did marry a spy in the 40s) . It's complete and covers all seven years.

I love this story, even though I usually hate when a story sticks close to canon and I generally don't like magic-less AUs. Dumbledore is manipulative and cunning, the kids are all far more competent, and the war more brutal and ruthless.

** linkao3(half awake and almost there) is a bit on the shorter end. It's Harry/Ginny, slow and charming with a bit of smut towards the final chapters. Annerb's depiction of Ginny is my absolute favorite, and she really made the story worthwhile for me.

  Wherein Harry never could help himself from trying to save the day, and Ginny was just trying to survive her shift without killing any of her customers.

** [[http://dirtytrousers.livejournal.com/][Dirty Trousers]]. It's in a LiveJournal site - there was also a PDF provided, but that link doesn't work any more - [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/ls9ottew8nyt73u/Dirty%20Trousers.pdf?dl=0][I've got it saved though]].

I've had this fic saved on my computer since the PDF came out, and I've re-read it so many times. It follows a huge cast in little cut up scenes in their day to day lives, in a similar format to the movie Love Actually. It's my go-to light and happy fic.

Summary: A loosely put together AU about the HP gang in their early twenties. Their days are spent in Lupin's fish store, at the cafe, uni classes. Their nights mostly end up at Curly's pub, listening to Seamus rock out with his band, Dirty Trousers
