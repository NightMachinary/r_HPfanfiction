The reason I bring this up in spite of knowing the shit storm it will create is because I don't understand. I don't understand why people think it's good.

I'm sorry. Let me say this right off the bat. I do not think less of you for enjoying it or thinking it good, I do not think more of you if you hate it. This is me trying to understand.

I want everyone to talk about this story, what really connects to you (positive or negative) and why. Then, because I want to invite discussion, I would be so happy if you could write both sides, what you like/what you don't like and why.

I can barely get past the first couple chapters, why? I think that the 11 year old Harry Potter sounds nothing like an 11 year old, genius/prodigy/well-educated background or not. It's aggravating to me in a way that I can't explain properly without becoming overly emotional.

Things I appreciated about this story: applying science to magic. It's a genre I tend to enjoy. Also, giving a different life to Petunia. I love AUs.

So. Your turn. Please help me to see. Both sides of course.


** There's a scene where Quirrell is like "Harry doesn't know what it's like to lose" and then he has a bunch of dudes beat him up. And then everyone is like "that makes sense".

Back when I was reading through the fic, it made sense in context: Draco probably views it as just one of the many ways to hurt, humiliate, and degrade someone.

It's a big thing for us, but not for the character. Watch the famous kkk movie - I can't recall the title but it's a cornerstone of the history of movie making - and think what happened if any of those characters were in a modern film. Or if a film was made with a modern character in the context of that film.

Well actually anachronism would happen and a magical Negro along with any of the Yankees in the film would explain how racism was wrong, but imagine we had courage.

HPMOR is like that. The magical world is a few centuries behind the muggle world. Justice is a farce, the trades are unregulated, education is personal after 16(?), there's racism, no human rights, and slavery. Luna is the insane daughter of an insane rabble-rouser, Malfoy is aristocracy or as close to it as possible.

That's addressed in the story, when Harry reacts with shock and revulsion once he realises Malfoy is serious. Harry is the reader stand-in - he reacts as we would.

**** | What the actual holy fuckery is wrong with this fucking author?!

What's wrong with this author is that he wants to tell a story with actual character growth. Draco Malfoy begins this story as someone raised by /Death Eaters/ for whom raping young girls is just a bit of fun and it's simply expected that he will carry on the traditions he's been taught. By the end of the story Draco has had all of his beliefs shattered -- he ends up mentally /devastated/ by revelations and events, and it's unclear how or whether he's going to be able to move forward. Yet this isn't a revenge fic -- Harry isn't trying to hurt him, he's kind of trying to save him (somewhat ruthlessly and a bit deceptively), and the author even gives Draco a gift at the end (a double-edged gift that shatters his last belief, yet still a gift).

As for the "critique" blog linked above, I'm sure the author could do exactly the same thing for JKR's original books (as many others have, explicitly or in fanfic form) -- laugh at the characters' stupidities, bemoan the paths not taken, etc. Is that a reason to never read her books? Hardly. The blog author misses a lot of the fun things (foreshadowing, double-meanings, etc.) in the story -- if I want to read a bash, I'll read an actual fanfic (because they can be fun too!).

***** I think the blog author did a fairly good job, he's snarky but for the most part, he's not wrong.

Also let me come at this from a writing perspective, the blog author makes a good point, it's a huge tonal shift. If we are to think about what the Death Eaters would be like in a non-PG setting, then yes, Draco might say something like this, however, we've had no prior tonal setup toward this. Everything before was science, magic, Harry being hugely condescending, and people making strange decisions.

Now, if the author intentionally wants to shift the tone to that or wants to make that point, there are better ways writing-wise to do that. I've actually seen some anime (yes I know this isn't literary but it's the first example to pop up in my mind) that does this well. They play up the, this is how it's going to be then whoa! What happened there?

Also joke rape isn't funny. This is thoroughly my opinion now but joke rape shouldn't be used lightly or at all. It's still a very sensitive thing to talk about. I hate it when my friends say it so I hate it when fics do it. I stand by my literary argument but I add my personal one as well.

****** | we've had no prior tonal setup toward this

This is chapter 7 of a 122-chapter story and the event occurs before Hogwarts where the main action occurs. This /is/ the "tonal set-up" for the rest of the story, the warning that while there may be laughter, there's also going to be some bad "stuff" happening (and the story is labeled as both Humor and Drama, which is a fair warning).

EDIT: Though perhaps the shopkeeper running crying into her store could be considered a warning. Professor McGonagall's chastising of Harry is also a notice to the readers that this world has a non-humorous background.

| Also joke rape isn't funny.

Draco /wasn't/ joking, Harry didn't take it as a joke, and the author dealt with it seriously in Harry's deciding to save Luna and then acting on that decision. This is Harry's first realization that there are actually things at stake that his decisions will affect and the author shows us how he deals with it. And this sets up Draco's journey too.

** I enjoyed it. It was a fun read, and I read most of it twice as I had to wait about a year before it was finished. The first bit is a bit dry and stilted but still intriguing to me, and then the story loosens up a bit and becomes a bit of a mystery.

It's a flawed work, they all are. I had fun with it.

Pros: - main character is smarter than we are - main villain is smarter than everyone - social manipulation is extreme at times - does a passable job of above character traits - some good Piers Anthony style combat - a bit of dry humor - Hermione is smarter than Harry (as per original) - magic has lots of untapped power, and it's acknowledged

Cons: - long - sometimes conversation seems stilted and overdone - Dumbledore is OP and yet .. - Harry really is an arrogant jerk even if he's right - you may learn to hate Harry - Harry is not an 11 year old boy in almost any way - characters portray Yud.'s personal obsessions to a fault at times

I think it's possible you need to be the kind of person that obsesses over details and thinks all of life's mysteries through from time to time. Perhaps that's why I related better than some.

** The word count is too damn high for me. Honestly it just sprawls and keeps going and going and going. Which is fine, just not my cup of tea. It is really funny though, especially in the beginning, and I like what it says about rationality and the inherent discussion and I like the angle of the magical world completely shitting on science and logic, though I don't think the author handles the conclusions well so far (I've read to chapter... 30? 40? I'm not sure, I just started skimming for sections with Hermione, Dumbledore and Snape). It's just not a constrained and well-told story, nor is it the type of fanfiction that is deeply canon compliant or explores the Potterverse or literary/character themes well. It's a popularization effort for rationality - which is fine and good but I'd rather read something on philosophical reasoning or psychological experiments concerning rationality and have a good long think on the subject and come to conclusions, which turn out to be are faaaaar different from his. I will say though - it is definitely a passion project for this guy. There's a lot of what this dude thinks in this. I'm not sure what the internet beef is, never really looked it up. The nerdy references here and there are kind of funny. There is a podcast on iTunes, it's easier to handle than reading this thing. The voice actors are decent and do funny voices and you can play it in the background. (I like 'shorter' fanfics - ie ones that won't cover the entire floor of my building).

** You know, I guess the simple answer is that after getting through a sea of really bad things, which is what many people reading fan fiction happen to do because most things are just that bad, something that is not the best but can be readable depending on the sort of writing style you like might be remembered as good.

As for me ... honestly, I found it decent, readable, with a couple of nice ideas presented therein and a few others that were not as much nice as they were interesting and worth consideration. Was it the best story ever? Nah. But given the choice between that story or a randomly chosen one or another trek through the sea of crud to find something readable, I'd choose this story because at least it's better than the sewage trip that a random story would be likely to be.

And as for Yudkowsky's attitude, which may or may not be listed by some people as a reason for the story being worse ... honestly, the story is done, whatever shenanigans Yudkosky may or may not have done or be planning to do or whatever matters not unless he deletes the story, so though that is a warning if he ever writes anything new I do not think it proper to judge the worth of a story with how ... socially pleasant the author is or is not.

** I think it requires suspension of disbelief of that "Harry doesn't sound like an 11 year old", and also some people may not want to read what an 11 year old would actually sound like. Snarky humour can be fun, and I found the armies particularly enjoyable to read about, even if totally impractical. The epic Neville fight scene should be made into a short film, really.

But for those who can't get over that first hurdle, then none of the rest of it will really make sense. Then there's the whole problem of EY trying to push his stuff on us and sounding very superior to the rest of us, which can be quite the turn-off.

I might be in the minority for this, but I actually enjoyed those parts. It's a bit like a parable slipped into the story, and reminded me a lot of "Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman". Then again, I went on to read more of the author's stuff about the same topics, which I guess is also not that widespread.

** There are two things I like about HPMOR that I think few other fanfics do well:

1. Harry actually has character growth. Yes, he's annoying at the beginning (for reasons which are initially explained and then for more reasons revealed later) but his rationality rants become less frequent over time as he realizes he isn't perfect either and life is actually complicated.

2. The sheer number of foreshadows, double-meanings, and patterns in the text. There's a reason there's a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/][reddit]] devoted to discussing HPMOR -- because even if it's not your cup of tea there's still a lot to discuss. Many fanfic authors can tell a story but HPMOR is /crafted/. You simply have not read HPMOR until you've read it a second time to see what it was /actually/ saying all along.

That the wizarding world in general would give a damn about it instead of telling him to man up, though ... yeah, that counts as bullshit.
