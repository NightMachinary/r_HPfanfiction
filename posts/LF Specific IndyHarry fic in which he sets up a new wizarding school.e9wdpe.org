:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Title. I'm looking for a specific indy!Harry fic, I think it's Harry/OFC or a character who might as well be an OC. Wizarding England wants Harry's kids to attend Hogwarts but he doesn't want them to go. I may be mixing fics but I think aurors come to kidnap his kids and obliviate his wife. Harry goes to the Queen and later on establishes his own wizarding school, and I think the school is named after Queen Elizabeth.


** These two, maybe?

  Harry Potter had enough of the stupidity of the Wizarding World. If they all believed that he was a dark wizard, just because he could talk to snakes, screw them! He didn't need them. And who ever said that all prophecies did come true? (No horcruxes).

  The Wizarding World is confronted with a problem they never had to face before. The consquences of their own arrogance and bigotry. After Hogwarts lost dozens of students each year, they try to change things again. But what do you do if you realise that things aren't that easy? Sequel to Screw Them
