I would like a couple good fics with decent grammar and descent plot. Story wise I don't really care it can be dark or what ever no crack fics though


** My favorites are:

The Minister's Secret: Hermione is sent back in time and is assumed to be the daughter of Aberforth. Cousins with the Lestrange family. Very well written end an excellent plot. I can not say enough good things about this fic.

A Year Like None Other and its sequel Snape learns the truth about the Dursleys and helps Harry. There's super powerful magic, lots to do with parseltongue, lots of Draco goodness, and Harry gets the family he deserves.

The Best Revenge: Snape and McGonngal help Harry be his best, he does well and over all a great story.

A Marauder's Plan: Sirius raises Harry. Lots of old Pureblood customs, ancient magic. Great plot with Neville and Hermione, too.

Fervidity: Read the warnings. Super dark. One of my favorites. Hermione pretends to be Snape's daughter and a Death Eater.

Debt of Time: Hermione is sent back in time and grows up as James Potter's sister. This is the Holy Grail of fics, IMO.

** I can't tell if this is a troll post or not. Asking for decent grammar in a two-sentence post while making at least eight spelling and grammar errors... wow.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  He was not bound so high that he couldn't recognize Fingon Nolofinwion from District 4. Cheerful, handsome and charming, the public loved him. Not someone he interacted much with. Even with his high score, Maedhros hadn't particularly considered him to be a threat.

  Now he was to be the last face he ever saw.

  “If you're going to shoot me, can you at least make it a quick death?”

  Or, when Fingon finds himself in the Arena against all odds, he realizes it takes more than valor to survive when everyone is out for your death. At least his unexpected alliances mean he isn't facing it all alone. With enough luck, he may even survive.
