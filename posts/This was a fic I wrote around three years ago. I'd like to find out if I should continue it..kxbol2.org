I'm not entirely satisfied with it. Some of its ideas feel a little....contrived, especially with regards to the Death Eaters. But, I'd like to hear what you all have to think about it, since its not like its doing much sitting on my hard drive. Please suggest any improvements to it you have.

Here it is: Braving the Storm.

“You and I are not so different, Captain. In another time, another reality, I might have called you ‘friend'.” --- Unnamed Romulan Commander, ‘Balance Of Terror,' Star Trek The Original Series.

Chapter 1, Prologue, 2035, New Yorkshire Colony,

The yellow glare of the streetlights blinded him temporarily as he stepped off the Alcubierre shuttle onto main street. The shuttle was blue, with circuit-like patterns on it. He knew that these were the shield generators for the shuttle. He turned toward the booth next to the shuttle. It was occupied by a man, in a dark black full-body suit with similar circuit-like patterns to the shuttle. But these were orange, signifying a low-cost personal shield generator. The man said to him, “Buisiness or Pleasure?” The man's voice was neutral. He said, “Buisness,” The man nodded, “Length of visit?” the man responded, “Only a day at the most. I am here to see the governor.” The man raised an eyebrow, “The Governor? Last I checked you had to get an invitation, and she only gives those out to her family. ID?” He got his ID out, it read, in part:

JAMES POTTER, DELTA INSTITUTE, CARDIFF, WALES.

He said, “As you can see, I am apart of the Governor's family.”

The man had a look of surprise on his face. “Well,” he said nervously,”its a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Potter.” He extended his hand, and James shook it. The man said, “That's all I need. Thank you, and enjoy your visit.” James nodded, and began his walk down main street. He pass by several things he considered perfectly normal. Men and women in uniforms similar to the Customs Officer. Holographic kiosks and billboards. Hover-cars. He walked towards a large house near the end of the street. It was Victorian on the outside, but James knew it had all the latest Magitech on the inside. He reached into his pocket and pulled out his invitation. It Read,

Dear James Potter,

I am sorry I was not able to return your letter last week. Pro-Roman terrorists struck the Colonial Parliament building two days after I received it. 200 people were killed in that attack, and I have been working non-stop towards apprehending the culprits. I have only just now gotten the time to invite you to the Governors Mansion, and I hope your visit will be a brief, if restful, distraction from the pressures of this office. But your father and I think that preserving what the world was 40 years ago is extremely important to ensuring that the devastation of the past never comes to future generations. I have heard of your father's promotion. Send him my congratulations when next you see him. Safe travel, see you soon!

Sincerely,

Your godmother, Hermione Granger.

At the bottom was the seal of the Royal Governor Of The Colony Of New Yorkshire.

His godmother had accepted a job just last month to oversee the Colonial Science Council. But during the Governors speech, a bomb had been exploded in the Colonial Parliament building. The Terrorist Group Nova-Roma, a Pro- RIGU group, had claimed responsibility. His godmother, having refused to attend because she was too busy, had survived. She was declared governor by the British Government back home, and took it upon herself to find the culprits. He smiled at his godmothers determination. His family was one of the most revered in the galactic region earth's nations controlled. The Weasley-Granger-Potter family had fought bravely during World War III, though the scars of that war still had not healed on earth. James's father was Harry Potter. Once known as The Boy-Who-Lived, he had fought bravely during the war, and was recently promoted to Brigadier General for his defeat of the Romans last year. The life of his family was one of the most well-known in history. His uncle and godfather, Ron Weasley, was currently the head of the Auror office, which still patrolled the former wizarding world, though they did so now alongside muggle police. His mother, Ginny Weasley, was a Member Of Parilament back home in the UK. But James was not interested in only his family. He desired to preserve the history of earth's most recent, and probably not final, war. He knew that telling the history of that time was vital. Though the terms ‘Muggle' and ‘Wizard' still held meaning to some, the two groups were slowly becoming one.

No one these days used solely magic or muggle technology. Magitech, was what it was called these days, and everyone used it. Shield generators, warp drive, teleportation devices, messages traveling faster than anything before. The two worlds were merging at a rate never seen before, even in ancient times. But with this unification, also came danger. When the two worlds inevitably became one, the mistakes of the pre-1996 world would be forgotten. No one would be able to concieve of what the world was like at that chaotic time. James and his father knew that unless the history of what had come to be called ‘The Great Division', formerly known as the Era Of The Statute Of Secrecy, was not preserved, the mistakes mankind had made in the past would be repeated. And so James, a historian for the Delta Institute in Cardiff, had begun work on his book, “The Unifying Factor: A History of the end of the Great Division”. He had interviewed many veterans of the War. Commander of the Death Eater Special Forces Colonel Bellatrix Lestrange. Head of the British Department Of Magical Defenses Allastor Moody. Former Prime Minister John Major. Headmaster of Hogwarts Albus Dumbledore. Commanders of the former Third World Military. Ex-Minister For Magic Rufus Scrimgeour. His Father and Mother of course. His uncle and godfather Ron Weasley. Generals in the British Military. American Presidents George W. Bush, and William Jefferson Clinton. Many others also were interviewed by him. James had collected almost all the information he needed. His final interview was with his godmother, Governor Granger. She previously was head of the Magitech research council at Oxford. James approached the Governors Mansion slowly, careful not to arrouse suspicioin. Paranoia on this colony was immense, and his godmother almost declared martial law. As James entered the building, he showed his ID to the guard outside, and was shown in to the Mansion. He was approached by a guard, dressed in the uniform of the Colonial Defense Forces. It was a black uniform, with a blue shield generator like the shuttle. This was a military shield generator. These, James knew, were the personal shield generators. The guard spoke to him in a respectful tone, “The Governor has given me orders to show you in when you arrive. Come this way, sir.” He led him up the stairs, and through large double-doors into his aunt's office. She was seated behind the desk, wearing a uniform with similar markings as her guards, though these were all red. These meant a greater level of shielding. Her uniform looked to be much more formal, more civillian. This type of wear was common amongst civillians in high-ranking government positions. Her hair was shaved down one-side to accomadate the implants, and long on the other. This hair-style was popular these days, as it was necessary for shield generators to function. Her face looked very similar to the way it did in the photographs from the war James had seen as a child. But she looked far more exhausted than in the photos. James reminded himself that, though his aunt was in her mid-fifties, the life-expectancy now was over 200 years, and getting larger every year. She stood up, her smile warm, and friendly. “I am glad you could come James,” She said in her typical voice. “I am glad as well.” James said, “The family has been worried about you.” She said,”I can understand. I almost declared martial law after the attack. The rioting was almost unstoppable. Thankfully, your father was able to stop it.” James smiled, “Fame has its advantages.”he said. The governor responded, “And its drawbacks. But I know you did not come here for conversation. Lets get started, shall we?” James nodded. His godmother said,”Would you like anything?” James shook his head,”No, lets get on with it.” They sat down on her couches, and James began his interview. They covered much of the last 40 years. The Battle Of Sydney, The First Attacks, the Treaties, the Reunification, and the Romans. When they were finished, James said, “How much has the experience of the war changed you, Governor?” Governor Granger responded, “Allot. 40 years ago, I was unsure of myself, and, frankly, not very tough. But the war changed all that. Now I can look back on my younger self and say, ‘You'll come out of this one day. You'll do things no-one has ever imaginied before'” James nodded and said, “I think I have all I need, Aunt Hermione. Can I expect you to see the fruits of my labor next month?” He asked. She nodded, “Yes, I think I will. Hopefully I will have caught the perpetrators of these attacks by then.” She smiled at him, “Have a safe journey back to earth.” she said. James answered, “I will, Aunt Hermione.” They hugged, Hermione kissed her nephew on his cheek. They said their goodbyes, and James was shown out by her guards. He walked slowly to the shuttle pad, paying the Customs Officer three pounds for a trip to earth. James took his seat, and smiled at his aunt's warmth. She was working incredibly hard, yet she still could be as gentle with her family as always. He sat back, and enjoyed the ride home.

2 days later, London, Great Britain.

Harry Potter sat at the dining room table of his home. He was currently along in the house. His Wife, Ginny, was a Member Of Pariliament, and of the British Wizards Party. She was currently at a party meeting, were she had told him that they were electing their new leader. “I am not running, if that's what you're worried about,” She had told him that morning,”I certainlly dont want any of those responsibilities.” Harry did not have any assignments as of late. The Roman's, or as they called themselves, the Roman Imperial Galactic Union, were building up troops along the border with the earth nations. Britain had colonies along the border, along with the Americans and Russians. The Americans had, of course offered the British help. The Russians, in a new cold war with NATO, had refused. Two years ago, Harry had stopped an invasion by the Romans. Harry had been promoted to Brigadier General, but he still did not yet have any assignments. The High Command overruled Harry at the last meeting, deciding that he should, as his old friend Allastor Moody put it, “Rest for a while, or the Roman's will make sure that you rest eternal.” Harry insisted he needed no rest, but the other's had overruled him, though he had been working non-stop for two years now, ever since the Roman defeat in 2033. He was waiting for his son, James Potter. His son had finished his history of World War III, and the events leading up to, and just after it a few days ago. He was looking forward to reading it, as his son had told him that he was writing it like a historical novel, based on interviews conducted with veterans from the war. Harry smiled, five books were written about his life before this, and they were very much similar to novels. Harry supposed that this book would be no different, and was looking forward to seeing what his son had created. He heard a knock on the door of his and Ginny's apartment, and checked the door's sensors to see if it was his son. When they registered James Potter, Harry opened the door. His son was standing there, looking exhausted, but delighted. “Hi Dad,” His son said, “Hello, Son. Won't you come in?” His son nodded, and entered the apartment. Harry motioned to the seat by the window, and his son took it. Harry moved the kitchen chair closer to his son, and sat down. Harry started, “I hear you've finished it.” James nodded, “I have it here in my briefcase. I cant stay long, I am due for a staff meeting at 3:00.” Harry nodded, sad that he could'nt spend more time with his son. The Granger-Potter-Weasley family rarely spent much time together, except for the annual family reunion. Harry knew it was because they were all incredibbly busy, and they would all be glad to take the time off to spend time together. But, Harry knew that their work was important. James opened his briefcase, took out a hard-cover novel with the words”The Unifying Factor: A History Of The End Of The Great Division”, in bold letters at the top. On the cover was a world map, with the Southern Hemishpere reddened, the symbol of the Third World Union in the center of the redness. He thanked his son, and they said their goodbyes. Harry sat down at the kitchen table and began to read.

Chapter 2, The Burrow, 1996, night of the First Attacks, Great Britain.

The light of the half-moon shone down upon the trees. They glowed with an etherial light, almost seeming ghostly and supernatural. The light reaced the top of the house in a nearby clearing. The house was brick, four stories tall and looked as if it were once used as a pigsty. At the top of the house, was a bedroom, it was currently occupied by a skinny, bespectacled, black-haired boy. He was Harry Potter, and the house was The Burrow. It was owned by his friend, Ron Weasley's parents. This boy had been through a great deal in a very short amount of time. He had been rescued 5 years ago from the neglect of his aunt and uncle after finding out he was a wizard. He had attended Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and had fought his parent's killer, the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, for five years. Voldemort had returend two years ago, and Harry had been forced to endure a whole year of the Ministry Of Magic, the government which ruled Wizarding Britain, ignoring him. After last years battle in the Ministry, they had finally achknowledged Voldemort's return. Harry felt reassured, though he still worried for his friend's lives. Harry was woken from his remembrences by a loud knock on the door. Harry went to the door and opened it. His friend, Hermione Granger, stood in the open doorway. She and Ron were Harry's best friends, at times his only friends. She looked her usual self, calm, collected, some might say logical. Harry smiled at her. She often saw clearly what he and Ron did not. She was one of the smartest students at Hogwarts, getting 100% just about everything on her O.W.L. test. She was also very unsure of herself at times, even self-critical. But she always looked past her doubts, often times with Harry and Ron's help. Back in the present, she stood there and said, “Harry, I have something for you.” Harry responded curiously, “What is it?” She answered him by handing him a book. On the front cover it read, “/A Bilateral History Of The Muggle And Wizarding Worlds/, by George Granger.” Harry looked at her, “What's this?” Hermione said, “Its a book me and my grandfather have been writing.” Harry said, “Tell me about it.” She told him the story. “After I got my letter, my parents were told about the wizarding world. Two years ago, we told my grandparents, when they visited. Dont worry, they can keep a secret better than anyone else in the family.” Harry said, “Is your grandfather a historian?” Hermione nodded, “Two years ago, he asked me if I could help him to write a book about the history of both worlds. Apparently he had stopped writing several years before, and was looking forward to a challenge. I had read ‘A History Of Magic' and ‘Hogwarts: A History.' several times, along with several muggle history books.” Harry said, “Is it finished?” Hermione answered, “Yes, its already been published. I gave a copy to Professor Dumbledore before he left, to give to Professor Binns.” Harry said, “I think I might read it.” Hermione said, “Ok.” Before Harry could, though, Hedwig burst through the window of the room he and Ron shared. She was carrying a rolled up /Evening Prophet./ She flew straight at Harry, and dropped it into his hands, before flying towards her cage. Harry saw a note attached to the paper. It read,

/Harry, you and whoever is with you must read this paper. It is/ /urgent. This is far more extreme than anything before this./

/Professor Albus Dumbledore./

Harry showed Hermione the note. She said, “Well, lets see.” Harry handed her the paper, and she began to read.

THREE ATTACKS IN ONE NIGHT.

HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED TAKEN PRISONER.

GROUP CALLING ITSELF THE ‘THIRD WORLD UNION' CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY.

INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF WIZARDS CALLS EMERGENCY SESSION.

Tonight, three attacks have taken place on an uprecedented scale. Diagon Alley, a peaceful shopping square, was attacked tonight by unknown forces. The attackers soon began to attack Muggle London as well. Thousands have died so far in London alone. Mere moments before a letter appeared at our office there. It read, “We are the Third World. Your kinds have oppressed those weakest in your societies for far too long. I am Orion Black, and I am your destruction. We have taken the southern half of Earth. You will fall. Nos Aeuternum! We shall prevail! You so-called ‘Wizards' and so-called ‘Muggles' will be enslaved or exterminated by us. There are millions of kilometers on the earth. If the word ‘Hatred' were carved into every nanometer of the earths surface, it would not equal one trillionth of the hate we feel for you.We will murder your children, enslave your old men, and torture your women. We will not rest until you are destroyed. Our soliders will begin the first wave soon. Your Dark Wizards will be the first to fall. Humanity will be ours!” Shortly after this attack, a great beam of light struck the earth in Southern Canada, annihalating the Canadian Wizarding Parillament. It then moved across the globe, stopping at the aleutian islands. 20 million wizards and muggles were killed. The ICW called an emergency session in New York. For the first time in modern wizarding history, the Muggle President of the United States, and British Prime minister, along with several other muggle leaders attended. They released a statement, it read in part, “We and our magical counterparts have decided upon a course of action. The Statute Of Secrecy cannot survive after these attacks. This ‘Third World Union' appears to have a unique technology, one which uses both muggle technology and magic. This threat is far too dangerous for us to handle alone.” As if all of this was not enough, the ‘Third Worlders' as they are being called now, attacked multiple sites in Britain. You-Know-Who was among those captured by them. All of the Death Eaters now are the prisoner of this tyrannical group. The Minister has urged all wizards and witches to prepare for immediate muggle reunification.”

Harry was shocked. These Third Worlders captured Voldemort? Harry know understood the urgency of this. He turned to Hermione, “Does it say all the countries that were hit?” Hermione shook her head, “No, but if it started in Ontario, it proablby passed through France.” Harry turned white. Ron's brother Bill, and his fiance Fleur Delacour were there with her parents. Hermione said, “Fleur's parents live in Paris, Harry. They were probably fine.” Harry did not feel reassured. Ron came running into the doorway, huffing and puffing. He said, “Did...you..guys...get...the...paper?” Harry nodded. Ron said, “Ginny and I got one too. Mum just got an owl from Bill. He says he and Fleur are alright.” Harry breathed a sigh of relief. Harry said, “What are we going to do now? The paper said that Hogwarts classes have been canceled.” Hermione said, “We should try to get some sleep. We can worry about what to do next in the morning.” Harry and Ron said at once, “Agreed.” They said their goodnights, and Hermione left. Harry and Ron got dressed, and climbed into their beds. Harry laid awake for awhile. He hated Vodemort incredibbly, but he knew that this Third World Union seemed to him atleast to be far worse. He fell assleap soon after thinking that.

When Harry awoke the next morning, it was to Ron shaking him around. “Huh-? Whasapening-?” he said. Ron said, “Wake up, Harry. Dad says the Minister is calling all wizards in Britain to the ministry in half an hour.” Harry got up at once, and got dressed. He ran down the stairs, nearly running into Hermione. She said, “Be careful, Harry. Well get there soon enough.” Harry nodded, and went downstairs to the Living Room. Mr. Weasley was there, along with Mrs. Weasley. They were both red-haired, and Mrs. Weasley was short, and plump. Mr. Wealey looked at Harry and said, “Good morning.” Harry replied, “Good morning. When do we leave?” Mr. Weasley answered, “At 9:30. I've managed to create a portkey to the Ministry. Its that sofa over there,” he pointed to a large green sofa near the grandfather clock. Harry nodded. Mrs Weasley said, “Breakfast is on the table. Eat up, you're all going to need it.” Harry, Ron and Hermione went to the table. Their plates were filled with eggs, bacon, and sausage. Harry ate quickly, not even pausing to talk to his friends. When 9:30 did come, they all gathered around the sofa, just in time to grab the portkey. Harry felt himself spinning, lights were flashing, until finally the portkey stopped in the Ministry Atrium. A large crowd had gathered, with the minister high atop a podium in the center, flanked by the Muggle Prime Minister and Undersecretary Rosier. Harry and the others stood together and waited. The Minister began just a few moments after they arrived. He said:

Fellow Wizards, Loyal Britons, we gather here on this historic and unprecidennted occasion. The attacks of the last few days have awoken us to a threat far greater than any before this. These ‘Third Worlders' desire our destruction and enslavement, and they have shown themselves fully capable of doing so. The Dark Lord and his followers were some of the first British wizards to fall in this war. Rest assured that they will be found. Though they were once our enemies, this group represents the potential destruction of all we hold dear. For this reason, the International Confederation Of Wizards has voted to abolish the International Statute Of Wizarding Secrecy. Myself and the Prime Minister were prepared for such an event for several years now. We both recognized the threat posed by the Dark Lord, and knew that it was very likely that the Statute Of Secrecy could very well be abolished. PM Major and myself developed multiple contingencies should this event ever occur. I stand before you now to initiate the first phase of PlanMW, the unification of the Wizarding and Muggle governments. This plan requires the approval of the Wizarding Population of Britain, and that is why Minister Major and myself stand here before you. We ask for your trust in this action, and beg you to consider the survival of not just the magical community, but of all humanity. The Prime Minister will speak to you now, thank you.

The crowd appluded the Muggle Prime Minister. Harry was surprised. Many of the people in this crowd normally did not like muggles at all. He supposed that this was not a normal situation.

The Prime Minister stood there and gave his speech:

Thank you all for coming. I want to say, first of all, that I wish I had known about your world before becoming PM. If I had, I many muggles would have been fascinated by your magic, and many of us would treat you as equals. I am sorry we have been denied that chance for so long. Now, as we begin to face the terrible threat posed against us, I call on all of you to remember our common heritage. Your genes do not determine your destiny. You do. If we stand united here today, we will look back on our past and say, ‘Why did we not do this earlier?' Your vote, here today, will matter immensely. You 3000 wizards here have the power in your hands to decide the fate of millions born and unborn. We must put aside our differences in the name of victory. We will prevail, if we choose this course of action. If we do not, then we will perish like the rest of the world. This ‘Orion Black' individual hates our races with every fiber of his being. I call on you to unite with us, to drive these genocidal tyrants back to where they came from! Victory is ours!

The crowd began shouting ‘Victory is ours!' Harry and the others joined in. Undersecretary Rosier stepped to the podium. He began, “All in favor of the resolution, cast ‘Expelliararmus!' all those against, cast ‘Lumos!'” Almost the entire crowd emitted red jets of light from their wands. To Harry's surprise, Mr. Weasley was the only one to cast Lumos. He turned to him with a confused look on his face. Mr Weasley said, “It's not a legal vote unless someone says ‘No'. Old Wizards Council rule.” Harry nodded. Rosier said, “Votes in favor: 2,999. Votes against: 1.” The crowd cheered, even Mr. Weasley. Hermione said to Harry, “I guess my book will have a much larger audience than I though.” Harry said, “Yeah. Everyone will want it.” Ron said, “The muggles will be quite shocked to find this out.” Hermione said, “Ron, they already have. 99% of the British people approve of us.” Ron whistled, “What about the extra 1%?” Hermione said, “1% dont care.” Ron looked even happier at that. Rosier said, “The details will be sent to you by owl. Thank you for coming. The Ministers have to get back to work shortly.”

Later that night, after getting home by Ministry floo, Harry sat reading the details of the unification. He had'nt wanted to, but Hermione insisted. “We cant be in the dark about this. Theres a Wizarding Mandatory Conscription law now, remember?” The law had been apart of the Unification Accords. Though no one had read them before voting, that did'nt seem to matter to anyone. Harry asked Mr. Weasley about it and he said, “Wizards tend to vote on something and then read the details. It actually works out well, since everything can be repealled or ammended.” Harry had understood. The Accords were very long, but thankfully they were in plain english, unlike what Hermione had called”Leagalese”. They included the Ministry Of Magic becoming apart of the muggle ministries, a unified military, with the Aurors acting similar to Military Police. Research on combining science and magic would begin immediately. The Minister would become an appointed position, though only wizards could be appointed. The Wizengamot would be dissolved, its authority transferred to the British Parialament. Wizards would be granted complete rights as British citizens, and could even vote in muggle elections. Harry thought about his life now. It seemed he would become apart of the British Military. Not that he had a choice. The Conscription Law was apart of the main body of the accords. It could never be repealled. But Harry knew that this would be a long, hard struggle. He just hoped Ron and Hermione would be there to endure it with him. He and Ron had been studying the military for the remainder of the day. Ron said, “It seems slightly better than fighting You-Know-Who. But with less killing curses and more shouting and...regular cursing.” All men and women of fighting age had to report for service tommorrow. Harry, Ron and Hermione had managed to convince the Minister just before they left, to allow them to serve alongside one another. Whereever one went, the other two would also. The Minister considered it a reward for their struggles during the last war. Harry had said goodnight to the others, and noticed that Ginny seemed very nervous. He supposed it was because she would be joining them next year, and she did not want to say goodbye for so long. He fell asleap almost instantly, and awoke the next morning. Hermione was waiting for him outside the door. She had transfigured some ordinary clothes into military wear. Her hair was up, and she wore the uniform of the British Military. He had also put on his uniform, and looked around, eyeing Ron dressed in his uniform. He said to Hermione, “No breakfast?” he had'nt smelled anything. She shook her head, “No. Were going to the recruitment office right away. If we pass the physical, well be able to join.” Harry said, “Wait. What about my eyes?” Hermione said, “Dont worry. Wizards have top priority. Eye surgery is mandatory for wizards with poor eyesight.” Harry said, “Ok, then. Lets go.” They said goodbye to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, and went to the Wizarding Recruitment Office via floo. They were met on their arrival by a tall, gruff-looking Drill Sergeant. He said, “Ah. More Wizards, eh? Top Brass has given you priority, so you wont even have to go through the physical. My name is Sergeant Davis, and I will be your instructor. Private, show the recruits to the waiting area.” He motioned for a private to take them into a small waiting area. Harry saw a bus outside the window. This was it. He might not set foot in Hogwarts or the Burrow for who knew how long. He recognized several people. Neville, Pansy Parkinson, and several of Harrys other classmates. He wondered why no one said anything, until he saw the sign. It read in part,

TALKING FORBIDDEN UNLESS IN APPROVED AREAS.

Harry thought that was a bit extreme, but then again he also knew that this was the best way to keep security tight, as none of the students would be able to cause any mayhem accidentally with their wands.

He took his seat, Ron and Hermione sitting on either side of him, and waited. The wait was'nt long. The private waved them through the door onto the bus, then sat in the driver's seat. Harry noticed Draco Malfoy, his usually sneering face looking terrified. Harry smiled at his distress. Malfoy would now be in the exact opposite environement from what he was used to. But then Harry's smile disappeared. He remembered that Malfoy's father was now the prisoner of the Third World. The bus ride was short, as the recruitment office was only several miles from the training camp. Harry and the others got out, and lined up. Harry saw several of his classmates. Alicia, Angelina, Oliver, Patil, and others.Harry noticed all of them were Gryffindors and Slytherins. He hoped to find out why. Sergeant Davis made his way down the line. He gave a small speech. “You are here to learn the ropes of muggle military training. You all come from magical backgrounds, and I myself have a wife who is an Auror. The training will not be easy, but I have been told to go slightly easier on you. Slightly. I fully understand your world is not well disciplined. I normally would not be saying things such as this to recruits, but you 20 are hardly normal. For some of you, this will be your first encounter with the muggle world,” He paused, glancing at Malfoy and several other pure-bloods. “For others, it is simply a matter of being reintroduced,” He paused again, glancing at Hermone, Harry, and other muggle-borns. “I cannot expect you to perform at the level of other recruits. To do so would be to jeopardize your training. We cannot have that. This war is far too important to waste any soldiers, even weakling grunts like you. By the time you are done, you will be at the level I expect from most recruits. I do not take this lightly. You will be facing the longest struggle of your lives. My job is to make soldiers out of you. This will take longer than normal. You cannot be rushed, you and I will have failed , and possibly cost us the war if any of you 20 fail. This will be not just for the military. This will be much like a military school. But even more so. Understood?” Harry and the other's said, “Yes, Sir!” Davis continued, “Good. You will head to the mess hall, get some breakfast. I expect you all to be in tip-top shape by the end of it. Or else.” He walked off, and a private led them into the mess hall. Harry was surprised to see much food laid out. Steak, pasta, soup, salad, even dessert. He waited in line, then picked out his food, and sat down near Ron and Hermione. He looked over at the sign.

TALKING ALLOWED IN BASE CAMP. WANDS ONLY ALLOWED IN DESIGNATED AREAS.

He turned to Hermione, “Do you think Davis was fooling us? It dosent seem like the military to have standards be any lower than they already are.” Hermione shook her head, “Harry, you have to remember, Wizards are an extreme minority in Britain. If any wizard fails to make the cut, they lose some of their most powerful soldiers. They wont go easy on us for that long, though. Its just to get us used to the muggle world /and/ the military. Some of the greatest wizards ever did'nt have a milligram of discipline.” Ron said, “Besides, Harry, dont bite the hand that feeds you.” Harry nodded, though he did'nt seem quite so sure. After Breakfast, they were told to do their usual excercises, push-ups, leg-ups, chin-ups. They learned the rudimentary skills needed to fire a rifle, and to take it apart. They were soon learning classroom-style work. Muggle history, science, government, everything. The next few days went by in a blur. They did push-ups, weight-lifting, learned how to fire a rifle, the obstacle course. More classroom work. Davis said Harry was, “Not bad for a grunt,” after he had hit the bullseye with all 50 bullets, though Harry sensed some restrained admiration. Harry responded, “Thank you sir.” Davis said, “I was reading about you. Seeker on... what do you people call it? Quidditch?” Harry said, “Yes sir, best Gryffindor house had, sir.”Davis said, “Carry on, Potter.” Harry grinned, “Thank you sir.” Harry and his friends barely had time to talk, they were doing so much work. They constantly had excercises, homework, and other things to do. The only time they did talk was at bed, and only a goodnight to Ron. Harry noticed that the other recruits were losing weight at a fast rate. Harry supposed it was from not eating very much. Meal times were only 15 minutes long. One night, Harry was looking at his calendar, stored in the mole-skin pouch Hagrid had given him a while back, and found that the previous day had been the last day of training. Harry sat back on the bed and breathed a sigh of relief. Tomorrow, he would graduate.
