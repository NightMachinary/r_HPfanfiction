ok so a while ago i read this one tomione time travel fic and i've been looking for it for a really long time but i just cannot find it. all i can remember is that its at the end of the war, harry and ron are dead, and hermione uses a time turner (i think) to go back in time to when tom riddle was in school so she can kill him, but they end up falling in love (duh.) i remember tom got jealous of her being friends with draco's ancestor (cant remember his name, think it started w an a.) i think she like travels with him and sees him make some of the horcruxes? not entirely sure. i know i read it on fanfiction.net and it was suuuuuper long. like way longer than like 20 chapters. if anyone can tell me which story i'm thinking of, i'd really appreciate it :)


** The user Colubrina on fanfiction.net has about a half dozen stories that are like this. A Ball of Wibbly Wobbly and Pygmalion both sound like what you are looking for.
