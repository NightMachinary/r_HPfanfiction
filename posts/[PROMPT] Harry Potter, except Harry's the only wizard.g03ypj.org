Okay so basically keep all the characters the same but! There's no wizarding community etc.

So Harry lives with his abusive Aunt and Uncle after his parents were killed and his Aunt finds out about him doing "Freaky" stuff likes his mother. His mother also attended Hogwarts, a rich boarding school, and put his name down and paid for his education. Anway Aunt Petunia knows that Lily's odd abilities are what got her killed so she drills a sort of "conceal don't feel or reveal" mindset into Harry, out of sense of responsibility but still pertaining a bit of a love/hate relationship with him.

When he turns eleven, an introverted Harry gets a letter to join Hogwarts, and he is not known for his BWL status but all the staff knew his parents. And Harry goes through his Hogwarts years trying to hide his powers (they study Latin because Hogwarts is fancy and Harry finds that this is the best was to channel his powers) whilst fighting basalisks and odd creatures that only he can see, but are a danger to everyone.

Snape, being Lily's childhood best friend, might recognise that her son inherited her ablilties and because he helped her through them from a young age, he takes on the role of mentor.

Anway just an idea, and if any of you are willing to write this/know of a similar fic then awesome lol


** Snape, mentor? I think you meant de-mentor, no way Snapey has enough goodness enough in his heart to help Harry xD

*** AU. Plus in this fic Snape wouldn't be a wizard so he wouldn't experience half the stuff he did as a DE so therefore would be less inclined to be.... Snape.

***** Perhaps, though, say he might be less inclined to be a totally incompetent teacher if he's teaching something like biology or chemistry rather than potions. Potions are volatile and precise, whereas muggle biology would be less difficult. Obviously he would still be strict to some degree, but he would still teach better. Plus, in this AU he would be the /only/ one to be able to teach Harry because he was the first to help Lily (especially if he continued their friendship, which would be deeper due to the level of trust that would be key)

**** His father would have been abusive, magic excuse or not.

Potter and Black would have bullied him, magic or no magic.

Lucius would have been a criminal and introduced him to a criminal organization, magic or not.

You cannot say "keep everything else the same", but then change /just/ Snape.

***** Yes. He can. He can say anything he wants to say; weather or not he'll get what he wants is another matter, though.

For instance, in this as-of-yet-to-be-written Verse. Snape gets accidental magic'd into loving Lily (and by extension, Harry) and because there's no magic, no one can ever undo it. So, Snape is just as horrible a person to everyone else, but as soon as you bring Harry into it, he turns on a head and turns into an upstanding sort. Like, Liquid Luck/Love Potion/Cunfundus kind of U-Turn. This just makes everyone else think he's off his rocker, though.

*** I think an interpretation of Snape could 100% have him be a mentor and ...

Well, /nice/ is a strong word, but at least protective and eventually caring for Harry. It requires a good bit of setup, but I think it's not as out there as you think ;)

**** Probaly not :) canon snape, despite beeing an utter bastard, has always tried to keep Harry alive. And its not hard to imagine a path where Snape turns "good"

I just tend to prefer seeing Snape get punished for his terrible behavior towards the kids ;)

***** Yup! And, IMO at least, if Snape were to be the one sent to get Harry (instead of Hagrid) and having to see first hand what he went through with his family, I think things would have gone very differently.

But you're right, seeing some variations of Snape getting punished for his behavior isn't a bad idea! I do like having the good ones in fanfiction as well, though.

****** Yeah, having Snapes eyes opened to Harrys childhood is one of the things i see that could change him. Or having it pointed out that he have become the bully (he believes) James was.

I tend to avoid fics with a supportive snape though, its rarely done well -or snape is massive ooc- and i cant take them seriously. But i know there are a few good ones. Just read a vampire!Harry fic, where him and Vampire!snape gets over their differences and become friends.

******* It's a hard setup to do well, yeah - partly because people who try their hand at such a setup have a rose-tinted view of Snape.

The best ones I've seen that managed it were actually Fem!Harry fics, funnily enough - one which had him as a mentor figure for a potion prodigy, and the other /really/ nailing sarcastic/asshole Snape as a protective figure, even if it rather unfortunately has a (very late) endgame pairing involving Snape for female Harry (Which, luckily, doesn't surface at all early on)

** Somewhat related, but the prompt title took me in a different direction.

Harry Potter, except Harry's the only wizard. The wizarding world is dead and gone... but all the magic is still running autonomously. At 11 he gets his hogwarts letter. He ditches the dursleys and figures out his way into platform 9 3/4. It's a little eerie and empty, but okay, that's weird. Too late to back out now. The train whistles to indicate it's about to leave, and fearing missing out, he hops on right as it starts to pull out of the station. Terrified and alone for 9 hours on the ghost train, it pulls into a run-down station in the middle of nowhere with a castle overlooking a lake in the distance. Still no people.

He approaches the castle, the gates open, as if welcoming him. The house elves are ecstatic, but still forbidden from interacting with a student who doesn't seek them out, but otherwise help him as much as possible.

An 11 year old, a haunted castle, and the only way out is through. Can he learn magic from the books in the library before he goes mad? Will his sanity break under the strain? Where /is/ everyone?!

Edit; will there or won't there be dead bodies laying around? Or some graveyard on the school grounds? How did they all die? Voldemorts last ditch attempt at godhood killed them all??? Maybe there are a few other muggleborns that found their own letter and were on the train too?

** I really like the idea for this fic! It would be interesting to see what differences there's be between canon and this new universe. Hagrid no longer being half giant, /or/ only harry can see him. Another interesting character might be Voldemort Perhaps, like Lily and Hary, he could also see this fantasy world, giving him his whole Superiority complex. Snape being a mentor is also a good idea! He probably wouldn't have all that great of an image in the school, still the least liked teacher, But there's potential that he'd see more of Lily in Hary then James in this AU

** How would Snape have wound up at a rich boarding school in Scotland?

/Edit/ You're going to say scholarship, but how would he get connected with a private institution like that to get a scholarship? Through his upper class mother (analogous to magic, I guess) who was cast out of her family for taking up with a working class lad? Her family wouldn't help him if she'd been cast out.
