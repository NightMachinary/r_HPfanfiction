So I just read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28454394][As Thirst Holds Water]] by MonsieurClavier simply because I enjoy the author‘s other works. I happened to like this one, but the plot hasn't truly picked up yet. Typically if I even see omegaverse, mating cycles, heat, etc. in story tags I immediately skip over them because I've just never found the whole concept appealing. Are there any ABO fics out there that y'all think would change my mind? I'm willing to give them another shot.


** I think this (see below) is probably the best ABO Harry Potter fanfic out there. In the least, it's the only complete one I know of with a real plot and very good. It's also a Tomarry fic, which I see the one you linked was.

In general, I haven't read many Harry Potter ABO fics that are good and not just pure smut. The few that have an actual plot usually don't get far.

Most of the ABO fics I've read and enjoyed are for Hannibal or Teen Wolf.

  Harry is a Guide with a secret. But when revealed, the whole world seems like it's out to get him. First The Ministry, then an 'Order', and now a hit man from a covert organization bent on eradicating his kind. The hired gun seems to have an agenda of his own though. But what could Tom, an Alpha Sentinel, want from Harry? (A Tom/Harry Assassin, Omegaverse, and Sentinel/Guide AU).

** I haven't read many solid Harry Potter ABO fics, and my favourite ones are actually original fiction by one particular author.

As far as HP fics though, I do have one rec. I haven't caught up with this one, but I did enjoy the beginning, though mostly for the Hermione/Theo storyline. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17653448/chapters/41631518]])

And this one was pretty fun too linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20795282/chapters/49423295]])

In the end, it's honestly not something that everyone will enjoy. I only like reading them sometimes (generally when I'm in horrific amounts of pain)

  Harry gritted his teeth and said to Hermione, “I think I'm an omega.”Because under no circumstances can Harry and Hermione have a normal year at Hogwarts, not even with Voldemort vanquished and Dumbledore too dead to complicate their lives. Of course other complications are entirely fair game.

  Hermione is about to go through her first heat as an Omega. Problem is: she doesn't have an Alpha to help see her through. Leave it to her best friend, Harry Potter, to sign her up for a match service called Findr, where Hermione finds a married couple looking for an Omega to share.
