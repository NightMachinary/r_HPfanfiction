I've recently read The Red Knight, What Ginny Forgot, and a couple of Daphne/Harry fics where the Slytherin supporting cast (usually including Blaise, Daphne, Tracey, and sometimes Nott and Pansy) and I'm just really feeling those dynamics. So any fics, any pairing, featuring Slytherin's prominently and positively (although still ambitious, cunning, and snarky). Preferably longer ones, but I'll take anything. Well written (by whatever your standard is), and ones that you've really enjoyed. Thanks!


** Latet Anguis in Herba features a Slytherin group of OC friends during the books. One of the parts I enjoy is that they're likeable whilst also acting like Slytherins probably should-ambitious and cunning. It's a series of oneshots that lead into the sequels Shade to Shade, Falls to Shadow and Beyond this Place-which are full novels. Ignite and it's sequels also feature Slytherins heavily and are also semi-sequels to Anguis.

**** The characters are great and I just love how much thought and care the author put into the story. Have you read Stygian Trilogy as well? Would definitetly recommend it if you enjoy Anguis.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** Well honestly I haven't found anything like the cast of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). You'd be hard pressed to find a Nott, Zabini, and even Malfoy that are more interesting than in this fic.

Oh sure there are certainly arses and serious lunatics, but thats the point of much o f the fic - there are two sides to those qualities the founders so venerated. Boldness goes hand in hand with recklessness, intelligence with snobbishness and conceit. For Slytherin, there greatest virtue ambition is also there greatest vice. This can carry them to the heights of good and power, but it can also take them down dark paths in an attempt to climb to the top, including by stifling as many challengers as possible.

This fic revolves around Harry's slowly growing attempt to push Slytherin away from the vice and toward the virtue of their ambition.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** The Green Girl by Colubrina This has some of my favourite depictions of Slytherins, from Daphne, Tracey, and Millicent having a thing for Muggle fashion magazines to Greg and Vincent having actual personalities. I would say that ambition, cunning, resourcefulness, and snark are all well represented.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas.
