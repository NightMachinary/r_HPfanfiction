:END:
I'm looking for this one particular fanfic where I think snape raised Harry but he was close with the malfoys and he was best friends with draco and the one thing that really stood out to me was when it was time for Harry to get robes he went with narcissa and he got robes with a lily flower and narcissus flower on them. I really enjoyed this fic but I can't remember the name if anyone can think of a similar sounding one that would really help. :)
