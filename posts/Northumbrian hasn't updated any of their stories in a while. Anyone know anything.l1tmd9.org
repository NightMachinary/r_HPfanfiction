** He did an AMA on the Harry/Ginny discord back in 2019 and I got the impression he'd lost interest, to be honest, though he did say he was still writing.

** No, there hasn't been any movement in any of his fanfiction stories since completion of “Strangers at Drakeshaugh” (2018-08-31), and complete radio silence since publishing (non-fanfic) “[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3328948/1/Winter-Journeys][Winter Journeys]]” (Feb 20, 2019).

  I used to say that I'm only just an Englishman, as I live north of Hadrian's Wall, but south of the border with Scotland. I am Northumbrian (I'm from that part of the UK that, twelve centuries ago, was the Kingdom of Northumbria) but in the last year or two I've become increasingly concerned about the labels we give each other. I refuse to be identified as English, or Scottish. I'll live with British Citizen, because it's legally correct, although, given our recent behaviour, being British is not something to be proud of. My preferred term has always been "EU Citizen" but let's not get into that argument.
