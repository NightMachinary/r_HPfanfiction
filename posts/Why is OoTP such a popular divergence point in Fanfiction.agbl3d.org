Almost all 'For Want of a Nail' fics diverge from sometime between the fifth and sixth books, usually the former. Why?


** here's the main reasons as I see them

- a marked decline in quality from OotP to HBP

- controversial plot and character decisions post OotP

- shipping

- a desire to deliver on the (implied) promise of a more Dumbledore-independent and/or assertive Harry

*** Also:

- Voldemort is back, so you have a clearly defined antagonist and not just some vague threat.

- The main cast has spent a few years learning magic, so it is believable for them to actually win fights based on ability and not just luck/Deus-ex plot devices.

- Post OotP means everyone is 16, which means that the main cast is able to comprehend more elaborate topics than a bunch of preteens

- You can have a 16-year-old Harry run around in the muggle world and pass as "of age", so you have a lot more options for possible plots. 12-year-old kids would not be allowed to travel on their own and so on.

- From an author's point of view, it is a lot easier to write believable teenagers than pre-teens (they end up way too smart/capable in 9/10 cases).

  Why do people hate him so much.
#+end_quote

Two quotes from OOTP is all that it takes to destroy the delusion that Dumbledore acted in Harry's best interest

#+begin_quote
  "I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years"

  "you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well-nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was working well."
#+end_quote

Dumbledore admits that he knew how awful the Dursleys would be. The cupboard might count as torture and is definitely child abuse and in canon, Harry was severely malnutritioned and was starved even further in CoS, but that's fine because he was not spoilt.

***** To be fair, that quote doesn't necessarily means Dumbledore knew what type of shit Harry would have had to put up with.

It means Dumbledore knew at some level that Harry wouldn't be treated like the Dursley's own son, but it doesn't necessarily means that he knew the level of abuse that would happen.

It has been consistently in Dumbledore's character through out the canon that, for better or for worse, he expects people to be far better than they actually are. So he might have thought Petunia would treat Harry poorly and not give him a loving home, but not outright abuse him with physical/emotional violence and starvation.

********* I am not saying his decision was perfect. I am not even saying it was the right one.

I am saying that it wasn't intentionally malicious as some people make it out to be.

Dumbledore is a powerful wizard, but he is still a man. A flawed man like any other and capable of mistakes.

That night was shitty for everyone involved and I am sure that everyone was busy that night because Voldemort's demise would lead to the Death Eaters lashing out or fleeing, so it was busy and stressful.

Again, was it the right decision? Probably not. I still think Harry could have been safe under a Fidelius with someone more trustworthy, like McGonnal or Flitwick, no need for "blood wards" or the Dursleys.

It was a poor decision but not one born out of malice, at least in my interpretation.

Too many people like to paint it as a moustache twirling "I hope Harry gets bullied real hard to lower his self confidence" Dumbledore which is frankly so cartoonish that it borders the ridiculous.

Dumbledore is just a naive dude who is too old and has too many responsibilities shoved into his hand because the wizarding world has an extremely sheepish nature of leaving their problems in other people's hands.

Most of what you're doing here is assumming about things you don't know. Only JK Rowling knows. And it doesn't seem to me like she meant to make Dumbledore Evil. That's your own interpretation, and I seriously disagree with it, that is all. And IMO only her opinion actually matters when it comes to canon. And like I said, I really can't see Rowling's Dumbledore evil in any way.

The Fidelius is the only logical point you made, but even then, again, we don't know how it works, only the author does.

******** 1) You don't need Lily's blood protection if you're able to make other protections that are just as good. It's also stated within the books that those protections (not the ones in his blood, but the ones on the Dursley's home), only protect him while he's there. Even if that means the whole street/neighborhood, it wouldn't protect him when they take him to London or anywhere outside of those borders. He stays at Diagon Alley, The Burrow, The Quiddich World Cup, and Grimmauld Place, all outside of those protections. They're clearly not /that/ important.

2) Death of the Author. If JKR says Dumbledore was good, but the actual writing in the book points towards him manipulating Harry's life and being amoral about it, then it doesn't matter what she said, canon states otherwise. You can argue the point, but use actual evidence within the story to support your opinion. Her opinion does not matter.

3) The Fidelius works by hiding a secret (possibly any secret, but definitely a location) within the soul of the Secret Keeper, and only the Secret Keeper can reveal that secret to others. If Dumbledore made himself Secret Keeper, and placed protections on wherever Harry was staying, then there's no reason Harry couldn't have lived in a loving and caring home. There's very few reasonable explainations to this plot hole, and all of the ones I can think of paint JKR or Dumbledore in a bad light. One, she just needed Harry to be raised by the Dursleys so she ignored that option. Two, she didn't come up with the Fidelius until book 5, so she hadn't thought of it. Three, Dumbledore was set on a plan and believed it was the only way things could work, and therefore ignored an equally viable plan that would have been healthier for Harry juat out of sheer arrogance. Four, Dumbledore wanted Harry raised in that environment so that it'd be easier to get Harry to off himself when the time came.

there were fics written after poa and before gof, but the number was in the hundreds, not in the hundredthousands and millions

after gof there was a long gap and there was a growing fandom full of teens with enough spare time to write

as a result the numbers of fics exploded while people waited for ootp to come out

many of the older fics were started or written after gof but before hbp

some writers edited their stories and changed to incorporate ootp, but many did not bother

rinse and repat with hbp

*** Absolutely agree. There was a 3 year gap between GoF and OotP, which back in 2000, felt like 5+ years especially since there were annual releases for the first 4 books. That's also when I started reading fanfiction and most authors during that time used the summer before Harry's fifth year as a diverging point, even after OotP came out.

Personally, I think the time gap allowed the collective readers' imaginations to cool and solidify into general expectations, extrapolating the direction of the series through fanfiction and theories. So when OotP came out and was markedly different in tone, authors "re-did" OotP according to what they felt better fit the series before it.

** I expect the fifth because it's immediately after a major shift in the narrative: Voldemort prior to this point wasn't really an issue because he was some kind of incorporeal threat, but now he has a body and followers and can do much more harm. Also, a lot of people (myself not included) were annoyed with Harry in the fifth book because he was an angsty teenager, so it was a chance to kind of rewrite that and replace it with someone who wasn't handling his PTSD and survivor's guilt by pushing everyone away.

The sixth, most likely because it's after the DoM battle and Sirius' death, coupled with the fact that it's when his ‘chest monster' is a thing. It kind of implies that while he had a crush on Cho in the previous two books, it wasn't really serious the way his crush on Ginny was, so people can use that as an excuse to be like /hey, romance/ and write what they want.

Or we'll just dump Harry back at the Dursleys after an especially traumatic experience (and school year, tbh) with no contact from the outside world, like that newly discovered godfather or his friends. Oh, and JKR will do her best to make Harry as unlikable as possible, but we'll handwave that away as Voldemort's emotions through his scar or "he's a teenager" (note: I was a teenager at the time, and I still noticed how bad his characterization was.). Wait a minute...what are the adults in the Order actually doing, anyway? Wait, did Sirius die? By drapery?!

5/6 divergence: Ok, so Voldemort appeared at the Ministry, he's back for good. War? Fighting? No, sorry, Harry's been abandoned at the Dursleys again...which seems a bad idea, since his last family member just died, and it's been proven that someone can definitely still harm him through the wards. I was already mad at the series from OotP's characterization issues, and then this book happened. Also, horcruxes seemed like a terrible idea at the time (probably still are, but I've read enough fic that I've seen how it can be done); it also turned the series into an adventure quest, which I hadn't signed up for.

** It's the latest point in time in which most possibilities remain open. Once you get to post-HBP, your options are highly limited. For example, Dumbledore is dead, meaning the Order are very much on the back foot rather than gearing up for a fair fight. Another: Harry is locked in to having to find the horcruxes, which is a dead weight on any original plot.

*** You can always defeat Voldemort before taking care of the Horcruxes. It's easier to find a bunch of trinkets if their owner is not currently ruling all of Britain and has death squads roam the countryside.

***** Kinda difficult if you are a disembodied wraith. If you chuck all Death Eaters through the veil (or have them kissed), Voldemort has no power base left and can be dealt with easily. Also, you can argue that the small piece of soul he has left would be impossible to split further.

**** I always thought that Voldemort Prime would just return to spirit form if you killed him before taking out the Horcruxes, so even if you DID go this route, you'd still have one disembodied spirit to find and kill before it manages to get a new host and possibly some more Horcruxes.

** That's news to me, but I suppose it's because I tend to look out for longer fics, and those tend to start earlier.

As for why, probably because OOTP is Rowling's only good book in the entire series.

** Because Voldemort is back in OotP. Until that point, Voldemort is still just a boogieman - frightening, but the danger is not as real. But the end of GoF changes that for Harry - Voldemort goes through the most convoluted scheme ever devised to kidnap him and try and kill him as an example to everyone else. Suddenly the danger is all too real.

The idea that the wizard who murdered his parents and tried killing him several times in his life is well and truly alive and back for vengeance makes for a very good premise to give canon Harry the kick in the arse he so desperately needed. Too bad it never happened in canon though.

There's also the shit he goes through thanks to the slander campaign the Ministry runs on him. After his life is put at risk, the Ministry chooses to verbally condemn him and has an official mutilate him in spite of the warning he gives - it should encourage a moment of introspection from canon HP, 'Was any of it still worth it?' Is the Ministry worth fighting for? After all, these are the same people who threw his godfather into prison without trial (from Harry's eyes) and refuse to acknowledge their mistake in PoA. They also force him into the tournament (again from Harry's eyes) and then the smear campaign. Harry could very well ask himself whether Britain is worth fighting for at that point (from Harry's comparatively narrow perspective).

Then finally, Albus' long list of bungles in OotP.

Together, all three of them are enough to feature OotP as a major divergence.

** OotP, where you can diverge your story at the beginning (dementor attack/Ministry hearing) or at the end (fight at the Ministry and its aftermath).

And each of these can be used for jumping off points for multiple story ideas.

** Because things start to seriously derail for the "light" after OoTP. Before that, most things are just contained to school events that everyone eventually overcomes with minimal loss of life.

I mean, up to Book 5 only one character died (as in, characters that aren't just background fodder).

So it is after OoTP that a lot of events happen in a way that people don't like or disagree with for one reason or another, plot and story-wise.

** I think people are disappointed to see Harry still doing nothing about his situation even though he claim that he wants to end the threat of Voldemort but even after seeing Cedric and above all, Sirius die, he still doesn't try to learn more, to get stronger or anything and finally, let himself be carried by Hermione and others all the way till the end while basically being useless in book 7 despite his claim to want to got on the Horcrux Hunt. Hermione did it all. Imagine if she had wanted to stay for her last year in Hogwart. Harry would most likely have died not two days after Fleur and Bill's wedding.

JKR's desire to push for Harry being able to be a hero without being specially strong of gifted made for a nice story but highly frustrating characterization. How could anyone in his situation not trying his/her best to overcome it, survive and prevail. That Cedric death hadn't been enough of a wake up call because they were not that close can pass (if barely) but after Sirius death? Or Dumbledore's death one year later? Preposterous.
