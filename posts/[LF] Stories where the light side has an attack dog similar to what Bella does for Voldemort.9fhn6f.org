** In my story "Patron", Aberforth covers this role for Dumbledore (grumbling all the way). Although he's more of a "take care of this problem in the Balkans" guy - he doesn't stay at his brother's side until a fight breaks out but does missions in Britain and all over Europe.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  What if Voldemort complied with Snape's wish on Halloween 1981? What if the Harry we know used the Resurrection Stone at the same time as a heart broken Lily? Two different eras, two different realities...Post DH
