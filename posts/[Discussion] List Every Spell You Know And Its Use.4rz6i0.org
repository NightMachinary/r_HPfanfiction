*** u/waylandertheslayer:
#+begin_quote
  Original spells from authors /belong to that author/, and if such spells are used elsewhere the original authors permission must be granted.
#+end_quote

But this is a subreddit dedicated precisely to fanfiction, i.e. using other people's work as a base without explicit permission from them. I agree that using someone else's ideas without crediting them is bad practice and maybe ethically not great, but there's no 'permission /must/ be granted' involved - maybe '/should/', but not '/must/'

***** I agree that it's in bad taste or whatever, but I think it's fundamentally strange to have a rule that says 'if you write a story about someone else's work, without asking the author for permission, nobody can write a story using elements of your work without asking you for permission'. Should you do it? No. /Could/ you do it? Probably.

******* I agree with both of you, I think. A bit. Do I avoid reading certain stories if I think I might write from that starting point someday? Do I take care not to knowingly rip off or recycle someone else's work? Sure! It's just fun for me that way.

Do I imagine that all of us writing fanfiction from the same seven books could have stories that echo or mirror someone else's? Yeah, it seems pretty likely.

Do I roll my eyes when I see a warning on a fanfiction that explains which parts are JKR and which parts are "MINE!" as if Author has his arm protectively curled around a plastic tray of cafeteria food? I sure do. Man, no one wants your beef stroganoff.

Do I care if I throw a bit of an idea up in a forum and someone else runs with it first? Nope. Will it stop me from writing something later when I get around to it? Nope.

******** That seems quite sensible. After all, there's only so many interesting plot ideas available, and while some are awful and should never have seen the light of day (Lord Potter-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-not-Hufflepuff-because-it-sucks-Black-Merlin-sorry-that-should-be-spelled-Myrddin-Weasley stories are universally terrible ime), a lot of them have been conceived of, repeated, refined, parodied and finally perfected, something only possible if you have a lot of people writing the same sort of story and building on each others' work.

** As I am in no way a wizard, witch, warlock, sorcerer, mage, or any other form of magical being (with the exclusion of witch doctor), I know no spells, unless you are referring to the proper arrangement of letters to create words to facilitate communication.
