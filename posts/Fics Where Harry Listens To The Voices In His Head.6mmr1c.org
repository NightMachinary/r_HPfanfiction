*** They aren't really voices in his head like he has schizophrenia, but Rowling writes Harry's own self-doubt like a voice that questions his thoughts and motives in his head. Kinda like a negative conscience. I can't think of a specific example but from memory it happens a fair amount in the fifth book (?).

** linkffn(Unlocked Knowledge) Harry infected the Scarcrux with empathy (and some of his sense of humor, YMMV) And Tom is perfectly willing to help Harry, when he's not making witty criticisms.
