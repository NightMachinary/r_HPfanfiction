I'm curious who will drop the most hated one, here goes:

- "I am not your boy, dumb-as-a-door. That's lord potter black slytherin gryffindor peverell ravenclaw to you. I will take care of voldyshorts on my own so you won't need to pay the weasleys from my vault to be my friends anymore!"


** "What, esteemed honorable goblin Griphook? You mean to tell me I, Hadrian Potter, am not only the Lord Potter, but also to Black, Peverell, Emrys and Le Fay? And this blood lineage test also showed I'm a shadow elemental and metamorphmagus, and Dumbledore has bound 99.99999% of my core? I'm also soul bound to 7 witches? Hmph and I suppose obtaining Slytherin by right of conquest as well shows I am the actual boy who lived, not my brother who has been so lovingly raised by James and Lily Potter. I will... MAKE THEM PAY! Goodbye Griphook, may your wealth grow, loins flourish, biceps engorge, and enemies' blood spill out of their eye sockets."

Welp, writing that gave me physical pain.

** Lord Hadrian Potter Black Peverell Emrys Slytherin Ravenclaw Gryffindor (but not Hufflepuff because it's the house of the duffers) stared at his enemy Albus "Too-Many-Middle-Names" Dumbledore, his AK colored green orbs flaming with power.\\
"It's over, old man", the raven haired lord said, a gush of wind flaming around him as if conjured by his words, "I have finally broken free of all you manipulations, and will not let you complete you plan to raise me as a lamb to slaughter".\\
The Old Goat reacted at his words, and seemed to want to respond, but was paralyzed by the aura of power which radiated from "The Boy Who Lived", and at that moment he knew that his boy had managed to remove the block he had put on his magical core, making him more powerfull than even him. As if reading his minds, (and he probably was, the loss of the block revealing his powers as a natural Legilimens, as well as a naturel Occulumens, Basilisk and Phoenix Animagus, Metamormagus and Shadow Mage"), the Green Eyed boy smilled.\\
"Yes I have discovered everything", he continued "How you Imperiused Pettigrew to force him to betray my parents, and how you made sure Sirius ended up in Azkaban with no trial. I also know how you paid the Weasleys to "take me in", don't think I have not read the Marriage Contract you signed in my name as my Illegal Magical Guardian after sealing the Potter Will, everything goes to Ginny after my death right?"\\
At that moment, Severus Snape entered the room, yelling "Potter how dare yo . . .", but before he could finish his sentence, Harry used his awesome Metamormagus power to turn his eyes red". Snape was shocked "Li-Lily?" he managed to say.\\
The "Man Who Would Conquer" looked at him with disdain. "You Snivelius, mistreated me for all my life her because you were jealous of my father. You don't even deserve my hate you . . . bully". And Snape, confronted with suck an insult, could not do anything else than see the errors of his ways, and chose to beg for forgiveness by giving Harry James Potter everything he owned, including the secret recipes of potions to cure Lycantropisme, heal his allie parents (because a Longbottom always stand next to a Potter) and make Muggles magical, before throwing himself out of the window to his death.\\
Harry looked back at Dumbledore, ignoring the intermission that had just happened. "As I was saying" he said "I know everything of you plan. Too bad you didn't respected the Goblinsg, May the blood of their enemies flow and their vault be filled with gold. Griphook was the most helpful, showing me everyone of your machinations. It's only natural since the Potter are long time allies of Gringott and one of their "special" clients. The only reason I talk to you know is to get back what is mine". At that moment, the Elder Wand jumped out of the old man pocket right into Harry's hand. Just as a ring came from the window and the Invisibility Cloack materialised on Harry's shoulder.\\
"As the Master of Death" Harry said, using his new found power "I kill now Moldy Short, as if he could truly "Fly from Death".\\
At the same time, at the Malfoy Manor, Voldemort got a sense of dread, right before dying in front of his Death Eater, his Horcruxes destroyed. With his death, Bellatrix Black was finally free from the Imperius she was under since he teenage years, and taking her sister Narcissa, jumped into the floo to Hogwarts in order to . . . reward her saviour.\\
His deed done, Harry looked at Dumbledore one last time. "You see, Old Coot, it was as simple as that, if not for your stupid plots". Shocked by what had happened, and outraged by the insult, the genius Dumbledore forgot to breath for 30 second before his survival instinct finally kicked him and swallowed some air. Just as he did so, the door opened and Susan Bones, Hermione Granger, Luna Lovegood and Daphne Greengrass entered the room, just as the floo flared and Bellatrix and Narcissa appeared from it.\\
"Now that this is done", "The Master of Death" said, "Know that Amelia Bones know all about what you did, and will arrive in 30s to arrest you. As for me, Hogwarts as nothing more to teach me, so me and my lovely bethroved, as if you could keep them hidden from me and in Hermione case try to give her to Ronald Weasel with love potions, will pass some lovely times in my private Potter island in Greece. After this, I may clean Magical Brittain of their stupidity and break this stupid Statute because the Muggles are better than wizards, they went to the moon after all. And don't think you can stop me by calling me a Dark Wizard, I use both Light and Dark Side, I am . . . Grey". By saying so, he used his amazing powers and apparated out of Hogwards despite the wards, taking all his girls with him. Albus thought he saw more girls leave with Harry than he thought he mentionned, but it was probably an halucination of his feable old mind. And it's not like Harry could satisfy all the girls of Hogwarts if he chose to. This was his last coherent thought before Amelia Bones came from the floo and arrested him, putting him in Azkaban.

** What the hell did you just fucking say to me, you old goat? I'll have you know I've been emancipated by the goblins, and I've claimed my rightful lordships, and I own over 300 vaults. I unlocked the abilites you blocked and my magical core grew over nine thousand percent. You are nothing to me but a squib. I could curse you with power the likes of which has never been seen since Merlin, mark my bloody words.

You think you can get away with calling me "Harry" instead of "Lord Potter"? Think again, old coot. As we speak I'm Legilimentally contacting Amelia Bones and your Wizengamot title is being revoked right now so you better prepare for the storm. The storm that wipes out the pathetic web of lies you call your life. You're fucking done, Dumbledork.

I can Apparate anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my katana. Not only am I extensively trained in wandless magic, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the MACUSA and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable beard off the British Isles. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" manipulations were about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have kept your crooked fingers to yourself. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you senile fool. I do not forgive, I do not forget.

*** (In response) Are you really? Interesting. I was waiting for this, actually. You've finally grown into your own. Yes, in fact all of this power came from my manipulations. How does it feel, Harry? To know that you can never escape my reach, that everything you do, even if you strike me down, was, and will forever be, orchestrated by me alone? After all, I am a the most powerful Seer in the world since I broke that upstart Lovegood's ability and added it to my own. 'Twas a shame it killed her and weakened her daughter's ability. I obliviated her afterwards into thinking it was an accident, and she will never OBLIVIATE!

We had a nice chat, talking about your newfound powers that I unlocked for you. You simply weren't ready until now, because I feared that with the Horcrux inside your head, Voldemort would be able to take you over. Now that you're of age, I was able to remove it, so go, fight, and win for the Greater Good.

I have pale white skin. I'm also the strongest wizard of all time, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I'm in the fifth year (I'm fifteen). I'm rich (in case you couldn't tell) and I have 40 manors and 20 seats on the Wizengamot and 5 soul bonds. I love shopping in Diagon Alley and spending 8 chapters buying everything there. For example today I bought a giant expandable trunk with 7 rooms and an expanding closet in it, 2 snakes (one was rainbow colored opal and the other was black), another wand with whomping willow wood and a basilisk fang and threstral scale core and two wand holsters. I was wearing a black dragonhide robe with dragonhide boots and black leather pants and sunglasses to cover my scar like in the Matrix. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of Death Eaters stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.

** Not so much a line as a summary for the crackiest crack that was ever cracked.

Dumbledore's obsession with the prophecy has led to homicide and madness.

Dumbledore was convinced that he was receiving visions that relate to the prophecy, and he is sure that Sirius was supposed to die in the battle of the Department of mysteries. When Bellatrix doesn't push Sirius into the mirror like she is supposed to, Dumbledore takes it upon himself to provide the appropriate amount of trauma to push Harry along his path.

In a horrifying twist, Dumbledore apparates out of the Department of Mysteries with Ron, murders him and then apparates back with his body, blaming the Death Eaters for his death.

Dumbledore is completely and utterly insane. He is the author of all of Harry's misery, because he has grossly misinterpreted the Prophecy. He thinks that the power that the Dark Lord knows not is driven by trauma. (Think ‘The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas' by Ursula K. LeGuin)

In additional Revelations to this horrifying backstory, we learn that Dumbledore tortured the Longbottoms and framed Bellatrix for it. Bellatrix didn't torture the Longbottoms for the same reason that she didn't push Sirius into the mirror - she hoped that the Dark Lord would bring the Black family together, not tear it apart, and she saw Dumbledore's manipulations for what they were.

Dumbledore also manipulated Pettigrew into betraying the Potters and framing Sirius. Dumbledore also knew what kind of people the Dursleys were and sent Harry to live with them anyway.

The final twist was going to be that Dumbledore */IS/* Voldemort, like, Full-on Fight Club Style. Dumbledore is so deeply insane that he killed Tom Riddle when he was young and assumed his identity. He used Tom Riddle to create this alternate Persona that he could use to make himself look better. After Dumbledore had taken care of Grindelwald, he lived in a world where everyone was asking him ‘what have you done for me lately?' All heroes need a villain, and Dumbledore's split personality became His Own Worst Enemy.

After Ron's death, Harry becomes deeply traumatized. Since I am a smut writer, of course the answer was going to be freaky sex with a bunch of witches, because everyone knows that a harem is the perfect antidote for soul-crushing grief. Ron's murder sets up an initial Harry/Ginny and later Hermione, Luna and Pansy jump on the pile because Blonde, Brunette, Redhead and Raven are ‘the four food groups' haha. I was also going to include a will reading, the Full Goose Bozo of Lord-Potter-Peverell-Black, Harry's bound magical core and helpful goblins.

“The power that the Dark Lord knows not” Actually turns out to be freaky ritual group sex with Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Luna and Pansy all making a freaky sex pile and using the energy to grow stronger.

I can't believe I actually wrote this summary. I hate myself. I am deeply ashamed. My brain needs a shower, and probably yours as well.

** Not gonna lie the dark!harry trope is something that I really like as long as its well written and has a decent plot and doesnt have the even more annoying trope of harry being part veela/part elf/ part dragon hybrid with a blocked magical core and all that random shit. Not adverse to Dumbledore bashing but once you've read one of them you've read them all so the trope gets very old. Not what you wanted but just some opinions..
