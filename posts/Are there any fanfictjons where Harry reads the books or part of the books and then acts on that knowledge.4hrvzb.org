Basically, I'm wondering if there are any fanfictions where Harry or somebody else reads the books or parts of the books like the epilogue and then the main part of the story not being Harry reading it but acting on and using that information? Kind of like a foreknowledge time travel fan fiction without time travel.


** linkffn(A Curse of Truth) is an excellent self-insert, where the main character (an OC) has read the books and finds himself in Kings Cross at the start of Year 4.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

*** I don't think A Curse of Truth is that good. Try linkffn(Neville Longbottom and the Harry Potter).

  OC becomes Neville and starts Hogwarts, helping the story characters grow and try to alleviate the extension of the purebloods influence in Hogwarts through a Student Council. More emphasis on minor characters and battles, minimal extra OCs. On indefinite hiatus.

*** Somewhat new. But all of the stories I've found that with reading the books are just about reading the books and the character's reactions are. What I'm looking for is Harry (preferably only a part of it) reading the books and then actually acting and using that knowledge and that is the main part of the story. Preferably, him reading the books would only be the first chapter or so.

*** I've read for years and years, and haven't even seen anything like this. Although, I avoid one shots and stories less than 30k words, so maybe the bulk of them are in there?
