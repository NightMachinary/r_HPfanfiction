If you've followed this subreddit, you know I'm a critical, cynical, and overall cold guy. So I tried my hand at an emotional Christmas one shot about love, told as a children's tale.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10910498/1/The-Tale-of-Sir-Growls][The Tale of Sir Growls]] is the result of this, and I would really like some feedback as this is /way/ outside my comfort zone.


** The strained and random rhyming seemed to distract from the story you were trying to tell. Sometimes it was good and felt like a true children's book, but then became painful to read a moment later.

I would suggest taking out the rhyming entirely, taking the time to make it all rhyme, or making it obvious which sections will rhyme while others will simply tell the story, such as putting the rhymes in italics and at the start of every section. Otherwise it's bound to confuse the reader too much, especially when only part of a paragraph rhymes.

*** I suppose I went a bit over the top with the rhyming / rhythmic nature in certain points. After all the "mature" interpretation is that Sir Growls was just the representation of Snape's more human side, and I wanted to keep that buried as deep as possible (he liked to spoil himself with fish&chips on special occasions, he took to organizing things in order to clear his mind, etc).
