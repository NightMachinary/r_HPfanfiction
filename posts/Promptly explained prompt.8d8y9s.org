So here is my prompt for a haphne fic:

Post war Haphne (Daphne Greengrass x Harry Potter) Dramione (Draco Malfoy x Hermione Granger) Draco and Harry are unspeakable working on improving time turners and tracking down dark necromancers and both Lords of their family names. Daphne is a Lawyer/Manager of her fathers potions ingredients shipping business and Heir Presumptive of Greengrass. Hermione is the transfiguration professor at Hogwarts.

Plot: Draco and Harry go on dangerous missions to track down necromancers and other dark magic users and helps focus on the developing relationships and how much sexual tension and awkwardness there is.

Featuring a reformed Draco and gang and Harry having knowledge of his family's history as one of the sacred 28 and playing the politics game.


** You might want to flair this as a Request. Fic Search is more for finding a specific fic.

Also, I have to ask, what's the reasoning for improving time turners and what's the end goal? Ditto for hunting down dark necromancers. Are these new Unspeakables? Because Unspeakables are usually just thought of as researchers (although some people have made them become something like what you are going for). How does Harry come into contact with Daphne? Is she Draco's friend and does Draco comes across Hermione through being Harry's friend? Where does the awkwardness and tension come from? Are they all a bunch of shy young adults?

To make it interesting you could have Hermione and Daphne both play hard to get. That could have awkwardness and tension ensue. I think this could have potential, you just have to connect all the pieces together in a unique and original way. Good luck.

*** Thank you for your help! It's not really a search, I'm just kinda seeing if anyone had any idea about writing something like this. I've found a few haphne fics but they are all abandoned worse then Chernobyl. Like a commission. I'm a terrible writer, other wise I would write it. If someone were to be interested I would gladly pay. But not many people seem to understand who Daphne is.

From what I read In the books time turners were very finicky and could only go back to a certain time limit. As I have perceived it, Unspeakables do much more than just research like a geeky R&D department, they also are skilled in other areas also. Think like a Navy SEALS type thing, every SEAL has a special type of niche that they are good at, they don't just do one thing. I really want Harry and Draco to do more than just lab research, I want them to have field time with Aurors and mercenaries. I Want them to be the powerful influential people that they are. Lord Malfoy and Lord Potter are very prominent people in wizarding society and I want that to show in everything they do.

With daphne, I really like the idea of a marriage contract. There isn't any other way those two would meet, but I also like the idea of them meeting through one of Draco's party's. I like daphne to have that mysterious, cold, almost icy persona, but once Harry gets to know her, she warms up. I want them to have that attraction that pulls the reader in and makes them yearn for more and that is where the awkwardness stems from.

**** Well Daphne is pretty much up for interpretation since the books don't cover her at all. Most authors that have written her portray her as "mysterious, cold, and with an almost icy persona". To make the story different and refreshing to readers you could have her as a warmer person, one that breaks her "ice mask" after graduating Hogwarts. Once again, if you want tension you can have her be playful and flirtatious with Harry (who is clueless and feels awkward because he doesn't know if she likes him or not). As for the time turners, they were all broken in the 5th book so you would either have to change part of history's past or have someone make new ones (both are options). Also, you'll have to have a reason as to why you want people to have access to the past.

For the Unspeakables, I have seen 2 or 3 fics were they are portrayed as the fighting type but I can't remember the fics names. (I will post to see if I can get the names of the fics and get back to you on it).

Marriage contracts are done a lot and the meeting at a party could work. One idea I thought of is that you could have Harry go to buy potion ingredients to make a small, less potent, dose of wolfsbane for Harry's godson Teddy (who let's just say gets slightly more upset at full moon). Then you could have Harry and Draco using their political sway to get more rights for werewolves (with the help of Hermione who sees Draco in a better light) seeing that Harry's Godson and Draco's quasi nephew is half werewolf. Just a thought.
