Taure brought this up in my other thread and now I'm interested in fics like this to.

So yeah, basically fics that take place while Harrys at Hogwarts but with little of him and bigger focus on other students going on similar (or not) adventures and solving mysteries.


** Goldstein maybe ? He has virtually no contact with Harry. The main mystery he has to crack so far is how to combine being a observant Jew and learning Magic. Linkffn(10847788)

  What's a nice Jewish boy like Anthony doing at Hogwarts? Well, for starters, his name isn't really Anthony. Winner of the Fanfiction Booker's Prize 2014. Year One complete.

** Would be interesting to see some sort of Monster of the Week thing going on with side students, a la Buffy or Gravity Falls. The Golden Trio still have their big adventure, but there's minimal interaction between the two groups.

*** Yes! This, with the Weasly Twins or something. Their bigger pranks could actually be their way out dealing with the Monster of the Week!

Only, they're in contact with the golden trio, so yeah...

** The best fanfic I ever read was Bullseye by Ohyeah100! It's basically the books, but from the perspective of Astoria Greengrass, and while she bumps into Harry and the gang from time to time, it primarily focuses on her own experiences and delves into pureblood culture, romance, ethics, and dealings with goblins amongst other things. It is as well written as it is long (something like 500k words long last time I checked), and while it isn't completed or updated particularly quickly, the chapters are long and usually by the time I finish (re)reading it there's another new chapter added.

I think the last time I read it, she was up to the summer after 4th year, but it's been a while since I read it. Again, it is long, but it is so worth the time and energy, it's really something special

#+begin_quote
  A mystery lurks at the heart of Hogwarts castle. A tangled web of lies and subterfuge that is so deep, so all encompassing, that only a mind as unique as Luna Lovegood's could ever hope to perceive it. Together, Luna Lovegood and her trusty partner Sue Li must uncover the truth: Who took the electrical outlets in Hogwarts, and how is this keeping Professor Binn's employed?

** Bit late to the party but [[https://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=329137][Year Five]], Fits the bill, set during book 1 but has nothing to do with the events of it, I don't even think Harry is ever in it beyond mentions, because the four OCs don't give a toss about him. Really well written, It's one of the best fics of this type iv read.
