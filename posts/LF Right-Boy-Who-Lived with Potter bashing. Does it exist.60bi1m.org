I know WBWL Potter bashing exists. James and Lily hate Harry because his sibling is important and he's not. Are there any stories where Harry is the BWL, and James and Lily are still jerks to him?

Slash, bashing, crossovers and dark!Harry are fine. Please no harems, genderbending, smut/romance-focused plot, mpreg or pottercest. Thank you!

*** This fic fits the recommendation probably the most, though there is less bashing from James and Lily and more from everyone else, but read the fic yourself... it's great and it's a oneshot, so [[https://media.giphy.com/media/jndc0TQq9fvK8/giphy.gif][just do it]].

  Lily and James Potter come out of hiding so their son Alexander could fulfill the prophesy and defeat Voldemort. Things don't go as planned though, as they returned to the Wizarding World in 1999.

** linkffn(Strange Reflections by LeQuin) is not exactly what you're looking for but still fits decently. James, Lily, Harry and Iris Potter from an alternative dimension gets transported into post DH canonverse. The two Potter families does not get along.

** There was a time travel one I read recently, but cannot recall their names. Harry aged 28 discovers them alive, as well as Dumbledore, and is so mad, he does a risky time travel ritual he and Luna created. It was canon compliant, but no JS, AS, LL, and I don't think Rose or Hugo, Ginny was a cheat, Ron died playing pro Quidditch, Weasleys blamed Hermione even tho she was on other side of world, Hermione ends up moving to Australia.

Harry in the past tells Snape early on Lily is alive, with proof. Unfortunately, full of a lot of magical aura stuff, goblin friends, Dark, Light, and Gray magic, and Harry having to pretend to be a genius. He also has an alter ego mainly from just changing his aura.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)
