*** At some point some removed a comment about the op's being more story friendly. That may be true because of the inherent deadliness.

However Stormbringer fits the worm story well.

Taylor is left longer in the locker and her cuts become infected or she is phased into the toxins. As she is dying Stormbringer finds her and because of her physical frailty but mental strength is reminded of Elric. Stormbringer offers to allow her to be a wielder.

Stormbringer was created to kill Chaos Gods. Zion causes conflict (chaos) to find a way to prevent heat death (again this is Chaos fighting Order) Taylor agonizes over choosing who to kill to keep her healthy but gradually builds to the level she can kill the endbringers. This would be the bulk of the story. Her moral dilemmas and hunting kill orders. If you want a lung scene then she only manages to nick him and flees before Armsmaster so she isn't charged with murder. Her guilt over that kill would haunt her, but it would also build months of health. Finally after she kills Zion we don't even need Contessa to double tap her since Stormbringer will kill her just like Elric.

Overall that probably follows to closely to Worm, like Goodkind/Tolkien. I just tossed it out there to show how similar the stories could be.

***** Sorry, totally my bad. I read both fandom's and was reading a worm one when I got the notification email about Stormbringer being a bad fit, so I just immediately went there.

‚Äã

For HP, that comment was likely right. Mr I'll give more second chances than I have names would NEVER allow Harry to keep such a horrific blade (worse than dementors), so either you kill Dumbledore right off the bat or it's over.

‚Äã

Potentially you could say that it eating Harry's horcrux or the diary would allow it to eat them all and get rid of the original plot right off the back. That leaves you free to go wherever you want without the stupid hunt.

I could easily see Dumbledore tossing Harry into Azkaban. Might be an interesting plot point to make the Dementors another way the various brothers of Stormbringer can manifest. Or maybe Stormblade teleports itself to Harry and he kills all the dementors with it.

‚Äã

To keep Harry from tossing it away, it is of course going to not only restore him to the health he should have, but also greatly enhanced. And maybe the basilisk still bit him, but Fawkes wouldn't heal him because the phoenix could feel the evil of the blade. Then you have a sword that would let Harry live even with the poison, but he can never let it go or he dies.

‚Äã

Just some random ramblings.

‚Äã

In any event Stormbringer has much more history and background, than something created for a movie or a MMRPG.

** While we're looking at awesome swords to pull out of hats, let me just recommend Nightblood. Should work quite well for destroying horcruxes (or anything else really) at the cost of the wielder's life - although perhaps you can work around that with Magic. Also, it talks!

** I've wanted Harry to pull the alternative version of The Witchblade from the Hat, Excalibur. Like in the story of The Witchblade it's created as a truce between the Light and the Darkness (Like in the Beginning their was Darkness... Let there be Light) and thus the Witchblade is a balance between the two. Excalibur would be a natural extension of it the Yin to the Witchblade's Yang

** How do you even explain that, tho? The hat doesn't just poop out swords. The Sword of Gryffindor was specifically entrusted to his charge so it could be wielded by Hogwarts chosen one to defend it when it was required.
