** Silvers Rayleigh from One Piece, even if it'd hilariously trivialise everything.

"Avada Kedavra" yelled Voldemort, but Harry just tilted his head slightly, letting the green bolt fly past it casually "Avada Kedavra!" a slight sidestep, and Harry once again avoided the curse. "You know, I can do this all day" yawned Harry, dodging dozens of Curses without effort.

"KILL HIM!" ordered Voldemort. "Avada Kedavra!" all of the Death Eaters fire, but Harry skillfully weaves out of the way of each curse. "It's Slow" he mocks, before his eyes turn serious, and with a sudden wave of force, only Voldemort is left standing.

"Game over Voldemort. Looks like you'll need to find a new Body. Armament Hardening!" Harry punches through Voldemort's skull with a burst of speed and a blackened fist, before executing all of the downed Death Eaters. "Distasteful, but no one can prove it was me, and they're enemy combatants that will just resurrect him again" he sighs, before touching the Cup.

Dumbledore when alone later. "So Haki is the Power mentioned in the Prophecy" he contemplated aloud.

** Chief Jim Hopper, Stranger Things. Mostly because I've randomly got a want for Harry Potter/Stranger Things crossovers. Poor Hopper, first a psychic girl and then a magic boy. Just can't find a normal kid, can he?

You'd have to reshuffle the timeline a bit to make it work (ST is in the 80's and HP is 90's from memory), but I think it'd lead to some fun moments of Harry fighting monsters, learning his powers as he went, etc, etc.

Also: "You're a wizard Eleven". I want this.

** Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden is the only valid answer. "Harry and Harry, Wizard Buddy Cops!"

Otherwise...

Bruce Wayne. I've a soft spot for "Orphans raised by the rich and powerful" fics, plus...magic Batman!

Doctor Stephen Strange. Raised by the Sorcerer Supreme, Harry grows up fighting magical threats greater than Tom Riddle every day.

Tyrion Lannister. Manipulative, snarky, and kind-hearted Harry Potter has Westeros dancing on his puppet strings.

** The Mighty Nein from Critical Role - Their experiences with Kiri were adorable and terrifying and hilarious.

Post-Change Revan from Star Wars KOTOR - Her being a parent would be utterly delightful, especially if the rest of the crew like Mission got involved.

Pretty much anybody from the Sunless Sea/Fallen London universe - they're Stereotype Victorian English people living in a world of Lovecraftian steampunk terrors. What about that doesn't scream healthy child-rearing environment?

47 from the Hitman Universe - This would just be an excuse to write a mercenary Harry fic.

Post-Directorship Jesse Faden from Control - I just really like the universe and I think giving Hierarchy-responsibility Jesse some parental responsibility after what happened with Dylan could be a fun development for both her and Harry.

Someone from the Autodale series by Dead Sound - post-apocalyptic fics are always fun and Harry living in the overly machine-ran happy-times-dystopia of Autodale would be a great 'breaking out of the machine' story.

Bob and Mo from The Laundry Files by Charles Stross - Any excuse to write a Lovecraft fic is great, but add in British Humour and the stymieing nature of byzantine bureaucracy and the civil services' dedication to Quality Practice would be great. Have them run into the Unspeakables too. Hilarity ensues.

A character from Darkest Dungeon - Mostly because I love Lovecraft and the idea of Harry being raised in a constant battle against the Eldritch could be fun (think Bloodborne meets Dark Mirror). '

The Changing God from Numenera - The idea of Harry being raised by a selfish tinkerer who's obsessed with, well, spoilers, but it's appropriate stuff given some of the fanfic explorations around here, is terribly thematically appropriate.

Lara Croft - I enjoy a good adventure fic and this fandom needs more curse-breaking, globetrotting archaeology fics (I know this basically exists with Petunia, Tomb Raider, but I want more, damnit!)

Carmen Sandiego and her team - Same reason as Lara Croft, only for thievery instead of archaeology.

Q from Star Trek - Shenanigans. 'nuff said.

Jonathon Strange and Mr Norrell - The magic views in this book are fun, especially if you could make them Muggles developing the ability separate from the Ministries, but these two co-parenting a child is about as nightmarish as Crowley and Aziraphale.

Crowley and Aziraphale - again, Shenanigans. 'nuff said.

Granny Weatherwax - Everyone needs a bit of headology and Harry more than most. I know this exists in Wyrd Son and more, but I want more, damnit! :)

Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks - This would be hilarious. I can totally imagine youngster Harry trying to be like his FBI agent dad and talking in a tiny little voice about coffee. Totez Adorbz, as the kids say these days.

The Room and the Objects from The Room - I know neither are technically sentient, but The Occupant is a sentient object and I like the idea of the whole shebang adding together in some weird way to raise a Harry slightly divorced from reality - though with amiable alimony payments and alternate weekends with the dog. :)

Minsc and Boo from Baldur's Gate - Again, this exists already, but I want to see more. They're brilliant and a Harry raised by them is brilliant.

A Doctor from Theme Hospital/Two Point Hospital - 'cause why the fuck not?

Glados - Again, I know this exists, but more please.

Gnarl and the Minions from Overlord games - This could be a fun 'Dark Lady Tonks' sort of approach to Evil Harry.

Harry Dread from The Last Hero - Again, a fun approach to evil from a guy who basically obeys the Evil Overlord list if it were the opposite of everything on the Evil Overlord list and designed to play the 'traditional villain' role.

Cohen the Barbarian from The Last Hero - Same as Harry Dread, only for being a traditional barbarian hero instead of a villain.

Garret from the Thief series - Shenanigans and fun stealy times! What's not to love about that idea.

The Narrator from the Bard's Tale or the Narrator from the Stanley Parable - I like the idea of Harry being raised by a benevolent, near-omnipotent designer and describer of reality that's quite human at the same time.

I can probably come up with more, but I think that's enough for tonight.

****** Or makes them be that way. I love the idea of them finding out about the Ministry and going "Right. That's where we'll send the idiots. They'll fit right in, based on these reports. Can these magical people even spell?" and just sending over all the 'dead weight' that fills desks and doesn't do much otherwise in an attempt to keep them occupied. Said dead weight doesn't really make much note of the new environment and keeps asking wizards where the printer is. :D

*** The Thornberries from The Wild Thornberries - Mostly because this would be like a cross between Harry being raised by the Lovegoods and the Weasleys and that is delightful in the extreme.

The Finches from What Remains of Edith Finch - They were a tragic bunch and so were the Potters in their own way. It might be nice for the remnants to bond together. Also a fix-it fic where they don't all get fucked by life would be cute too.
