This year has been so difficult and draining for everyone, and I wanted to create something to lift people's spirits as they finish out 2020 and get ready to leave this awful year behind....

So naturally I built a Harry Potter choose your own adventure game!

Hoping this can serve as a nice little 1-30 minute (depending on what choices you make) quarantine distraction as you're relaxing over the holidays. Designed for kids and adult fans as well ;-)

** This is so clever!

I had a problem with the wands.

I wish there were pics of them to help us choose which one to use. Also when you try to cast spells with the kids, if you choose 1 or 2, you get a choice to choose again, but whatever I choose next sends me to the sad ending waking up in my room, forgetting about magic.

I had to play through everything all over again, only made the right choice the third time!

** It's a bit bizzare how the choices that lead to wizarding are the choices that would most likely get you molested.

Still, solid bit of content, good job!
