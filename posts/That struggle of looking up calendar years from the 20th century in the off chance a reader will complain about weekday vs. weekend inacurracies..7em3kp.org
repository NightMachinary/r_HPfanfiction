**** On a more random note, I am using a particular explanation for the value of galleon that has me checking gold and silver prices in 1980s and 1990s on occasion when I try to write something.

****** You mean the thing with gold and silver prices for the value of galleon? I have no idea if I am the only person who came up with it or not, but my theory is based on a few things:

- At some point, one Pound was worth exactly one pound of silver (fact; this is why it was called a “Pound”)
- The wizards did not notice when Pound got a set value instead because their economy and the muggle economy are too separate (educated guess)
- The Galleons are charmed to not be seen as gold by muggles (just a guess)

With those three, we have one point of reference: the Grangers bought Galleons (not exchanged Pounds for them, but bought them) at 5 Pounds per 1 Galleon, in August 1992. Now, going with the exchange rates, one ounce of silver cost 2,052 Pound back then, and with 80 ounces to 5 pounds that gives us the cost of 1 Galleon being 164,16 Pound. Now, the price of gold at the same time was 5,962 Pound per gram, meaning that assuming 24-carat gold and that there was no mark-up you would be able to buy 27,53 grams of gold for that much, and assuming something like 25% mark-up (seems tame for the goblins) it'd only be able to buy a coin that weighted 22 grams. For reference, Triple Unite, the biggest coin historically used by the English, weighted 27,3 gram.

It does, to me at least, feel like a nice theory that leaves gold coins worth as much as gold coins would actually be worth, the wizards' crooked economy aside, while at the same time not changing what we already know from the books.

And if you mean the site that I am using for this, bullionbypost.co.uk; I think I either used a different site at one point or knew some magic of this site that I now forgot, but for month-by-month tracking it's fine.

*** Would really like to see such schedule, if every teacher teachers two houses at a time for 3 hours(1 single and 1 double) a week for every year(7 year for the core courses).

That would be 7 (years) X 2(2 houses at a time) X 3 (3 classes every week)

That should be 42 hours per week for a teacher to teach.

Meaning if you teach 8 hours per weekday 8 X 5 = 40. It will not be enough to teach the whole school. So I assume there is 9 hours per day for school for the students.

This is of course if 1 period is 1 hour, if you make it 50 minutes and 10 minutes of break, it still round up to a hour. So it takes up a lot of time for a teacher to teach the whole school.

**** Look up the information, All first-years at Hogwarts must take seven core subjects: Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, History of Magic, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Astronomy and Herbology. Flying lessons (on broomsticks) are also compulsory. Flying is the only one of these that is dropped upon entry into second year.

At the end of their second year at Hogwarts, students are required to choose a minimum of two additional subjects from the following list: Arithmancy, Muggle Studies, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes and Care of Magical Creatures. Students cannot elect to drop any of the core subjects at this time.

This means the 7 core subjects will take up 7 X 3, 21 hours of their time in a week. Even if they take all the electives, 5 X 3, 15 hours for elective, that is only 36 hours per week. So for a student to need a time turner because to attend all the classes, a subject needs more than 3 hours a week to be a burden, but then how are the teachers suppose to teach all of them if it is more than 3 hours per class? Even with 4 hours per class, it will still be 56 hours per week, meaning more than 11 hours per weekday for a teacher.

Time turners aren't needed because you ran out of hours. They're needed because there's no way to get the set of classes you want without signing up for things that meet at the same time.

Also, most students don't have to use time turners. Hermione is unusual. So it's not like they have to create more class sections because of all the time traveling students filling them up.

****** That said, it kind of makes one wonder. I mean, assuming three hours per subject, with NEWT-level classes being all-year rather than limited to certain houses, that gives us 36 hours per each normal teacher and 24 hours per each teacher of an elective subject. It's hard to believe that anyone halfway competent in making schedules would fail at making it all work properly.

I'll go ahead with conspiracy theories and say that the schedule was botched on purpose, leaving only Hermione stranded, so that with the threat of Sirius Black they'd be able to get the ministry to give them a time turner that would then be close to Harry's hands should there be a need for it.

**** Don't forget the class drops after OWLS. Idk about more popular/mainstream classes, but it was specifically mentioned that Harry's NEWT Potions class contained all 4 houses in one section. Maybe something popular like Charms would still need to be split into two groups, but a lot of them wouldn't. AFAIK, there are no "core" classes after OWLS, you take 1. what you want to take, and 2. what you're allowed to take. Neville wasn't allowed to take Transfiguration, and it's mentioned that his grandmother didn't make it into Charms.
