Well I'm not looking for a beta per we, just someone to bounce ideas off of for a fic I want to write.

Basically the premis of the story is Harry and Hermione are sorted into ravenclaw.

I know red flag right away right? Let me explain.

Things I want for this fic is not a child prodigy, and not a Harry who rushes into battle without thinking about the dangers and consequences. Of course Harry could still be in Gryffindor without doing those things, but I also wanted to be a tad different from Canon.

It was pointed out to me that Ravenclaws are probably the worst house for a protagonist, but I want to challenge that, not to mention play with ravenclaw characters, the common room etc.

Also blood purity isn't as much of a thing as is fear of muggles (their numbers and evolving technology.) And because of this some wizards, like Voldemort obviously, who doesn't fear muggles but wants to use the fear, to strike now and secure their place above muggles and rule over them or eradicate them.

Harty instead of going to live with the dursleys instead goes to live with remus. Also creature laws are much harsher. Werewolves/veela/goblins etc. are forbidden to use wands.

This will hopefully not be anything like canon. That's the ultimate goal. Of course some Canon years and events will still happen.

Anybody who's interested in reading the story once i start to publish please follow

I think that's how you link an account not sure tbh

Anybody who thinks they could help me as I've only been reading for a few months and this will be my first attempt at writing please pm me eithier on here or fanfiction.net

Edit: as of right now I got a good outline of the first 5 years.
