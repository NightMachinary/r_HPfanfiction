I would like to read something where someone displays musical talents from a wonderful singing voice to playing an instrument. Preferably where the fic stays within the realm of cannon. If there's a divergent, let it be a gradual realistic growth.

Also, keep romances at a minimum.

Thank you in advance.

*** In canon, all three of Harry, Ron, and Hermione are able to play musical instruments. (Harry plays the flute in book 1 to make Fluffy go to sleep. Hermione knows piano and teaches Ron to play FÃ¼r Elise one Christmas.)

Lupin playing piano does not seem a stretch.

** I think there's a couple of stories that have Hermione being able to play the piano, based on the scene from the Deathly Hallows movie. They're minor in scope though, it's only there for the romance between Ron and Hermione.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen]] has Hermione play violin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11752324/1/Limpieza-de-Sangre]] has female Voldemort play violin.

Neither is canon compliant, however.

** I read a fic some time ago (that I couldn't finish but I don't remember what stopped me) where Harry was a good singer and sometime his singing, and even more if singing in pair with Ginny (they may be a soul bond involved), was having effects on the world around them.

For example they sang Blue Suede Shoes and got assorting shoes for it.
