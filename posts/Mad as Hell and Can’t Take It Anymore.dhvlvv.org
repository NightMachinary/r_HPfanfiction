I've attempted to take in stride the unconscionable errors of grammar and syntax that pervade even the best authors' fanfiction. However, I have found that, if I read one more sentence in which the word ‘breath' is used as a VERB, I'll likely stick a fork in my eye, or at the very least, flush my phone down the toilet.

I realize that certain words in the English language confuse people. These words will not reveal themselves during a typical spell check, nor perhaps during a full SPaG (spelling, punctuation and grammar) check. A beta reader may not realize the misuse of some words, in the context of a story. But for the love of god, please, authors, figure this shit out!

Here are my major pet peeves with respect to this topic: --- “Breathe” is a verb. “Breath” is a noun. One does not ‘breath'; one breathes. Conversely, I won't hold my ‘breathe' that a beta'd fic will contain a scene in which Umbridge ‘breaths' heavily into Voldemort's ear hole. ---“Past” and “passed” are not synonymous. I did not walk ‘passed' you in the hallway; I walked past you. Harry did not ‘past' a note to Hermione; he passed a note to her. After 19 years have passed, fucking Fanfic will likely continue to state that Harry never ‘past' his NEWTS.

I have noticed these errors in the fics of respected, prolific authors who should know better. And it's annoying af.

Has anyone else noticed these errors? Do you point them out to fic writers? Should I?

*** I've actually noticed that non-English speaking fanfic writers are often much, much better in the areas of spelling, punctuation, grammar, etc., and I suppose it's because, in many non-English speaking places, English is studied comprehensively, in school. I have been amazed at the capability of these writers! A great example is “Nights of Gethsemane” by kibatsu. It's very intense and tightly plotted. And impeccably written.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10178294/chapters/22606751][Nights of Gethsemane]]

** Yeah, so, maybe you should take a break from fic and visit a library.

I'm not saying that the breath/breathe thing doesn't make me wince every time I see it, but if simple spelling errors bother you enough to rant about it like this, maybe you need to reevaluate if it's worth it for you to read fic at all.

Because individual fanfiction authors improve all the time, but fanfiction as a whole is /always/ going to be poorly edited.

The man literally said individual authors can improve, and you've made an entire thread complaining about the lack of quality in five /in general/.

The /vast majority/ of fanfiction will /always/ be, on average, of shit-tier editing quality because of the low bar of entry. If this isn't a trend you've noticed, you've probably subconsciously learned to filter those results out. IE: Most favorites, etc.

** Grammar errors are not in my opinion the worst problem of fanfiction stories (and yes, English is a second language to me, so I may be not sufficiently sensitive to it), but the length of the stories. Every story I have read in the last couple of years (with exception of few one-shots) would get better if it was severely cut down in size, most of them at least in half, and many a way more. And that includes even stories from really good authors like Northumbrian or White_Squirrel.

*** cepima, I adore your perspective! I was reading some fanfic recently and thinking about the /wordiness/ of the story. For example, instead of writing, “Harry finally got a new pair of glasses” (this is something that I love in fanfics!), the person wrote something like, “At last, having suffered for years due to Aunt Petunia's failure to seek out the services of a decent ophthalmologist in the vicinity of Little Whinging, the raven-haired first-year was able to purchase for himself a pair of new spectacles which complemented his emerald orbs quite nicely.” I totally get the appeal of sentence #2, but is that truly the best way to convey the information to readers? I have always read that writers should “show, not tell.” So instead of writing this sentence, the writer could perhaps describe Harry's experience at the eye doctor's appointment? I hope I'm making a point that you were thinking of, when you wrote your comment. I would love to know more about your thoughts! Thank you for taking the time to comment, and to really make me use my brain!

**** That's the one problem, but other (and I know it very well from my own experience when writing) the author apparently came with nice idea, short story, some kind of magic or whatnot, and he/she couldn't resist to write it down even though it brings absolutely nothing to the plot development. Or she (I suppose, the author is a girl/woman) starts to describing beautiful robes the heroine brought up for the event. Or of course, the author includes long pieces of gratuitous smut. It doesn't bring anything to the story, just buries it under a lot of unnecessary stuff. I wrote a longer [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][blogpost]] about it.

One example is (otherwise excellent story by probably the best fanfiction author I know about) linkao3(Friends and Foes by Northumbrian). The first four chapters are absolutely unnecessary. Literally, if the story started with the fifth chapter as it is, without changing a word, it would work as well (it is very common, but not that bad start of the police investigation story, that the policeman is waken up by the phone in the middle of the night). Northumbrian just fallen in love with Harry & Ginny arriving to the Privet Drive on a bike, scene with Dudle in his belowed Newcastle, or lovely Easter in The Burrow, and some more of the fun stuff. Nice fluff, which has absolutely nothing to bring to the story. And even that is too long (one and half chapter for Harry & Ginny to step down from a bike!).

When the story finally starts, it is very good (everybody just have to love Bobbie Beadle!), but it is too bloody long (and unfinished, but that's another problem).

***** I think some writers, exactly as you said about Northumbrian in your comment above, have fallen in love with their own idea (The Burrow at Easter! Seriously?! In my headcanon, Wizards and witches don't celebrate Christian holidays!! It's just wrong!!). The scene is unnecessary, and the reader doesn't need the information, but they love their idea more than caring about their audience, so there's hundreds of words they could just cut. It's like a Mary Sue scene, instead of a Mary Sue character! You have some wonderful insight about fic writing. I bet you're a Beta reader!

I have to rec you a fic about Witches and Wizards celebrating the way I think is more genuine than what JKR shows in the books. Please read it, and send me a message with your impressions of the story!\\
Here's the link (AO3): [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11671674]]. The fic is “Blessed Be” by flitterflutterfly.

****** Being a Christian myself, I don't feel there is anything wrong with wizards and witches celebrating Easter. Perhaps during the heights of the witch-hunts there was a little love for the Christianity among magicals, but I think continuous influx of Muggle-born wizards and witches (and outright Muggles married into the magical world) blunted this hatred, and it is my head-canon there is at least a group of traditionally Christian families living in the magical world.

****** BTW, concerning your non-Christian wizards: both Dumbledores and Potters have a citation from the New Testament on their grave. I don't think that quite common dreaming about pagan rituals among wizards and witches has any support in the canon. JKR is (perhaps a wee lukewarm, I heard, true) a practicing Christian herself, member of the Church of Scotland.
