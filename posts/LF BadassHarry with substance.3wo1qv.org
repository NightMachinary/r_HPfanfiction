badassery is more character than it is a "power level", with that said any stories out there that have Harry as a force to be reckon with and not some OP level 9000 war-mage. Again, when it comes to a badass character, characterization is just as important as power. one doesn't necessarily have to be overpowered for one to be considered a badass. A Harry that's determined, intimidating, analytical/cunning and take's absolutely no F**** is more badass than a harry who has nigh-unlimited magic core.

Story can take a back seat to this but that doesn't mean it should be left to poor writing, while the story doesn't need to be awe-inspiring, but make it so that it's at least decent.

Prime examples of what I'm looking for are stories like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/1/Deprived][deprived by The Crimson Lord]](really wish Author finished this one) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766604/1/What-We-re-Fighting-For][What We're Fighting For by James Spookie]](I /really/ love this one and is probably one of my all time favorites). and as you can see by my examples, I'm a sucker for a good romance.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magics-of-the-Arcane][Magics of the Arcane]] is pretty good I think. It might have a bit of that level 9000 warmage thing going on, but most of the other main characters are either just as badass or close to his level in some respect. (most of the Order of the Phoenix people are actually bamfs, Diggle is incredible with surveillance and mind magic, Bill can use ancient curses as well as he can break them and Molly is a Runes master)

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** I tend to write a Harry who's good in a fight, with some romance. How good he is depends on how old/experienced he is in the story.

In "Harry Potter and the Spygirl", he starts out as the canon Harry at the battle of the Ministry, and gets more training. Definitely a force to be reckoned with at the end.

In "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution", he starts out as a veteran of the War against Voldemort, though most of the fighting is done by other characters.

In "Uncle Quentin's Spy", Harry gets training as a Watcher after his fourth year, and ends up competent and crucial for the war, though the "main badass" of that story is Dumbledore.

In "Patron", he starts in an alternate fourth year, and has since then (2 years) grown into a competent wizard able to hold his own in battles with more experienced wizards, though I'd not call him a badass yet.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
