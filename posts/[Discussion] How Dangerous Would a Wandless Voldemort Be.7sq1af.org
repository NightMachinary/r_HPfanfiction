We know he can fly and Apparate, and he could already perform complex wandless magic as a child (wandless, wordless Imperius and Cruciatus). But where would you place the limit? Could he cast a Killing Curse or a Blasting Curse or a Fire-Making Spell without his wand?


** I don't think he was throwing around Imperius and Cruciatus Curses wandlessly as a kid. You would kinda need the incantation for that. It's more likely he just had some innate control of magic that he could manipulate to his will, causing him to perform magic similar to the Imperius or something painful, but not to such a degree as that of the actual curses.

*** Yes, when I said "wandless Imperii and Cruciati", I meant his wandless, wordless /approximation/ of the curses, but I presume it was still close enough to the actual curses that using ones or the others would be functionally equivalent against muggles.

** Quote from book 6:

â€˜I can make things move without touching them. I can make animals do what I want them to do, without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me. I can make them hurt if I want to.'

And that was when he was eleven. Nothing fancy, but powerful just the same.

** I think what he did as a child could be a compulsion charm instead of the Imperio same goes for a pain curses instead of a full blown Crucio.

I am sure he can blow stuff up and move things around. Wandless Mindarts like Legilimency is within his power aswell. I always immagined him strong enough to swat away weak spells with a wave of his hand but that could be too strong.\\
I would rule out comlicated spells like the Killing Curse entirely and most other Dark Arts too.

** Well, considering he only dies in the books because of Rowling's weird-ass Wand Lore system, then... immortal?

But not counting that, it'd be almost functionally identical. The only way you separate Voldemort from his wand is with a disarming spell, and if you can hit him with that you can hit him with anything else (i.e. you can't and won't)

*** The idea was that he'd been caught in a magical catastrophe that destroys his wand, in a place where he cannot get another one. Not that he'd lose it in the middle of a duel.

** Well...who knows? Wandless magic doesn't appear enough in canon to make an accurate assessment of how strong it is compared to regular magic.

Based on that Tom could control his magic as a child and that house-elves can effectively use magic without a wand, and that the wiki mentions African/North American groups using wandless magic, it presumably has SOME functionality.

Personally, I'd say...a wandless Voldemort would actually be stronger, but not as fast. For most spells beyond simple charms on objects, he'd have to gesture, sing, dance, make ninja-style hand signs, scream as he charges up an attack, et-cetera. Whereas with a wand he can shoot lasers to do things, which might not match his maximum strength, but would be a lot faster. Does that make sense?

*** True... though I feel that "wandless magic" can mean two different things --- there's the "controlled magic", /Force/-style, that gifted children like Lily and Riddle could do; and then there's actual spellcasting done without a wand, which is what these African and North American groups seem to be using. The latter is what you're referring to and would indeed take hand gestures and incantations and stuff, the former seems to only take willpower and practice.

** Hard to say, as we don't know much about canon wandless magic. He would hardly be defenseless, I think we can say that much from his use of magic as an untrained child at least. Another thing I would look as is what Dumbledore said to Fudge in OotP, about how he could/would escape Azkaban if Fudge arrested him. In such a situation Dumbledore would certainly be wandless, and while he might have just be posturing, he certainly seemed confident. Voldemort is of course of a similar tier to Dumbledore, so I would assume he would be powerful enough to at least escape azkaban.

** It really depends on the version. Like, fuck, I don't know. Probably could do something like a Killing Curse wandlessly.

** I would deem a wandless Voldemort as dangerous as one with a wand for two reasons.

1) Wandless spells does not seem to travel in 'beam' form over distances. They are just willed into being and then, immediately, affect the intended victim. This would lead into them being impossible to block or parry.

2) Voldemort does not use his wand for a lot of spells in the movies and is doing fine. Sure, many of them are 'party tricks', like spewing fire, making a storm of glass shards or controlling lesser minds. But this is still way more impressive than any other wizard. (I don't know if I should count Albus extinguishing some candles as 'impressive' or not.)

**** From the fact that almost every spell cast using a wand has some sort of 'effect' to signal its use.

Some people does seem like they can be cast without the lightshow, but not many.

Wandless magic, in my eyes, appears to function like the force. Meaning, pure domination of will.

Accidental magic is seen as the most common sort of wandless magic. That can be either a focused 'attack' against someone or an 'area of effect' kind of thing.

Dudley and the snake is in my eyes an example of an 'attack'. Harry made the glass disappear so Dudley would fall through.

Marge managed to get Harry angry enough to make the lights flicker. Then became a ballon through an 'attack'.

This is just random speculation. I don't know if I'm right.

***** While I kinda agree on the principles of what you say /here/, where I disagree is on the "instant" thing. I feel like accidental magic, though it is often /invisible/, would travel through space at the same approximate speed as a "normal" spell.

** depends on why he's wandless.

if he's like a squib, unable to use a wand, then he wouldn't have been a student of hogwarts. perhaps he would be a much more badass alternate to Filch? takes the job so he can study in the hogwarts library.
