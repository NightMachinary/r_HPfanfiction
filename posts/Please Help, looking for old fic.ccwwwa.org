:END:
There is a story I read once where Harry has left the wizarding world before the war. He gave birth to twins, and was famous in the muggle world. I think Snape found him, on a beach flying a kite with the twins.


** He gave birth or fathered twins?

*** I am pretty sure he gave birth to the twins. Also Lucius was after the twins.
