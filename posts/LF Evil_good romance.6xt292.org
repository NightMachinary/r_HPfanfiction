Looking for romance between people from different sides, but with no redemption of the evil or corruption of the good, so to speak. They hate each other for what the other stands for but can't help but love them nonetheless. At some point they end up hurting each other, or evening killing. So their relationship is of a fucked up, abusive, love/hate kind. I imagine Eden by obsessmuch is a bit like that, but it's been awhile since I've read it, so I am not sure.

I have been listening to "What Have You Done Now" by Within Temptation and it gave me a craving to read something like it. Will take any pairing as long as the writing is good. Or even any literature/movie/tv show with this premise. Thanks!

** I've hated every iteration of Draco I've ever read so you won't find any of that bullshit in here. There are only a couple of slash fics I've ever liked and neither fit the criteria so none of that either.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11752324/1/Limpieza-de-Sangre][Limpieza de Sangre]] Harry x Fem!Voldemort. Tad weird and creepy but it's fun. No real romance so far but it's pretty clearly heading that way.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12297993/1/Solve-the-Riddle][Solve the Riddle]] Time Travel, Harry x Fem!Voldemort. They're roughly the same age in this one so it's a little less creepy.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's in the past. There is no 'Lord' Voldemort. However, if he expects things to be easier just because he's older and Riddle's younger, he's going to be sorely disappointed. Harry's never been one for giving up, but neither has Riddle, and as they both are forced to work together- in more ways than one- the stakes slowly change. [Time travel, Dimensional travel, fem!Riddle]
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6031176/1/Tied-for-Last][Tied for Last]] Teenish!Riddle x Hermione. Easily my favorite of this pairing. Only one I've really been able to enjoy to be honest with you. Riddle isn't whitewashed and I really liked that about it.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione is killed by Voldemort, and is now dead. Well, sort of. Turns out that death is a little more complex than she knew... Ignores epilogue and last 50ish pages of DH.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11603096/1/Carnivore][Carnivore]] Riddle x Hermione

#+begin_quote
  Tom returns to the orphanage during the summer before his seventh year, to find that there is a new resident. An interesting and curious resident, with frizzy hair and no memory of her life before coming to Wool's do to a terrible attack. A resident who can perform magic, though she has forgotten how. No matter. He can teach her. One Shot.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11452361/1/His-Persephone][His Persephone]] Riddle x Hermione

#+begin_quote
  When the world is coming to an end and all hope seems lost, Dumbledore has a rather unusual request for Hermione. "1943? And you'd like me to...kill Tom Riddle?" Dumbledore shook his head, that annoying twinkle glowing thrice as bright as before. "No, my dear. I'd like you to join him." Full Summary inside. An interesting take on time travel.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2896398/1/Only-Enemies][Only Enemies]] Harry x Bellatrix. Only good Evil Bella x Harry I've ever found that wasn't just a lemon. It's a dimension travel from an AU to an AU. You know that whole manipulative Dumbledore trope? This fic has pretty much everyone in any sort of position of power plotting in different directions. Lots of ancient family magic stuff. It's hilarious.

#+begin_quote
  In the aftermath of the Final battle a misplaced spell sends HP and Bellatrix to an alternative world. It holds everything each of them have lost to the war and yet they find themselves inexorably drawn back to each other. HPBella done right.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6245561/1/][The Lies that Bind]] Harry x Daphne. It's my second favorite one of that pairing.

#+begin_quote
  In the midst of his sixth year, Harry rescues Daphne Greengrass from an unpleasant fate. While innocent affection grows, a shadow has been cast into the Chosen One's life that might herald him down a darker path. A path his own actions may yet create.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]] Harry x Daphne. My favorite one of them. Post Hogwarts. It reverses the usual order of things here. Daphne's a relatively nice person Harry's a scumbag using a marriage contract to her to further his political ambitions.

#+begin_quote
  In which pureblood tradition doesn't always favor the purebloods.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][The Dark Prince]] Eventual Harry x Ginny. Fun series about Harry being kidnapped instead of attacked and indoctrinated by Voldemort. I linked to the first one which if I remember right has a rewrite going by the same author. No idea which one is better since I haven't read the revised version.

#+begin_quote
  What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? A Dark Harry fanfic. AU Mild HG
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4438449/1/Path-of-Decision][Path of Decision]] Harry x Death (Sandman) Fantastic fic. Easily one of my favorites. Not much knowledge of Sandman/The Endless is needed for this. Most of the fic is him trying to get away from them. Ending is pretty polarizing though. Personally I thought it was great, since it really was what the whole story had been building up to. Lots of people didn't from what I remember though. It's not quite what you're looking for but it sort of is, I guess?

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Warning: This story is weird and not for everyone.
#+end_quote

Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power by Sage Ra: The fucker deleted his account and stories. If you can find a copy of it though it's not quite Evil!Harry but it's at the very least Amoral Harry x Good!OC. Not the greatest fic but still a relatively fun read. Pretty creative from what I remember.

*Edit:*

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2973799/1/][Equal and Opposite]] Harry x Alternate Dimension Fem!Harry. Supposed to be pretty good from what I remember but I haven't actually read it in over a year.

#+begin_quote
  Left bitter and angry when his female self leaves him, Harry decides he will do anything for revenge. Nobody will stand in his way. Because desperation and anger can turn even the most noblest of hearts into darkness... HarryFemHarry COMPLETE
