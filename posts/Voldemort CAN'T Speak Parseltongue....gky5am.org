Voldemort has a secret, one even Dumbledore does not know. By design of course! For, above all things, Tom Riddle was a cunning genius. A wizard of nigh unparalleled skill and power:

...and an absolute nobody.

It was in Slytherin House that he learned: "Heritage trumped all!" Bloodlines and relations dictated how you were treated and what you could accomplish. Thus was the Slytherin way at least. In this new world, his investigations into his own heritage lead to the Gaunt Family, the last known heirs of Slytherin house...

As they had advertised themselves to be, centuries ago...

Sick to his stomach as he learned more and more, his torture and interrogation of his aging, pitiful uncle revealed the Gaunt's were anything BUT related to the dark Founder.

A scam. Cooked up centuries ago, as no one on the isle was a parselmouth, thus no one was able to refute their hisses as anything other than parseltongue. It took very careful compulsions and imperio's but the family was able to create the masquerade that they could communicate with and command the serpents of the world: hence they were descendants of Slytherin.

Though (as much as it could have been) Tom's heart was broken at the realisation, he could work with that. Yes, the Gaunts were paupers and oppurtunits, they'd tricked the wizarding world for fortune and fame (that they'd blown through, effectively, in the generation they recieved it) and were no one of note. But the illegitimate claim to Slytherin was never challenged so no one would ever know he was anything other than what he claimed to be.

There was some pride to be had in *that* at least, it was a cunning and ambition worthy of Salazar.

He traced the final steps of his mother to ensure no holes would be present. And he, like many a pureblood he wished to conquer, he kept to his families traditions and kept up the ruse...

Yet... The Gaunt's trickery may have worked on the British Isles, but he was scoffed at when he attempted to widen his circle of influence into Europe and Asia with the use of his name and "ability".

The Gaunt's were, correctly of course, tarnished with title of 'frauds' by the few who cared for the Founders in mainland Europe. Though none had any proof to the contrary.

Many were, as was the case in Britain, disdainful of the language of the snakes and felt no obligation to rally behind him even if they DID fall for his trick.

It was in Asia, however, where his plot nearly fell through. Nations where parselmouth's (to the surprise of the West) were alive, if rare, and venerated for their abilities. Openly practicing their abilities and magics they developed from it, protected and adored by their communities in most places.

Almost too late for him to silence and escape, Tom was ousted as a hack and he spent much of final days wary of the eyes he had on him from overseas.

But within Britain, everything worked perfectly.

The successor to Slytherin's will and ideals, he branded himself as Slytherin's heir using the Gaunt's tricks and his own power and charisma. His organisation borne of the lie that he was Slytherin's last heir, even after his "demise" in Godric's Hollow.

The only threat to his image came in 1992, where Gilderoy Lockhart decided to form a duelling club for his most loyal and beloved fans. Two schoolboy rivals faced off against one another and the famous Boy Who Lived communed in true parseltongue to the snake he summoned... and his own investigations began coinciding with others...

*/[NOTES: Just from the idea that people can, phonetically, speak parseltongue without understanding it in canon gave me this idea. Also a bit of intrigue on Harry's end as well as the headcanon that parseltongue has a very different reputation in the East]/*


** This is great! It completely overturns an important aspect of Voldemort's characterization, while simultaneously /enhancing/ the character. Not only convincing people he's a pureblood, but also making them believe he's a parselmouth, makes him appear even more cunning, deceptive, and ruthless, than his reputation in canon. Having Harry be, for real, a naturally occurring parselmouth, would further throw existing prejudices into disarray, such as which bloodline is responsible for which qualities of a person, and the importance of bloodlines in general.

The only fly in the ointment would be his control over the basilisk, since that requires both parseltongue and being Slytherin's heir. But I believe anything can be explained away in a fic, with the right preparation.

The short story you wrote to go along with the prompt, was also a pleasure to read.

*** Thank you x The basilisk is the only thing that I'm scratching my head over.

As it stands with Hagrid and the events where it first opened, it's easy. Tom would just fake it.

He'd be theatrical (as he was in canon) and make it seem like the Chamber was opened. He could still kill Myrtle and then blame Hagrid and Aragog. Years on he would, only to his followers, take credit for the event to further legitimise his claim to the house of Slytherin.

Ginny would still get the Horcrux and Tom would use her to wreak havoc on the school as the Heir of Slytherin. Though I don't know what he'd do to students, it wouldn't be petrifying them.

I like to think it's more brutal and leads to a lot more fear and scrutiny towards Harry. Isolating him a lot more from the student body (which would then coincide with him wanting to know more about the ability that was alienating him from his friends and classmates).

However, what I'd love is Ginny still being kidnapped at the end of the year with the same message that she was being taken to the Chamber. Harry, Ron and Lockhart would go down there and Harry would open the Chamber...

BOOM, it's a trap. Ginny/Tom followed Harry down there and intends on trying to take control of the basilisk and force Harry to summon it: he does, Tom can't control it as it only responds to parseltongue not Tom's Imperio, Harry is forced to face off against it. Maybe part way through the battle he realises that he doesn't need to kill it and then uses parseltongue to take control of the basilisk and destroy the diary...

...and the Aurors find Harry James Potter, standing over an unconscious Ginny Weasley with the basilisk at his beck and call...

**** I think that's a great idea. Since Tom's already faking everything in regards to his pedigree, it wouldn't be at all out of character for him, to take credit for something he had nothing to do with, or inflate his accomplishments, since there's no one who could prove otherwise. Myrtle's death was never closely investigated in canon, I think, so an AK would be an easy way to do it (it leaves no marks, hence - no clues). Tom's a student in good standing at the time, so it's his word against Hagrid's. Not only would Hagrid, at the time, be victim of discrimination and have no official support, but he actually /does/ have a dangerous magical creature, that's got no place in a school.

As for Ginny killing students - while being more brutal is certainly an option, it may not be, strictly speaking, necessary. A Basilisk's gaze kills, not petrifies. That every victim in canon saw it through some kind of filter, is such an unlikely sequence of events, as to be equivalent to the author saying "A wizard did it!" Pun very much intended. That Hermione figured out "petrification = basilisk" is also an incredibly illogical conclusion, since, as far as we know, there's literally no precedent for it. Pardon the griping.

The plot to use Harry, to control the basilisk, is also a very Voldemort thing to do (stone from the mirror, resurrection ritual, retrieving the prophecy). I'm very much a fan of Harry having a basilisk, as a kind of familiar. I feel a bit cheated, that his ability to talk to snakes, was not utilized more in canon, even though I'm aware the canon character himself dislikes having it, due to it's connection to Voldemort. Though that could change once he discovers that's not the case, couldn't it?

***** I'd have Dumbledore begin doubting Voldemort's claim to Slytherin's bloodline from then onwards (maybe not just him). Harry would be investigated by the Ministry and would reveal that Tom never opened the Chamber, and revealed that he couldn't all along, which would then snowball into Harry and Dumbledore's own investigation as to where his parseltongue ability actually comes from.

And I absolutely agree, if he found out it wasn't from Voldemort but instead was from his family (especially as he discovers Tom never had it) then I think his opinion on it would change.

On the subject of Ginny, that's the big factor I don't know what to do with. I like the idea of her doing something dark and esoteric to other students as I don't think it Tom would be dumb enough to have her just go about murdering children. The Ministry would have to come down on the school super hard if that happened and I don't think he'd take that risk.

****** Regarding Ginny, I think the easiest solution, would be for her to recreate the events of canon (for the most part). Having random students be petrified and writing in blood showing up on the walls, seemed to properly scare the students and staff, since it's both harmful and mysterious (so you get "dark and esoteric"). Being original with it could prove difficult since you'd need her to do something harmful, mysterious, and, most importantly, /not permanently damaging/. As you've pointed out, the reason events were allowed to go as far as they did, was because petrification was viewed as something, that could be undone, without much harm to the students.

I think whatever you choose to do, would need to cover some criteria:

- It incapacitates - it wouldn't do for the victims to be walking around, living their lives; that would take away from the fear, as well as reveal, potentially, too much information
- It's arcane - if it's uncommon (even if not unheard of), it wouldn't have a ready solution, nor a standard way to handle it. An alternative, off the top of my head, would be to make the victims into a sort of drone/zombie - have them walk around and talk, but completely devoid of a personality, memories or personal attachments; to children (hell, to adults) having some /thing/ walking around with your friend's face, would be highly disconcerting
- It's reversible - as you pointed out, things can't look so dire, as to get the ministry involved

At this point, I admit, I'm starting to hope I see an actual fic, come out of this discussion.

******* My idea was more a sort of temporary mindbreak (somewhere between the Longbottoms and a victim of Cthullu) but it's a "well known" dark curse with a complicated counter. Like you said, the idea is for it to be uncommon enough that the solution isn't readily available but isn't too permanent. Though I really do love your idea of drones walking about and still interacting with everyone in a really creepy way.

I like the idea of students and/or teachers being hit by it and just going mad. Would really amp up the terror factor but be contained enough that Dumbledore and the staff could argue they have it in hand and can treat it (possibly playing it down).

However, before Ginny gets taken I want an Auror team at Hogwarts. They'd be investigating and trying to figure out what is going on, which would convince Tom he needed whatever was in the Chamber to really fight them off (and to dispose of Ginny and Harry). Hence that team would arrive in the Chamber, after it was all over, to arrest Harry.

********* Talking to myself, because I'd like to expand on just what kind of living nightmare that would be.

You remember the scene where Harry spends time with Hermione in the hospital, after she gets petrified? Imagine that, but she and all the other victim make up a dissonant choir, whispering of the horror and the glory that is to come. What's more, Hogwarts has only one nurse, and just one infirmary, meaning - a lot of students are going to get exposed to that, not to mention poor madam Pomfrey.

I guess they would have to be completely oblivious to what they're in for, the kind of hardcore battleaxe that's /made/ for dealing with things like this, or a person that genuinely enjoys dealing with these kinds of problems (and that can range from someone that likes the challenge, to being an absolute psycho (head nurse Bellatrix, hur hur)). On a more humorous note, do you think Dumbledore would have to find a new nurse, in addition to a defence professor every year?

****** You could take this in a different direction by making Ginny a parselmouth. Harry didn't talk to a snake (as far as we know from canon) before his visit to the zoo on Dudley's 11th birthday, so it's plausible Ginny has never talked to one before coming to Hogwarts.
