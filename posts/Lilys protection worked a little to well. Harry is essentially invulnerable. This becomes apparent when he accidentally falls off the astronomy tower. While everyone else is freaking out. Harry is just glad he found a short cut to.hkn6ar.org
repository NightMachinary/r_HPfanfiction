Harry shrugged. "Possibly. My aunt poured drain cleaner down my throat once." Hermione was mortified at the casualness of the statement.

A bright blue streak of light flew over her shoulder and struck Harry in the chest. The impact throwing him over the banister and down several stories where he landed with a wet meaty thud. Draco strolled over the edge and yelled down. "Did it work?"

****** Yeah its often hard to find a fic that perfectly balances an OP Harry that its not an asshole or a Know-It-All-Master-of-Manipulation and a traumatize Harry that manages to overcome his trauma or stands up for himself in a realistic way without being a dick about it.

Regarding the rape part, yeah I agree with you. I guess rape has become the bread and butter of angsty fics that do not have creativity when it comes in creating trauma.

There was a fic that had immortal OP Fem'Harry that is captured by an evil group in a very realistic and believable way. However, the group is only interested in her for her immortality and never mentions or even threatens to rape her if she does not cooperate. They do open her up to see how her body works and is kept awake through the process.

Its fics like that really understand how to create trauma for the character because once she is rescued, she develops a phobia for hospitals and anything related to muggle medicine.

** Linkao3(A station south of canon) This has something similar. Harry has the properties of a horcrux and is basically indestructible.

  First year at Hogwarts is a time for self discovery, making friends, and possibly starting yourself on a horrible downward spiral where your exceptional abilities alienate yourself from everyone around you. Harry Potter, for reasons he's personally curious about, cannot seem to die or even be hurt. Draco Malfoy has been dealt the cruel hand by fate to have so little magical power as to be barely better than a squib. Hermione Granger is a deaf natural legilimens. And Ron Weasley has been inducted into the ultra-selective society known as the Sparrowkeet Lounge. One stop down the line is still a long way from canon.

** linkao3(5601229)

actually has him jumping off the tower, break his neck, die, and come back to life.

not invulnerable, just immortal. and we could argue if it's still Harry. not sure if I would recommend, I still didn't finish, I fear a very depressing ending.

  The Dark Lord lingers. Severus spirals. Did Harry Potter ever truly exist at all?[Severus Snape splits his time between the war effort, a mysterious plot hatched by his students, the ever nefarious Dolores Umbridge, and the physical and mental well-being of Harry Potter. The last one turns out to be more difficult than it sounds. And then things take a turn for the worse. OotP AU in which it turns out the Dark Lord had more than one way to return from the dead, and Severus discovers just how far he has left to fall. Expect dark humor, a liberal dose of angst, and plenty of Severus Snape's personal opinions.Other things to look forward to in this fic include: Dolores Umbridge's frankly deeply disturbing crush on Severus Snape, Minerva and Severus as best bros, Albus Dumbledore as a really bad prankster, Lucius Malfoy as a poncy git, Kreacher the house-elf, a Harry Potter who seems more and more different every day, a surprisingly pragmatic Hermione Granger, and a Severus Snape who for some reason can't stop dreaming about the Dark Lord.]
