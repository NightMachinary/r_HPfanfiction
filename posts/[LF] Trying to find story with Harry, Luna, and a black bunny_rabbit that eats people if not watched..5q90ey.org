** It's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]]

IIRC, the bunny was conjured(or transfigured from something?) by Lily. She says that if it's not supervised, it can eat the entire Scotland. I don't want to spoil anything but I love the bunny in Lily's second year! Love that fic.

** It sounds a bit like Coronation of the Black Queen, the third in the series. The main character, who is close with Luna, summons a pooka. This creature matches your description. linkffn(11510729)

  Third in the Black Queen series. Jen chose to embrace the darker aspects of the world long ago, and she has never once regretted it. However, serving Baron Samedi creates its own problems. A new enemy is on the prowl, and now she needs to eliminate him... before he can do the same to her. Jen/Luna; as always, not for children

**** The series itself isn't complete, mind. She's working on the fourth book now and it's only 30k words in... just in case you're one of those people who prefer reading complete works only.

I finished it last night, actually. It's picking back up again, thank goodness. I missed seeing Voldemort in the third.
