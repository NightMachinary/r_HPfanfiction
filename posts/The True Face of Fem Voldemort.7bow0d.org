[[https://imgur.com/xl3oDZh][Behold, the true face of the Dark Lady! Those of delicate constitutions may wish to avert their eyes.]]

There are despots and dictators

Political manipulators

There are purebloods with the intellects of fleas

There are ministers and petty tyrants

Who are so lacking in refinements

They'd be better suited to swinging from the trees

Your resistance now is futile

No one has ever been this brutal

In a thousand years of mageocracy

An enigma and a mystery

In British Wizarding History

The quintessence of dark magic that is she

She's the Dark Lord of the nation

She's the wickedest witch in creation

She's the evil, the horrid, don't you see

And this wizarding world will spin

Around her every little whim

'Cause this wizarding world begins and ends with

What's her name?

VOLDEMORT!

That's her name

VOLDEMORT!

She's the dark lady of the world

VOLDEMORT!

Is she wicked or what?

VOLDEMORT

Yeah!

**** Ohhh --- sorry, I should have read that little text thing (what's the name of that?) next to your username. It's an oddly surreal experience when you happen to chat with the author of one of your favorite stories on this humble reddit! Anyway, as implied by the previous sentence, I /do/ love your story, and have tried to emulate part of its tone in my own story (though mine's a /bit/ more grounded --- the Sorting Hat beaving like in your story could happen in it, but not Avada Kedavra turning people into llamas or Voldemort falling in love with Sirius)

***** I'll have you know that Voldemort did not fall in love with Sirius. He was sort of forced into by Quirrell who is a hard core Blackmort shipper.

Whats the name of your story BTW? I could always use more insane sorting hats in my life.

****** /The Parselmouth of Gryffindor/. Although, the Sorting Hat isn't truly /insane/ (just a terrible gossip --- and even that is actually mostly showcased in the as-yet-unpublished Chapter 4), I was just saying it wouldn't be out-of-place if he /was/.
