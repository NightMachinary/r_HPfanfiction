Give me fics where Harry is rightfully horrified at Dumbledore's plan, that he was just a sacrifice and was being groomed to die. If he does go through with the walk to the forest (because he thinks there's no choice left and it's too late for anything else), he either doesn't meet Dumbledore in Limbo or the encounter goes very differently.

And Harry remembers Aberforth's warning about his brother. He gets a sick feeling in his gut that he disregarded his doubts about Dumbledore due to the trauma from Dobby's death and that Aberforth knew his brother's true nature well.

#+begin_quote
  “I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother's knee. Secrets and lies, that's how we grew up, and Albus ... he was a natural.”
#+end_quote

Bonus: When Harry returns and the war is won, he does his level best to destroy Dumbledore's legacy.

Edit: Flair updated in regards to the new rule. Discussion welcome.

Check out Rohata fics, but they are poorly written.
