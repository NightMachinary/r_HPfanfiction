Not from the very beginning of Tom's journey, but it's a superb fic.

*** Not usually a huge fan of OCs as main characters (forgot to mention that) but I'll give this a go, thanks!

**** Almost every character in his era would be an oc to be fair

***** In the sense that characters like Daphne Greengrass and Lisa Turpin are OCs, you're right. I'm generally okay with them as tertiary characters but I don't often read main character OC stories, though I have made a start on the recommended story and it's decent enough. And admittedly, I would prefer an OC to a wildly OOC main char that we already know.

  What if Tom met his match in his fifth year at Hogwarts? What if someone upset the power balance before he became The Dark Lord... And changed the trajectory of history? That person is Amalia Gray. (NOT a time-travel fic!) [Awesome]Fem OC x [Evil]Tom Riddle

** I can't read cannon character x cannon character. I read anything with an oc x cannon character which makes it very hard to find good ones that don't fudge up the original plot too much to make everyone occ but I've found a few good ones, hopefully this helps~ (I don't do the stories justice)

I love that this one! It shows Tom being true to a mean and manipulative character and watching a young girl struggle through the abusive relationship. It incredibly well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307531/1/Violet-Eyes][Violet's eyes]]

This one is a little occ for Tom Riddle since he actually CARES about a person but it still shows his inhumane habits toward others as well as the girl who thinks this is okay but the author doesn't shy away from pointing out it's wrong on both ends.

*** I will take a look at these, thank you! The first one sounds particularly interesting, I've seen a few fics where Tom is portrayed as just being 'misunderstood' and essentially forced into becoming how he was through how others treated him, which I can't stand, so one that shows him as cruel and manipulative from the off sounds good to me.
