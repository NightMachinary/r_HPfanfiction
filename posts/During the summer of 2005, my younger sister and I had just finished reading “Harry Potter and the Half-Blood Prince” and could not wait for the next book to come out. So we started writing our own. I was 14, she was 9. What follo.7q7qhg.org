#+TITLE: During the summer of 2005, my younger sister and I had just finished reading “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” and could not wait for the next book to come out. So we started writing our own. I was 14, she was 9. What follows is the first draft of our own version Harry Potter 7. Enjoy.

** I really enjoy the story but I am having trouble reading it via pictures. Have you or your sister considered putting this story on fanfiction.net or a similar site?

From what I could tell your story looks good and I think people would enjoy reading it in a more legible format.

PS Nothing in this comment is meant as a criticism. It is just a friendly suggestion from one HP fan to another.

*** I think part of the charm of this post is the fact that it's handwritten in what looks like a composition notebook by a 9 year old and a 14 year old. Doesn't really seem like it's meant for mass readership at ff.net.

*** Thank you! I actually wasn't sure which subreddits to even post this on. This one made the most sense. Still looking around.
