Does anyone know a fanfic with the summary:

"AU and Draco and Harry were already BBFs and wanted to be the same House. Harry was a lot more timid and Draco more assertive so they figured that naturally Draco would be a Slytherin and Harry a Hufflepuff but they would convince the Hat to put them Gryffindor because that was the middle ground between them. Harry got in no problem but Draco got distracted during the sorting and ended up in Slytherin...until he literally fought his way into Gryffindor by refusing to leave and beat up anyone that tried to make him leave."

Someone posted this summary but never followed up with the title. Was wondering if the great powers of Reddit could help me track it down. Thanks in advance!
