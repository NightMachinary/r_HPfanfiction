So, the title should sum up my request well. I'm trying to find stories where Riddle is the Defense Against Dark Arts teacher.

However, almost everything I find has him and Harry fucking, which is not what I'm looking for. Any suggestions?

  Born of a drunken one night stand rather than a love potion, Tom Riddle grew up a little differently. Family. Job. And absolutely no insane take-over-the-world attempts. Which all changes when he gets thrown into a world where apparently he grew up to be some sort of mad Dark Lord with a complex and he doesn't have any hair... Or a nose...

**** Dangerverse series, and Be Careful are two different stories, though Be Careful has characters from the Dangerverse.

In the Dangerverse series, Hermione's older sister "Danger" (by several years) learns she is a witch. Their parents die. Danger meets Remus. Danger and Remus raises Hermione and "adopts" Harry, rescuing him from the Dursleys. Danger can also have prophecies in dreams. Anymore and it would be spoilerish. Canon relationships, aside from Remus, Tonks, Neville, Draco and Luna.

** I really liked linkao3(Reclamation by copperbadge) It's a one-shot and focuses on the marauders era but it has a minor slash pairing so I don't know if it'll go. Regardless, I think you should give it a shot since it's not explicit and secondary to the plot.

*** I still don't get why Snape had to die, also I find it odd that Tom would be ever so friendly with the Maruaders and yet would so callously murder Severus, it made no sense. After seeing a bit of Tom's background, one would think it would Severus he would try to save and mentor.

**** Yeah the author didn't make the reason very clear, but from what I gathered Snape was trying to make a horcrux. Even though it's never explicitly stated there are a few clues scattered that seem to indicate so, like the notes in the book. Tom says that he murdered Snape in defence of himself. Maybe he was trying to kill him in order to make a horcrux?

Considering this Riddle is rather repentant of his past history with horcruxes he probably warned Severus about them but didn't want to mentor him either because he was afraid of a... relapse, for lack of a better word. In this story he reminds me of an ex-drug addict who is trying to live the most ascetic life possible but still has a weird longing for his past life. Becoming close to Severus and having him share his thoughts with him was putting to risk his years-long abstinence from that side of the dark arts.

That's how I interpreted it anyway.

***** Thing is without a Voldemort, would Snape have even gone darkside? I don't get the weird redemption of not only Tom but the Marauders. It doesn't make much sense to me. If we use your take on Tom, then wouldn't he recognise the signs and perhaps alert Dumbledore? If Tom talked with Severus, then it was half assed, yet Remus and Sirius rate heart to hearts? I just can't get behind it.
