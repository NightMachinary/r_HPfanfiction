At first, the invention of the magical computer seems to be the greatest innovation of the century. Then people discover the horrific reality of tech support.


** Read that as a murderous clown, not tech support.

  This is an AU look at what might have happened the day after the Twins left the school during OOTP if Umbridge had had a reason to question Hermione as she did Harry. Since wizards don't understand anything about the internet, or computers or gamergirls, it's a classic example of what you don't know can hurt you. Rated T for ... well just because. AU Harmony. H/Hr
