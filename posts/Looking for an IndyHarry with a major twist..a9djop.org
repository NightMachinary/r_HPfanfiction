Basically I want an Indy!Harry story that starts off like usual, Harry is fed up with all the secrets, he finds out Dumbledore set him up to die, and he sets out on his own, this is where the twist starts. I want Harry to do worse after this. I want him to learn magics, and maybe even start his own club, then I want it to all turn sideways. I want him to by the end of the story be broken, and understand that Dumbledore was doing the best he could with the gathered information, and that he(a teenager) could never truly do better than what Dumbledore did. That at least with Dumbledore there's a chance where he lives, and more importantly his sacrafice protecting the rest of the wizarding world. I want an Indy!Harry that shows that teenagers won't be able to beat a literal army with a leader who is effectively immortal with some extra tricks, and bit of extra power.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** While that's believable, I like happy stories that make me feel better about the world, not ones where things go from bad to worse - I have the news for that.

*** It might still be possible for Harry to win in the end, if he learns humility in time to salvage the situation.

**** That's a good point. In that case, if the story is being posted on AO3 then maybe 'eventual happy ending' tag or similar should be included, unless the author is worried about spoilers. I'm just not really in the mood for angsty dark fics right now.

** It would be an interesting thematic compare and contrast dealing with proper authority vs. improper authority and how one ought to relate to them. So often fiction tends to be either all for authority or all against authority (thematically anyway). Showing how Harry's destiny is not solo and that he needs help, including oversight and guidance and yes, even secrets kept from him, would be refreshing.
