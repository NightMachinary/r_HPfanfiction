I'm looking for a specific fic where Snape is headmaster of Hogwarts and Hogwarts is sentient and ultimately chooses the headmaster. Dumbledore and McGonagal both try to contest Snape being headmaster. Possibly Dumbledore bashing. No idea if this fic had a romantic pairing, or whether it was het or slash.

The main part of this fic I remember is that there's a large group of people standing in front of Hogwarts and it will only open the doors to its chosen headmaster/mistress. Is this familiar to anybody??


** If you find out the name let me.know!

** Is it linkffn(reboot by kallanit)? It has a scene similar to what you are describing, where Hogwarts recognizes Snape as headmaster because he was in his previous life.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. COMPLETE.
