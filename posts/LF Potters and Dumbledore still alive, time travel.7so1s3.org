In this story, after the war, Harry learns that Dumbledore and his family, including I think a new sibling, are alive. He then travels back in time and, while there, uses polyjuice as Lily to prove to Snape they're alive. He also kisses Snape as Lily.

****** When a story has gone over a calendar year since it has been updated, it's dead, Jim.

Last update for Travel Secrets was December 2016.

Rare updates, as you put it, are the life support a fic gets before it flatlines.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

** Why would Harry polyjuiced as Lily mean she was still alive? Also why would he kiss Snape? Or is it AU where Snape is nicer, and Harry is gay?

*** IIRC you can't polyjuice into a dead person in that fanfic. So he used a hair from Lily and polyjuiced into it, proving to Snape that she is alive. I think he only kissed him because he took pity on Snape.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
