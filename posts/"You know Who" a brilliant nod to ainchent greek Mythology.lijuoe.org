So I just saw this video

[[https://youtu.be/Ac5ksZTvZN8]]

In Greek mythology, it's not about Harry Potter but about Hades and Persephone anything but later on, in the video, it mentions that in ancient Greece the common folk referred to the underworld deities with fake Names just like "He who must not be named" "You know Who" etc. So I was wondering if this was ever considered as inspiration for Voldemort. Comparing him to deities that are death-related, meaning magicals saw him as the god of death, or if it's just a funny coincidence.


** It's possible that's the link, but it's a thing in other areas beyond Ancient Greece as well. Even H.P. Lovecraft (Harry Potter, eh? :D) had The King in Yellow who was also called that.

** [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScottishTrope][It's not exactly an uncommon trope.]] And if you look in the Myths & Religion section, you'll see that the Greeks weren't even the first people to do it.

It's certainly possible that Greek mythology was Rowling's direct inspiration, but it also could have come from anywhere else.

** The theme is also common in some Christian communities where people won't say the devil's name because it is believed that this way you will summon him and he will curse you. Also considering all the parallels with Christianity in the series, I'm more tempted to believe that JK used Satan as inspiration for Voldemort. A brilliant charming handsome young man who completely destroyed all his good traits in his hunger for power and became a monster who seduces people over to the dark side and enslaves them. Also the snake which is the first incarnation of evil that appears in the Bible is his symbol and there are numerous commentaries on the internet about each Horcrux representing one of the seven deadly sins.
