I feel like if I "died" then came back to life, I'd probably freak the fuck out about it.

  Mortal minds were not meant to see the splendor of the Hereafter before their time came, not even the Master of Death. After slaying Voldemort, Harry must find something to help him come to grips with his sojourn to the afterlife lest the temptation of the Veil win out...

** Linkffn(8212843) harry is rather traumatized from the horcrux removal. Crossover with the Hulk. I like it a lot.

  Gen. "While on the run, Bruce meets a young man who speaks to the moon. He's probably not quite the sanest friend Bruce could have made, but, well...beggers can't be choosers."

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late][fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late]] is a brilliant story, that was sadly never finished. Harry's life is mentally affected by the deathly hallows. The first 28 chapters though are in themselves a closed-up story. Reading further only lets you get to an open end - unsatisfied - so just don't read them.

** Oh, and another one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6563043][fanfiction.net/s/6563043]] "The Real Memory" is ever better. Harry comes back to life and everything has changed. It is another story that deals with the effects the deathly hallows have for Harry. In the end everything makes sense in a strangly satisfying way - as much sense as coming back after dying can. Have read this one like 5 times?

** If you're okay with Harry/Draco, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5688056/1/On-a-Clear-Day][On A Clear Day]] is a brilliant fic which addresses this in an interesting way.
