we've all seen different stories where harry goes to a school in america and likes it better there or someone comes from there to hogwarts. So this made me wonder, anyone here ever seen stories where harry goes to Canada's wizard school or the story takes place in canada or Canadian wizards help harry instead of american ones? It'd be nice to see how canada is in the hp series


** Linkffn(A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Fliargold) has pretty much the whole story take place in Canada.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10514631/1/Hear-No-Evil-See-No-Evil-Speak-No-Evil]])

This one features Harry becoming friends with the Canadian along with America and England making an appearance. It's not the best fic but it is about Harry's interaction with other nations.

  England needs help. Harry Potter has been lucky so far, but the Boy Who Lived is going into his third year, and threats loom on the horizon. Watch as the Golden Trio gets help from a shy Canadian, a reluctant American, and an odd Englishman. Takes place in the third year, rated T. NO ROMANCE!

  She was like the threatening dawn in his childhood hive, primal and looming larger the closer he stepped towards her. His head was still bent, neck bared. He knew the final trial. He knew the clinical definition--dedication to the Empire, subservience to the Empress--and he knew the dime-store novelization--dedication to the Empire, forbidden lust for the Empress--and god, he had forgiven himself his own sins during his years in the academy, bent low beneath her plate-print image on his mandatory Iconagraphic Image.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2866740/1/Grey-Maiden-I-Philosopher-s-Stone]]) and sequels has Harry raised by one of Lily's friends, and, IIRC, he grows up in Newfoundland. (Speaking of that, Lily was supposed to be generally well-liked. Why didn't any of /her/ friends show up in canon?)
