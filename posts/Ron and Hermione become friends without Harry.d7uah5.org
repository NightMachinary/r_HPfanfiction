** Well, I've written an AU where the two meet as adults, "The Dark Lord Never Died". (I'm also planning a story where they became friends without Harry at Hogwarts, but it'll start in sixth year, when Harry arrives at Hogwarts. So far it's just a snippet, though.)

*** Your idea reminds me of linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9766604/1/What-We-re-Fighting-For]]) but without the Ron bashing.

I'm interested.

***** Hmm. Well that was definitely worth a read.

I'm not particularly fond of a seer Luna myself. I prefer the sweet, but really weird girl who adores her insane father from canon. Who makes rather insightful comments, but is rather flighty.

I love what you did with Ron and Lavender though.

****** What Seer Luna? As the snippet shows, she might as well be making things up. With Sirius never having been to Azkaban, his house most certainly won't be full of traps.

******* True.

Sorry, I just instinctively shudder at the thought of a character even suggesting it. I did like the retroactive charms claim. Imagine the Quibbler being like the party from 1984.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
