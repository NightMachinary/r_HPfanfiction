** Well, I hate ones that are excessively long, if your chapters are 40,000 words long or more, you need to break that crap into chunks.

I'd say a maximum of, oh, maybe 20,000 words, a minimum of 5000.

*** Totally agree with this. After reading that other people preferred long chapters, I understood why and now I prefer them too (strange) but I absolutely can't read excessively long chapters if it isn't one coherent part, sometimes it could also have easily been cut into shorter chapters and then I hate reading it.

** a good sized chapter that won't drag on long enough to lose people's attention is usually five to eight thousand words. This depends on your writing style, though. If your prose flows well enough you can keep going longer, but if your tone is formal and complicated, like if you're writing Lord of the Rings fiction, one thousand words can feel like ten thousand.

Of course, I've known authors who put out literal fucking novellas for chapters, so there's that.

So, five to eight thousand words if you want a meaty chapter. Otherwise you do you.

** I think it's not so easy to provide a general must-have length, because it also depends how authors decide to divide up their story.

Generally speaking, I am leery of those stories with less than 1k words per chapter /unless/ I know the author or the story is either complete, recommended or favorably reviewed.

You have to look at it from a reader's point of view for a moment. Readers follow a story in progress and every few days or weeks, they will receive another update. Keeping track of the story in one's mind is difficult, especially when yours is not the only one they follow in this way. The longer the break between chapters or the shorter their content, the more difficult I find it to immerse myself in the world an author builds with his writing. I'm also hardly ever in the mood to go back and re-read stuff, so I may just stop reading a story until it is complete. Sometimes I remember to pick those stories up again when they're done, sometimes not.

** Wow, I feel like the odd one out in this discussion. I try for at least 1.5k, but I rarely try to hit anything higher than 2k. Honestly, that's because I feel it works best for me, though. I think it just depends on how you prefer to write. Some authors write feel happier with longer chapters, and can maintain the flow better than with a shorter chapter, and vice versa.

As a reader, I do admit preferring longer chapters, sometimes. Mainly with fics that take ages to get updated, because every single update adds so much progress to the fic. Otherwise, with say a completed fic, I rarely am bothered by chapter length. So long as the flow is good.

So basically, go with what works for you. Don't push yourself to hit 5k words or 8k words or whatever if you don't want to. Or don't limit yourself to a word limit. Whichever you prefer.

** A bit late, but generally you should aim for a four-digit amount.

Look at it differently: depending on the size of the book it would be printed in, a thousand words can take from two to four pages. So think about how many /pages/ you'd like in your chapter, and then translate that to the amount of words.

That said, unless you are info-dumping or creating highly elaborate situations in which a lot (possibly too much) happens, you should have places to split it every so often so just write as you go and split at the length you deem reasonable.

** Anything above about 5k words is fine by me. I mean I've read one shots like DobbyElfLord's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4544334/1/Harry-Potter-Mercenary][Harry Potter Mercenary]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6568694/1/Harry-Potter-Hit-Wizard][Harry Potter Hit Wizard]] which are 25k+ in length and it's totally fine. Anything over 20k can sometimes get a bit annoying if you lose your spot, but it's still preferable to too short chapters. Okay I guess I probably would have pretty big problems with a chapter that was about 100k words, but I have yet to see something quite that extreme.

** I like reading longer chapters when I'm waiting between updates but if it's already complete it doesn't matter to me at all.

I write scenes. If the scenes are connected they'll be put together in the same chapter. Some scenes are shorter than the others. If there's one scene/chapter that's important but not very long, I plan to add two chapters when I update, so readers don't feel cheated.

Looking down the chapter list of my work I've got one chapter that's 700 words followed by one that's 7000. It just depends on what you need to happen in each chapter. A quick averaging of my chapter list gives me about 2,250 words per chapter.

** 4K+.

And the longer the better, as far as I'm concerned.

I primarily read fic on my Kindle so I don't really care if a 100k fic is broken up into 5 chapters or 20. It's all the same to me.

For WIPs, I do prefer longer chapters (5k+) because I'm an incredibly fast reader. The exception is when the fic is being updated very frequently. Then anything 2k+ is fine.

** For a normal chapter, don't go under 3000, aim for at least 4000. It's probably good not to go over 8-10000, either. It's not as bad as having chapters that are too short, but if you have much more material than that, you're probably either stretching things out way too much or it needs separations that would basically just make it multiple chapters under one heading anyway. Prologues and epilogues can be any length.

** I'd say it depends on the story you're telling as well. If you total words are going to be <20,000, then smaller chapters are more acceptable. If you're going for novel length, then you should break your chapters up accordingly, ~5000 words is a good, safe bet.

** 2000 words is my absolute minimum, both in reading and writing. When reading I prefer chapters to be as long as possible, but when writing myself I tend to start with 2000 word chapters and gradually increase the length of updates until they're about 4000 or 5000.

** About 3-7 thousand. But it really depends on the kind of fic you're writing and your projected update schedule. If you're writing a series of one-shots/vignettes or if the total length is projected to be under 40k then it's ok to go shorter. I would generally shy away from going longer since chapters like that tend to drag on. However if you plan to update frequently, like once per week, then the shorter end of the scale is ideal while monthly or longer updates would be better served by longer chapters. The best marker for chapter length is not to measure strictly by word count, but rather by content. Compare a chapter to an episode of a tv show. Your chapter should generally have a self-contained arc comprised of multiple scenes that fits into a larger overall arc of the story. If your chapter accomplishes this then it is the correct length.
