:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello there !

I've been looking for a fic I read a while ago, but I can't find it anywhere.

â€‹

So basically it's a time travel story, but not in the usual way. The reason for the time travel is revealed at the end of the story : Hermione is pregnant and her baby has a weird time travel ability. I don't exactly remember the order in which all the events happen, but she's sent back in time to when Snape was about 20 years old, she has to woo Snape because she's already in love with him in the present, and then at some point it's his turn, in the present, to woo a 20 y.o. Hermione (before she' sent back - so that she can be in love with him when she arrives in the past). I think the story was told in the present, they reminisce about her time in the past and Snape is anxious about having to woo her in the present because of the age difference ?

I hope it makes sense, time travel stories are hard to explain ! If anybody knows which fic I'm talking about I'd be very grateful !
