Looking for a good fic that's 80k+ where Sirius raises Harry! Doesn't matter who the pairing is to me!


** Have you read the Innocent series? It features Sirius kidnapping and raising an eight year old Harry. The first one is linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7). It's very well written! And really really long, the fourth(?) story is currently ongoing.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** linkffn(8045114) has Sirius becoming Lord Black and becomming Harry's Guardian after 3rd year. Not sure if that is exactly what you wanted but it's well over 80k, hell it's over 800k!, and is one of my favorite fics.

**** Honestly I can't remember. Probably H/Hr, if anything, but it wasn't a major part of the story if there was a pairing at all. It all takes place during the fourth book.

** The Wise One series linkffn(4062601;4423362;4711743). I've only read the first one so far and have heard that quality drops later on, but it's probably still much better than Innocent and sequels and definitely better than Marauder's Plan (though that is so bad that it's good). The first part only had some temporary relationships with OCs.
