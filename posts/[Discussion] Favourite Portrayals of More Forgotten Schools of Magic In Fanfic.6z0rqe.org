Are there any big stories where the villain is taken down with the power of Herbology alone? Have you seen something very interesting done with Arithmancy or Ancient Runes? Is there a story out there that makes History of Magic sound worth going along to?

I'm just interested in hearing about really different portrayals of certain magics, whether it's done in a Harry-centric fic, with OCs or what - I'm more interested in people branching out, honestly!

(I think Potions and Defence Against The Dark Arts are explored fairly ubiquitously in different fanfictions, but if you've seen an especially interesting or different portrayal, totally mention it.)


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6565419/1/All-That-is-Pure][All That Is Pure]] by Sasha Dimierez. HP/BZ non-graphic slash. Harry learns ancient runes so he can learn spellcrafting so he can create a ritual to destroy Voldemort from afar. The story revolves around Harry learning runes with Blaise's help and the boys creating the spell.

** Linkffn(The Arithmancer) Arithmancy is the basis for spell creation, and Hermione is a prodigy, starting the class in her first year, and creating brand new spells by her third. The only two people who match Hermione's prowess are Barty Crouch Jr and Augustus Rookwood.

She also beats the Basilisk's gaze with modified sunglasses.
