Hi

As I stated in the title, I am looking for a long read. Meaning something like 400k+ but wouldn't be adverse to something short either if the content is good enough.

- No slash, at the least not in the main pairing.
- I like to read mature content, so nothing babyish.
- I personally prefer ff.net but any site will do
- any setting will do, with the MC being Harry.
- no preference regarding pairing or smut as long as it is written with taste.
- The fic should at least have a decent grammar and story structure.

Here is my ff profile [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1751687/][link]]

Mind you, it has not been updated in 4 years. the only thing that is updated is the fav section.

Thank you for helping me :)

*** Thank you so much for the suggestions! I think I have read the 'Rocking the boat' and I know I have read the 'Odd Ideas', don't know why they aren't in the list :S But I have not read the others and for that you have my gratitude :D 'Resistance' seems the best choice to start these with. Thanks again :)

***** If its not too much trouble? I really like your suggestions, so I would probably love that list too :] If you can include only the completed ones or which have not yet been abandoned? It would mean a great deal to me :) and you can also let me know if you are looking to read something, I got a collection of sorts so I could probably locate a few gems.

** Posting from mobile, but have you read "Prince of a Dark Kingdom" by Mizuni-sama?

It's still a wip bit at over a million words I think it fits your request. It's a AU of what if voldermont took over from the first war? I really enjoy it and the author still updates at least once a month.

** Do you mind if it's not Harry? I found this amazing fic about a witch in america, discovering that she's a witch. It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and The Thorn Circle.]] She's written 4 years of the series so far, and she's expecting to have book 5 out this year.

The first book is literally double the size of Philosophers stone, so this should keep you happy. =]

*** I wanted to like that, but the main character wouldn't learn to curb her impulsiveness, ever, after acknowledging it's a problem and seeing it result in progressively worse things over the course of years. I know people don't change quickly, but you'd think, after years of reality bashing her over the head, she might get the hint. But no. 2.5 books in, I gave up.

**** Book 3, and the *Spoilers* Time-Turner incident in particular */Spoilers* is the peak of Alexandra 'throwing herself into walls for the hell of it' to borrow a phrase from another reviewer. In Book 4, she starts to show progress in thinking things through and consulting with others. Not a huge amount of progress, she'll always be an impulsive person, but progress nonetheless.

Then again, even at her most impulsive Alexandra has never annoyed me as much as canon Harry does. At least she is smart, talented, and ambitious. I find her to be far more compelling as a main character than Harry ever was.

***** Alexandra does grow, the real issue isn't that she never realizes how her decisions hurt people, it's that adults around her either constantly don't fix the situation or that they keep her so in the dark that she feels the need to push them. Also I strongly suspect a character met in her second year who went out of their way to be involved in situations that might have been better left to adults left a big impact on the way Alex approaches situations.

The only time I legitimately got mad at Alex for being stubborn and foolhardy was the most third book and even then her motivations for doing so were so well written that I can't say, if I had only the knowledge she had, I wouldn't have tried to handle it the same way.

****** Epic.

While Alexandra is still just a student she ends up traveling far afield within the magical US (and... other places), and her involvement in the greater politics is logical and thrilling. The author draws on early American culture to extrapolate a living, breathing magical America with its own history, rules, bureaucracies and threats.

Now if Inverarity would start blessing us with Book 5, the world would certainly be improved from my perspective.

**** I thought so too, but I started book one when I finally ran out of HP fic and it was amazing. If you can look past the occasional minor plot devices referencing the war Britain had in the 90's, it is simply fantastic.

The magic isn't incredibly divergent either, it's probably one of the best "Hogwarts style schools in the US" fics I've ever read.

Plus if you start now, you'll probably finish by the time the new one is out.

** Shezza's Denarian series is a three book crossover with The Dresden Files which assumes no knowledge of the other series before you begin. The ideas are well presented, and I really enjoyed watching the author's skills grow as the series progressed. Find a link to the first story below.

**** A Brave New World is fantastic. Also the authors other work is great too. A Brave New World involves HP taking off too the US after a thing happens, but the author originally couldn't decide whether to have him go off or stay in the UK. So she wrote both, and they are VERY different. Brilliant both of them but the couldn't be more different after the first 5ish chapters. From memory they wrote a solid 3rd fic thats unrelated as well. I'm actually going to go reread them all now methinks...
