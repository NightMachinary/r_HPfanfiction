I just finished a chapter of a HP story, and while he can still be beaten by Dumbledore, and maybe Snape he grew up for a couple of years with two other kid's, and left the Dursley's, and missed the first two years of Hogwarts on purpose, and he can perform powerful wandless magic, and he knows Occulmancy, but the second he starts Hogwarts in the third year, and the whole Dementor thing happened he still f****** faints. I'm getting sick of when ever someone drastically changes the story everything still happens the same. Oh Harry can do magic without a wand, and has lived with what he considers family for the last 3+ years, and knows Occulmancy, but he reacts the exact same way to a Dementor even thought this is NOT the same Harry.

The reason Dementors effect Harry so much is that he has a lot of sadness, anger, depression(to the point where as a 17yo he willingly sacrafices himself with little resistance), but not a lot of happiness to counteract that. I mean this is theory, but it seems plausible that a decent enough Occulmens can at least be more resistant to a Dementors aura. I mean Occulmencey requires you to focus only on one image, and nothing else to me that sounds like it could at least help. If not Occulmencey having happy memories allows you to last longer I mean that's what the patronus is built around.

Apart from all that is there any other instances in fanfiction stories which make you just want to hit your head on a wall, because of how different yet the same it is.

Yes. A lot of fanfics have that issue.

Oh look! I'm a God! and super adjusted! And i totally made friends with that annoying know it all on the first day, because 11 years totally find it cool if they are gods. But then there was this comment from Ron about her not having friends and she spent like 12 hours auditioning for Moaning Myrtles position despite us being friends, so i totally went and used my Godly powers to stick a wand in that trolls nose!

It's surprising how many authors fail to understand how cause and effect works.

*** Yes. There's one story that I can't remember the title, but it was a Stargate/Harry Potter where by third year Harry was literally in command of the entirety of a city ship, had all the magic of earth downloaded into his head, and could do wandless magic, but Wormtail, yes WORMTAIL still knocked him out, and he couldn't get himself free of the stone angel even though earlier in this story he crushed a fricken Goa'uld mothership with his MIND with no ship or no wand.

The only reason he even befriended them was because he never had friends before and was to shy to make other/better friend.

***** I believe that in fanfiction, the reason people always have Harry befriend Hermione is because it's convenient for him to have a friend who is a walking encyclopedia. Hermione is pretty much established as the smartest character around Harry's age, so it's an advantage for him to have some kind of relationship with her.

Also, I'm sure that the reason Hermione has this many fans is NOT because of Emma Watson. It's because she is a figurehead for the girl nerd. In fact, many girls do not like how she ended up being beautiful, as if she needed beauty when being smart should have been enough.

***** It really isn't the only reason. I always liked Hermione, even before I watched the movies - maybe it was because I could identify with her and wished to have friends, like she did.

Growing up as a bookish kid wothout friends sucks majorly, so I could totally relate to her, and thus basically always liked her and was kind of on her side.

Sure, Emma certainly helped, but for some Hermione is very identifiable and thus needs to be a friend of Harry.

And of course, this leads to her kind of being a Mary Sue from time to time as well.

****** I grew up as a bookish kind and was friendless during a long time. Even through this perios, (and before fanfiction) I hated Hermione. Actually it's impossible for me to relate to her. She doesn't like knowledge just for knowledge. She just like being the smartest person in the room. Like when Harry "cheated" in his potion class in his sixth year. She got jealous because someone else was the best.

** Yes, this has been my number 1 pet peeve for some time. I mean if Harry grows up for example with Sirius, his personality and thought process are all going to change. His knowledge and skill set will be very different too. But too many fics still force everything on the canon plot rail, I'm so disappointed about those authors because some of them write really well.

*** If this was your only reason to comment do me, and everyone else a favor. Don't. I made a mistake in the spelling, but you just commenting what you have without doing something as simple as pointing out which spelling is correct makes you come off as rude, and pety.

P.s. I know the proper spelling for it now, but my point was if your not going to either offer up constructive critism or commenting about the topic or replying to others comments then don't comment at all.

**** I'm sorry. I rarely do this sort of thing, but people on this sub (and in otherwise well-spelled stories) keep misspelling Occlumency in a myriad of ways and it just /got on my nerves/ after a while.

As for the topic... I didn't answer because essentially everything has been said. There have been numerous threads on the Stations Of Canon and how some people don't like them, and that's about all you can say. These threads keep ending in a consensus that most people would like some originality, only for writers to keep using them.

As for the specific Dementor example, I guess it all relies on how Dementors work in that particular author's headcanon. Canon is vague enough that whether Occlumency actually helps against them is up to interpretation. Some --- including me --- think not, because I see human Legilimency as usually being /subtle/. The 'focusing on one thing' method of Occlumency is geared against the subtle, Slytherin sort of Legilimens who tries to subtly nudge you to think about what he wants to know, in a way that won't let you notice your mind is being read.

Dementors, on the other hand, don't care about alerting their victim (the fact that /there's a Dementor right there/ and the general feeling of hopelessness surrounding them are a bit of a giveaway), so they just barge in to look for what they want, dealing damage to the rest of the mind in the process. There is thus a less subtle sort of Occlumency (the "hard wall of willpower at the forefront of your mind") that is the occlumentic equivalent to Dementor-style Legilimency, the very same one that works as a defence against the Imperius Curse --- but because all their magic is focused on it, while this sort of Occlumency would work against an angry Legilimens who forewent subtletly, Dementors could usually break down these barriers in a matter of seconds.

** I don't necessarily mind these fics if it's more about the fluff than major events - eg. a lot of Sirius/Remus raises Harry stories follow the normal plot in terms of major events (Innocent is a pretty big offender from 1st year on), but I still like them anyway bc I'm more interested in happy feels-fluff from those story than anything else.
