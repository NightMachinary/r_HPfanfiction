** Well, there were supposedly only 4 schools, so Harry would just be replaced with the best Gryffindor. Was the class list for all years, or only the 4th year? Maybe Ron would have had a chance, after all.

**** Good point! Though, since "Potter, Harry" is in the middle of the alphabet, BCJ would have had to cut the class list in two, and then it would be between people whose family names come before "Potter" and people whose family names come after "Potter".

** Imagine if Ron was the one to be chosen. I don't even care how realistic that would be, I'd want a fic about this. And as we know nothing about ravenclaws and very little about hufflepuffs in Harry's year, I'll assume those students wouldn't be good enough. But maybe I'd want to see Draco get a burn from that dragon.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** My prediction (largely cribbed from canon):

#+begin_quote
  The fire in the Goblet had just turned red again. Sparks were flying out of it. A long flame shot suddenly into the air, and borne upon it was another piece of parchment.

  Automatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment. He held it out and stared at the name written upon it. There was a long pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared at Dumbledore. And then Dumbledore cleared his throat, and read out --

  â€˜Hermione Granger.'
#+end_quote

If the whole 4th year had gotten tossed in, it would probably be a toss-up between Harry (best action hero) and Hermione (best at magic). If Harry is excluded, then it's going to be a (very surprised) Hermione, who is probably going to be dealing with murder attempts for the rest of the year.

The most popular fic with Hermione as a Triwizard champion is /Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire/ by Couldson Eagle. In it, though, she casts a protective spell on Harry that essentially redirects the Goblet's magic at her. The fic was generally good, but it had issues as well: 1) the Muggle Law plot threads that took up what felt like a third of the fic and led nowhere, 2) Hermione did not outright /win/ enough, and 3) it had an atrocious Idiot Ball fixfic ending.

Are there any other decent fics with this premise?

**** I assume that the names had to have been written down by the candidates, so BCJ would have had to use something like a sheaf of homeworks, in which case each name would have been on its own piece of paper.

I guess he /could/ obtain a class list with names written down by students by taking attendance by passing around a sign-up sheet.
