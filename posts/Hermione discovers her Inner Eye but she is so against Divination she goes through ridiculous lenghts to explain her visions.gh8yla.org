"No!"

"But-"

"I said no."

"But how can you explain your visions then?"

"Maybe I'm a Horcrux as well, have you thought of that? Hmm?!"


** I want to see a fic in which Hermione /thinks/ she's Sherlock Holmes, but, in reality, she just has a very strong retrocognition talent. Every time she has an insight, she rationalises it by retroactively identifying clues and putting them together.

**** You jest, but Conan Doyle actually wrote a self-parody of sorts, [[http://www.sherlockian.net/investigating/watson-trick/][How Watson Learned the Trick]], that shows just how impossible it is to make the sorts of deductions that Holmes makes based on the information he actually references in his explanations.

**** It's in French if you're ok with it. (Hence the Tom JEDUSOR).

It's called "boules de cristal et feuilles de th√©" and it's on fanfiction.net, the title is specific enough that you should find it no problem.

***** linkffn(7346779)

So basically, you type

linkffn( )

Then you put the title and the author in the parentheses, or the number of the fic if you have it. So linkffn(Boules de Cristal et Feuilles de Th√©) or linkffn(Boules de Cristal et Feuilles de Th√© by Selminia) would work.

** There's one where she's seen as a great seer but all she's doing is collecting all the information from Trelawney and the more skilled divination students, combining it with knowledge from books and creating useful deductions. For example when Trelawney predicted that a bad thing was going to happen, she made a list of possible events and excluded things until she figured out that something might happen to another student's pet rabbit, and managed to save it. I don't remember which fic it was though.

When Trelawney predicts "the thing you are dreading will be on the 16th", Hermione makes Lavender make a list of everything she's dreading and then gives her sensible precautions to take. Lavender's rabbit is rescued just before the 16th and everyone praises Hermione as a great Seer. She gets irritated at Lavender and predicts dOooOm if she goes to Hogsmeade. Meant as a little pettiness to take her fun away. Coincidently, during the next Hogsmeade visit Death Eaters attack. Lavender and everyone else assume that the Doom Hermione Saw was Lavender's death at a Death Eater's hands. Thus sealing Hermione's reputation as a great Seer.

** Hermione ridicules Divination by making a random silly prediction. Next day it comes true and everyone is like "WOOAH, you're a seer." Hermione says it was just a coincidence and makes another even more ridiculous prediction. Next day it also comes true which makes everyone even more inclined to believe that she is a seer. Hermione gets increasingly frustrated and makes a completely nonsensical prediction that absolutely can not become true just to prove a point. Due to a series of improbable events it becomes true and Hermione gets really angry and sets out to prove everyone that she is not a seer while failing miserably.
