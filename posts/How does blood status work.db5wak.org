I understand the bigoted hierarchy of magical Britain... pureblood > half-blood > muggleborn > dark creatures > muggles or at least something along those lines but how does it work?

Can only purebloods create more purebloods or can two half-bloods create a pureblood? And two muggleborn create a half-blood? If not in their generation then the generation of their children's children. I know this likely isn't how it works which is why inbreeding was such a problem with cousins marrying each other at every turn.

I was just wondering if muggleborns started mingling and having children together and their children did the same would they eventually create a 'pureblood' or just muggleborn legacies?


** According to Rowling herself, pure-blood society accepted people as "pure-blood" when they could claim that both parents and all four grandparents were magical. Therefore Harry's children are pure-bloods by this standard, as all four of their grandparents were magical.

The Malfoy family are an example of a pure-blood lineage who occasionally married half-bloods, as the children of this union would be considered pure-bloods if all four grandparents were magical.

*** Yeah but a muggle born is basically equal to a muggle in terms of blood purity. I think Harry's kids would still be considered half blood.

I mean if you think about it if there was a wizard with 4 muggle born grandparents theres no way Malfoy would consider them pureblood.

**** You guys are launching into some complicated head-canons instead of actually listening to Rowling's words about the world she imagined. [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pure-blood#cite_note-harry-3]]

I realize that Deathly Hallows' muggleborn oppression doesn't match with that, but what Rowling says in the linked text matches with how muggle-born and half-bloods are treated in the previous books. Muggleborn with derision and half-bloods tolerated, if they don't cause trouble. Remember that not every pureblood was a Death Eater. Many, most even, were just mildly judgemental of muggleborn.

  As far as somebody like Lucius Malfoy is concerned, for instance, a Muggle-born is as 'bad' as a Muggle.

This literally matches with what I said. Harry saw himself as a half blood as well so it's not like it's a fringe idea to consider a muggle born with equal blood status to a muggle.

******** Because he has two Muggle grandparents, and so does Dumbledore. That's why they're considered half-bloods. They have two magical parents but not four magical grandparents. But if he married a pure-blood (and he does), then his children would be considered pure-bloods, as they would have four magical grandparents.

Snape and Voldemort's cases are different as their fathers are both Muggles. So it would take two generations instead of one of marrying purebloods before they could have Perfect Pureblood Progeny™.

** To get a pureblood all their grandparents have to be pureblood. Anyone else with wizarding ancestry is a halfblood.

To be a pureblood pureblood society has to accept you as one of their own.

So yes, the only way to become a pureblood is by lying.

** My own preference is to have the pure-bloods themselves disagree over what being pure-blood means. I feel like this adds both complexity and realism.

#+begin_quote
  “We discussed this before,” Pansy said impatiently. “Lily Potter was a Muggleborn. That makes Vicky a half-blood. Maybe she was attacked because she's in Slytherin... you know, cleaning house and all that.” She glanced quickly at Victoria. “Not that I'm saying that's right, of course.”

  But Daphne shook her head. “That's not how it works, though. One marriage doesn't just get rid of all your family history. She's still a Potter.”

  It was an old argument.

  Having spent over a year in Slytherin, Victoria was no stranger to discussions about blood. It was just something that wizards tended to mention when they first met someone, like where they came from or what their parents did. It had always seemed perfectly harmless, and even though her mother was a Muggleborn, no one had ever treated her differently for it.

  Something had changed since the attack on Justin, however. Blood was no longer simply a matter of bragging rights---it was the difference between whether or not you were a target. Yet as she listened to Pansy and Daphne bicker, Victoria was reminded that even among pure-bloods, no one could really agree on who counted as part of the club. For some, like Daphne, it was all about your family name: the Potters were an old wizarding family, so anyone who bore their name was a pure-blood. For others, like Pansy, even a small amount of Muggle blood could ruin an otherwise impeccable lineage.

  Draco was conspicuously silent.

  “What do you think, Draco?” Victoria said, interrupting Pansy's increasingly complex hypothetical in which she had married a Muggle and all her children were squibs. “Am I half or pure?”
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  “Can I ask you something?” Victoria said.

  “By all means.”

  She told Dumbledore all about the conversation with Pansy, Daphne and Draco regarding the purity of her blood; about her fears that the other pure-bloods would laugh at her, if she claimed to be one of them; and her concern that sooner or later she would have to provide Draco with an answer. Dumbledore listened to her story attentively, his eyes only leaving her own to glance down at his plate between bites.

  “So what do you think, Professor? Am I a half-blood, or a pure-blood?”

  If he thought her question was a silly one, he didn't show it. “Before I answer---and I will answer---it is educational, I think, to consider what purpose these distinctions serve. As I have understood it, you are not suggesting that your magical talent would be greater if you were a so-called pure-blood .”

  “No,” Victoria said, not having even considered that idea.

  Dumbledore steepled his fingers. “Nor are you suggesting that your moral character depends on your blood.”

  She shook her head.

  “And so, if it does not tell us anything about your magic or your character, what is it that your blood is supposed to indicate?”

  Victoria frowned, searching for the right words, but Dumbledore answered the question for her.

  “It is your social status,” he said. “In truth, the concept of purity of blood is inextricably linked to the idea of social class. With that in mind, I would invite you to consider which is more important: a person's character and deeds, or the family they are born to.”

  He paused to take a bite of chicken.

  “When you put it like that, it seems kinda obvious,” Victoria said. In fact, it was so easy to follow the logic of his words that it took her a moment to realise that none of what he had said actually solved her problem.

  Dumbledore smiled. “It is not my place to tell you what to believe, only to equip you with the knowledge to form your own views. But so much for the principle of the matter---I promised you a straight answer to your question.”

  She leaned forward eagerly.

  “Regretfully, we must learn to navigate a society where supposed purity of blood matters to many people,” Dumbledore said. “If you will forgive me, this requires something of a history lesson. You see, soon after the Statute of Secrecy was passed, separation from Muggles came to be regarded as a point of /wizarding pride/, a concept which has only increased in popularity since Grindelwald's defeat. The division of worlds has affected all areas of life, but familial connections to Muggles have long been viewed as especially suspect---indeed, in many wizarding nations, it is still illegal for a wizard to marry a Muggle.”

  “Because they might tell the Muggles about wizards?” Victoria asked.

  “That was the original reasoning,” Dumbledore said. “However, the culture of separation quickly took on a life of its own, and wizarding pride has come to be valued in its own right. It is by this circuitous route that we come to the concept of purity. As you know, the British Ministry has never made intermarriage illegal---”

  “France too, right?”

  “---nor has France, nor several other European nations. But not everyone believed in such a liberal approach. In the early eighteenth century, a new elite rose to power, largely replacing the old wizarding nobility whose authority had derived from the Muggle king. The families composing that elite are now considered /traditionalists/, but in those days they were quite radical.”

  “You're talking about Brandon Swann, aren't you?” Victoria said, “the founder of the Ministry? We learnt about him in History.”

  “He was their leader, but he did not act alone. Indeed, your own ancestor, one Ralston Potter, was a key supporter of the Swanns,” Dumbledore said. “In their zeal for wizarding independence, the traditionalists swore a pact never to marry a Muggle, holding themselves to a stricter standard than the law required. And thus the pure-blood ideology was born, an idea which had previously existed as no more than a small movement on the fringe of wizarding society. In the years following the Statute of Secrecy, to remain pure-blooded was to advertise your family's commitment to wizarding pride, and thereby gain the favour of those in power.”

  “So... I'm a half-blood, then?” Victoria said, surprised at the depth of her disappointment. It would have been nice to fit in with the other girls. “My dad married a Muggleborn, and that's a connection to the Muggle world, isn't it?”

  Dumbledore raised a bushy eyebrow. “It is not quite so simple. Think about what I have said... who was it that first promoted the idea of blood purity?”

  “The traditionalists,” she said, the wheels turning in her head, connecting what he had said to Daphne's views. “You're saying that for the traditionalists, your family comes first. Like, maybe a family breaks the pact now and then... but they're still part of the group who made the pact in the first place.”

  “Precisely. Over the years, the traditionalist families have stuck together, even as they lost their monopoly on power. In many ways they resemble the old aristocracy which they replaced, though they never adopted the Muggle titles of nobility which their enemies had borne. It is this aristocratic aspect which is the cause of the disagreement between Miss Parkinson and Miss Greengrass.”

  “Pansy's just thinking about blood,” Victoria said, “but Daphne's right, isn't she? If the Potters were one of the families who made the pact, then we're older than the /idea/ of purity.”

  “That is the /traditionalist/ view,” Dumbledore said. He paused to pour himself a glass of white wine, taking several sips before he continued. “There is, however, a more modern viewpoint, one which attained popularity among the traditionalist youth in the years following Grindelwald's fall. It was an uncompromising ideology, in some ways more liberal, in others more conservative. That view espoused a greater separation from the Muggle world than even the traditionalists had envisaged... no one would be able to cross the divide, not even Muggleborns. Under this radical view, those of wizarding blood who embraced the new ways would be welcomed with open arms, the equal of any pure-blood, no matter their family name; but those who associated with Muggles, even indirectly, would be considered tainted by association.”

  “That sounds more like Draco,” Victoria said.

  “In part,” Dumbledore said, his expression pensive. “I suspect that Master Malfoy has been exposed to a number of ideologies, and has attempted to piece them together in a way that makes sense in his particular familial context.”

  It didn't escape Victoria that he still hadn't answered her question. “So... the answer is... Daphne and Draco are both right? Is that what you're saying?”

  “Forgive an old man's ramblings,” Dumbledore said with a chuckle. “My answer is this: were you to choose to participate in so-called pure-blood society, you would likely be welcomed by traditionalists and radicals alike. However, as you have already intimated, your treatment thereafter would largely depend on your ability to conform to their understanding of how witches and wizards should behave.”

** [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/pure-blood][According to Pottermore canon,]] blood status beyond Muggle/Magical has nothing to do with biology, but with political alignment. The average wizard doesn't ask or care about other people's blood status, and the only ones who make a big deal about it are a certain minority of purebloods.

#+begin_quote
  "To call oneself a pure-blood was more accurately a declaration of political or social intent (‘I will not marry a Muggle and I consider Muggle/wizard marriage reprehensible') than a statement of biological fact."
#+end_quote

[[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html][And according to JKR,]] all muggleborns are descended from squibs and other wizards. So technically, they count as halfbloods since they have magical ancestry from at least one side of the family. It's only because of political/social reasons that they're called "muggleborns" and treated like poop.

**** Of course it doesn't make sense. The entire "blood" thing is nonsense to begin with... it's nothing but an excuse to put on airs and claim you're superior to other people. I always thought that was the entire point of it.

The term "blood traitor" comes in when self-declared purebloods, who do consider Muggle marriages reprehensible, describe families or individuals whom they feel SHOULD share that reprehension, but don't. Hence, the Malfoys call the Weasleys "blood traitors" rather than "purebloods" because without the attitude they don't really "count."

I'm not 100% sure, but I think that whenever the terms "pureblood" or "blood traitor" appear in canon, they're used either by people like the Malfoys, Blacks or Death Eaters, or in reference to how they see things. Like, I don't think any Weasleys ever call themselved "purebloods." Ron calls himself a "blood traitor" at one point, but he basically says it as a point of pride and in reference to what the Death Eater thinks of him... kind of like how Hermione might ironically called herself "Mudblood" when summing up what the Malfoys think of her.

****** I stand by my previous statement. Most of these seem to be either in response to, or referring to, the Voldemort/Malfoyesque ideals, not as an official classification status. When Ron says Ginny is a Pureblood, he's saying it because he can't make sense of why the Pureblood-obsessed Heir of Slytherin would target her; Sirius is talking about the vaues of his family, who were total bigots; Lupin is using the word "Pureblood" to explain to Harry why James would not have called himself "Half-Blood Prince." For the rest of the example, it seems to be either a Slytherin who says it, or it's said as protection against and/or defense against someone with those values. It's hardly ever used seriously by people who aren't blood bigots.

"Blood status" is a concept that's complete bull, and it's an attitude that I definitely see the narrative disagreeing with. Trying to make sense of it is pretty much a hopeless task... but not because JKR didn't think it through. It's just because it's rooted in bigotry and elitism, and those things, by nature, DON'T make logical sense.

Of course, blood status is a BS in terms that lineage doesn't make anybody more capable, wiser, etc. Two of my wife's grandparents were the Auschwitz survivors (and our kids would still fall under the Nürnberg laws), so I can fully agree with that. However, it is not nonsense meaning it doesn't have rational construct behind it. Nazis had pretty well defined what does it mean to be an Untermensch, and I suppose that Tom Riddle & co. had pretty well defined what does it mean to be pureblood.

** This is my personal headcanon. This is strictly term-wise, I consider the entire ordeal scientifically bs.

A Muggleborn is someone born from 2 Muggles. A Pureblood has no Muggles within 2 generations of ancestry. Everyone else is a halfblood. So Harry's children are Purebloods if he procreates with a Pureblood or some halfbloods. Meanwhile, Severus, who is also a halfblood, cannot create Pureblood children since his father is a Muggle.

This means that 2 Muggleborns birth halfbloods. If this halfblood procreates with another halfblood with Muggleborn parents, their child is a first generation Pureblood.

EDIT: This made me curious about the obvious German analogy for Jewish heritage. According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischling_Test]] , they used similar, but not identical definitions (the German rules are more complicated) -- they both concern themselves with 2 generations of ancestry. This is probably what my headcanon was ultimately based on (by proxy in some fic).
