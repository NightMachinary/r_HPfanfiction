So, this fandom seems to wholly agree that Rowling showed a veneer of a magical world that was incredibly enchanting and delightful and made you want to be there (whether there's any substance behind that veneer is a matter of strong debate, hence the use of the word - I'm definitely not getting into that argument on this thread, it's not the point I'm trying to make and I'm clarifying here to hopefully avert that argument before it starts) and was, in every sense of the world, a magical thing for a child to experience.

I'm looking for fics that mimic that sense of magic and marvel, fics that make you feel like you're in a magical place of promise and majesty, those most Harry Potter of Harry Potter fics. The Disneyland of fics, basically. :D

They don't have to be actually canon to have that magical tone, nor do they have to be not-canon. Any fic done in any way with any plot is fine by me. Just has to be one that gives you similar feelings to that first time you read about Harry walking into Diagon Alley, the first time he found his wand, etc. That promise, that delight, that /magic/. ;)

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.
