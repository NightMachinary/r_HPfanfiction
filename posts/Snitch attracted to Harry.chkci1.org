So I just read Harry the Hufflepuff and now I'm searching for more fun and light-hearted fics in which the snitch seems to be attracted to Harry or another character. There are probably not that many out there considering that this is rather specific, but I hope some of you have some recommendations for me anyway :)


** 'Harry, the Snitch-Charmer' where everyone thinks he is the best Seeker of all time for consecutively catching every snitch within the first 2 minutes, but in reality it's the snitches that are pursuing Harry, because they find him hot.

During his pre-quidditch-routine we can see him shaving his legs and deciding on which lingerie to wear for the match.

** As in, sexually attracted or just attracted to him proximity wise? Sorry, this is the first time I've heard of this tbh

*** I meant proximity wise. Sexually attracted would be pretty weird but I can see that the wording might have been a bit unfortunate ðŸ˜…

**** Is it wrong Ito imagine a scene where Harry is furiously dodging the Snitch, until a Bluggers make him fall to the ground where his shrill mark the end of the match, and another "irregular catch".

** Linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff)

Honestly just started reading this and came across a chapter where Harry keeps catching the snitch because it's randomly always near him.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  While flying back from Godric's Hollow, Hagrid accidentally drops baby Harry over a wild forest. Harry is raised by rebel fairies until his Hogwarts letter arrives. The Dark Lord is in for a surprise... HP/LV romance. SLASH.
