Looking for Fics where Voldemort is a big deal in England but compared to the organizations and wizards outside of England he's not a big deal. The reason Voldemort stays in the shadow and doesn't break the International Statute of Secrecy is because he doesn't want the attention from outside England. Bonus points if Harry goes outside England to train and returns able to face Voldemort.


** Hmm, pretty interesting premise. Off the top of my head I cannot really recall reading anything much like that.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]])

I believe something similar happens in this fic, Voldemort doesn't really stack up in terms of power in regards to some of the other characters. This is pretty AU though, I mean, except for somethings it might as well be original fiction. I do enjoy them a decent amount though, perhaps due to nostalgia.

The story does sorta drag on at some points, but I personally find it a fun romp to spend some time with.

Finally, this fic is pretty damned old, and is probably rife with clich√©s and other things, so just be forewarned.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** linkffn(Animagus at War) has a similarish idea, where Voldemort is only one of several worldwide Dark Lords and Ladies, and probably not the most terrible at that. Fittingly, Dumbledore is also only Britain's number one --- he has an even match who was the Australian Minister of Magic for a while. Anyway, the story kicks off when Voldemort decides to go out and enlist the help of some of said Dark Lords so that they may help each other take over the world.

** Lightning on the Wave's Sacrifices Arc has a whole bunch of Dark/Light Lords/Ladies that could be considered the big pond that both Harry and Voldemort swim in.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]] is the first, but I recommend reading the author's "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][A couple things about this AU]]" section to see if the other parts of the story will be palatable for your tastes.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.
