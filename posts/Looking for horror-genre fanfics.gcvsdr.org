If possible:

- Complete
- Focusing on one or several of the following: Voldemort (preferably young i.e. Tom Riddle), Dementors or Death Eaters
- Should read as a horror novel
- Includes lots of details on Dark Arts and obscure magic (e.g. Horcrux rituals, creation of curses, resurrection etc..)
- Some spellfight
- If it features a romantic pairing, canon please :) (Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, Lupin/Tonks etc)


** Generally, the two most often-rec'ed writers are Ruskbyte and Voice of the Nephilim. If you check them out, they'll probably have something of interest to you.

I also vaguely remember a few things like this being rec'ed in previous threads over the last few months. My internet is struggling to upload just this message and I don't think I have the bandwidth for a prolonged search, but if you check out 'horror fics' in the search bar, you should get the lot to search through.

For example: I think Diablerie counts, judging by the way it was rec'ed to me, though I haven't read it myself to claim either way yet.

And though it meets virtually none of your criteria, I'd recommend checking out The Eyes. It is, in my opinion, the best horror fic in this fandom.
