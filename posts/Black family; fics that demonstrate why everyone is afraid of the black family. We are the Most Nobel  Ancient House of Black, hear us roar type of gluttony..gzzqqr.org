Hi all!

I'm looking for fics that give me that Goosebumps 'ooooh yessss' feeling when say Narcissa reminds everyone that first and foremostly, she is a Black. And the reasons people fear crossing them are valid (and delightful)

I'd love fics were the Black family have some wild lineage or family practices and spells. Some fics where they are all at the heart Black's, and they stop at nothing when they've been wronged. The House of Black are ancient and they do not bow type of feel, yknow?

I did (in the middle of but it doesn't seem to be updating) read a fic where Dorea Potter survived and rallied the House to adopt Harry and they created a Coven. There was story and world building and realism and House of Black fierceness and it illustrated why they were to be feared.

Can you guys point me in the right direction please? Creature fics, House of Black loyalty, powers, all of it, I don't care! If people go 'oh fuck, I remember why these ones are feared' I will love it!

Thanks guys!!

Edit: sorry just want to make it clear, it doesn't have to be only Narcissa. I am truly not picky in this!

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

It's been some time since I've read it, but I remember dark rituals and a somewhat intimidating and calculating Arcturus Black. Though it's heavily AU and focuses mostly on Harry who was raised by them.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

  The Most Noble and Ancient House of Black's public motto is Toujours Pur, always pure. But it's the private motto that sees Lord Black free his grandson Sirius from Azkaban, that sees Harry Potter raised in the Black ancestral home of Ravenswood, that changes the Wixen world forever: Familia Primum, family first.

** Dorea Potter? The woman who married Charlus Potter and had one son and is /not/ the mother of James Potter? The Dorea Potter who died in 1977?

Also the obligatory stuff on how Narcissa Malfoy is first and foremost a Malfoy, constantly supporting Lucius and Draco throughout the stories.

The fact that the Blacks were dying out, had a rash of insanity, and poor control over some of their children probably meant that they lost most respect.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear]] has some of the fanon stuff you want.

**** I have, in a surprising twist of events, hence why I offered a fic that met the request's guidelines.

#+begin_quote
  read a fic where Dorea Potter survived
#+end_quote

That said, this form of phrasing implies that the OP believes Dorea Potter is canonically James Potter's mother.

Phrasing that would indicate the OP is aware of the fic's change from canon would be something along the lines of "read a fic where Dorea Potter, here Harry's grandmother, survived".

The rest of the post falls along similar lines. It leaves an impression that the OP has a warped view of canon from fanfiction. As someone who has had the same thing happen to them (Snape and the godfather thing), I know that I would appreciate the reminder.

I don't think that offering information about canon impacts the validity of my recommendation in any way. If you've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear]] and disagree, fair enough.

***** Disregarding facts like this is what Fanfiction is all about. Taking a world/series that a professional author has created and inserting our own ideas/plot points.

Canon used to say that Charlus and Dorea were James' parents. JKR changed it to Euphemia and Fleamont. Fanon usually has it as Charlus and Dorea (mainly for a closer relation to the Blacks)

****** I don't disagree. I do disagree when fanfiction overrides canon as the default.

Canon actually never said Charlus and Dorea were James' parents. JKR published a family tree of the Blacks that mentioned Charlus and Dorea Potter.

I don't mind it if a fic has Charlus and Dorea as James' parents. I do mind if Charlus and Dorea becomes the default assumption for Harry's grandparents.
