Currently I'm listening to Stephen Fry's Harry Potter audiobooks and they are fantanstic. I wonder whether there are good fanfiction audiobooks out there. Any suggestions?


** I've found this website. Don't know whether there's any good fanfics though.

** The OP is probably looking for something that can be listened to while driving or otherwise being mostly pre-occupied with another task.

** The only one I know of is the podcast for methods of rationality. It's pretty good, they do different voices and everything. [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/harry-potter-methods-rationality/id431784580?mt=2][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]

** Erm, I think Robst has someone doing audiobooks. But you also asked for 'good,' so I'm not sure that qualifies.
