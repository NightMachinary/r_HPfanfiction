  "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING YOU MOTHERFUKERS!!!"

  It was....... Dumblydore!

But I'm sure there are people out there who have other preferred pieces in this which is arguably the best hp fanfic out there.


** “WARNING: SUM OF DIS CHAPTA IS XTREMLY SCRAY. VIOWER EXCRETION ADVISD”

What part of the fic wasn't 'SCRAY'?

** I have heard of this fic and I cannot tell you if I ever tried reading before this time as I made it to Draco Malfoy arriving and had to stop as my brain stem started trying to shut down my bodily functions in an attempt to stop. No telling what may have happened if I had tried before.

Holy crap, we as a species need to apologize for this.

*** Why do I think in a 2D 8-bit based Harry Potter platformer sequel with it's levels and worlds based on the fandom plots, this fic would probably be a second half to a “Crappy Fics” world, and to complete levels, you get to jump onto detonators to destroy the levels, and the third level and fourth/boss level of the crappy fic world would be based on this fic, where in level 3, you have to face this world's version of Snape and Lupin as a duo mini boss to get your level complete detonator back after they snatch it, with Ebony being the main boss of the world in the fourth level, would this possibly be something you would play? (Note: The graphics would be something in low-bit quality for these levels)

The original got deleted... Don't skip the author's notes.

I'd suggest to find a dramatic reading on YouTube (keep in mind, some are better than others).

  On what seems like an ordinary day in Hogwarts Lily and company find themselves in a surreal reality that seems to hinge entirely on a strange transfer student by the name of Ebony Way. Now, with reality tearing at the seams, Lily must find a way to save the universe before everything she knows and loves sinks into a goffick abyss. Crossover with the immortal fic "My Immortal"

** This is a masterpiece. This is "The Room" of Fanfiction and I thank you for bringing it to my attention. I have already recommended this to 10 people in the hopes that ENOBY will not crawl out of my monitor. Favorite part by far are the author's notes which are the thing that finally convinced me that this was written on a stolen Motorola Sidekick in a drafty cellar by a golden retriever with a lazy eye and severe head trauma.
