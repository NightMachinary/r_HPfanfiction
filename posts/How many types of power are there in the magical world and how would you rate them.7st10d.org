I would say that theirs three mains types of power in the magical world: Magical power, monetary power and political power.

and I would rate them in the order of :

1. Magical power if you have enough Magical power the other two aren't hard to get. and its very hard to lose it once you have it.

2. Monetary power is a distant second to magical power with it you can increase the amount of magical power you have by being able to pay for information and equipment but that can only take you so far and unlike magical power it is a lot more fickle.

3. political power is the weakest of the three and Someone with enough magical power can mostly ignore it. after all Political power is only useful when you can enforce it and magical can give people a level of Independence that makes that very difficult.

so what would you say are the Main types of power in the magical world and how would you rate your list?


** Voldemort and Dumbledore were magical power. Everyone looked up at them in either admiration or fear.

Lucius Malfoy was monetary power. He bribed his way out of Azkaban, but was taken down once he ran into a situation he could not simply pay off.

Fudge and Umbridge were political power. They were able to cause a lot of trouble, but were mediocre at best when it came to magic. The former fell into a spiral of delusion that cost him everything he had worked for, while the latter got outsmarted by a sixteen-year old witch with a grudge.

*** Who would you say is the most balanced we see in the canon I would say it's Authur Weasly he has a larger than average magical talent that he passed onto all his children. And once all his children move out he and Molly will be comfortable money wise with just two people living off a ministry department head salary. And he seems to have More then enough political power to protect his interest in muggle stuff considering he managed to push threw a muggle protection Bill that even Lucius Malfoy with all his money was unable to block which was the reason Lucius gave Ginny the Diary in her first year.

*** I'd argue that Malfoy, Voldemort, and Dumbledore all had significant political power too. If your followers have some sort of power, than as the leader, you do too (though magical power doesn't quite translate as directly).

**** yep its pretty much a tier system Magical power will get you Money and political power threw followers example Voldemort stared off as a no name Orphan and threw his magical power because one of the most powerful people in The magical world , Money will allow you to get Political power and Increase your Magical power although if not used well will eventually fail you example Lucius Malfoy and Political power for those with out Magical or Monetary power turns you into a bottom feeder like Fudge who will horde what little power they can get and will be left with nothing when there usefulness runs out.

** I feel like this is quite a strange question, rooted rather in personal philosophy than any measurable sort of system. It's not nearly as simple as three very broad “powers”, as two of them are a societal thing whereas the other is a truly personal aspect.

My opinion is the opposite to how you've listed it, the power of a massive group of people is staggeringly larger than your individual ability to change the world around you. It's like comparing linear and exponential functions, one increases at a set rate - it can't expand past that limit; the other has an increasing rate of change - it goes beyond its limits as part of its nature.

Honestly I would say that political power, true political power, would have to involve all three of them. All of these powers require the others to function effectively, and I would argue that any piece of FanFiction should aim to include all of them fairly equally to keep the story interesting and engaging.
