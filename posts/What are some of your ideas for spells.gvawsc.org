One of mine is the Inertness Charm. The charm will prevent chemical reactions from occurring in the environment but will be unable to affect chemical reactions within people. This would be another way to neutralize fire, protect the ministry against mundane explosives, and the release of some chemical weapons that rely on chemical reactions in the environment.

More advanced users (like those that would cast it as a protective enchantment) can be more selective with the spell. Only harmful and potentially dangerous reactions would be halted. More harmless reactions like rusting would still occur under the more advanced versions of this charm.

The most advanced users could even start to render magical substances inert. Exploding fluid would lose its explosive powers.

Obviously there are a few issues with the charm and suspension of disbelief, but a little bit of handwaving over magic and I think it could be an interesting charm. I look forward to seeing some other ideas.


** I subscribe to Merriam-Webster's daily word emails and often save the text (to a doc) at the end of the email that goes into greater depth about the origins of the word because they contain great ideas for future spells.

A lot of English words are rooted in Latin or Greek, so are perfect for shaping into future spells.

For instance, the other day the Word of the Day was: *eolian*: borne, deposited, produced or eroded by the wind.

When [[http://click.wotd.m-w.com/?qs=91805f1c7b57563a5f7d7b1cdf7e9f24eb5dfcf0f0f8a89dd0630e75c64cbee9aabc1ef5aeae5aff91954e655d8a17fb7f293daff77fe66ea550f764f93629aa][Aeolus]] blew into town, things really got moving. *He was the Greek god of the winds and the king of the floating island of Aeolia.* In The Odyssey, Homer claims Aeolus helped Odysseus by giving him a favorable wind. Aeolus also gave English speakers a few terms based on his name, including the adjective eolian (also spelled [[http://click.wotd.m-w.com/?qs=91805f1c7b57563aa2aeb1b01c9d5c440df171714f9433e3d54031b55da123569e1253a912380aab32ca94a5179ac25f5c642ccdead7ce881160fd4b08082009][aeolian]]), which is often used for wind-sculpted geological features such as caves and dunes, and [[http://click.wotd.m-w.com/?qs=91805f1c7b57563a8b9043f68293f87082fe70ed90ac2432ab605c5a1d75fb7dc9bd7ae5e6961db4f26f1d055033acdcb4acbf7ce41616979e84efd8ff6a1670][aeolian harp]], the name for an instrument that makes music when the wind blows across its strings.

This also tied in nicely to another fanfiction that I enjoy--The Name of the Wind.

** /Aquila Visioviola/ - the Eagle Eye spell; a targeted spell that lets one see into the ultraviolet spectrum as many species of birds do. Great for seeing things at night, especially if you can cast Lumos in the UV spectrum.

/Teallach/ - the Hearthfire spell; conjure a contained cooking fire including a spit or, with enough finesse, a cooking pot. Convenient for camping trips!

/Lectio Libri/ - the Page-Turning spell; cast on a book, and the pages will automatically turn on their own once you've read to the end. The book can even be held in place in the air before you with this spell, though this works best with hardcover books.

** A throwing spell. Rather like levatating banishing or summoning, this would be a charm. Select the object say the spell with the intent to move the object fastly to a particular point. The bigger the object the more power needed. The further the aimpoint the more power needed. The more precise a throw the more skill and concentration. I imagine various sports would involve this,wizarding disk golf, catch, javalin in the wizarding Olympic games. Also perfect for Weasley twins playing keep away with Ron or Ginny's toys.

** I'm a big fan of normal or even mundane spells being used in novel or unexpected ways.

For example, turning the Lumos spell into a laser, or transfiguring a tiny amount of an enemy into anti-matter. Both of which I know have featured in fics before.

There are others I can think that I'm uncertain have been featured in fics before. For example Scourgify I could easily be seen used as a method of torture, or the Accio being used on an anchored object could be used to move towards that object quickly (useful in the absence of Apparition, though I do acknowledge that it'd more likely just cause the user to disarm themselves).

Hell a general Finite Incantatum could possibly be one of the most dangerous spells you could cast on a person, as it's possible, even likely, that many magicals have active spells or potions in them that, casting an over powered/general purpose Finite Incantatum might disable those effects.

*** I read a story where Voldemort wanted Snape to torture an auror to death and he used household/cooking spells like apple coring and potato peeling. Then he terrified Voldemort by having the auror say a poem he (Snape) made up knowing Voldemort would believe he heard a prophesy from 'the blind seer' or the blind prophet or whatever the myth is. Then he told the Order about his fake prophesy so the could quote bits of it like everyone one knew it to be true... I got a little off topic, but I thought you'd appreciate other people using mundane spells too. The DEs didn't know what to think.

** Perhaps the inertness charm can have a modifier attached to it, like "magia", becoming "inerto magia", and rendering some basic magical reactions and spells inert. At higher levels of skill, it is basically the stasis spell that's so popular in fics, and prevents any sort of chemical or magical reaction in the object it was cast over, meaning potions don't decay, magical swords don't rust or lose their power (though their abilities are also "paused"), and so on.

*** That's actually interesting. I've never really thought about a stasis charm like that. That said, they always seem to be used to preserve the condition of a substance. A sodium hydroxide solution, for example, would be prevented from degrading via evaporation or a potion might be kept drinkable with a stasis charm. But they don't seem to render it inert. I could use the sodium hydroxide solution, for example, in a reaction, or drink the potion. An inertness charm would prevent it from being used as a reactant. I also imagine it with a greater scale. Stasis charms are cast on objects like cauldrons whereas the inertness charm I imagined is usually cast on buildings, rooms, and only a few objects. Edit: Ignore the example of the potion. I rushed this reply and forgot a key concept around the own charm I envisioned, namely it only works in the environment. You would be able to drink the potion but be unable to combine it with others for potions or alchemical purposes.

**** hmmm. I suppose you'd probably need to lift the spell before drinking your potion or using your solution, then. And it seems likely to me that a modifier like that (which doesn't explicitly increase size or effect along an existing vector) would basically not change the spell's requirements, but decrease its area of effect to compensate. So the normal Inertness Charm works on a room even for a novice caster, while the magic dampening modifier shrinks the novice area down to maybe the size of a teacup, which grows larger and stronger with practice.

***** Not really, the way I envisioned it, the most advanced forms of the charm would be unable to affect substances within people and could selectively limit reactions. You could drink the potion and use your solution so long as the reaction is not within the remit of the spell. In short, a novice caster can limit all chemical reactions within the area of the charm (but not magical ones) but a experienced caster (like one that may charm the ministry) can cast one to allow desired reactions but prevent dangerous mundane and magical reactions.

I'm going to be honest and say that I don't understand your thoughts on the "modifier". My thoughts on scale were meant to compare my inertness charm to the intruder charm and the stasis charm to something like an anti-theft charm. Still, your thoughts have allowed me to refine my idea a little more, I'm reconsidering magical substances a little now. I think my example with the potion didn't quite capture how I considered it would work with magical substances perfectly.

****** I could be wrong, but I'm assuming they meant modifier as in how one can modify the patronus charm to act as a messenger. If that's the case I also have a modifier for you to use of you want. I didn't name the spell but it stops foreign chemical reactions in a body. It's uses are to stop or pause a person/animal from a poisen interacting with them until said poisen can be neutralized and/or removed. Somewhat like how I see a bezoar to work. Also works to stop the process of saponification if lye is spilt on one's hands.

She escaped (no thanks to the party!) and focused on elemental magic. Her preferred method of injuring the demons sent after her was to encase their genitals in ice then shooting them off (this character was a ranger before capture, I stopped putting ranks in ranger after but that didn't mean I lost the skills previously earned).

** Once I used an unnamed Native American tribal spell, that is the best know healing spell. It's so strong that the MACUSA gets instantly reported every time they use it and they always investigate it because it can kill the caster if they are not experienced enough, making it super risky to use.

I haven't written the story, but I have an idea for a spell named 'Inferno', which basically makes a giant fire blast that my heroes use against a horde of inferi.

There's an also unnamed curse from the same story idea that works like an infection that turns the victim's blood into a black goo that causes permanent damage everywhere that it randomly manifests. In my story, a female character would be cursed, but even with stopping it within minutes, it would damage her lungs so much that she could only breathe with magic, her eyes until the point that she almost goes blind and her womb and ovaries, making her infertile. Yep, pretty brutal, I know. And it knocks her out for weeks, but that's just for some cliffhanger material.

Another one I used sometimes is called 'Lubricate', but I guess you can figure out what it does. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

** ironskin/ward armour/ zhonyas

if your familiar with Zhonyas hourglass from league of legends or armour lock from halo reach, that would be a good one. basically temporarily either transfigure yourself or magically shield coat oneself to become invulnerable. i feel temporary immobility would be a reasonable drawback and it would make logistical sense given a static object is easier to reinforce.

this would not be invincible against such things as avada kedavra but the ability to weather any circumstance for a moment could be very valuable.

for example a wizard about to be hit by a car/thrown boulder/ fireball/ potion explosion. it would also allow you to essentially self cast around you and survive the results. about to be swarmed by grindilows, drop a delayed concussive spell in the water and ironskin to live through it.

*** animation charms

standard hit a broom sorcerors apprentice. maybe more specific spells to give automatic orders and to animate specific objects. frankly was perplexed why this wasnt a more common idea in harry potter.

id also imagine common use of this spell on objects would begin to build up even after the task had been completed leading to the tempermental armour stand and stair cases.

also if your familiar with doctor strange the marvel movie theres a scene where baron mordo steps up and pushes off of air as he maneuvers in a spar with strange. i imagine it cant literally counteract gravity permanently but it essentially is a permanent double jump enchanted on his boots

** Most spells i designed were curses, but i think i have some pretty interesting ones.

Scalpere - The Flaying Wind curse - Was created at first by Isaac Moondreamer ( OC created by me, a sadistic, sassy and annoying ravenclaw that was one of Harry's best friends, in spite of his personality he thinks that the killing curse is boring so he created a curse that would make death a little more exciting than just green light) The Scalpere curse fires a continuous wave o silvery wind towards the enemy, the said wind then Flays it's targets alive and leave them without any of their skin in the body, the effectivines of the curse is proportional to the time the victim was exposed to the wind.

Counter Aegis - The Thorn-Shield charm. - Designed also by Isaac but he was unable to use it, it becames one of Harry's favorites during my GoF AU, This is an intelligent shield charm that senses intent of people arround the caster, it prevents them from aproaching the user by extending itself and attacking with sharp macical tentacles, it also fires a wave of magic thorns in the direction that some spell struck it.

Sana Cicer - The Deadly Air charm. - Sana Cicer was designed by another OC of mine ( Alice de Blois, was a genious french witch that studied in Hogwarts during the seventies, she was also a Ravenclaw and a great researcher of Blood Magic, she was 4 years younger than lily and was the one who gave the redhead the ritual wich protected Harry, later in life some months after the end of the first wizard war she disappeared. ) The Deadly Air is a charm that uses sound waves to make the air arround the tip of the caster's wand to pulse in accelerated rythm, making the wand into a pretty dangerous melee weapon that can pulverize solid things with ease, the main disadvantage it's the low reach.

Gladium - The blade summoning charm. - Gladium was created by Harry with inspiration in one of Isaac's spells, its a simple charm that envelops his wand with golden energy that takes the shape of a sword, it's an abnormally sharp blade that while activated the user cannot use magic with his wand, it has two special habilities that are, the power to shot long range slashes and the power of antimagic, the blade can cut trough most of spells and nullify shield charms, with enough power can be used to destroy wards and the ones who got strucked with it, will have their magic in a weaked state for awhile, low ranking wizards can't do magic if affected with it.

​

Eviscerate - The Mooncrest Ripping curse. - The Ace spell of Isaac Moondreamer, it does't have a fix wand movement, it fires a great bright purple energy slash that have the shape of a half moon. The Magic schythe will be fired proportionally to the wand movement used during the incantation (If the user uses a vertical motion than the slash will be fired vertically and so on), this curse does't have any counters so it's wounds are very difficult to heal, also it was designed by Isaac as a shield breaker spell, it has a unique capability of panetration, when it strikes a spell it shatters in little purple and sharp fragments that can pass trough shield charms and maim the enemy with part of the power that the original slash had.\\
The greater the difference of power between the Shield and the curse, the greater will be the damage of the shards. Focusing at leats an above average level of magic in the spell would make it powerful enough to tore a person apart if striked directly.

Those were my favorites, there are others that i did't developed as much so they're not so important but they're:

The Physical elevation wandless charm; The Starfall Storm charm; The invisible stunner and the Compressed air bullet curse.

*** Have you heard of the dnd homebrew called tentacles of forced intrusion? There's one similar with thorns that causes an additional 1d8 piercing damage. I don't remember the name but I just called it my raping tentacles. (I love DMs that allow home brews) my party and I killed a youngish white dragon much more easily with the help of those thorny vines. Your shield sounds similar.

** A spell that would pull the heat from something. So you could flash freeze something and then you have all that energy ready to be used for something else.

An enchantment that can be put on clothes that absorb the kinetic energy of things that hit it. Either it would use that energy to charge it or you could direct the energy as an attack. It would mean that bullets, rocks whatever would be useless and all you have to worry about really is spells.

An enchantment that lets you feel air currents/earth vibrations based on movement. So while it would take practice, you could literally feel every move people ar making around you.

** An illusion spell. Would create images and sound of whatever the caster wanted. The larger and more complex the image or sound the harder it would be to use. But someone like Dumbledore, or Voldemort could possibly create the illusion not being somewhere fake and use the illusion to trick people into talking or doing things they wouldn't otherwise.

Though more ordinarily it would be used to display things that couldn't be shown in person. Like images of a holiday, or a dementor in a classroom. Or even used by parents to weave the most epic stories of all for their children.

And because you lot are dark af...

You could create the illusion of things following someone. Or other creepy things and drive a person to madness with it.
