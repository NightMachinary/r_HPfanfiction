  Oh, and if somebody reading this are good writers; I'd love you forever if you wrote a morally and ethically dubious SI OC in the HP world that just abused everything for their own goals.
#+end_quote

I don't know if I'd call myself a 'good' writer, so much as I'm a D&D DM who writes stuff.

But... I'm possibly four chapters ahead of your request (fifth stalled due to beta/editor being on vacation outside of internet range) it's... half SI / half Tom Riddle in that the SI merged with the diary horcrux and emerged with a mishmash of memories a few months later.

  Reborn as a halfblood in 1920s France, I panicked. Grindelwald was coming, and there was only one place that would be safe. Hogwarts. And I'd do anything to make it past twenty this time around. Self Insert.

  I never pretended to know what I was doing in my last life. Why should I pretend to know anything about this one? Well, the other option is a horrific and bloody death, so...I better start learning how to be a witch. OC Self-Insert/Draco's Younger Sister. [DEAD]
