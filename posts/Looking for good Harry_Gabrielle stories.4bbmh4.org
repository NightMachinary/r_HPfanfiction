Slightly too perfect, but a pleasant read. It's well-known though, so chances are you've read it already.

** *The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382), although a harem story, Gabrielle does play a big role in it. This fic is very well written and fun to read.

*** I am. I just finished 'The Lie I've Lived' and i can never get enough of H/F.

I'm pretty sure it's not because i like Fleur more than some of the other girls Harry usually gets paired with but rather that Harry is usually more mature in fics that he gets paired with Fleur in.

So really, i think i'm looking for mature Harry more than Harry/Fleur and ideally both.

**** I read His Angel a while ago. It was pretty fluffy if I remember correctly but I don't think I finished it. When a veela cries was one of the first Harry/Fleur fics I read. It seems be abandoned now though. It was very dark buy amazing. Bit angsty though. Euphoria was a good canon rehash fic. The description made it sound pretty boring but I really liked it. Of course there is also Wastelands of Time which is a must read. I've probably read more but that's all I can think of right now. Sorry for not linking them but I'm on my phone. They should be easy to find from google.

** linkffn(the Little Veela that Could by Darth Drafter)

It's not exactly Harry/Gabrielle or even Harry/Hermione, but they're the central characters. Charming ideas but made the unfortunate choice of presenting Dumbledore in Snidely Whiplash mode.
