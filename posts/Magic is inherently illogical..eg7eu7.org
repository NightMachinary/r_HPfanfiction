Something often brought up in fan fiction is that wizards don't have a shred of logic. Even basic logic that we tend to take for granted. But I've been thinking that this actually makes sense. Of course wizards don't think logically, what's the point? Magic can fundamentally change anything to the point where you can't even look at water and say “that's wet” or a two story building and say “that has two floors” or a dog and say “that's a mammal”. And if this is the case then no doubt the muggleborns are going to have a hard time getting on. (Not to mention the culture shock, language barrier, and monetary problems they will have if the wizarding world really separated from the muggle one so long ago)

Regarding Snape's puzzle, it does involve logic, but if we take magic to the next level then there are space bending spells, and illusions, and just straight up lies. Let's be honest, who would try and solve the riddle, and who would just use magic to dispel the fire, or scan the contents of the bottles, or drink all the bottles, and have the poison removed later?

What are everyone else's thoughts about this?


** I'd say that magic is perfectly logical but the rules are /different/. It seems illogical but that's only because muggles and young muggleborns don't /know the rules/.

***** That's fanon!arithmancy, though. Pretty sure in canon it's more abut numerology and predicting the future.

Real (non-HP) arithmancy would, for example, assign a number to each letter in your name, add them up, and claim to tell something about you based on the result. Presumably the HP one is something similar, but of course with magic.

******** My head-canon, from those two things and Hermione being stoked about loads of complicated equations, is that arithmancy is a number-based form of divination that lets you find things out, represented as /other/ numbers, by magic.

So on the one hand, you can 'divine' the contents of a bank account and 'divine' compound interest and so on, using magic the way we use silicon chips to do our calculating for us, faster than the human brain could get there.

On the other, you can 'divine' the right ingredients for a potion, or the right syllables for an incantation, based on magical properties as represented as numbers, or you can divine how many years ago something was broken, or, in fact, actually a future outcome from current events.

That would all seem a whole lot more useful than crystal balls and tea leaves and vague answers. You use /equations/ to get a /number/ so it /has/ to be logical, right?\\

But it could also be totally something like, you cant a spell, asking a question, that spits out a number, then you find its prime factorization, and each factor means something about the answer. And if you ask, say, "How to defeat Voldy", it returns really big numbers nobody can factor.

****** Maybe so, but I would argue that if it was only numerology, it wouldn't be worth 4 years as a subject. If Ancient Runes allows you to cursebreak and enchant after taking it, and it is held as one of the harder subjects, it makes more sense for there to be something else there. If it was about prediciting the future though, I find it strange that Hermione wouldn't try to make use of it in Diviniation, given she tends towards subjects with more substance. Surely it would come up right?

Also, even if we only take the numerology component to be true, that still implies that the random, chaotic view of magic in the world is still governed by some mathematical priniciples?

TBH, I think we are inherently discussing something the Rowling didn't entirely think through when she was coming up with these courses

** This has come up a lot, and it basically boils down to if you hold a naturalist philosophy or not.

Naturalists believe the world is made up of only natural laws. If you hold to this belief, magic would be potentially understandable/logical. And science would be completely applyable.

Current users of magic need not be logical, no more than ancient sailor's need to understand the world is round.

The opposite, of course, is supernaturalism, which holds something outside of nature can influence nature (such as a god, but not a god that exists in nature).

So magic is either simply another natural force/system we do not fully understand, or it is tapping into a spiritual system whose rules do not live in the natural world.

I strongly prefer the naturalist view. Science the shit out of that magic!!
