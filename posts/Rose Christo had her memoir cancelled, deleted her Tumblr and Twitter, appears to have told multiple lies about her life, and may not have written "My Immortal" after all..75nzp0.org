[[https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/9/16428248/my-immortal-still-a-mystery-rose-christo-fake][There's a lot of information to unpack here,]] but for those wishing to follow the links in the article, let me advise you NOT to attempt visiting Kiwi Farms to try and see the evidence for yourself.

Also, someone has now set up an entire subreddit for [[/r/Myimmortaldrama]]. I'm not sure how much more of the story will be revealed, given that the book deal is off and Rose Christo (whoever she is) is now completely off the grid, but stay tuned for any further updates.


** Her story did sound outlandish though I tried to give her the benefit of doubt. I don't know how true these new developments are but it's hard to believe such an old and shitty fanfic can stir up so much drama.

*** The delicious drama is not so much about the fanfic, as it is about Christo claiming she was native american (she's greek), she was abused (apparently a lie), she was in child porn (also a lie) and she was in foster care (actually lived and lives with her grandmother).

And he says it's the grandma who told her she was sexually abused when she was too young to remember it, that she seems to believe it, and that it might even be true for all he knows.

Well, I'd gathered that much already, given how old her Tumblr page was. I can't remember how old precisely, but I did go into the archive page when it was still active and it had been around for quite a few years already. According to her Goodreads page, her first novels were self-published in 2012, so the "fake Native American" shtick has been going on for at least five years.

****** From what's given on the books description (which is still on amazon) and from what it used to say on her tumblr FAQ, she was separated from her younger brother by the foster care system after she was sexually abused by her mother/mother's boyfriend (which is where the child pornography thing comes into it) and wasn't able to find him again despite searching, and somehow the fanfiction comes into this as a way for her to try to mobilise a searching team for him or something? According to one of the posts I've seen though I can't really remember which (I've been rather obsessively following all this lmao) she admits that the publishers kinda pushed the idea that she was using the fic to search for her brother but I think it would be a kinda odd thing for a publisher to push, some people might argue you're going for the fans of my immortal but it's such a niche group it seems a dumb thing to do.

Years later, she's set to publish a memoir of all this called /Under the Same Stars: The Search for My Brother and the True Story of My Immortal/. Not saying it can't happen but it sounds like a plot from a soap opera.

***** ...And that's /another/ weird thing about all this. Apparently, her memoir wasn't going to end with her finding her brother, because right before she deleted her Twitter page, she sent out a series of "it's-been-so-long-since-I've-seen-you-I-have-so-much-to-say-to-you" messages. I'm seriously questioning whether the brother is even real, especially since we have yet to see him and Theresa / Rose interacting on the same social media platform together.

Tbh, at this point, the whole thing feels like some big, weird, experimental MFA thesis in fiction writing that is playing out in real life. Which of these characters are real? Which are fictional? How can we tell, when everyone interacts through the medium of the internet? Are we in a post-reality world where we're just one giant fiction, or are we instead in a post-fiction world where anything can be real?

It's still up in the air whether she is the author of my immortal or not simply because the brother wasn't in contact with her then so he has no idea if she did write it or not.

While I'm mostly inclined to believe the brother and think Rose Christo was lying whilst also being a victim of gas lighting to some degree, the whole situation is a bit odd particularly that apparent random half sibling who shows up at one point in the kiwifarms thread and then disappears and isn't mentioned again by either the brother or Rose

There's not really anything to look at anymore, and if she didn't write "My Immortal", then none of this is really that relevant to the HP fandom. But it's certainly been a wild ride, and an upsetting one, and I do hope this family works out their private issues soon. It's just unfortunate that so many of those issues ended up becoming public.

** this was actually in reply to a different comment that got deleted but since i already wrote it all out i figured i'd post it anyway

I think it's pretty certain at this point that she at least lied to some extent. She posted on her twitter, while not directly @ing anyone, it was definitely in response to the stuff that was written by the brother on kiwifarms which definitely made it seem like she believed him. She deleted her FAQ after becoming aware of the kiwifarms thread which is where the majority of the mentions of her being native american and having been in child pornography came from. And then after all that, she posted on her tumblr basically addressing it all and it was pretty clear from that that the guy was her brother, that the screenshots of conversations he posted to the thread were between the two of them and that there was at least some truth to what he was saying.

Whether the brother does have the whole story is a whole other kettle of fish, he openly admits that their mother is a terrible person and other people have pointed out with the terrible homelife they were living it's very possible that both of them were lied to and so to them, their version of the story is true. As for her being Native American and sexually abused, which are the two main things people are talking about her lying about, who actually knows tbh. She says the father on her birth certificate isn't her biological father but the brother didn't seem to be aware of this until she said this to him at a later point once they'd gotten back in contact, but he does say that their grandmother used to call herself a Native American because she was born there. I mean she certainly looks white to me but that doesn't really mean anything tbh, she might have Native American ancestry but even if she does, she had two white parents listed as her biological parents on her birth certificate which she herself has admitted so even if she were some part Native American, she wouldn't have been recognised as such by the state. Her experience in foster care or the custody issues which took place wouldn't have been the same as someone who was recognised as Native American because of this even if she is part Native American, the struggles of which her book directly references and was for all intents and purposes there to highlight don't apply to her and weren't something she lived through despite claiming to.

As for the sexual abuse, I do think there is a chance this could have happened and the brother was simply lied to about it by their mother. If it didn't, it seems as if she was gaslighted into believing it by her Grandmother so she's still a victim of abuse either way.

You definitely don't have to believe everything the brother says, but there's no question really that he is her brother and there is some truth to the stuff he said. Unless of course they're both the same person and we are all being extremely catfished lmao.

There's still pages for it on [[https://books.google.com/books?id=yns0DwAAQBAJ&dq=rose+christo+under+the+same+stars&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwim97iX2OzWAhWLgVQKHRvfBh0Q6AEIJjAA][Google Books]] and [[https://play.google.com/store/books/details?pcampaignid=books_read_action&id=yns0DwAAQBAJ][Google Play]], although those links may also be dead before long.

******** Yeah, I just checked again myself and I can't find it either, though it was definitely still up for preorder yesterday when I checked before replying to someone else on this thread. I wonder how many people had actually preordered it though, I hope they get their money back

Edit: looking at the reviews on Goodreads, a comment on there from 18 days ago says that the book is full of lies? I wonder who that is

** I think the reason that this whole story is so convoluted is that new pieces of information are coming in that neither convincingly corroborate or debunk any of the previous information. My interest in "My Immortal" is largely tied to its place in the narrative of how the internet talks about mental illness particularly in reference to teenage girls.

*** ...And it would now appear that some amount of mental illness was involved in its creation. I'm starting to favor the "multiple personality disorder" theory that [[/u/dusangpartout]] suggested earlier in this thread.

**** Okay, I understand the appeal a theory like that has. It's edgy, sexy, weird, etc. I would just like to remind us that we are not psychologists and even if we were, we are not her psychologist. Throwing around specific illnesses that we don't have a complete understanding of in relation to this person and our perceptions of her behavior in a public forum is not a look I want to be a part of really.

***** I agree. FYI, I'm not going along with the theory because it's "edgy, sexy, weird" - I'm leaning toward it because I think it sounds plausible and it fits with my theory that perhaps all these social media profiles are the same person communicating through multiple personae. But I'm not a professional psychologist or psychiatrist. I don't know if anybody else here is, but still, that doesn't change the fact that every person is different and we can't make broad diagnoses about this one person (who we still don't have a very clear picture of) based on what we've seen in other people.

It's easy to get caught up in all the drama and forget that this is an actual person with actual pain in their lives. As I've said before, this whole scenario has gotten to the point where it doesn't seem real - it seems like metafiction that is playing out in real life. But unless she's the greatest internet troll of all time, and she only /appears/ to be mentally unstable, this is very much real and I hope she's OK wherever she is. This may be a controversial statement, but I don't even care how much she lied as long as she's working things out in her life and getting the help she deserves.

****** I don't mean this rude at all, but your theory is really far-fetched, and it kind of does a disservice to the brother (who has been doxxed) - calling him a persona of Rose's.

****** u/MolochDhalgren:

  pain in their lives
#+end_quote

That plural was intentional, btw. She does appear to have been living multiple lives - and I do find it troubling that even her fictional lives were so messed-up. I think most people who created an alter ego like that would want said alter ego to have a /happier/ life than their own. Instead, she went even darker and created that "I-was-in-child-porn" story. Again, I can't give a psychiatric diagnosis, but that just doesn't seem like a good sign to me.

I repeat: I hope she's OK.
