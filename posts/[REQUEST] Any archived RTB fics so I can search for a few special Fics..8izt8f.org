I am hoping one can rehost as many RTB fics as possible from the 2012 and 2013 archives of FFN, and let me know what good ones exist in the harrypotterfanfiction.com and ao3 archives. RTB is the only instance of canon pairings and events I can stand, with some exceptions. Plus a few FFN RTB fics evaded me, such as one series from 2012-2014 that, by DH, lead to old!Hermione having Rose at the Burrow. In my favorite and now lost FFN RTB fic: ~Harry Potter and Yargly's Staff???, Luna Lovegood meets an old wizard with a staff, named Yargly, after DH, and pulls the ENTIRE cast, including Tom Riddle, out of their times, and reads the books in the great hall. Please help me find these deadfics, I am getting nostalgic just hearing about the archives. Check Portkey and that dead HP/HG pairing site archives as I want RTB. Also find me untouched Ao3 RTB fics.
