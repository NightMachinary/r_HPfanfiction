*** was coming here to post this! Definitely follow her "order to read" list.

I also enjoy quite a bit of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2505393/Epeefencer][Epeefencer's]] stuff. (Choices/More Choices/The Most Powerful Magic). It's not entirely cannon compliant. But it's nice.

*** Yes, but A Peccatis is not done yet! And it leaves off at a cliffhanger ending currently and now I'm very impatient :(

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?
