He had the wand, he found the ring, and why in the world would Dumbledore give an 11 year old an ancient powerful artifact that would supposably allow him to even hide from death let alone regular magic users? Answer, he wouldn't, for the greater good he would give Harry a regular cloak of invisibility and he probably planned on switching it out if he survived with the real thing.

Yea yea, Dumbledore died, but he somehow was able to wait for and talk to Harry at the crossroads? Spirits that should have been wanting to protect Harry encouraged him to sacrifice himself when he used the ring?

In my opinion cannon Dumbledore is a moderately good man, but he is indeed a criminal and a manipulator. For the Greater Good means that the Lesser Good are sacrificed to preserve the Greater Good, and Harry Potter has always been the Lesser Good in Dumbledore's mind.

Dumbledore hadn't been into "greater good" in over 50 years by the time canon started.

For that matter, no, Dumbledore didn't sacrifice Harry Potter. Dumbledore, faced with a situation where Harry was anchoring Voldemort to life through the horcrux in his scar, orchestrated what was possibly the /only way/ for Harry to defeat Voldemort and survive.

he hadn't been into the greater good in the context of grindelwald's ideology, but he definitely still supports the /essence/ of it- which is why he lets snape mistreat the students and why he sought out lockhart to expose him

**** The way I think about it, Dumbledore doesn't pursue "greater good" as much as having to choose the lesser evil. I've outlined what a GreaterGood!Dumbledore would have been like in a sibling post.

Consider that good potioneers don't grow on trees, and Snape, for all his personality, was actually a pretty competent teacher: despite their misgivings, Harry and Ron did well on their OWLs. And, Snape needed to be under his protection, because not having a spy in Voldemort's camp when he came back would have been disastrous. I think there is also an unrelated personality flaw in play: Dumbledore does try to see the best in people. I suspect that he hoped that Snape would get better over time.

With respect to Lockhart, he was scraping the bottom of the barrel due to the DADA curse. There probably wasn't a good teacher to be had, so it was making the best out of a bad situation.

***** well, according to jkr and on pottermore:

#+begin_quote
  Why does Professor Dumbledore allow Professor Snape to be so nasty to the students (especially to Harry, Hermione, and Neville)?

  JKR: "Dumbledore believes there are all sorts of lessons in life ... horrible teachers like Snape are one of them!"

  *Albus Dumbledore's plans, however, ran deep.* He happened to have known two of the wizards for whose life's work Gilderoy Lockhart had taken credit, and was one of the only people in the world who thought he knew what Lockhart was up to. Dumbledore was convinced that Lockhart needed only to be put back into an ordinary school setting to be revealed as a charlatan and a fraud. Professor McGonagall, who had never liked Lockhart, asked Dumbledore what he thought students would learn from such a vain, celebrity-hungry man. Dumbledore replied that â€˜there is plenty to be learned even from a bad teacher: what not to do, how not to be'.

  *Lockhart might not have been keen to return to Hogwarts, given how well his career of stolen glory was progressing, had Dumbledore not dangled the promise of Harry Potter over his fame-hungry head (a ruse that Dumbledore was to repeat four years later, when another teacher needed to be persuaded to come back to school).*

he actively pursued and convinced lockhart to join

****** Thanks for the reference. I don't think there's a contradiction, though. He'd run out of good teachers after losing one per year for 30-40 years. Can you blame him for being strategic when selecting from among the bad ones?

*** Oh, yeeah, Harry is alive. What about *literally* everything else? All other people? All other... not-people? Government, being maybe even more corrupt? School, being really bad in learning, apparently?

**** I think that you might be making my case for me here. Dumbledore failed in these things because he wasn't ruthless /enough/.

A GreaterGood!Dumbledore could have fixed all these things. He might have had to cut a few corners, perhaps have Lucius Malfoy (and a few other inconvenient people) assassinated and maybe seize power from Fudge when Fudge didn't do as he asked, but he would, perhaps, attain greater good than in canon, net-net.

At that point, he might decide that, say, that since there's nobody as intelligent, wise, experienced, and uncorruptible as him, he might want to govern for longer. Perhaps Nicholas Flamel might oblige (and if he wouldn't, Dumbledore could make him), or perhaps, well, there are always some inconvenient people standing in the way of the greater good, no?
