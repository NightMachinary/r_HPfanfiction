I was tidying up my parents old library when I picked up an old Norwegian translation of Order of the phoenix and went to a random page near the end.

It was during the battle of the DoM and Hermonie was just made unconscious with some kind of spell, Neville got his nose kicked inn, Ron was high af and was wrestling with a brain, Ginny had a broken leg and Luna was suddenly blasted away by Bellatrix.

The death eaters chased after Harry when he ran away with the prophecy, he fell down a flight of stairs and ended up before the veil. They started torturing Nevile when he came to save the day, right before the order came inn for the rescue.

It was honestly great.

That tension and desperation is something I don't think I've ever seen from fanfiction tbh.


** Yeah... I never read a fic that managed to replicate the rollercoaster of emotions that's the night of Voldemort's return in GoF: the enthusiasm before the start of the final task, the eeriness of the maze, the dreadfulness in the cemetery, the fear of imminent death during the duel with Voldemort, the hope when the wands connect, the chaos when Harry returns, the exhaustion and despair when Harry finally realizes what just happened, the fear of what's to come. So many things happen that night and in my opinion that's when the series really peaked.

*** Yeah to me it doesn't get any creepier than the humanioid thing he was before and then the flayed baby in the train station.

**** While the whole homunculus thing was a pretty cool and creepy, at the same time, idea (assuming to convey how low Voldemort had fallen in his quest for power), what I was trying to point out is that those chapters (31-36 I believe) are so well written that you, as a reader, actually get to feel what Harry is living through in those moments. I remember that I first read that part during a family friends get together and I completely ignored everyone else and could not stop until I was done with those chapters.

***** Oh yeah, totally. I think what I was getting at is that he'll pop up in that form in a fanfic or the flayed bit of soul will be mentioned, and it doesn't have nearly the same impact as canon does because you haven't been with Harry the way you were in the books.

Also, I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing and what I felt when I read Snape's pensieve chapter in OOTP. It genuinely felt like I was standing next to Harry in the memory.

** The Department of Mysteries sequence is one of my favorites in the entire series. It's so good. Honestly I think Order of the Phoenix is her masterpiece. Like I really think that's where she peaked.

*** There have been three books that I can remember getting a reaction out of me where I cried and raged and just sat down and stared at the wall with an empty heart. OOTP was one of those. Everything just built up so wonderfully.

Especially with Sirius. You love him because Harry so desperately loves him in the beginning. You become apprehensive with him when you learn about his childhood, just like Harry did. And then when he dies, it's senseless, heartbreaking, and tragic because you wanted to see him grow and heal but instead it's this awful, terrible death.

*** No. I'd say you are growing up, maturing and just start noticing how bad lot of the writing actually is. For most part, HP fanfiction is written by teenagers, while there are exceptions, usually people stop writing once they grow out of that phase and move on.

There is however, a proliferation of common tropes. Which sadly make it seem like lot of the stories are variations of the same thing and are annoyingly predictable.

** I never could get back into my Norwegian copies again after my first English read. Somehow the writing and the reactions of different characters always felt so overdramatic in Norwegian.

*** Yeah the language used in the books (and some of the names) can be pretty jarring. I read the original books when I was between 6 and 9 so I didn't think anything of it at the time though.

** I had to check: OOTP was the 5th book? I thought the 4th one was boring af and I gave up after that. Are the later ones better? I did see some parts of the later movies and they were interesting.

*** I feel the opposite of how OP feels. Like you, I didn't like book 4-7 as much as 1-3 even back then, but canon material is just not as good as re-reading The Pureblood Pretense series for me. I've reread that and other fics more often than I have felt the need to go back to canon. Voldemort coming back and having multiple horcruxes felt like a rehash of the older plotline to me, and puts me off from rereading the later books.
