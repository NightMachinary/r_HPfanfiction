I don't have problem with these fanfics but there are so many fanfics where characters are genderbent that I don't want to read the summary or find out halfway that a character is genderbent (because they didn't disclose it in the summary). Also with the amount of requests I see for these fanfics I think it would be easier to have one added.


** It absolutely should be in the summary. I'm not interested in genderbend fics, at all. The only exception I can see is from back in the day when blaise zabini didn't have a cannon gender.

*** I have read a couple of them in the past but I don't really like reading femHarry fanfic so like you I would like it if all authors put it in the summary.

** I wish fics were better tagged in general but also that writers don't go crazy with tagging. I naturally just get kind of turned off when I see a wall of tags. I know there's an option to hide additional tags but then I worry I'm going to miss something important if I toggle it.

*** I agree that there needs to be a better way to tag (AO3 is a good example of too much tagging).

** Speaking as someone who loves a gender bent fic, I would love for people to tag properly so I can actually find them easily. It's really frustrating when you find a good one has slipped through your fingers because you could use the tags on AO3.

** I am amused by clever tags on AO3, but recognize that it's not helpful. After all, the entire point of tagging is to be able to use them to find similar tropes. That said, I've done professional indexing, and full tagging includes a lot of things that may seem redundant because you try to include every permutation that people may search for.

But yes, to answer your original question, I agree it should be mentioned either in the tags or the summary, so that people can either look for it, or avoid it, as they please.

(The ones I don't get are when they genderbend the character and then put them in a gay relationship. Ummm, if you wanted them with that person, why not leave them as-is and write het? I don't mind slash, but to genderbend to make your fic, I dunno, "edgier" by being slash, seems like just a gimmick.)

*** Then there's the ones that genderbend and put the character with an opposite sex person, so the author can pretend they are not writing slash (ie Female Harry/Male Draco). >>>>Yeah, about that.
