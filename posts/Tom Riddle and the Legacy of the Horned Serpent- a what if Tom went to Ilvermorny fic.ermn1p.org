I recent wrote a story about Tom through the British government's scheme to reduce the number of orphans in Britain, is sent to Canada to work on a farm. From there, he is adopted by a small branch of a Pureblood wizarding family and sent to Ilvermorny. There, he will have to grapple with his past, and find himself learning about the legacy of the Gaunts and the Sayres.

Here's the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22340770][link]], please give it a read if it seems like something you might be interested in! I've posted one chapter. But I'd like to see if anyone would be able to provide feedback. Thanks!


** I liked the first chapter. Tbh, I am glad that his introduction to magic did not involve setting cupboards on fire.

*** Thank you! I thought that a different spell might have a different effect too, especially if Tom could see his Parseltongue normalized. Though this Tom is a bit less forthcoming about his psychopathic tendencies- we'll just have to see if he keeps them in check

*** Yeah, way to teach a bully that he can keep on bullying if he's strong enough. Good job Dumbledore, calibrate that moral compass. Teach him that threats are a great way to open interpersonal relationships.

*** Thank you! I'm planning on exploring more of the history of the Sayres, and American Wizarding politics, but I will have a storyline where Tom does interact with his English roots, and even plays a role in the War with Grindelwald

** I like the fact that he still goes to a school set up by one of his ancestors, an even more recent one at that.
