I've noticed that in many crossovers, the HP universe is much weaker than whichever universe the story is being crossed with, to the point where even the most powerful wizards hardly matter in comparison. Any fics where wizards like Voldemort and Dumbledore are still very powerful, even with the crossed-over elements? 100k+ words is preffered, but not required.

Nah, HP Wizards would lose badly to any universe where significantly increased speed/reaction time is typical for trained fighters, such as a lot of shonen anime for example. At least if we are considering how both are depicted in canon, I don't mind when crossovers change things up a bit to make them more balanced.

Imagine trying to shoot down an aircraft that is unplottable, for example.

****** The spells still need to hit to work, so any sort of danger sense, which is also common, would allow one to avoid them. And Imperio in particular is possible to resist with a strong will, which strong fighters from other universes tend to have. No way any HP wizard could land any sort of hit on current arc Luffy with his future sight observation haki for example.

******** What are you imaging they will do then if not try to hit people with spells?

Anyway my main point is that HP wizards have human level speed/reaction times, while there are other fictional universes where the fighters have not only slighty higher, but like an order of magnitude or more higher speed/reaction. Things like DBZ, One Piece, or Naruto. In a straight up fight, assuming the opponent was taking things seriously, there is little the wizard could do against that since they would be defeated before they even realized what was happening. In a non straight fight they could try to do something sneaky of course, but since many of those same fictional universes include the ability to sense or detect when they are about to be attacked, the fighter could presumably quickly get out of dodge to avoid whatever the wizard was doing, and then counterattack with overwhelming force.

** I went straight for my favorite HPxNaruto fics.

​

linkffn(Magical Shinobi) has Remus Lupin fusing magic with the fighting style of the Naruto world, with the Naruto world entirely unused to werewolves or the killing power of the killing curse. Other wizards and witches get thrown into the mix later on, and then it's war between Konoha and Voldemort's Death Eaters. Somewhat cheesy.

​

linkffn(Efforesco Secundus) Hermione is reincarnated as Sakura. The experience of the wizarding war against Voldemort lends her war experience when coming into this ninja war, and while it takes a while to recover her magic, it's portrayed as something that takes enormous power but is seen as something that's as strong as a bloodline. At the times she can access her magic, it's OP. Seriously great read.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) It's a long, comedic WIP crossover with DnD. The OC main character is from the DnD universe and via a ritual in the HP universe is teleported there. He is limited to using DnD spells and abilities, which makes him really powerful in some instances and absolutely pathetic in others. One of the side plots has Bellatrix going to the DnD universe and causing some havoc because she, unlike wizards from the DnD universe, can cast faster than once every 6 seconds and doesn't have a spells per day limit. Like most long comedic fics, it gets more serious over time, though there are still laughs to be had.

#+begin_quote
  A Harry Potter cursed with immortality must not only survive the ravaging of Earth by monsters far more powerful than any humanity has encountered, but he must rise to save it, and in the process exact one wizard's revenge against the Galactic Empire.

  The world first saw Harry Bailey in a photo kneeling on a road before the Endbringer the Simurgh. The Simurgh's psychic scream drove entire cities mad. In Harry, it woke something else entirely. He never told the heroes what happened. After all, how could a young boy explain memories he could not possibly have, of a powerful, ancient sorcerer from a universe that preceded his own?

  It only takes a single disharmonious element to throw off the entire composition. Fifty years before Robert Baratheon was to ascend the Iron Throne, Westeros receives one hell of a bad musician. Harry never did care about any player other than himself.
