Hey, I don't know if there are any fics like this, but I would love to see one (or more) where Harry has a twin or someone else who Dumbledore decides is the BWL and that boy is raised as Harry was in the books while the real Harry is sent to live with w/e Wizarding family they decide the extra should go to. Harry doesn't need to be OP or raised to hate the Light, I enjoy Dark!Harry fics, but it's not a requirement. I see too many where Lily and James live and simply abuse or neglect Harry while his, usually, twin brother is a spoiled brat who lives for the limelight even though he's magically average along with his parents.


** There's quite a few like those and I mean quite a few... I don't really read many because most are unfinished but a lot are Harry gets sent to the durselys Probably the most popular one,

*** I think you misunderstood the request.

The fic you linked (and the common scenario) is:

- Harry has a twin/sibling who Dumbledore/James and Lily/everyone thinks is the BWL and this twin/sibling gets special treatment and/or training

- Harry is sent to the Dursley's as "the spare"

What OP was requesting (I think), was:

- Harry has a twin/sibling who Dumbledore/everyone thinks is the BWL and this twin is sent to the Dursleys because James/Lily still died (but Harry is really the BWL still)

- Harry is foisted off on some random wizarding family because Dumbledore doesn't think he's important.

Personally, I think it'd take a real leap of logic to separate the two if James and Lily are dead, but it's possible someone's done it before (I'm not aware of any fics that did this, myself)

*** This is the exact opposite of what OP asked for BTW.

I'm here hoping for an actual rec for this plot idea. I don't think I've ever seen WBWL story written with this twist.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Not many knew that the Potters had twins. After the Halloween attack of '81, Rose was declared the Girl-Who-Lived, and Violet was all but forgotten. The twins were separated, one receiving a better upbringing than the other. But Dumbledore made a very big mistake. Rose was not the GWL, Violet was. And now she's learning the truth...

  Take a WBWL-verse, add in some Slytherin Harry with Voldemort's memories, and add just a dash of Parselmagic, and what do you get? Harry Potter and the Sorting Hat's Gift, Book 1 of the Saga of the Lightning Speaker.
