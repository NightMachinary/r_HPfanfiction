  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** linkffn(The Queen who fell to Earth) this is a long series where the dragons are descendants of the dragons from The Dragonriders of Pern series. You don't need to know those books though, the story itself will explain everything you really need to know from the Pern universe. Sadly the author passed away before completing the 3rd story in the series, but still recommend it.

  Forced to compete and abandoned by his friends, he steps from the tent with only one goal in mind, suicide. Instead Harry awakens a power that spans time and space and starts a war between the worlds.

** This is a great idea. I have a series actually outlined pretty neat about it. Though it is not in the stuff I'm currently writing.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (Mostly fluff, no character bashing.)

** Not exactly dragons in the conventional HP way as it's a crossover, but this fic has MoD Harry being given an old dragon rider's memories in order to train the next dragon rider. Reading the Inheritance Cycle isn't actually required because the fic explains everything very well.

Also, MoD!Harry/Arya is simply put a perfect pairing.
