Everything is the same in this timeline instead all events were pushed to 20 years after like marauders attend school in the 90s instead of the 70s, The first wizarding war took place from 1991 to 2001 instead of 71 to 81, Harry was born on 31st July 2000 instead of 1980, Tom riddle attend Hogwarts in the 60s instead of 40s, etc etc

How much the hp series would be changed if it took place between 2011-2018 instead of 1991-1998.


** Events would change immensely because all generations are shoved up and butterfly effect would be fully on.

And I'd expect Muggleborns trying to get eletronics to work around magic. Though tough luck with that around Hogwarts.

This is already possible within canon - Colin Creevey's camera is a Muggle camera that he adapted to run off magic instead of batteries. So I don't think it's even particularly difficult.

**** Colin's camera is an analog camera, though - there's no electronics, and the only electrical component is the flash bulb. I imagine it would be much more difficult to adapt a modern, digital camera to work in Hogwarts.

** Frankly, I'm disappointed by the prevalence of gratuitous, not to mention fallacious, nitpicking and youth-hating (dubious claims of "humor" notw/standing) in the responses. I think this is a really cool and relatively-unexplored-in-the-Harry-Potter-fanfiction-fandom idea. Pushing a bunch of story-relevant generations two decades back gets around the very strong " 'locking in' to canon" tendency Next Generation fics generally have. Particularly w/r/t the muggle-raised students, there's a lot of rich opportunity the cultural impact of real-life developments. Voldemort growing up in the postwar period and 2010s muggle-raised Hogwarts students' growing discontent w/ a lack of accommodation for increasingly considered-vital electronic forms of communication^{\}1]) are both interesting ideas to dig into.

Not to mention, while canon's themes are meaningful and relevant whether the main story takes place in the 1990s or the 2010s, there's a case to be made that the progression of canon's sociopolitical developments lines up more w/ the 2010s than the 1990s. Plus, there's a nice side benefit that this prompt lightly encourages writers to focus more on the nonmagical-interfacing side of magical society in contrast to the fandom's unhealthy fixation on fanon pureblood aristocracy and oligarchy.

^{\}1]) While, afaict f/ what I've read, I get that mobile phone usage in UK school are a lot more heavily restricted than I'm used to, I imagine that non-magical parents' concerns about their magical children having to navigate a very different society and culture pretty much unattended will heavily shift the debate in the favor of accommodating access to the internet and social media, at least outside of the classroom.

** There would be no muggleborns attending the school, as all of them were too busy watching tik-tok videos to bother reading the invitation letters. Every child would refuse Hogwarts upon learning their smart phones didn't work there.

With this nonviolent purge of anyone but purebloods, inbreeding reaches catastrophic levels, and wizards become so mentally disfunctional they can no longer read spellbooks to learn magic. Wizarding Britain coasts by on lingering enchantments, and goblins easily fleece all the gold and wealth.

Finally, decades and decades later, the enchantments cast by previous generations wear off and Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, and the Ministry are exposed to the muggle world. The uproar is veey shortlived, though, as neoliberal governments never bothered to take serious action on climate change.

Magic's existence is a page 4 story, a footnote among rising sea levels, unbearable heatwaves, and mass migration. Before long, most of humanity, and with it life on earth, winks out, victims of their own shortsightedness and unwillingness to sacrifice now for survival later.

*** I'd read it as crack but realistically it has no legs to stand on. Many of the earlier gen z still remember a time where not owning a phone was seen as normal. At least for our age. Also who wouldn't ditch electronics if you could literally learn /magic/

*** This is a...interesting dystopia, but OP said 2011. Not 2021. Tik Tok is like a 2015 thing. Wizards had their own version of gifs and facetime long before we did, so I imagine they'd have their own version of a smartphone, too, if only to keep the statute intact.

** Well, if /everything/ is the same but the number of year is +20, absolutely nothing would change except the years marked in the cake in Nick's deathday party, the publishing years of Riddle's diary and Snape's mother's Potions book and the years in the Potters' tombstone. However, if you only change all human actions in the wizarding world and of those Muggles interacting with it, many things would change.

Almost all weather conditions described in the Harry Potter books would have been different. There wouldn't have been a storm during the first Quidditch match of PoA and therefore the match would have ended earlier. That means the Dementors wouldn't have affected Harry again. As a consequence, Harry wouldn't have asked Lupin to teach him the Patronus Charm. Therefore, during the end-of-year adventure Harry wouldn't have known how to repel the Dementors and he, Sirius and Hermione would have been Kissed. End of story.
