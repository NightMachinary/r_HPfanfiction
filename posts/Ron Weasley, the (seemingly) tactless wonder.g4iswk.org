Yeah yeah, we've heard it all (and for the Ron-haters, said it all) before: Ron's a prat.

...or is he?

Scene from book 5:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Hello, Harry!'

  It was Cho Chang and, what was more, she was on her own again. This was most unusual: Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls; Harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by herself to ask her to the Yule Ball.

  'Hi,' said Harry, feeling his face grow hot. At least you're not covered in Stinksap this time, he told himself. Cho seemed to be thinking along the same lines.

  'You got that stuff off, then?'

  'Yeah,' said Harry, trying to grin as though the memory of their last meeting was funny as opposed to mortifying. 'So, did you ... er . . . have a good summer?'

  The moment he had said this he wished he hadn't - Cedric had been Cho's boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her holiday almost as badly as it had affected Harry's. Something seemed to tauten in her face, but she said, 'Oh, it was all right, you know ...'

  'Is that a Tornados badge?' Ron demanded suddenly, pointing to the front of Cho's robes, where a sky-blue badge emblazoned with a double gold 'T' was pinned. 'You don't support them, do you?'

  'Yeah, I do,' said Cho.

  'Have you always supported them, or just since they started winning the league?' said Ron, in what Harry considered an unnecessarily accusatory tone of voice.

  'I've supported them since I was six,' said Cho coolly. 'Anyway ... see you, Harry.'

  She walked away. Hermione waited until Cho was halfway across the courtyard before rounding on Ron.

  'You are so tactless!'

  'What? I only asked her if - '

  'Couldn't you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her own?'

  'So? She could've done, I wasn't stopping - '

  'Why on earth were you attacking her about her Quidditch team?'

  'Attacking? I wasn't attacking her, I was only - '

  'Who cares if she supports the Tornados?'

  'Oh, come on, half the people you see wearing those badges only bought them last season - '

  'But what does it matter?'

  'It means they're not real fans, they're just jumping on the bandwagon - '

  That's the bell,' said Harry dully, because Ron and Hermione were bickering too loudly to hear it. They did not stop arguing all the way down to Snapes dungeon, which gave Harry plenty of time to reflect that between Neville and Ron he would be lucky ever to have two minutes of conversation with Cho that he could look back on without wanting to leave the country.
#+end_quote

Yup, Ron put his foot in his mouth, cringe or laugh accordingly. But let's not forget /Harry/ was the one who fucked up the conversation to begin with by mentioning her summer. Literally /four/ (/two/ if you discount the 'hello') lines in! Then in comes Ron with the distraction by mentioning Quidditch, and Cho walks away annoyed at /Ron/, not Harry. She didn't walk off because Harry brought up the heavy, uncomfortable, topic, she walked away because Ron criticized her loyalty to her Quidditch team. Could you imagine how awkward the conversation would have been if it was just Harry and Cho? Maybe Harry could have recovered after that massive fumble, but how many of us said something /that/ awkward in front of someone we fancied? Do you think you could recover quickly at 15?

Thank fuck Ron was there to make a prat of himself, eh? That takes courage. Maybe not necessarily tactful, but it lightened the mood and kept Cho from thinking Harry was insensitive (at least, for now).

But of course Hermione /finally/ speaks up to call Ron tactless (Tactless: not having the skill and sensitivity in dealing with others or with difficult issues). And fine, he /was/ tactless. It was a clumsy subject change, no doubt about it. So why didn't /she/ change the subject? She clearly heard everything that was going on. She could have asked Cho (who's a year older, mind) about NEWT classes or something. But we all know it's easier to play backstreet driver rather than do the driving ourselves.

And for those who say, "Well, Ron didn't explain himself!1!", Ron couldn't explain himself because Hermione kept interrupting him! /Four times!/

Where's the critique for Harry, who first put his foot in his mouth? Speaking of Harry, his reflections of the situation are ungrateful as hell. Ron saved his arse from that awkwardness. Where's the "Thanks, mate?" But I'll give credit where credit is due: at least he didn't berate him like Hermione did.

Thoughts?

** Counter bashing is not the way to go, dude. But I'll take the bait. Harry fucked the conversation by going in wrong, but him asking her how her summer was could still be seen as something positive. They have a shared trauma over the loss of Cedric and as seen would have continued despite the awkward start.

What Ron did was butt in in a conversation Cho and Harry wanted to have privately to comment on a Quidditch preconception. That's why Hermione calls him tactless. He didn't comment on it to save Harry, that's just what you decided to make of it. I do think Cho overreacted. What he said really wasn't that bad. Cho or Harry could have easily excused theirselves to speak privately for a moment.

*** Asking about her summer, sure. Asking if it was good, nah.

And again, OP's point is that Ron very well could've done that intentionally because "he insulted my love of my quittich team!" hurts less than "he asked me if my summer was good after the person I love died!"

I don't think Cho overreacted at all; at face value Ron butted in to be a jerk about her quittich team, and she excused herself

And Hermione didn't even give Ron a chance to explain himself

Something good? Cho trails off her sentence. She said, "Oh, it was all right, you know..." not "Oh, it was all right, you know--". The "--" would mean Ron cut her off.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Privately? With Ron and Hermione there? Four people is privately? I mean I guess you're /technically/ correct. (Private: belonging to or for the use of one particular person or *group of people* only.) Did I happen to miss a quote? Did Cho pull Harry away or something to talk?

Anyway, Ron only commented on Quidditch when Harry stuck his foot in his mouth.

#+begin_quote
  That's why Hermione calls him tactless.
#+end_quote

Which I agree with, to a degree. Quidditch wasn't the best topic, and his execution was sloppy, but it's better than what Hermione did, which was nothing.

#+begin_quote
  He didn't comment on it to save Harry, that's just what you decided to make of it.
#+end_quote

Wow, you must have had some shit friends if they left you hanging in front of a crush. So Ron should have followed Hermione's lead, am I right? Just stand there and let Harry make a fool of himself? That's true friendship right there /s. But I guess if you're not a fan of the Harry/Cho pairing, it makes sense. Then Cho can be pissed at Harry instead of Ron for bringing up a painful subject.

But then again, maybe you're right and I'm the "counter-bashing" idiot. We'll never know since Ron didn't get a chance to explain himself because Hermione jumped down his throat to call him 'tactless' (which, again, I'm not denying, but this reeks of Book 3: Binky the Rabbit Saga). And interrupted him. Four times.

****** I'm not blinding defending Ron. By definition he was tactless. His subject change execution was sloppy, however, it was a good distraction from Harry's blunder. ("Your boyfriend died last year, how was your summer?").

Apparently after Harry stuck his foot in his mouth Ron should have stayed quiet like Hermione and let Cho walk away. Then the Ron-haters could you this as proof he's a "shitty friend". And the next time Harry fucked up (during their date by mentioning Hermione) and offended her, Ron wasn't there. Interesting, that.

Hermione was /right there/. Why didn't /she/ do something? Since she's "much more sensitive" according to someone on this thread, she could have brought up NEWTs or classes or something. She /doubtlessly/ could have done a /much/ better job as a distraction.

I'd agree with you...if Hermione was Harry's best friend in canon. Ron is Harry's best friend, so he helped him out of the massive fumble. If Ron let Harry hang himself in front of Cho (/cough/ like the fourth person there did /cough/) we'd all say he was a jerk. We'd ask why he didn't do something. But Hermione can stay quiet with no problems and interrogate Ron later like some sort of backseat driver. Hermione doesn't need to intervene, she can just watch and complain. True friend material right there.

The upvote % seems a weird thing to fixate on when they're all at basically 100%, and doubly so to compare when the Hermione threads aren't positive and the Ron ones are. If anything, it would show the opposite of your position.

The reason I didn't look up actual request threads is because bashing request threads in general are going to be super low - because people who don't like bashing will ignore it, and deliberately asking for that is going to just make it ignored. You're welcome to take a look at request threads that mention bashing [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search/?q=bashing+flair%3Arequest&sort=top&restrict_sr=on&t=all][here]] - when I glanced through, it's obviously heavy on requests about /not/ bashing, in particular in reference to Ron, which would support my point of this forum being against Ron bashing.

** I'm not sure what you're saying there.

Are you arguing that canon Ron was doing it on purpose and not putting his foot in his mouth? In which case, I disagree. Ron is pretty consistently tactless, and - as much as I like the character - there's no need to lie about how he acts. He's a good character, he's funny, he's a good friend... and he's tactless.

If you're asking about a fanfiction that starts with the premise that he's being tactless on purpose to help his friends out, that's a different story - and would be rather fun to read about!

As for why people don't look at Harry the same way, well - we know he's putting his foot in his mouth because he's talking to his crush. Hermione berates Ron because he messed up, and doesn't realize it, and that exasperates her. She's often much more sensitive to social situations than the other two, at least to the more sensitive subjects - like in book 4 with Neville, after the lesson on the unforgiveables.

Or are you just trying to defend Ron by attacking Hermione?

Sensitive: (of a person or a person's behavior) having or displaying a quick and delicate appreciation of others' feelings.

So her making fun of Ron's arachnophobia in Book 2 and the "I was right about Trelawney being a fraud, who cares about your dead pet Lavender" in book 3 are Hermione's "much more sensitive" moments? Or when she claimed Harry was "fanciable" and looked at Ron with disdain in Book 6, along with her jealousy of Lavender and Ron dating, the infamous bird attack and the "Your trainers are too tight" wisecrack during their Apparation lessons? That's "having or displaying a quick and delicate appreciation of other's feelings"?

I guess I need a new dictionary.

Hermione isn't always sensitive of other people's feelings, sure. Interestingly enough, my sentence had a modifier - *often*. And /yes/, she is often able to pick up on clues of how other people are feeling moreso than Harry and Ron are. The excerpt you posted yourself points to that, as does the example I mentioned in book 4.

I'm not sure how you think posting situations where there's a difference disproves that, because no one made the claim that she's /always/ more sensitive than the others. Particularly when Ron is /repeatedly/ insensitive - it's part of his character, and it's not a bad thing.

  Hermione isn't always sensitive of other people's feelings, sure. Interestingly enough, my sentence had a modifier - often. And yes, she is often able to pick up on clues of how other people are feeling moreso than Harry and Ron are. The excerpt you posted yourself points to that, as does the example I mentioned in book 4.
#+end_quote

There really needs to be a list to fact-check this.

#+begin_quote
  Particularly when Ron is repeatedly insensitive - it's part of his character, and it's not a bad thing.
#+end_quote

List please.

****** You need a list of Ron being insensitive? /Really/?

Year 1, his first introduction to Harry, he ups and asks about the scar, knowing what caused it. He also makes Hermione cry to the point where she spends half a day crying in a bathroom. Year 4, he has the whole spat with Harry that makes Harry feel terrible because Ron is jealous and won't believe his friend. He also ruins the Yule ball for Padma and Hermione, along with being very insensitive when asking Hermione out to the ball right before.

Those are off the top of my head - but Ron putting his foot in his mouth when it comes to others is a consistent characterization of his. Just like Hermione being bossy or not backing down from an argument once she starts getting into it/caring about it, or Luna being a bit detached. It's not an attack on Ron to say that he's often insensitive and doesn't realize it.

******* I would argue that making Hermione cry in the first book wasn't insensitivity. He didn't say it to Hermione's face, he was venting to Harry after Hermione had been completely insufferable to him. That she heard it was unfortunate.

The interesting part is that Harry didn't even deny it. No one stood up for her. That's what made it worse for her.

****** If that were the case, he'd have said so. Ron's not the type to hold that back.

When he's asked why he mentioned the badges, his defense is that he was just asking and that she could have kept talking - while Harry feels he was needlessly accusatory in his question.

From the description in the excerpt, it reads pretty clearly to me like he just saw her with the badges and decided to accuse bandwagon fans. It'd be different if Ron were never tactless - but he is often like that in the books. It's not a bad thing - it's a part of his character, which I quite like. But just because I like Ron doesn't mean that he's perfect, and he messed up in that excerpt.

A fanfiction where he's doing that deliberately, like a one-shot premise, would be quite fun

We got incomplete explainations because, for the countless time, Hermione interrupted him! Multiple times! We didn't get his full train of thought, but I guess since Hermione knows best ^{TM} she definitely pulled the truth out of Ron! 'Cause she's /sensitive/ like that. /s

** Meh, this is quite a stretch. It doesn't read as Ron trying to distract Cho from Harry being awkward, he just has a beef with bandwagon supporters.

I do think it's a bit ironic that Hermione accuses Ron of being tactless though, given that we see her be completely devoid of tact(and/or empathy) several times in the books. And of course it's a part of Ron-bashing that his negative qualities are often focused on and amplified, while Hermione's are glossed over or justified.

Don't we all? But given Ron's "sudden" noticing of her Quidditch team badge, I'd say it's definitely possible he was looking for a subject change. We'll never know for sure though, because Hermione cut him off four times when he tried to explain himself. Because Hermione knows everything ^{TM} . No need to listen to what Ron has to say, just jump to conclusions! That's what good friends do!

Yup, preaching to the choir on that one. Ron is tactless, but Hermione isn't that much better. Heaven forbid someone points that out.

There's a big difference between Harry fucking up a conversation when he really wants to have a genuine, polite conversation with a girl he likes and Ron butting into a conversation to make accusations. Notice how Hermione didn't speak? Yeah.

Cho walked away because she felt insulted that Ron was calling her a bandwagon fan.

On the date, Cho was ultimately upset because she wanted to talk about Cedric and Harry wouldn't do it.

She wasn't wrong to be upset with Ron for calling her a bandwagon fan. She also wasn't wrong to be upset with Harry for leaving their date and not trying to talk to her about Cedric. Her feelings were valid in both situations.

I don't see the reason why Ron's tactlessness needs to be spun in a favorable light when he, himself, says "half the people you see wearing those badges only bought them last season -"

** I like Ron just because he was one of the few canon characters whose characterization worked with the plot instead of having to constantly be ooc for plot convenience. He makes sense and his decisions fit in well with his character. I actually think the Weasleys in general are best written characters in the books and the least influenced by plot convenience.

In the 4th book he got jealous and threw a hizzy fit and then was too proud/afraid of rejection to apologize. This is not only normal for teenagers but also in line with his history of feeling overshadowed by others. People forget that he didn't attack Harry in public, just stopped defending him.

In the seventh book, he threw his hissy fit /while wearing the locket/ which we know has a negative impact on people. He was also under a lot more pressure than the other two since his family was still in the middle of everything and him getting caught would endanger them. I have family in war zones and I know that a lot of their behavior is influenced by prioritizing their family's wellbeing and the worry they feel. People who've never had to choose between doing the 'right' thing and the safety of their loved ones may not understand the emotional toil and guilt of jeopardizing your family. In the moment, the risk to your family seems overwhelming compared to the low chance of success. Ron had to really believe in Harry and trust him to make that choice twice (when they first started and again when he went looking for them).
