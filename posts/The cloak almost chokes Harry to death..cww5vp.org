**** Temporal Knight, not Templar, my bad.

At least I think it is supposed to be Fem!Harry. Not entirely clear.

  Cordelia is the Master of Death and has been for quite some time. The only problem is that she doesn't particularly enjoy being an Eldritch Abomination. What's a girl to do when you have no interest in the role forced upon you? Run like hell perhaps. And hope to Merlin and God and all else that's holy that maybe, just maybe, one day you might get lucky...and find a way out.

** Closest I can think of is linkffn(Coming Back Late) -- not sure if there was a strangulation scene, but it fits the rest of your description.

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?
