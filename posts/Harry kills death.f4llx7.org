Harry decides to get enough power to kill death because death refuses to allow Harry to resurrect his parents. Then Harry decides to kill all the other gods as well I believe. I believe it's a time travel fic but I can't remember.


** Sounds like Supernatural to me.

But the story sounds interesting if somebody knows the name of it I totally want to read it.
