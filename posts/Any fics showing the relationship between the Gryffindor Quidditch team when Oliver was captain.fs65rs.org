Any rating/paring but preferably Gen that show the quidditch team taking care of Harry, teaching him things or generally having fun together


** I'm currently looking for one fic like this - Harry's scars (can't recall whether they're from his adventures or his beatings at the hand of the Dursleys) are seen by the Quidditch team and they, quite reasonably, make a fuss over it. No idea what the title is, but I saw it on a rec here and can't find it again to bookmark it.

Also, second rec is a mildly weird one which sort of meets your request, but also not really? It's called 'Play up, play up, and break the game' and it's the story of what lengths Oliver will drag his team to in order to win.

**** I don't know if it is it, but Paleocacher found one that's similar enough - check their comment for the link to a fic called 'Scars'.

**** I don't know. I only ever saw it as a rec - the summary looks close-ish to what I remember, but it's generic enough I could be getting it confused.

** Unfortunately, we got some glimpses of it only in some fem!Harry stories, where the Chasers Trio shows Harriet the ropes, but I would love to see any story dealing with the dynamics (perhaps not even romantic) between Harry and Katie Bell, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fmp8ak/looking_for_harry_x_gryffindor_chaser_girls/fl6hdgv/]] .

** I don't have what you are looking for but I know a few Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint stories which are quite a bit Quidditch centric. If you want them, I'll link them.
