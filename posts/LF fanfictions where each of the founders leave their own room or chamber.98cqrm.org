Like the Chamber of Secrets? There's been some speculation that the Room of Requirement is Hufflepuff's but it'd be nice to see the other three. Preferably complete and with no slash, but it's OK as long as it isn't the main focus of the story.


** linkffn(What You Leave Behind by Newcomb) has this and is also excellent. Unfortunately probably abandoned.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  With his life turned into a Game, Harry now has to raise a Phoenix, uncover the Founders' darkest secrets, deal with political manipulations and live through Hogwarts all while trying desperately to not swear too much.

** linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) also does a really great job with this topic, especially with the Chamber of Secrets, although in this fic the Room of Requirement is not attributed to Hufflepuff.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** Can't remember which fic it was, but it had the Headmaster's Office as Gryffindor's, the Room of Requirement as Ravenclaws and the Kitchen/Great Hall as Hufflepuff's.
