hey guys, anyone know of any good fics set in the marauder time where theyre at school or fighting the first war? looking for some with lots of Sirius and remus. Not Slash just to clarify


** I always suggest this one. You should read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]] by Jewels5. It's a romance fic about James and Lily, but there are tons of Marauder-themed antics involved.

** Sirius and Remus or Sirus AND Remus? Marauder gen fic are rare, since the large wave of it came with/after Shoebox Project, so it'll guarantied to be slash. The second wave of Marauder fics are after OOTP about L/J, so it'll be some bullcrap romantic comedy. The only one I can recommend are:

First - Shoebox Project. The original, and arguably the greatest Marauder fic of all time. Unfinished, however it finished right after they got out of school, with a perfect book-end ending. Light R/S later on, but its a gen fic in general

Second - The Life And Times. Not cliched, done really well, chapters are really friggin long though. More Lily-centric
