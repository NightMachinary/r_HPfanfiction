I read a fantastic fanfic that was incomplete about life after hogwarts. Ginny and Harry had been fighting in it and Ron was on the verge of alcoholism and I really want to see where it went. Unfortunately, I didn't F*&^{%ing} save the website. Anyone have any idea what I'm talking about? Or am I just a rambling idiot?


** Believe it or not, you'll have to be more specific. I've read a sh*t-ton of dysfunctional!Harry fics.

*** gah! when i had left off, ginny had run away from their home basically. their home is grimmauld place. she wants to be a quidditch player. ginny was a real bitch so far, the author apologized in the notes that she had made her so bad. harry was frustrated being an auror. It was pretty good! lol

**** Yeah, you're gonna have to be way more specific than that. The plot line you describe has been done over and over and over again. Sorry!

****** Oh, sure, at the /start/. But in these fics, Hermione rarely winds up with the drunk guy - or with Ron. The fact it's Ron /and/ he's drunk? Double-whammy.

** Well, you have an opportunity here to do a systematic search over the next few days, and enjoy many fine fanfics along the way. Join fanfiction sites and go to their Search or Categories page. Plug in as much info as you can. At the least, input the two main characters and the category (probably Drama). Then, start skimming fictions. Pay attention to Author Notes concerning a bitchy Ginny. Here's a search result on [[http://www.grangerenchanted.com/enchant/browse.php?type=characters&charid=11&catid=79&warnings=44&genres=2&sort=alpha&complete=all][Granger Enchanted]]. Maybe fans here can offer advice on likely fanfic sites.

*** WAIT! I've just remembered perhaps the most important part of all. This fanfic was specifically about the intermediary between the end of the 7th book and the events in the epilogue.

****** Well, I think you're destined to run through the search engines of fanfic sites until you find it. Start with [[http://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry_Potter/][fanfiction.net]], [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/storytype.php][HPFF]] and [[http://grangerenchanted.com/][GE]]. As I say, it'll be tedious yet strangely fun.
