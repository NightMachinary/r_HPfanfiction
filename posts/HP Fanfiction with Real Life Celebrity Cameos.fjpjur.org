So, we've all seen the Gordon Ramsay fics, the fics with 'ole Queen Lizzie, that one with Stephen Colbert, but what other fics are there with actual celebrities playing a part in them?

Gordon Ramsay - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12805206/chapters/29228961]]

Queen Elizabeth - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12023156/1/Harry-Gets-Summoned]] (since there's such a long list of these, this was just the first fic that appeared when I googled 'Harry Potter meets Queen Elizabeth fanfiction'.

Stephen Colbert - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2856276/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Eagle-of-Truthiness]]

The Most Electrifying Man! - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7583739/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Most-Electrifying-Man]]

** Oh! I forget the story name and author, but someone did a few short fics where the trio, Sirius, and Serverus were stuck living in #12 so they started a movie night. Lupin was free to come and go so he would pick up the movies. Each movie had the actor of someone watching that night (example that the author didn't use so no spoilers: Sweeney Todd the Demon Barber of Fleet Street would have worked for Serverus, Bellitrix, and Peter). I know it's not exactly what you are looking for but kinda cute. I don't remember anything else about the stories to tell you if there were pairings or what not.

***** Not a big fan of Snappy without some growth and development into 'not a bitter nazi arsehole' myself, but I can generally work around that for an interesting and fun fic like that one sounds to be. :)

Yeah. Same with music fics. A lot of them are just excuses for the author to talk about the media they enjoy consuming.

********* Indeed. I grew up reading Tolkien and when I found out he was interested in Arthurian Legend, I started reading up and loved it all. Plus, the adaptations get really spectacular - there's a steampunk cabaret-burlesque band called The Mechanisms that does an adaptation called 'High Noon over Camelot' that's absolutely magnificent. Sci-fi Cowboy Arthur really, really works. It's on Youtube, if you're interested. :)

Why do you ask?

********** I adopted a Maine Coon cat I named Caliber after Excalibur and gun ammo. I love the Arthurian legends as well and by extension Celtic mythology. Tolkien is amazing and once I fell in love with Norse mythology I recognized many influences Tolkien barrowed.

*********** Aww. Maine Coons are beautiful creatures. If I ever got another cat, I'd get a Maine Coon. Is he a fan of baths then? Lady of the Lake and all that. :)

Heh. Yeah, Tolkien borrowed influences from so many places. If you read his books with a little knowledge, you really can see just how much of an Old Sagas and Myths fanboy the guy was.

************ Yes they are and he was perfect. When I got him, I didn't realize the gem I was getting. He was rather small when I got him, I didn't want a kitten, but my apartment complex did not allow large dogs and I'm not a fan of small dogs, but the only adult cat available... they weren't sure if she was just fat or pregnant at the time. I realized his breed when he got to be very long in about 2 months. He did like playing in the shower water unless he got spritzed. Then I got a dirty look. His version of kissing me on the nose was to bite my nose. He liked being read to, but he'd get irritated if I paused in reading to laugh before I read the the funny bit to him. I loved that cat and I miss him so much.Oh! And he knew how to open doors, but his paws were too fluffy to get a grip on the knob. I always joked I was going to make him miniaturized war horse armor. As far as the sagas go, I started learning Bokmål to try to read them in their original writing. When Duolingo gets Icelandic I'm switching though.

************* Ah, my condolences for your loss, Puck. Always sucks, losing a beloved pet. I do love the image of a cat in tiny armour. That would've been totally adorable. (Full disclosure, I am picturing the Steel Horse Armour from Oblivion here :D).

Ah, Bokmal, that chaotic bastard. I still remember the day I found out it just meant 'Book Language'. :D

I don't read it myself, but it's on the list of things to do before I die. I've contented myself with translations for now and a lot of textbook checking to cover the Kennings and references and such that just do not translate well at all.

Why limit yourself? In this time of Pandemic, do both! :)

************** Thank you for your condolences, I personally believe we'll meet again. He was white with cream splotches and I didn't groom him to enhance his fluffiness if that helps your mental image.

Originally I was disappointed when I found it was called the book language, but according to my research, it is spoken by the majority of the country and the secondary most used language was only used in the more northern regions, was more limited, and though claimed to be more native sources seemed to disagree on that front. Of course my sources could have been flawed and I may be misremembering.

As far as continuing Bokmål after starting Icelandic, the two languages as similar enough, I'd rather put the additional effort into learning different languages instead. I'm leaning towards Gaelic, I do wish the app specified if it was Scottish, Irish, Welsh, or what. I'm guessing not Irish just because the app lists Irish separately. Expanding on my German could be fun too though.

Honestly, with everything going on, I've been so distracted I'm not learning a whole lot in my impromptu time off at all. How about you?

*************** I admit, I'm not a believer myself, but I hope you do see him. And damn. Sounds like one gorgeous floof ball.

No, that's all correct. I can try dig out some of my reference texts on that, but from what I remember it's all true. I would emphasise that it's more of a written thing than a spoken thing - the spoken version has little to no standardisation across the country and thus is highly dialectical (meaning each region has different pronunciation or grammar or vocabulary specific to it), though it has what wikipedia tells me is called 'mutual intelligibility', which means that people using those different dialects can mostly understand one another (did not know it was called that, though it seems pretty logical and I hope I could've guessed it if pressed).

If memory serves, Duolingo is Scottish Gaelic, but I'd have to take the course and check (I grew up in Scotland, so I've a few phrases and words I've picked up from friends there over the years - enough to recognise, but not to converse, unfortunately).

I'm mostly trying to write and catching up with the TV, movies, books, and audio-stuff I missed while I was in Uni. I'm trying to learn to draw, but it's slow-going (I run D&D games regularly and I'm trying to get competent enough to draw character art and map-pieces and such). Oh, and I did learn how to iron properly last weekend, which I'm slightly embarrassed it took me until 23 to do. I was ironing before, mind, just... badly. I found out that half my pleated shirts really, really shouldn't have been pleated, I just ironed creases into them. :D

*** Ah, royal family fics are usually fun. This one gets a little bit too "Snape did nothing wrong and the Malfoys are good people really" in the middle for my taste, but it's a good fic otherwise. The royal involvement is quite nicely done, so I'd call it a good rec for this request. :D

#+begin_quote
  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.
