So many of Remus's werewolf issues come from being denied jobs in the magical world. So I'm looking for fics where he sets up a life in the muggle world with a job that allows for taking a once a month sick leave. I've seen fics where he becomes a PI, a mob boss, a bouncer, etc... Anything like that would be great.


** I'm slowly working on a series called Employee of the Month. The first story is complete. He gets a job as a bouncer.

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

**** Thanks! I've slowly been writing parts two and three simultaneously, but I've been so distracted by news it's hard to focus on fiction.
