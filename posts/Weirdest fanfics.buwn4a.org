  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

**** Yeah, the summary itself seemed fairly standard to me, but that /combined/ with the context of the fic being a HP-matrix crossover meant that I couldn't /not/ give it a shot. And boy was I glad I did! :)

** I'm under the impression that there's a fic with Snape and Teletubbies, but I'm not brave enough to find out if its actually true. I'm fairly sure this would classify as fucked up though!

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Enter the Dragon]] is pretty absurd though.

  Do you want your little ones to read books; and they want to read the Harry Potter Books; but you do not want them to turn into witches? Well-this is the story for you! This story has all the adventure of JKR's books; but will not lead your children astray. For concerned mommies everywhere! Blessings! Grace Ann
