:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember finding a fic (on this sub, actually) where Ron, who was like 8 at the time, was getting dreams of the future, the first one being of the Battle of Hogwarts. He decided to try to change it.

I'd be really grateful if anyone found it.

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.
