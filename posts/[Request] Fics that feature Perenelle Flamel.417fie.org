She doesn't have to be a main character but fics that where she's a part of the story? I know most fics that involve the Flamels probably focus on Nicholas but idk I'm more interested in seeing things about Perenelle. If theres none where she's there in person maybe some where she's mentioned?


** linkffn(4894268) It's needlessly wordy and convoluted, but it's still enjoyable.

  On the night of Halloween 1981, Harry Potter vanished for eight years, reappearing at a Muggle orphanage with no recollection of his past. The deck stacked heavily against him, Harry arrives at Hogwarts, his past the key to the present's brewing storm.

** linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn518). It's a time travel fic and Perenelle and Nick become Harry's guardians (but in a pretty hands-off kind of way). I'm really enjoying this story and hoping it updates soon.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Gift of Memories)

She doesn't actually appear in this fic, but rather in it's second-year sequel "Harry Potter and the Heir of Slytherin". In it, both she and Nicolas appear to be in their twenties rather than older as a lot of fanfiction portray them, also she is a veela in this fic if I remember correctly.

I can't really recommend the fic in general as Harry is basically the textbook definition of a Mary Sue in this, but I will admit that it's a guilty pleasure of mine to read fics like that occasionally.

  Eidetic Memory, the ability to remember everything you have ever done, seen, smelled, tasted, and touched. To some it is a gift, to others a curse. For Harry Potter, it's both.
