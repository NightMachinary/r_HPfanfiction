I want to occupy myself with some really long fanfics. They can be slash (as long as it's well done), any plot, but I'd rather not have a super-charged 11year old Harry.

I have read HPMoR, and couldn't get past the first chapter.

Not a fan of AUs where Harry and the gang aren't include, I.e. The Alexandra Quick series.


** Not sure what your definition of long is but most of those are 100k minimum and a few are 500k+. Edit: oh, and a couple aren't particularly well written but they're funny enough to overshadow the grammar issues.

Godemperorless Heathen is the first in a completed trilogy with the fourth story just having a chapter posted.

the Best Seven years is a Calvin and Hobbes tale set in the HPVerse and I love it to pieces And I know that's not your jam but if you love C&H you may love this too.

30 minutes that changed everything is probably hella cliche now but I remember enjoying it.

I haven't read Searching for the Power in years so it's probably obscenely cliche too.

I remember the Python Defense as pretty brilliant but sadly incomplete.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
