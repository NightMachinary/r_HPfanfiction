I tried reading the first one but within the first few chapters there's an exchange student being brought over from America and I noped out. Are they worth reading or do they have a load of cliches like that in them?


** I enjoyed them, the exchange program thing is quite entertaining actually, brings in a few interesting characters like a voodoo-ish witch from Louisiana and a fair few historical characters that are portrayed quite well. Give it a chance.

** I thoroughly enjoyed them. Very well written, and very developed worlds/OCs.

** I enjoyed them. They were written primarily for a younger person / teenager, however they were well-written and quite comprehensive in terms of character development. There are niggles but the same is true of any fanfic.

** They are decent. I enjoyed it while I read them, and that's what counts :)

** I read the first one and it was ok, the second one drags and gets really boring so I dropped it.
