So, just finished re-reading linkao3(Island of Fire by esama) entire series (“works inspired by it” section included) and as always after reading another of Easama's excellent works want to read more stories of this premise, so, can anyone point me in the right direction?

I specially liked two things of the IF series, the way that Harry and Co managed to create their own society/town from scratch and that Harry didn't world travel alone or with just a few companions, but with a relatively big population, it really make the social dynamics that much more interesting with them having their specific talents but still the same underlying basic capabilities, as well as creating a broader set of possibilities only reasonably achievable by a larger population.

It goes without saying but crossovers are definitely welcome (though not obligatory).


** Off the top of my head, the only one I know is 'A Place Apart'.

  Sick of the Dursleys and resolved to missing his few friends if it means getting away from the people of the Wizarding World and their nosy whispers, Harry gets the idea to leave it all behind for a while, just a bit, just for a rest. Like a camping trip, except he'll take enough provisions for a year or so...maybe some plants, seeds and things for a little garden. Maybe some time away from the things that weigh him down will help the constant highs and lows he's been feeling for a while now. Just a little break. (Or, the one where Harry says TTFN and takes himself off on an indefinite vacation and upsets a few very careful plans.)

**** Enjoy. I think there's a couple more, but I haven't been able to find them - one is a time travel fic about the 'Nightshade Family' where Harry runs a village (I think with Bellatrix?). The other had Harry accidentally creating a place to go (either an Island or something with the Indy!Harry Trunk-Spaces) and getting half of Hogwarts wanting to go with him and helping out.

***** Sounds cool, will search for those eventually, the second one seems familiar though, is it the one where Susan and Hannah (easily) convince Harry to create his own island nation and everyone around loves the non-interference politic idea so they jump on the boat the second the third task ends? If I am not mistaken there was also a bit of miscommunication with Dumbledore thinking he is teaching Harry to eventually make his island under his supervision after the tournament while Harry thinks he figured out he was already making his own nation and just gave him the spells to help.

****** Could be. That sounds vaguely familiar. I don't remember if it's the same fic, or something else though. Sorry.
