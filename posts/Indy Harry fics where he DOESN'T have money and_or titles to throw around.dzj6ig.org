So basically the template is Harry is fed up by Dumbledore's/OOTP's incompetence, goes to Gringotts, finds out he is the richest wizard on the planet with a million and half various titles and lordships etc. etc. Are there any fics where he doesn't have that? Where the part where he doesn't agree with Dumbledore's methods and wants to start his own resistance stood, but the only money he had were the ones in the vault Hagrid showed him?

** Reminds me of that one severitus, Snape takes Harry to his vault, and where Harry is overjoyed because WOW MONEY, Snape is internally monologing how while it will get Harry through school, that's it. Realization how Potters must spend all of the old money they had, I think most Dumbledore took as contribution to war or something? Can't even remember the plot, just this one scene XD

** I can think of several, though quality will depend on your preferences I think:

- linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure): a 2nd person action adventure fic depicting the summer after OOTP. There is some bashing, but its moderated later by what you learn and you realize its not as cut-and-dry as Harry's initial POV. No titles or extravagant wealth. The 2nd person gets better, and works more if you listen to it rather than read.
- linkffn(On the Way to Greatness): in the top 3 Slytherin!Harry fics, easily. Canon Harry in Slytherin goes about as well as you would logically expect, and we see how the distance it creates affects Harry's choices and behaviors. Good Cedric friendship stuff too.
- linkffn(A Mother in Law's Love): more of a comedic fic than anything else, but this fic definitely lampshades numerous trope in both the wider HP fandom and fanfiction (including the ones you mentioned initially). A good read, if relatively short.

This is a Slytherin Harry who is not the Boy-Who-Lived (everything else is canon: Dursleys, Sirius, Voldemort etc.).
