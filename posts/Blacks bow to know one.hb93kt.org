Any fics where it features prominently that Blacks do not bow? Edit: Typo sorry, "Blacks bow to no one"


** There's linkffn(Growing Up Black) by Elvendork Nigellus.

I'm also writing a fic where the Blacks try to usurp Voldemort as the ruler of the Great Britain, but I haven't written it to that part yet. Would you also be interested in that story? (Right now it's still at the worldbuilding arc and the mystery arc)

  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the weird and wonderful story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II complete. (Warning: Part II ends on a cliffhanger. If you dislike that fact, Part II, Chapter 35, might be a better place to stop reading.) Part III is on indefinite hiatus.
