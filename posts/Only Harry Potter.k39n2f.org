Id be super interested to know how many people primarily only read Harry Potter fanfiction or Harry Potter crossover? I know personally I read 95% Harry Potter based work, wondering how many people here are similar. I'm guessing that its atleast some simply based on the fact that there is such a greater amount of HP work out there compared to other fandoms. Idk lemme know?


** It is weird really, while I wouldn't even put the books/movies themselves on the list of my 20 favorite fictional works, I do read almost exclusively HP fanfiction.

** At the moment I'm reading mostly HP (at least 75%, probably more). But I have gone through probably a dozen fandoms that I read "mostly" at various times over the years. I had a Merlin phase, a Star Trek phase, a Once Upon a Time phase, a RENT phase, a daytime soap opera phase, a Ranma 1/2 phase, among others.

Hp, marvel, dc, mo dao zu shi, anime. There's so many good fics, why restrict myself to one genre?

**** No but if you had a link I'd love to read it because I love her.

I'm a Reylo fan (I know it's unpopular), and there's one called The Heartbreak Prince where Ben/Kylo is an American that went to Llivermorny and gets a job as the DADA teacher and falls in love with (legally aged) 7th year Rey. It can be out of character at times and not everyone's cup of tea, but it's very atmospheric of Harry Potter.

Leia is the MACUSA president and I think Han is a muggle.

** I've got some weird switching thing going on. For several weeks or months I only read and/or write in one fandom, then I suddenly get tired of it and move to another one. That repeats until I am back at the beginning. So somehow I always end up circling through fandoms a lot. /xD/

Edit: Just read the comments, good to see I am not the only one with that habit. /g/

** I've read exclusively HP for 15 years. It wasn't until this year that I tried branching out because one of my old favourited authors uploaded a Pokémon story of all things. I thought I'd give it a read and see how Pokémon could possibly be written as a story and I actually loved it, so now I'm starting to be less picky and my lockdown has been certainly brighter for it!

**** On FF they are called "The BlackStaff and NightMarE" I honestly can't remember the plot of the HP fic I followed them for (Defiance) but it's being rewritten as a new fic (Monochrome) which has promise I think.

The Pokémon fic is called Acension, if anyone is interested. Some really good world building that shows just how deadly Pokémon are and how it all fits together.

** HP fanfic is my most-read, followed by Star Wars and Naruto.

The Potterverse is one of those canons that are especially fertile ground for fanfiction, particularly of the type(s) I personally enjoy. It's got an interesting/compelling setting, a solid cast of characters to work with, and lots of room for things to go better for the good guys without getting so easy that it leeches all narrative tension from the story. Other franchises that fall into this category for me would be Star Wars, A Song of Ice and Fire / Game of Thrones, and Mass Effect.

** Well, it's almost exclusively HP and HP crossovers for me, but there are times where I go on sojourns into other fandoms.

However, there isn't a lot of stories that come along nowadays in the HP fandom that I'm interested in, unfortunately. I remember going through the archive, looking for a very specific type of fic, but it seemed it didn't excist, so I ended up writing my own. It's unique and I've never seen anything quite like it.

I sometimes feel like I may have done myself a disservice by writing it, because now, I've become very intolerant of grammar mistakes. Now I'm not perfect, but it's not horrible.

** It varies, but most of the time I pick up /new/ fics from Harry Potter. There are several ongoing ones that I follow from other fandoms (eg [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.8961/][With This Ring]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Pokemon: The Origin of Species]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14998685/chapters/34762652][Spellbound]]), and also some original works, such as Dungeon Crawler Carl (no longer fully available online). But for hunting out new things to read, it's usually HP.

** I read several fandoms. Examples include Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, occasionally Naruto, some tiny book fandoms that only have a few (if excellent) one shots on AO3, etc.. I can be picky (though when not reading original fiction I no longer care so much about spelling or grammar since I like reading about characters outside of Harry, Naruto, etc. ) but I mainly read fanfic for the same world (sometimes the same characters) with a plot made up by the fanfic author, preferably keeping the original tone. Obviously some fandoms lend themselves better to original plots post or pre canon than others. Harry Potter fandom has produced the best fanfiction I have ever read overall, though I don't read this fandom as much these days since a children's book series I got into this year gives me all the Potter feels without being Potterverse.

** I came from anime and games fandoms- Fire Emblem, Xenoblade, One Piece, Naruto. Vaguely remembered the Harry Potter books from childhood and saw a Harry/Draco fic and wondered how on earth they managed to pull that off. Then read another. And another. And then a Snarry. And then Tomarry. And then memorised the entire wiki. Please send help.

But I would say it's because there's more work in that fandom. Another thing would be that there's so many things you can do with the HP world, and there's houses that give some baseline character traits that you can tweak to your heart's delight, there's a school year structure, meaningful settings and traditions that the characters are a part of. And it's urban fantasy, so we can write about the normal world as well as a fantasy one.
