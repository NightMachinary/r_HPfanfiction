#+TITLE: Personally, I hate when Mysterious Figures pop up in stories to do evil and teleport away afterwards. If you need conflict, tension, and mystery to be artificially injected into the story by some nobody in a black hooded cloak, look at why and fix that.

I'm making Kingdom Hearts references for the memes, but you know what I mean. That thing where a mysterious masked, hooded, cloaked, or hooded and masked and cloaked character will just pop into existence within the story now and then, whenever the author needs him to do bad deeds. Or worse, bad deeds that end with the hero getting nicer stuff he wouldn't get without the mystery man's interference. Characters like these are hard to pull off, which is why they usually aren't characters, they're just plot device who exist to enforce the author's will when the author can't think of a way to make X happen organically.

I know, I know, cliches like this one aren't inherently bad, but I've only ever seen this used in a bad and lazy way. The mystery figure doesn't usually have anything about him or her that lets the audience figure out his motivations, he's just here to do acts of highly specific villainy that would leave Team Rocket scratching their heads in confusion.
