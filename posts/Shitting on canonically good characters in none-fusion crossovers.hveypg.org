Just tried a crossover story that in chapter 1 it shitted all over Ron and Hermione and in chapter 2 Harry's name turned out to be hAdRiAn because reasons.

It's basically the classic bullshit start of a crossover, where war is over Harry is riddled with angst and ministry is after him and tosses him through the veil, which is fine, in a none-fusion crossover he has to get to the other universe somehow. Just get it over with.

But NO author has to also shit on (in this instance) Ron and Hermione while praising the (AU Not Dead) Snape and Draco. Even when Harry is going to have no way back to go back to HP universe and even if he had, everyone mattered in HP universe is already dead.


** God it's so annoying when they bash characters that won't even make an appearance... makes it so obvious it's just the author wanting to make their opinion known

** I absolutely dislike Snape and Ron so I'm ok with them being bashed but that's just personal tastes. Always thought the Ginny and Molly bashing to overdone but to each their own.

*** Bashing can be funny, especially if it's original or crack, but pretty quickly it becomes a dead horse. Like, we get that the author does not like X after the third time that character was dragged through the mud, no need for the other 23 times.
