I really don't recall much about it other than Umbridge and Trelawney were at Hogwarts at the same time.

I think it may have been a primarily McGonagal fic about her time at Hogwarts, and I believe Tom Riddle was an important character as well, but I can't remember for sure.

My Googling is failing me, any help and/or recommendation would be appreciated.


** They were at Hogwarts at the same time in canon, so really any 5th year fic would probably fit.

For some reason, I think [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/1/Just-a-Random-Tuesday][this]] may be the fic you're referencing. It's worth a read, in any case.

A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

*** This definitely seems familiar, publish date seems about right for when I was big into fanfic.

Does it contain Umbridge and Trelawney as students at Hogwarts? I realized I wasn't super clear that's what I meant in my post.

** Adding comment to clarify I meant Umbridge and Trelawney as students at Hogwarts at the same time, I think with McGonagall and Riddle.
