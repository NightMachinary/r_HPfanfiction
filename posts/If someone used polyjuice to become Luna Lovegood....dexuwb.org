Would her 'flightiness' transfer over to the person who now inhabited a version of her body? Her dreamy disposition? Her possible ability to see invisible creatures with or without spectrespecs?

Would it simply be a person in a new body or would her eccentric quirks start to show themselves the longer they were in that body?

In fact on that subject what about aspects, physical and beyond, in general if you became someone else for a prolonged period (i.e. Barty Crouch staying as Alastor Moody for the better part of 9 months)...

Would you acquire Ron Weasley's insatiable appetite? If someone had OCD would you get the urges that it brings? What about verbal ticks that a person has like a lisp or a stutter? What about afflictions like asthma or the common cold or 'that time of the month'? Would these things transfer over?

How thorough is polyjuice potion?

** If some of Luna's attributes are caused chemically, maybe. Like if she has ADD or something.

But other than that, no. I think the text makes it pretty clear that the potion only physically makes you take on the form of another person - you're still you.

And even in the case of chemical “imbalance”, people cope very differently with things. Her flightiness can very well be a coping mechanism to depression, but the person who's taken her form will deal with that in their own way. Nothing to say they'd act the same as Luna.
