For anyone not familiar with this story from the ol' book, the Mark is essentially a permanent marring on Cain, who killed his brother Abel because of jealously. It has the effect of reflecting any and all harm sevenfold upon the one perpetuating it, which made Cain an outcast because people were thrown into walls or bled out when they accidentally ran into him or poked him.

In a lore sense, it would be a truly ancient spell/curse originally designed as a protection, but quickly shelved and never used again because there's no way to remove it. Throughout the ages, muggle authors interpreted things into the story, making it an act of God and building a story around what they knew. Perhaps the original subject wandered the world for a time and they built up a story from what they saw when people interacted with him.


** Kind of wonder what happens with the Dursleys and Harry then...and does the curse/spell interpret only physical harm as worthy of retribution??

** This sounds very interesting, but it's got a major pet peeve for me. Non-Euclidean geometry is just and geometry that is not based on a flat plane, like say a sphere. Or in the case of the earth, an oblate spheroid. You know those massive bridges that don't have parallel towers due to the curvature of the earth? Those are non-euclidean. Most buildings are Euclidean because that are build on a flat foundation, but even a non-Euclidean building would be indistinguishable from a Euclidean building. The Verrazano-Narrows bridge, one of those massive bridges mentioned above are only 1 5/8 inches further apart at the top, that's only a 42 one-hundred-millionths (0.000042) difference.

If you really want to include a space that defies the laws of physics and/or nature, just call it an Escher Space or something else that invokes thoughts of M.C. Escher's art. Maybe it could be called Escherine Architecture.

In summation, lovely prompt, but the concept non-Euclidean geometry being spooky-scary was coined by a half-educated, racist agoraphobe who found thing like math, the outdoors, and people whose skin wasn't white far too racy and obscene for his delicate constitution.

^{Side Note: on dictionary.com you can search for any suffix's meaning if you just prefix it with a hyphen, like -ine, -tor, -trix, -ensis, et cetera. But when you dive too deep into suffixes usually used in binomial nomenclature like -cola it starts to break down.}

^{Side Side Note: the -cola suffix means “inhabitant of” or “resides on” so Pinus monticola is the “Pine that inhabits the mountains” and Plasmopara viticola is the “Plasmodium that inhabits grapevines.”}

*** You know, non-euclidean geometry also means what I mean. Endless hallways are non-euclidean. Overlapping frames are non-euclidean. impossible spaces are non-euclidean. So I find it rich that you lecture about this when you don't realize that you're just... pointlessly rambling, but doing it with such conviction.

Sure, perhaps the word isn't fancy enough for your refined palate, but I just don't give a damn. Even if it weren't technically scientificially correct, language is an organic thing and the word means what it means to everyone who knows it.

So yeah, I don't know why you latched on to that. Maybe you just wanted to flex your "knowledge" or something, even though it was pedantic and unnecessary? I neither know nor care, and I find it ironic that your entire rant is ultimately pointless, because according to your definition of the word, the "spooky scary" stuff is still non-euclidean.
