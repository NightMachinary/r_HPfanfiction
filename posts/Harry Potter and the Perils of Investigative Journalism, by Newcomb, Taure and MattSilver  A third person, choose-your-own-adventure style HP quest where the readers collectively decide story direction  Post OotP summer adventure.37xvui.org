** This.. is a very interesting concept. Definitely going to have to follow this!

I like where the posters are going with Tonks and the Bertie Bott's Every-Flavour condoms! :O

*** This hasn't been my experience with that forum, but I'm a very new to the site. From what I can tell they aren't monolithic. Yes, there /are/ trolls and scads of useless advice given in a haughty, superior tone. But there are also plenty of users who genuinely want to give constructive feedback and help each other out.

Like anywhere else on the internet, it's a mixed bag.

  Sadly it's taking place in DLP, which is somehow a worse medium for CYOA than spacebattles.

How so?

  but I fully expect it to have evolved into yet another grimdark power fantasy yet again

Lol. If you had read the first chapter, you'd know how hilarious this prediction is XD

Also, it never fails to surprise me how many people apparently think DLP hasn't changed since 2008. I can't remember the last time a DLPer wrote a dark Harry or independent Harry story.

**** Obviously it's just my opinion, but in my experience DLP tends to think a specific type of story (that I mentioned) is something /every/ story should aspire to.

That said, it does seem like people are just picking the funny options, so maybe I was wrong.

** It's in DarkLordPotter's Work By Author section, so you'll need an account to take part/read.
