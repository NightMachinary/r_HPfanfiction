I'm fighting through writer's block, so I just wanted to write this one down. Let me know if it's stupid, or interesting, or if you want to read more.

Summary: All Ron Weasley ever wanted was a little recognition. It was time to earn it.

--------------

Tip. Tap. Tip. Tap. Tip. Tap.

The ceramic floors of the bank reflected the lights hanging from the ceiling above. The bank smelled of sulfur, zinc, and oranges. The latter overpowered the others, but the repugnant odors could not be fully masked.

Tip. Tap. Tip. Tap. Tip. Tap.

Ron Weasley's foot bounced against the tile impatiently. He had been made to wait for nearly an hour. It was the middle of the day, the time when Gringotts should not have been busy. Yet, no one had come to see them. His mother sighed exasperatedly and tapped his knee.

"Enough of that, Ronald," Molly Weasley said.

He scowled and crossed his arms. "Someone should have been here by now. Bunch of ruddy idiots."

Another sigh. Ron had heard the sound all through his childhood. His mother was known for her temper, but she was also known for her patience. He imagined that growing up with seven children exercised that particular trait to the fullest.

It was a shame that only four of those children remained.

"Ron! Mrs. Weasley!"

Ron shot up from his chair, grateful to hear a human voice. He stood nearly six feet and three inches tall, towering over Dean Thomas. Ron stuck his hand out as the fellow Gryffindor approached. Shaking his hand vigorously, Dean then bowed to Mrs. Weasley.

"Let's go over here for some more privacy." Dean gestured towards his office. He held the door open for them as they entered and then shut the door behind them. A lock slide into place as Ron took his seat.

"I'm so sorry for being late. Bit of an emergency going on right now," Dean said as he took his seat behind a large mahogany desk.

"Oh you're quite a dear for seeing us on such short notice." Molly smiled benignly at him. "No need to apologize."

Dean smiled tightly as he opened a manila folder. The Gryffindor looked healthy, his black hair cropped short and just a hint of a beard dotting his jaw line. Ron remembered his love for Muggle football and found it surprising when Dean joined Gringotts as a financial analyst. Still, it was a job, and Ron was currently grateful that it was Dean they were seeing and not one of the goblins.

The Weasleys needed this.

"So, I took a look at what your loan application. There are some good things here, but I just wanted to ask a few more questions," Dean started.

A knot started to form in Ron's stomach. He had expected Dean to just approve the loan without question. They had known each other since they were eleven. Ron tried to maintain his temper, but he could not help but glare at Dean Thomas. The other Gryffindor avoided his gaze and continued to address Molly.

Molly laughed. "Of course. What did you want to know?"

"It says here that you want to start a Muggle gifts shop. Do you have your business plan with you?" Dean asked as he licked his finger and flipped through a few parchments.

"Yes, yes! Here you go!" Molly levitated a parchment towards his desk. Dean snatched it out of the air and looked over it intently.

"I see. I see," Dean muttered to himself. "Some good ideas here. Obviously, you'd have to get a permit from the Ministry to sell enchanted Muggle goods. Do you have that as well?"

"I do."

Molly floated over a signed permit from the Ministry. Ginny had been helpful in pushing the permit along. Ron started tapping his foot again, growing more impatient with every question.

"Excellent," Dean said, but there was little optimism in his voice.

Two or three minutes passed as Dean reviewed all of the paperwork. Ron's foot tapped incessantly against the ground. His teeth clamped over his tongue, not wanting to spoil this for his mother. Molly held onto her purse tightly, her knuckles white, but a smile was plastered on her face. When Dean finally spoke again, the knot in Ron's stomach wound tighter.

"So, with all of the information you've given us, we can approve you for a loan of twenty-three Galleons."

The blood rushed to Ron's head. His ears were inflamed and red as his foot went from tapping the ground to stomping the ground. He tried to keep his teeth clamped down on his tongue, but the metallic taste of blood was too much for him.

"Mate. That doesn't even meet a quarter of the lease of the property," Ron said. "Twenty-three fucking Galleons is all you can give us?"

"Ron -" Molly tried to interrupt him, but Ron was past caring.

"Twenty-three!" Ron slammed his hand down on the expensive mahogany table. To his credit, Dean did not flinch.

Ron's former classmate closed the manila envelope containing the documents and leaned forward. He looked at Ron in the eye as he continued to deliver the horrid news.

"Given your current assets and the previous loan you defaulted on, this is all I could get. They didn't even want to give you any more, but I talked them into this much, Ron. My hands are tied!"

Ron covered his mouth his hand and ran it down his chin, exhaling petulantly. Gringotts had approved him for a two hundred Galleon loan three years ago to open his racing broom shop. It only took a year for the business to go bankrupt. He defaulted on the loan and swore off Gringotts forever.

/Yet, here I am/, Ron thought bitterly.

"But, I still have good credit under my name, don't I? What if we don't list Ron as one of the owners?" Molly asked.

Dean shifted in his seat. At least the bastard looked uncomfortable addressing Ron's mother.

"Your credit is nearly non-existent. The account was always opened under Arthur's name. He was the only one that made deposits and he never took out a loan. He bequeathed the account to you, but it has a negative balance right now. You have to understand, twenty-three Galleons is far and above what you should have gotten given your current financial standing."

"That's a bunch of sodding bullshit, Dean. You know we can turn a profit. Look at the plan! There's almost no overhead and it wouldn't cost a lot obtain the inventory. Hell, there's still a lot of my Dad's stuff in the shed," Ron argued.

"But there's no market for your product. Even by your most optimistic estimates, you would break even for two years and that's if people actually bought your product." Dean held his hands out in apology. "Even if you met these optimistic projections, that doesn't excuse your current financial standing. There is a negative balance on your account. Unless something has changed recently, there isn't an income either."

It was Molly's turn to blush. Ron remembered a time when she would have stood up and told the sodding banker off, but she had changed when Dad died. She was more subdued, the life a little dimmer in her eyes. Molly sighed and stood up.

"Mom, no. We can -" Ron tried to say.

"No," she interrupted him. Molly turned to address Dean. "Thank you for trying for us, Dean. We...we'll think of something else."

Dean stood up as well. "I'm so sorry, Mrs. Weasley. I did what I could, but my hands are tied."

She nodded curtly and exited the room, clutching her purse tightly against her chest. Ron watched her go, the fight within her no longer as strong as it once was. He turned angrily to Dean.

"You've got to be able to do something," Ron hissed.

"If I could, I would!" Dean ran his hand along his face in frustration. He stepped around the desk and sat on it. "Why can't you ask Harry for some help? I know he'd want to do som-"

"No!" Ron cut him off vehemently. "We're not a fucking charity case for him.

Dean threw his hands up in the air in exasperation. "He's not going to think of you as a charity case, Ron! He's like family to you. He would never think of you like that. This is Harry we're talking about."

"Absolutely not."

Dean sighed. He cringed as he next asked, "Any chance with Hermione?"

"Fuck that bitch."

Dean shook his head. "Okay, point taken. I really think your best bet is Harry. If you were to just say -"

"No," Ron repeated angrily. He stood up as well, relishing in the slight fear that was in Dean's eyes. Ron jabbed a finger against his chest, poking the crimson tie around Dean's neck.

"None of this reaches Harry's ears, Dean. I swear to Merlin if it does..."

Dean pushed his finger away and straightened his tie. His next words were clipped and angered.

"If you hadn't fucked up the first time, Ron, then maybe this would have worked. Please leave. I have another client."

Ron glared at his former classmate, but granted by his wish. His feet clattered against the ceramic tile of Gringotts, and he glared at every goblin that dared to look at him. He was fuming, his ears bright red and his blood boiling.

He could not ask Harry for money, not again. It was embarrassing enough the first time to admit he had lost his business. Harry had offered to help him then, but Ron could not take his pity. He would not go crawling to Harry for yet another handout. Harry was his best friend and Harry had enough of being used in his lifetime.

As for Hermione...

"Fucking bitch," Ron cursed to no one in particular.

He pushed hard against the double doors of the bank and spilled out into Diagon Alley. His mother was waiting for him, looking pensive as she stared at the rows of buildings. Diagon Alley had recovered from Voldemort's reign of terror and it was more bustling than ever. The roar of the crowd as they shopped around filled the air.

"Come on, Ronald." She tried to take his arm as he approached, but he laid a hand on her shoulder to stop her.

"I'm actually going to George's. I wanted to speak to him about something," Ron said.

She nodded and kissed him on the cheek. Ron waited until she disappeared into the crowd before sitting down on the stairs that lead to the bank.

How had it come to this?

His father's death had hit all of them hard, but Ron didn't know the whole situation would spiral out of control. Arthur had passed two years ago and Charlie died from a dragon attack not three weeks after. Bill moved to France to live with Fleur, and Ron suspected that his older brother could not stand when he transformed. Persecution against werewolves was not nearly as prevalent in France, and though there had been progress for their equality in England, it was safer for him to be with Fleur.

Percy, the pompous git, had run away from the problem of course. He moved to America, serving as some sort of aid to some sort of pansy political bastard. He sent a card for Christmas every year. How thought of him.

Ginny married Harry just a little over a year ago. She was happy when she was working and she was always working. Harry was head Auror and she worked in the Department of Magical Games. They were a perfect couple, according to the Daily Prophet. They could have turned to her for help, but then that would involve Harry, and Ron could not do that to him.

So there they were, their bank accounts empty and a paltry twenty-three Galleons if they wanted it. Ron buried his head in his hands, exhaling loudly. How had it come to this?

"Harry and Hermione get their fairy tale ending. Of course I'm the one to suffer," Ron muttered.


** After a few more minutes of self-pity, he stood up and started his trek to the Weasley shop. Business had not been kind to the Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. While their jokes and pranks sold like gold during the war, people were not as eager to buy a novelty prank now that they were in peacetime. George made enough money to keep the shop afloat, but he could not help their mother either.

A movement caught his eye.

Sparkling blond hair drew his gaze. Ron recognized her. Daphne Greengrass. He watched as she entered Knockturn Alley. The Ministry had gone through extensive lengths to purge the most darkest of wizards from Knockturn, but it still retained it's seedy reputation.

On a whim, Ron followed her.

His strides were longer and the crowd parted due to his size. He did not catch up to Daphne though, and she entered a building. A sign hung over the door. The Emporium.

Making a hasty decision, Ron followed her inside.

The air was rife with tobacco and burnt leaves. A single lantern radiated light from the middle, but it cast weird shadows everywhere he looked. Round tables littered the floor with no apparent shape. He spotted Daphne's long, blonde hair and quickly followed.

To his surprise, she entered another door near the back of the room instead of taking a seat. Curious, he followed the former Slytherin deeper and deeper into the building. He had half a mind to call out to her, but he did not want to attract too much attention to himself. Despite his current position, he was still one of the Golden Trio and this was still Knockturn Alley.

A much smaller room was hidden behind the door as Ron followed Daphne. There were fewer tables and fewer patrons this time. Still, Daphne entered yet another door and Ron was beginning to question his purpose at the Emporium. He pushed on.

In the next room, he finally caught up to her.

"Hello, Daphne," he said.

She whirled around, alarm and suspicion in her eyes. "What the bloody hell are you doing here, Ron?" She grabbed him by his elbow and led him to the corner.

A smile broke Ron's face as she frog marched him into the corner. "Whoa. I don't remember you being the aggressive one."

She scowled at him, her pretty face contorting tightly. "This is not the place for you to be."

"And what place am I supposed to be at?"

"Not here," Daphne repeated.

Ron took stock of the room. A surprising amount of people milled about the area. A large spotlight illuminated the center of the room. It was about twice the size of a regular classroom. With the number of people in the room, the atmosphere was almost intimate.

"What is this place anyway?" Ron asked.

Daphne opened her mouth to respond, but a loud gong cut her off. The rest of the wizards and witches shuffled around until the center of the room was clear. A door that Ron had not seen opened, and two wizards entered.

They wore loose robes and an odd chain around their neck. Ron watched, transfixed, as they faced each other in the center of the room. Then, they bowed.

/A duel!/

An luminescent dome surrounded the duelists as they squared off. Spells and hexes flew through the air. They were no match to someone like Harry, but they were passable. Ron had been in enough duels to know the value of an opponent. He could not tear his eyes off the sport and did not notice a man in a bowler cap approaching them.

"What's it going to be, Greengrass? You going to play it safe and take Rolly again? Odds aren't good. One to three favorite for him. I can give you two to one if Benji can last more than two minutes," said the old man in the bowler hat.

"Benji's new. He's not going to last two minutes. Put me down for a regular bet on Rolly," Daphne replied. She dropped a shiny Galleon into his bowler hat.

The old man nodded and placed the hat on his head after Daphne dropped the coin into it.

"What are you doing?" Ron asked.

"What does it look like? I'm placing a bet," Daphne said.

He shook his head, his eyes never leaving the two wizards. "You should have bet on the other one. Benji or whatever. He's going to win."

Daphne rolled her green eyes. "Rolly is a regular here. Trust me, he's going to win."

Ron disagreed and shook his head again. "Call him back. The man with the hat. Call him back."

"Ron, you shouldn't -"

He interrupted her. "Just call him back."

The man in the bowler hat returned and Ron teared his gaze off the duel for just a few seconds.

"Put a Galleon down on Benji for the win. Can you give me odds if he wins in the next two minutes?" Ron negotiated.

The old man in the bowler hat stared at the wall, bobbing his head, and then he replied, "Two and a half to one for the outright win. I can parlay it into a victory in the next two minutes for a total of seven to one."

"I'll take it."

He stared at Daphne expectantly. She returned his look with a mutinous expression on her face, but she eventually procured another Galleon from her purse and dropped it into the hat.

"You're going to pay me back for that," Daphne whispered as the man in the bowler hat left.

"I'll pay you back and more."

A bright flash of light engulfed the room and the newcomer was the only one who remained standing. Ron pumped his fist into the air, jubilation in his chest.

"I didn't take Arithmancy, but even I know I can pay you back with seven Galleons." Ron winked at her.

Daphne did not look amused. Her eyes glanced furtively around her as the loser, Rolly, was levitated away. She stood closer to him and wrapped a gloved hand around his elbow.

"Let's go. Someone like you shouldn't be here."

Ron was not going to be pulled away so easily. "Wait just a minute. Aren't you even going to ask how I knew the other guy would win?"

"Later," Daphne hissed, pulling him towards the door. He was stronger, though, and held his ground.

"Hey. What's the rush? I need to get my winnings."

"You'll get your bloody winnings, but this isn't a place for you to be," she reiterated.

"No, I want -"

"I don't bloody care what you want." She was so close to him now, her lips pressing against his ear. "For the last time you stubborn prat, let's go somewhere else. I'll talk to you about this there."

Ron was tired of being pushed around. He had just won nearly a third of what the bank was going to loan and only a dragon could pull him away now. Still, Daphne was not one to be frightened from his previous experience with her.

"You're going to tell me about this place. I want to know more."

For once, genuine worry flashed across her face. "Ron, this is fun once, but you can't be here. There's people that will recognize you. Dark wizards. Death E-"

"No." Ron interrupted her purposefully, knowing what she was going to say. "I want to know more."

Daphne hesitated, her beautiful green eyes looking up at him. "Are you sure?"

He looked around the dark and seedy room. The rest of the wizards were leaving, but he could see the man in the bowler hat making the rounds and paying out the victors. Ron had a sense that this was not an entirely legal venture and Daphne's worry only confirmed that thought. Still, it was easy money.

/Mum needs this/, he thought.

Ron leaned down and whispered into her ear.

"Yes. Tell me more."

*** This is excellent. After reading so many fics centered strictly around Harry/Hermione's POV it's nice to see something that focuses on Ron. Especially in a universe that isn't so rosy for him.

Your dialogue and narration are expertly done. The characterizations are somewhat new, but Daphne is an unknown quantity so you're certainly free to do with her as you wish (and I really admire your effort so far), Ron is different but it's easy to see how his mental processes might turn in this direction after the background you've laid out. You deserve a lot of praise for this as you've laid out an AU without resorting to any sort of infodump or cagey author's note.

I'm extremely interested to know more about Hermione's character and what could have turned Ron off of her. The H/Hr fan in me hopes that she's with Harry and that the Prophet is wrong (again).

In any case, this is quite good and I hope you'll continue to share more of it with us.

*** Thought it was going to go to some sort of chess gambling but this underground dueling seems more dramatic and could provide much more plot. Though I'd imagine this would set up some sort of conflict with Harry or other aurors due to the legality of the whole thing.

Very interesting canon divergence! Between Arthur dying, the Wealeys' Wizarding Wheezes not becoming a money spinner, and the seemingly disastrous end to his relationship with Hermione, this seems like it'd be a lot to overcome and could push Ron to desperate measures.

I noticed Ron seems to still have high respects for Harry so I'm assuming he'd be a protagonist? Anyways, great drabble! I'd be interested in reading more and there is an audience for everything. Good luck if you choose to expand on this.
