1: A feel-good fic. Second year goes differently and Ginny never encounters Diarymort, allowing her to be a cute, innocent, happy child for a few more years. Bonus points if everything just goes well in her life. Minus points if Luna ends up Diaried.

2: Pure crack. The Dark Lady Molly Weasley has one wish. To have every person in Wizarding Britain to be part of the Big, Happy Weasley Family.


** Not quite what you asked for, but how about a story where the Diary ends up Luna-ed? Linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary)

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasly loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

** linkffn(Fate's Mistake) comes to my mind. Note that in the fic Harry's childhood is much worse than in canon, but after finally reaching the wizarding world he becomes best friends with Ginny and the rest of the story is quite a bit lighter than canon, including skipping the diary.

*** This is one of those stories that I just wish the execution was better. I like the premise, and the writing is ok, but I feel like the characterizations aren't that great. Everyone 'sounds' the same (same speech patterns, level of formality and sophistication, etc.) and it keeps throwing me. A lot of the story just seems to be 'all this stuff happened' - it lacks the pacing or emotional buildups and resolutions that would make it a great story.

**** I completely agree. The whole fic reads more like a retelling of events rather than a full story.

I'd still consider it worth a read though. Also, there aren't exactly many stories where Ginny doesn't end up as the heir, which, if you think about it is actually quite a shame considering that giving someone else besides her the diary is probably one the easiest ways of mixing things up and leaving the reader guessing a bit in a second year fic.

Instead, most authors seem almost determined to just retell the same story everyone already knows all over again.

** It's interesting that you've described a feel-good fic as one where Ginny remains "cute, innocent, happy" and "everything just goes well in her life."

My favorite feel-good fic is not like that at all. Cute perhaps, but there is little enough of innocence, and she is still exposed to the Diary - for a shorter time than canon, but it's still traumatic. What makes it a feel-good fic is not the absence of big problems, but the support of loyal friends, and the slow and steady healing from big problems. linkffn(2636963)

*** Interesting - not the first thing I think of with this story, but it fits.

For the record, this story isn't abandoned, but updates once a year/every couple of years maybe? The quality is good, but it's long. I think it's longer than canon at similar points in the timeline. Or maybe the sometimes wordiness just makes it feel that way? Still, I do like this story, and second the recomendation.

***** An update would be good, but it's been so long since any previous updates that I'd have to reread the whole thing to feel caught up enough for the new chapter. With a story this long, especially a canon rehash, that's a tall order.

Back when it was started, I hadn't read so many canon do-overs. At this point I'm not even sure how far I'd make it. That doesn't have anything to do with the story itself - it's just a matter of how much fanfiction I've read since hitting the end of this one.
