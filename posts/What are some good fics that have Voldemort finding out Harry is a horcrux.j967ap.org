I always wondered what he'd have done if he had found out. Realistically, probably lock him in a box somewhere for all eternity - but the fics don't need to be dark lmao. I'm good with literally anything. Thanks!!!


** Not updated in nearly a year, but

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13047893/1/Beyond-the-Curtain]]

is pretty good so far.

Edit: Thought of another one which fits your theme better:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil]]

It's supposed to be a trilogy, only book 1 and 2 are out so far, with book 3 being ongoing. Book 1 could be considered a standalone. Have fun reading!

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.

  Amidst the stresses of his fifth school year, the horcrux within Harry begins to become sentient; its intentions unclear but possessiveness evident. Consequently, things take a dark turn as Halloween approaches.

  Harry hasn't always had things easy. But with the defeat of Voldemort, maybe he can finally get some rest. But make no mistake, it has taken a toll on Harry. He has grown tired of being the famous Harry Potter, only to discover there may be other options.

**** He intended to use the diary as a weapon, willing to potentially sacrifice it. Same can be said for Harry. Harry would still be a threat to him, someone who has link to his mind, potentially knows all his secrets. Either he can contain Harry, imprison him securely or he'd just kill him.

**** Voldemort doesn't "care" about his soul (the fact that he split it in 7 parts is proof enough of that). And the reason he made so many Horcruxe (outside of the whole "going further than anyone before" ego trip) was because he /really/ didn't want to die.

So, why destroying of of his anchors would suck, and would probably try some alternatives first, there is a point where sacrifice must be made, and if losing of split of his soul is the only way to kill "/his Chosen enemy as foretold by the Prophecy/", it is a sacrifice he would totally be willing to make.
