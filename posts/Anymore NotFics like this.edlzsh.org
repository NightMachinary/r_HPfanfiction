I just read linkao3(14906663) after seeing it recommended here.

Are there any more fics like this? I've never even seen the tag Not!Fic, let alone read one. It is such a concise way to present a story with just its best bits.

This story was a hilarious crack-fic, but I am willing to try almost any genre as I am just now learning about this style.


** /[[https://pics.me.me/prongsmydeer-the-most-hilarious-thing-about-the-fact-buckbeak-had-42813193.png][Gerald White and the Pair of Glasses]]/ has a very similar energy and is hilarious.

This recommendation is quite good, by the way, but I dispute the following paragraphs:

#+begin_quote
  -But because he's there, Snape does not manage to get the job, which doesn't help at all with his ‘everyone is out to get me' worldview,
#+end_quote

It's odd that the author borrows the "Dumbledore strongarms the traitor into accepting the Potions Master job at Hogwarts (which the traitor doesnn't really want) so that Dumbledore can keep an eye on him" plot point for Regulus, then proceeds to ignore it regarding Snape. Snape did /not/ want the Potions Master job at Hogwarts IMO.

#+begin_quote
  -Also, Regulus has a very quiet long-running project with Albus, that they mostly work on in the summers, to the tune of, “Well, if Voldemort had one Horcrux, he probably had others, and we should maybe find them...”
#+end_quote

Without Slughorn's testimony /or/ the fact that the Diary is weirdly unprotected if it's Voldemort's /only/ Horcrux, I don't see how Dumbledore would figure it out.

*** I agree with your second point.

About the first, it was Regulus who overheard the prophecy and later tells Albus about V's plans. I don't think Snape had any contact with Albus after he graduated.

**** I know, I see why Snape doesn't get the job in this timeline. But what I mean is that even in the canon timeline I don't think he was ever /after/ said job; rather, it was foisted upon him by Dumbledore as an excuse to keep him around Hogwarts, both under Dumbledore's close observation and safe from Death Eater reprisals. Meaning he wouldn't actually throw a fit about /not/ getting the job as the line here seems to imply that he would. It would simply never be on his radar to be Potions Master at Hogwarts to begin with.

***** Oh!

I think the story was saying that no one evinced any interest in him of whatever sort, not even what Dumbledore did in canon.

I see Snape as the sort who desperately craves the care of others, but can never really accept it anymore (maybe after Lily's rejection, maybe from home stuff, or some combination) due to being convinced he is unworthy or because his desperate need would strip him of all defenses if he ever accepted the care of another and he no longer really trusts...or some combination.

*** Thanks for the link, the “they're attracted to glasses” and “Mr Crocker” lines both had me laughing.

Edit - the rest of it is also good, I just meant those lines got me to lol.

  What if Regulus Black, and not Severus Snape, ended up being the turncoat Potions Master of Hogwarts? A not!fic written in bullet points, ignoring the Deathly Hallows entirely because they annoy me. Beta by my immensely patient Best Beloved, Turn_of_the_Sonic_Screw, and by the delightful starbirdrampant.
