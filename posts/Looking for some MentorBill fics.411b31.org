I have been in the mood for mentor!Bill fics like "Bungle in the jungle" and "Harry Potter and the cursed summer".

linkffn(2889350,5915140)

It doesn't need to be harry being mentored, these are just the only two I have found. And it doesn't /need/ to be cursebreaking, I just prefer it.


** There is a sad lack of cursebreaker fiction, IMO. Or, it isn't tagged well and I can't find it. I loved Cursed Summer. I wish there were more like it.

*** Same here! If only the sequel didn't stop so suddenly, there was a good buildup for one scattered through it.

**** Ok, I'm going to rec something that has a trope in it that turns a lot of people off (it's in the warnings), but I promise that it's mostly a cursebreaking fic. Really. Just try it: linkffn(harry potter and the soul gems by shedoc)

  Coming as it did a scant 10 hours after his defeat of Voldemort, the Minsitry's exile of Harry Potter must have come as a crushing betrayal...

****** I'd already commented on this thread before. I found Soul Gems and it sprang to mind (cursebreaking!). And seriously, you'll know why most people might pass, but it is /not/ that kind of fic. It all ties in with the cursebreaking. And while there is an eventual pairing, there are really no romance scenes. There's an sequel, too. And I kind of love the tent city.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

*** I read the first arc a while ago, but am waiting for the second arc to complete before going back to it. Iirc Bill was just used to have a reason to set up the plot trigger, or was there more to it than that?

**** I've read through it a few times because I rather like it, and I believe that Bill is mentioned most prominently in the first chapter. I think he might pop up in a couple specific scenes in later chapters though.

** Mentor!Bill isn't something I seek out to read, but tried to do a bunch of googling for it since no one else was replying, and I couldn't find any ao3 tags, tumblr lists, ffnet c2s, or really any collection that would help you at all. Sorry I couldn't be of help.

*** Yeah... I was hoping, but didn't expect much (I had searched before too).

Mentor!Bill just seems like something that /should/ get more stories. You have the coolest weasley (dragontooth earring!), the coolest job (cursebreaking), and one of the smartest characters mentioned that still at a somewhat relatable age around the time he shows up in England again.

The only thing holding Harry back should be his guilt/responsibility due to voldemort coming back/deaths of Cedric or Sirius, but running away from it could be a valid response. And if it's hermione, she would jump at learning new things whatever the timeframe

** The only "mentor" Bill (and Charlie) fic I've read is linkffn(Watching and Waiting by mhersheybar). That is, if teaching Harry all about pleasuring a girl counts as mentoring. It backfires on him gloriously as Harry applies his lessons on Bill's sister. Mostly smut.

  Harry catches Ginny in a private moment, and it distracts him for the rest of the day. Mature sexual content and themes.

** This does have some Bill mentoring, although it's mostly Snape. There's a companion one-shot that takes place in the middle of this that heavily features Bill and Charlie.

  Slash SSHP. Severus' POV: Potter is changing in front of my eyes, gaining a disconcerting resemblance to Tom Riddle. As usual, it falls to me to save the brat... for the price of 'only' my soul.
