:END:
- Harry (accidentally?) puts Voldemorts soul back together. After this, it seems as if Tom is dying, and Harry is even humorously pushed to be the first to visit Tom's hospital room by a couple of Death Eaters, since Tom "likes him the best".

- After Harry and Tom meet again (after the putting horcruxes together incident), a fight ensues, and Tom flicks Harry in the nose as "punishment" for putting his souls pieces back together. Harry (who is upside down for some reason I cannot recall) asks if "they are good now?", to which Tom says "yes, they are good".

- Harry worked part time jobs during the summer, and in one of them he had to work on ward around a werewolf colony. Remus and Sirius are part of this pack. If I recall correctly, so was Luna.

- At some point Harry is kidnapped by a family of werewolves driving through Germany (they intend to return him to Tom), Harry attends a party with some fae in the middle of the woods during a full moon, before continuing on his way to the UK with the family.

- There is a talking raven, that when Harry asks his to say "nervemore", actually tells him to fuck off.

- Harry is the reincarnation of someone (OC perhaps) that is the brother of the raven from the above bullet point. The raven can also take human shape at times.

I don't seem to recall anything more specific (like the plot!), and all my searches have proven fruitless. I do recall it was a massive fic, and has a very prolific author and steady fanbase.


** It's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] - an excellent fanfic, too bad it seems to be discontinued.
