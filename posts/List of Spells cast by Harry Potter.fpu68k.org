I have tried my hardest to include all the spells he cast but if there is something missing or if I added a spell that he did not cast; let me know and I will add or remove it. Hope this is useful for anyone writing a fic or someone just wondering about the spells cast by Harry.

If you want to know when Harry cast a particular spell just ask.

I will be posting a list of spells for the Hermione and Ron as well. Hope this helps.

*Edit-* I have changed the description of Dissendium. I messed up while writing the description.

Turns out the word Dissendium was used in two contexts in the series.

One was the password to the statue.

And the other was as a spell used by Harry in DH pt 1 in an attempt to destroy the Locket. It was the first one he cast that sent the locket flying and the log smoking.

Thank You to [[https://www.reddit.com/u/ChangeMe4574/][u/ChangeMe4574]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/u/S1lm4r1l/][u/S1lm4r1l]] for pointing this out.

I have also expanded the description of Expulso.

*** It looks like Harry has a few favorites that he has a high level of mastery in that he uses in a fight.

Expelliarmus is one of them. But he also likes using Impedimenta, Stupefy, Petrificus Totalus and of course protego. His protego which he learned in GoF for the third task (Hermione was able to shatter it with Jelly leg curse at the time) was able to withstand curses from death eaters and later on Voldemort himself.

Seriously Harry's Protego should have been as famous as his Expelliarmus. In the Battle of DoM Dolohov almost kills Hermione with a silent curse and when he used the curse on Harry his Protego took the brunt of it allowing him to continue fighting even after getting hit by it.

******** Just going to throw this out there. It's quite famous but not particularly good... but make the call yourself after the first two chapters. My gripe with it is mainly to do with the descriptively heavy writing style that has a strong dash of pompous dialogue.

****** Hermione and Harry were the ones who cast the protections at the camp site; Hermione more often than not. So Protego Totalum, Cave inimicum, Disillusionment Charm, Muffliato, Repello Muggletum and Salvio Hexia.

I don't remember her Protego being that strong. It was solid but not as good as Harry's was in the later books. Initially it was much better than Harry's and she was able to use non verbal Protego from the get go unlike Harry.

But then again Hermione is shown to be a pretty much Jack-Of-All-Trades and at the time, she obviously used a lot of protection/shield charms because they were the ones that were required the most, if that makes sense?

** A somewhat related thought which I'm not sure warrants its own thread.

Who else here is lowkey annoyed when authors imply that there are only a dozen or so combat spells? Unforgivables perhaps not included. I noticed a ton of fics (perhaps unknowingly) giving the impression that the few spells we see in battles are more or less the full extent of combat magic. Bruh. /Bruh!/ These people have a unique spell for turning beetles into buttons! Just think on the uselessness of that for a moment! And it exists! There are probably tens of thousands of combat spells in the Hogwarts library alone! And you're telling me it's either Stupefy or bust?

No need to know 10 different killing, and 20 incapacitating spells. Variety does come in handy for battlefield control, but even there you can do a lot with a few well mastered spells.

** What a cool compilation! Salutations from one Ravenclaw to another! I had forgotten some of these spells.

At the same time though, over 7 years of magical education, you'd think there would be...well...more spells? Haha, Harry oh harry....always falling back on those familiar spells...

*** There were a lot more spells. I left them out because we never saw Harry actually cast them. I left out spells from first and second year which he should know, spells he was about to use but the situation changed and he thought better of it.
