:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for an old fanfic I've read where Harry is a time traveler (I think) and also Lord Slytherin. His Lord Slytherin persona wears a mask. Harry tutors Hermione, Luna, the daughter of Sirius Black, Daphne. His Lord Slytherin persona has a betrothal agreement with Daphne who laters becomes Lady Slytherin. Sirius' daughter becomes a necromancer.

  What do you think of the story? Personally, I like the whole Lord Slytherin persona and the faction he creates out of that identity as a response to the Light and the Dark.

How long do you think until this finishes? Then I can start reading it!

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
