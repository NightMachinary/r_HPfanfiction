I'm looking for decently written stories that have Heart Jerking/ Unexpected moments. Moments that turn the story around.


** A little child shall lead them linkffn(10871795) Chapter Five is just a roller coaster ride. Worth reading just for that.

Playmate is a oneshot that really tugs on the heartstrings linkffn(10027124). Sadily I find Harry really OOC in this one, given how pliable he is in cannon.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  Curses. Dark curses, rather, weren't very fun at all, and certainly not when Hermione keeps waking up in a different decade because of one. At least the company wasn't half bad. Oneshot.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

*** I actually just finished reading this fic this morning. It was a very good read.

My only minor complaint is the author's use of the word toleration instead of tolerance. It's a nit picky complaint, but it comes up multiple times per chapter in the latter two thirds of the story.
