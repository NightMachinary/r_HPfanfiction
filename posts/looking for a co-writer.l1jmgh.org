I write drarry.

I need someone who can work around my busy schedule, and is fine with very detailed planning before writing. I was hoping for a, for lack of term, long-term partner, but I'm fine with working with someone once.

My current project we would be working on is wand lore, soul mates, 8th year, and angsty with loads of pining. I already have several notebooks with notes on it.

DMs on my wattpad is how I usually do this, and so that's how I will continue. Docs, too, now that it's been brought to my attention it's uses for this. Nothing more, nothing less.


** I mean, I do wanna help, but I have issues with motivation to actually do productive shit, and I'm also busy with this other dude as a beta.

Therefore, I will be co-writer, if you don't already have somebody lined up, so long as you remind me to work on it and contact me regularly. Also, I'm picky about things like pining, and a lot of it doesn't really appeal to me, so as long as I can back out if I decide I don't understand/like the premise.

However, despite my lil issues, I would love to help you out with writing and if you don't have someone helping already, I'll totally message you on Wattpad. My username is HufflepuffBellatrix. I love drarry, and I'd love to be useful ðŸ˜Š

*** I found you, but apparently my wattpad has decided to fuck me. It won't let me even activate the account; which I already did when I created it almost a week ago! well, I'm always here on reddit and on tumblr(cest-la-via-fics) which have DMs. I also have an insta.
