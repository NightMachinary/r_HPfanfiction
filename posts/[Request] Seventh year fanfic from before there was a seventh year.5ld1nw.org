I remember reading, long ago before DH was released, a fanfic of the seventh year that in my opinion was phenomenal, but i have no idea what website it was on or what it was called. It was very dark, and involved Voldemort taking over Hogwarts and even possessing Harry. I'm sorry I cant help much more, and thats not a lot to go on, it would be a miracle if someone actually found it. But who knows, this is reddit.

Edit: I remember another part. It involves Voldemort showing up to Privet Drive and killing at least Vernon. Like I said it was much darker than the rest of the series.


** "The Seventh Horcrux", linkffn(2818538)?

It came out before DH, correctly predicted Snape as a 'good guy' and Harry being a Horcrux.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

** Linkffn[[the book of Morgan le Fey by lavenderbrown]] and the sequel are a books 6 and 7 before there was a book 6. Ron centric, pretty good, there's an OC Dada teacher that's a little odd. It's supremely strange that there aren't any horcruxes.
