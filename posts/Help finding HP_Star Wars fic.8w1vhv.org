I'm looking for a fanfic that involves Harry Potter Shaak Tii and Maris Brood. And Harry saves part of the Jedi Ordr or at least part of it, by using a time turner. Thats all I remember about the fic.

**** Know though that this one begins as a clear rip off of "Last Second Saviour" also given on this thread. Yes it's completed but I found it of lesser quality. Unfortunately the other one isn't finished

***** Ironically Last Second Saviour is itself a ripoff of one of bluminous8's abandoned stories, Sword and Magic, there is a version of about 12ish chapters somewhere on the internet. Bit smuttier and not as much of a clear story as plums one, but I was the same in finding this one worse as well as being a ripoff of a ripoff.

** Yes, both fanfics are great, but it's a shame that they have not updated them in as much time.

If you want to read a good Star Wars crossover, I recommend linkffn(A Horse For the Force) It is not of this fandom but I think you will enjoy it anyway.

The author also has this linkffn(Magic of the Force) a Harry/Aayla, if you do not like the above (which personally I like more) you can give a view to this.

**** With Plums and Kathryn you can never know. They seem to prefer publishing a gargantuan chapter every other year rather than write smaller but frequent chapters. 2 years between updates is sadly not out of the ordinary for them and hardly indicative of abandonment.

Still sucks for the readers tho.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
