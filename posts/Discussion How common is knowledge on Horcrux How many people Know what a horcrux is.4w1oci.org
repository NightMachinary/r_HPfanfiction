I've read fics where Snape, Amelia Bones, Malfoy, or Sirius immediately recognized or "paled" at the mention of the word Horcrux. Realistically, how many people in the HP Universe would you expect to know what a Horcrux is?


** Realistically, no matter how available the information is, we have to assume it's a very, /very/ small group of people simply because no one knew or hypothesized that Voldemort would have them. If it was even close to common knowledge before or during his rise everyone would have known about them after his death, and definitely after his resurrection. If you include Dumbledore, Slughorn, Voldemort, and Regulus, I honestly wouldn't say it would be more than seven or eight people in all of magical Britain would have known without Dumblefore telling them. I sincerely doubt any of the Death Eaters, the people that would generally be most interested in such things, would have known because Voldemort would have killed them to make sure they didn't start spreading the information around or start making guesses about whether or not he might have one.

*** I think the fact that Voldemort was so certain of his immortality means that he himself was convinced that only a very small number of people in England knew about them.

Also, we know from HBP that he asked Slughorn if he knew what horcruxes were when he was still a student, so I imagine that the Hogwarts Library would have contained books that mentioned the term (which is where he would have discovered their existence), but not much information about what exactly they were and how one would make them.

I think in those books it might also have been presented as "magical theory", something that someone had /allegedly/ managed to create before, but that there really was no proof of it ever existing. So even if someone had read the entire Hogwarts Library when the books were still there, they probably would have a hard time believing that Voldemort could have created even one horcrux, much less seven of them.

** Well, from canon we know that there used to be books on horcruxes in the Hogwarts Library (presumably the Restricted Section) until Dumbledore became Headmaster in 1955 (according to the Lexicon). So, theoretically, it can be anyone who had permission to peruse the Restricted Section before 1955 and is still alive. However, from Slughorn's memory, it is implied that it is something not many people know of, and Tom Riddle/Voldemort in that memory calls it a rare piece of magic.

In canon, until Harry is told, we know outright that Voldemort, Slughorn, Dumbledore and Regulus Black all knew what Horcruxes were. How Regulus Black knew, we will never know, but that is probably why people assume that Sirius would know. To the tentative list, I would put Grindelwald (the evil Dumbledore) and probably whoever the Head of the Department of Mysteries is. Sirius hated Dark Magic all his life, so I doubt he learned what one was growing up, but it is still possible. For some reason, though it is incredibly implausible and unlikely, I have the thought that Aberforth might know. They're mentioned in some books from the Hogwarts Library (or were, at any rate), so whomever owns copies of those books AND HAVE READ THEM would know. But if a book called /Magick Moste Evile/ says that it will not speak of them, well, I doubt there are many, or any beyond /Secret of the Darkest Art/.

It is far easier to know who doesn't know. Voldemort would not have trusted one of his horcruxes to someone who knew what one was, so the Lestranges didn't know, and neither did Lucius Malfoy. Because the Lestranges and Malfoy couldn't know/be told, no Death Eater other than Regulus probably knew what one was. Snape didn't know of them either (from The Prince's Tale, that conversation about Nagini proves this).

EDIT: So in conclusion, effectively nobody.

*** If I recall correctly, there were only mentions of the word horocrux but no actual explanation of it in the books because of its horrendous nature, hence why Riddle had to sweet talk Slughorn into letting him know. Also, yeah barely anyone except those who were craving for power as much as Dumbledore used to back then with Grindelwald and Slughorn being a friend of Dumbledore and most likely helped out in the old Order of the Phoenix during Grindelwald's reign, pretty sure 99.99999999% of the wizarding world doesn't know of its existence

I'm not a fan of the whole "Knockturn Alley is where you go to get everything illegal and super rare/super evil stuff thing." It's the Wizarding Britain version of late 80s, early 90s Compton.

As for Durmstrang, well, I didn't really think of it, but the comments about them and Dark Magic teaching is hearsay, if I remember right.

*** Hmm. I always thought that Snape was included on the "in the know" list. I presumed Dumbledore filled him in during the time he was having Snape treat his cursed hand. It would probably be important and relevant info in order to brew a potion to slow the curse. Additionally, the knowledge would lend weight to his request that Snape kill him. I always read that conversation Snape had about Nagini as playing along to the very end the image of obedient servant who only knows what his master wants him to know.

** I know one story where it was pretty much down to Harry, Hermione, Ron and Voldemort (everyone else who knew was dead - according to Dumbledore before he died. And Dumbledore had spent years trying to track down the written knowledge and destroy it).

Anyway, they decided the knowledge was so dangerous, that Hermione and Ron requested that Harry obliviate the knowledge from them. The word itself, and the basics of what they were.

*** u/turbinicarpus:
#+begin_quote
  Two possibilities (alluded to by JK iirc) are necrophilia and cannibalism. Maybe they prevent the person from leaving limbo like some kind of Death Note. Regardless, they're horrific.
#+end_quote

IIRC, there wasn't anything specific, but rather a throwaway line by Rowlings's agent or some such, who felled sickened by it when Rowling told her.

The thing is, that's a pretty low bar. Necrophilia and cannibalism --- they can add extra squick, but frankly, I think that they don't work thematically: the revulsion involved is physical and not moral or spiritual, and they are not that much worse than plain old murder most foul without them as follow-ups.

This is getting into the headcanon territory, but in a moral (rather than indifferent) universe with immortal souls, the very intent to create a horcrux compounds the original murder. The evil of it comprises:

- The /act/ of murder most foul itself: I don't think a horcrux would take if the death is not one hundred percent intentional on the part of the murderer and unwanted on the part of the victim.
- The /intent/ to mutilate one's immortal soul --- what makes one human --- on purpose and with full knowledge, rather than out of ignorance and as a side-effect of a common crime.
- The /hubris/ (in the Ancient Greek sense) of not accepting one's own mortality and passing into the afterlife, but instead instead presuming to obtain immortality on one's own terms; and the additional hubris of entertaining the belief that one might actually succeed in doing so.
- The /sense of entitlement/ that one is so important, that one is entitled to murder another and commit crimes against nature to prolong one's life.

Put together, I think that the deliberate act of making a horcrux is evil enough in itself in Potterverse that it doesn't really require any extra accoutrement to make it repugnant. Merely committing an unjustifiable murder and then just willing, essentially, that a piece of one's soul be stored in a phylactery of some sort, compounds the original murder sufficiently that the soul is torn the rest of the way and a horcrux created. Of course, this is getting deep into the headcanon territory.

**** I completely agree. My favorite rendition of them is in Harry Potter and the Prince of Slyterin series where the Horcrux is like a Patronus.

To cast a Patronus you have to concentrate on your happiest memory. You need to have a certain mindset.

For the Horcrux ritual, you must have the mindset that out of all lives, yours is the only one saving. Basically you must never ever regret murdering someone, which is extremely evil.

(The fic actually expands on this, for example Fendifyre requires the mindset that to kill whoever you're using it on any amount of collateral damage is acceptable)

I'm just saying that there needs to be something there that makes making a horcrux worse than murder. Even worse than wholesale murder.

I think that in Potterverse metaphysics,

EvilOf(Murder + Intent to Make a Horcrux) > EvilOf(Murder)

and even

EvilOf(Murder + Intent to Make a Horcrux) > EvilOf(N * Murder)

even for a pretty big N, so it suffices to make the horcrux. (Heck, there's even some canon support for that, in that Voldemort's soul fragment settled in Harry's scar without any extra actions on Voldemort's part.)
