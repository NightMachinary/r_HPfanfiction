I tried to post this last night, but it got downvoted to oblivion for some reason. This pairing intrigues me, but I've never encountered anything readable. Any recommendations?


** Ive read a few. I just happen to stumble upon. Not really a fav pairing though. Id look into fanfiction.net then filter names with Sev/ginny.

*** People are allowed to like different things. This subreddit is not just for "popular" pairings, or pairings that "make sense." OP is allowed to ask for some suggestions, especially if she can't find any fics with that pairing by herself. This subreddit is not just for fanfics that /you/ like and approve of.

Grow up.
