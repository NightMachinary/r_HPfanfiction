Elphias Doge became an Animagus, and became a weird Dog. not knowing the signifance of it, he ends up in the Muggle World, and he becomes a Meme.

It'd require moving the timeline forward (Doge came about in 2013. So it'd mean jumping the Timeline forward 20 years)


** It was days like this one that made Harry regret taking up the Potter seat on the Wizengamot. As a junior member, the man-who-conquered was placed on "whichever committee no one else wanted", which was why he was sitting in a conference room with eight wizards and two witches. The topic of debate was whether the penalty for violating import rules for potions ingredients should be stricter than the penalty for violating import rules for flying carpets.

The committee had been arguing for twenty minutes when it happened. Elphias Doge, the oldest wizard in the room, had quietly dozed off in his chair, letting the argument proceed without him. Harry noticed, but said nothing.

Daniel Greengrass, however, was not as patient as Harry. Leaning over, he shook Doge's shoulder. "Oi, Doge, wake up!" he said.

Elphias opened his eyes and glared at Lord Greengrass. The room had quieted, and everyone looked at the elder member of the committee.

Doge sighed. "If you lot are just going to talk in circles, then I'll sit here and stare at you." Before anyone could reply, Doge shifted into his animagus form. The (very good) dog sat in the high-backed chair, his head tilted slightly, his eyes focusing on nothing in particular.

All activity in the room had ceased, as everyone stared at the unnerving creature before them. Then, after a moment, the silence was broken by a snort of laughter from Harry Potter.

"Such Merlin," he said between laughs. "Much win."

"Woof," replied Elphias Doge, happy that someone finally got the joke.

** Why does it require moving the timeline? As far as we know he's still alive, just /really/ old.

*** I suppose it doesn't, I tend to just dislike Nextgen fics as 90% of them are actually worse than Cursed Child.

Moving the Timeline at least keeps it with Harry and Co.

**** Yeah, I've had to do that for the fic I'm working on, because critical plot points require either moving canon 10 years forward, or completely rewriting much of the history of the 80s and 90s.

For now it's not hard to do - I can just have everyone whose age is important be born 10 years later, and have Voldie wait an extra 10 years studying and traveling before starting the first Blood war.

***** Just remember how technology changed society, wizards would have at least started to take notice and be more aware to not break the Statute of Secrecy.
