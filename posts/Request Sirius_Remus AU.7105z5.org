Looking for Sirius/Remus AU's, doesn't matter what the AU is, just want an AU with Remus/Sirius.

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

(Am also fine with Het/Femmeslash pairings). Would just want Remus/Sirius as a main or one of the main pairings.


** How AU are you wanting? Like a totally different thing (like non-magic, modern day?) or just A/U as in non-canon?

The best non-magic AU Sirius/Remus I've read is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1651109][Text Talk]].

A super interesting AU is [[http://rs-games.dreamwidth.org/82564.html][Riding the Rails]] which is a sirius/remus set during the American great depression.

A fairly close to canon but not quite that I loved is [[http://rosie-writes.livejournal.com/1468.html][Bring Me a Boat]] where the basic premise is that Remus never believed that Sirius was guilty and goes on a mission to rescue him from Azkaban.

A great AU where Remus and Sirius steal Harry from the Dursleys and raise him is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987408][Stealing Harry]].

  Sirius is in boarding school, Remus is in hospital, and they don't know each other until Sirius texts the wrong number.

  In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.

*** Don't care how AU the story actually is, can be a bit AU or majorly AU or whatever. Can be close to canon, far away from canon or anything in between really.

Thanks! Will check them out, if anyone knows any more let me know!
