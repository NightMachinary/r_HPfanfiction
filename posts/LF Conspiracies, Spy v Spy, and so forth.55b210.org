Hello all.

I'd like some fics that feature conspiracies, powers behind the throne, or some spy v spy action.

Preferences

1. No moustache twirling, evil!Dumbledore. This is damn near always incredibly stupid, and I don't need that in my life. Unless it is...

2. Intelligent. I'd prefer the fic to be well thought out, clever and just plain not stupid. I'd rather not have my intelligence insulted.

3. Not slash.

4. Written in English. Non-negotiable. I barely speak English, let alone other languages.

5. Harry centric if possible.

Things I have read already:

Death Gate Trilogy (Ring of Gold, Amulet of Stone, Jewel of Darkness)

Unatoned

Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (sadly counts)

Well-Groomed Mind

Hogwarts Battle School

Duality

The Legacy (it kinda sorta has this going on)

EDIT: Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin (incredibly galling that I forgot this, since I'm REREADING IT)

And that's all I can think of at the moment. Thanks.


** Prince of Slytherin has been getting there lately... But otherwise - I think you got them all.

*** Son of a bitch I knew I was forgetting something. And the sad part is, I'm currently rereading Prince of Slytherin to see if the things I'm thinking because of this Italy interlude is actually a thing, or is me going tinfoil levels of paranoid.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** A long one, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771/1/Partially-Kissed-Hero][Partially kissed hero]] which is epic in how Harry and co circumvent genius!evil!Dumbledore who knows how to use Horcruxes intelligently.

A shorter one, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2067949/1/Death-Betrayal][Death & Betrayal]] where Snape learns how to be a spy. The atmosphere is great in this one.

I forgot to add littlewhitecat's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][Inquisitor Carrow]] series where Harry learns to be a Warhammar40k Inquisitor (no prior knowledge required) then gets plonked back to his own time to play with the hapless Ministry, Dumbledore and the God Emperor. Scheming and conspiracying galore. Best Dumbledore and Snape I've seen in a while.

** Gah... I can't find the fic but there is a decent spy fic where Harry is a "sport." It takes place during the tri-wizard tournement.
