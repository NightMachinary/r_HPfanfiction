anyone have a copy or a way to access "Underneath the Starless Sky" or "Stars that Align the Full Moon" by Dark Cyan Star? It's mentioned under the profile on AO3 but not under works. Does anyone know what happened to them?


** I only have Stars that align the full moon, if someone has underneath a starless sky, post it! Try this... I have this saved from years ago. I still go back and read it when I'm feeling nostalgic.
