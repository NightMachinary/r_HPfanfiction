We had a previous post created by someone else asking about the most pathetic Harry you've ever read, but I'm looking for your favorite Harry that you've read.

He can be a main character or not. Just a Harry Potter that you really enjoyed reading about.


** HufflepuffHarry is hilarious.

** My favorite kind of Harry Potter to read are the stories that has Harry either as an older brother figure, parental figure, or teacher figure. Whenever assumes the role as an older brother I find the story to be pretty well done and often create a somewhat realistic relationship (at least for fanfiction).

For parental stories, I like seeing Harry being the opposite as he was raised. Someone who shows warmth, care, and love unlike how he raised. Which I think makes a lot of sense for his character because Harry rebels against things he sees as wrong and how he was raised would fall in that.

I blame the OOP for my desire to see Harry being a teacher. Seeing Harry teach the DA felt right and I wish there was more of that.

** The VERY proactive and even a bit scary Harry from Eclipse of the Sky.\\
He's my favorite version.\\
His Gryffindor traits are explored to the max, making him so controled by his emotions that his passion for Kaylens is almolst obssessive and his actions towards the war are hateful and muderous.\\
He's reckless and impulsive to the extreme, and i love it !

If anyone has some fics with more Harry like this i would gladly accept.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.
