[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9655837/1/Harry-Potter-Becomes-A-Communist][Harry Potter Becomes a Communist]] definitely belongs alongside the masterwork that is 30Hs on that list of classics as well.

** What about the one where harry fell in love with professor snape because ron put armontentia in his drink for april fools, but it turned out that it was a bluff and ron never put ANY thing in his drink, it was the placebo effect and Harry had fallen in love with Snape by himself! I think that was the best april fools I've ever heard of, and it seemed very well written.
