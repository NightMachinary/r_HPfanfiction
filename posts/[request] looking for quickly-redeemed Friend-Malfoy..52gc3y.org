** Not sure if this is what you're looking for, but in the Innocent series, linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7), Draco has a brother who's about 10 months older than he is. They start off with similar Draco-ish personalities at about age 9 but Snape and Narcissa conspire to make Draco more Gryffindor-ish in the hopes of having one Malfoy child in Slytherin and one in Gryffindor to befriend Harry no matter where he's sorted. The outcome without spoiling it is Draco learns some stuff that changes his mind about some pretty important things, and his friendships develop differently from canon and from his brother's. The Draco plot is only a side story in the series but the whole thing is great overall if you want to give it a shot. Draco's progression is probably my favorite in the whole thing.

** I have three to recommend - two of which end up Drarry but that part can pretty much be ignored as it isn't a main part of the story at all.

In the [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/992265/chapters/1960418]["Stealing Harry-verse"]] the Laocoon's Children fics (they go first through third year) have a Harry and Draco best friendship. Draco is in Hufflepuff and Harry is in Slytherin. There is some slash between remus and sirius, but that isn't the focus of the fic. linkao3(992265)

In [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/78806/chapters/104944][The If Sieve]] the premise is that there is a magical object called an "if sieve" that works the same as a pensive, letting you see how events would have played out if one decision was changed. Draco in this fic wants to find out what he could have done to have been friends with Harry. He makes a ton of changes ranging from having Voldermort not kill Harry, to befriending Harry in Madam Malkins, to having Harry apologize after the 6th year bathroom incident, to joining the DA 5th year. Not much really changes his relationship with Harry in all of these different possible pasts. But Draco slowly starts to realize how to befriend Harry in the present and the If Sieve gives Draco some insight on how to fight Voldermort. One of the possible pasts has them kissing which is why it is marked as slash, but it is more than anything an interesting Harry/Draco friendship fic. I would recommend this fic to anyone who loves "what if" fics. It is really well done and a definite favorite of that genre. linkao3(78806)

My last rec is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/78824/chapters/104978][Earthbound Spook]] actually by the same author as The If Sieve. This fic uses a cool plot device that I haven't really seen before (A Black Comedy kinda uses it)- there are multiverses and certain spells could send a person from one to another. Draco from an AU where he is a Gryffindor and best friends with Harry and Ron jumps into a mostly canon 7th year universe. The new Draco is really well written as he is very similar to the Draco from canon but his Gryffindor side is heightened. Also, I kept expecting Draco to reveal that he and Harry had been romantically involved in the AU, but they were not exactly... The slash in this is really mild (maybe just one kiss?) and at the end. Otherwise it's an interesting glimpse into what if the trio were Harry, Draco and Ron. linkao3(78824)
