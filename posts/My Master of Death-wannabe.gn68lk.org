Hi my name is Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore and I have long white beard and hair (that's how I got my name) with silver streaks and ends that I tuck into my belt and brilliant, soul-piercing blue eyes sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and a lot of people tell me I look like Michael Gambon (AN: if u don't know who he is get da hell out of here!). [[I'm not related to Gellert Grindelwald but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie. I'm an old guy but my teeth are real. I have pale white skin and a black dead-looking hand. I'm also a wizard, and I work in a magic school called Hogwarts in Scotland where I'm the headmaster (I'm one hundred fifteen). I'm eccentric (in case you couldn't tell) and I wear mostly flamboyant jeweled-coloured robes. I love Madam Malkin and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a long wizarding robe with matching lace around it and a long purple cloak, a purple and gold hat and buckled high-heel shoes. I was wearing sparkly lipstick, sparkly foundation, sparkly eyeliner and extra sparkly eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very calm and serene about. A lot of students witch (lol, geddit) I was supposed to protect and not sacrifice in the name of greater good stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.

“Hey Albus!” shouted a voice. I looked up. It was.... Severus Snape!

“What's up ma boi?” I asked.

“Nothing.” he said shyly.

But then, I heard my friends call me and I had to go away.


** This. I like.

** Welp this made my day... or week? I was trying to decide which line was my favorite. After much deliberation I eventually decided on this one: "A lot of students witch (lol, geddit) I was supposed to protect and not sacrifice in the name of greater good stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them."
