Today, in a fit of pique, I renamed my drabbles story because it had two drabbles and forty some chapters of long form writing. I like the new name a lot better(something I came up with last night with a change of title that felt even better than last night's idea).

What are your thoughts on people renaming their stories in the middle of it all? Does a sudden name change confuse you when you receive an email saying a story you don't remember following has updated?


** I've never had it happen, but I don't think it'd be too hard to figure out if you put an A/N in the update. Maybe on your profile too.

** I don't mind and I'd much prefer this rather than an author taking down their story, renaming it, then uploading it again chapter by chapter because then I would get 40+ email alerts.

*** Not to mention those who only subscribe to one story and thus wouldn't get any alerts at all.

*** Yeah, my compilation of story fragments was called harry potter drabbles then i thought 'anthology of interest' then the next day i thought they're kind of all broken and baam, 'an anthology on broken pottery' which felt even better because they're all first drafts.
