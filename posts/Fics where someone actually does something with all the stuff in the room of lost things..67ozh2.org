  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** It's not major, but in /The Arithmancer/, Hermione uses various objects from the Room at times. This includes hundreds of toy wands (used for cutting up and serving as templates for custom-made wands), and, more interestingly, a Quick-Quotes Quill that once belonged to Rita Skeeter, which Hermione later uses to write an article in Skeeter's name (since the Quill absorbed Rita's usual purple prose style).

** In linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds by Seselt), re-incarnated time-travelled Hermione sorts through most of the stuff in there, including money and clothes, since, for plot reasons, she is short of any other means to support herself.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*

** not directly what OP wants asks about, but I really like how in Princess of the Blacks Jen figures there must be a lumber room somewhere, and eventually tracks it down. As a yank, I had no idea what a 'lumber room' was, but I looked it up and learned something new. If I ever do see a real lumber room, I'll probably be reminded of the Room of Hidden Things.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of neither. Matou Shinji, protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focus on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements or both settings with author original ideas. Ongoing, with currently iregular updates.

Shinji's use of stuff from the room even leads to creation of a new school rule.
