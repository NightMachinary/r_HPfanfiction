Basically, a fic where Harry resents Sirius and Remus for abandoning him after his parents' death (since the two were his father's best friends.) WITHOUT bashing, Sirius and Remus regret it, but Harry takes longer to forgive. It may also be that Harry resents the order of the phoenix. Thank you, thank you in advance.
