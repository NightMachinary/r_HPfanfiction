I've had some interesting conversations recently on how French culture differs from what we in England might expect and how the books themselves were localised to reflect that - for instance, Hermione's intellectual traits were more emphasised in the French translations. It got me curious about how one might write a fic that accurately reflects French culture and norms/ideals, and how many people manage that.

So, for those writing 'Harry-attends-Beauxbatons' fics or just 'Harry-goes-to-France' fics, what are your best French-finds, France-says, and examples of general Frenchitude to help us non-French write more accurate fanfiction? If you know any good resources, feel free to link!

If you have any good fics that are particularly French, feel free to link those too.


** I know this from my French exchange; pain au chocolats are twice the size you get in the UK and about a quarter of the price.

So if you're writing a piece where there's an equivalent of Hogsmeade (I hope that's right), the pastries are larger and cheaper than the british equivalents.

Bread is also a fair bit cheaper as well.

** A few things I know about France (as an American):

- */There is no snacking./* That is an American thing. French have multiple small courses and/or portioned meals to SAVOR and not simply EAT. You will get confused looks if you are snacking on the Metro. You get confused looks if you're strolling around France chomping down on food from a bag. They'll instantly identify you as a foreigner or "Frenchman/woman who has spent time in America" in seconds. They just KNOW.

- The French, compared to America, are infinitely more intellectual and don't have as many "taboos" in discussion as Americans do. They like to debate and discuss controversy, while it's hard to get into a controversial convo with somebody in America without somehow insulting them or getting into a heated argument.

- If it isn't already pretty well known, French are not as ridiculous about LGBT+ individuals. So if you're writing a "Harry-Attends-Beauxbatons" kind of fic, the "sexual awakening" stage of his growing-up into a teen is definitely going to be a lot more diverse and exploratory than what you'd get at Hogwarts (because stuffy old british customs of the wizarding world in britain probably aren't super cool with LGBT+.... unless you read into the "witches and sorcerers in Britain were a LGBT+ coded thing, so thus the wizarding world is hella cool with LGBT+" but it's all up to you on that.)

- Also pretty obvious: FASHION. Clothing styles in Britain are a completely different animal to French clothing styles. Do some research on 1990s french fashion and everyday wear vs. British fashion. and everyday wear. Trust me, there is a serious difference. Harry will look infinitely more trendy than anybody else in Wizarding Britain.

That's just a few things. Really, do some research on 1990s France. That's a pretty solid jumping point.

************ I'm both French and American, actually - so I have at least somewhat of a look at both :P

In the US, the main political parties (due to how the system is setup) are very broad. So the Democrats encompass everything from center-right in French politics all the way to the somewhat-left. That's with caveats that on some issues, like healthcare, the view in the US is just off the charts to the right compared to France/Europe.

For a socialist candidate, the US would likely not vote for any actual socialist - the equivalent of the France Insoumise would be super fringe at best. A social democrat - along the lines of the old PS - would certainly get the vote of a lot of democrats if selected. That's where I'd put Bernie Sanders at, at least with his policies in the US - somewhat center-left by French standards, and there'd be a lot of democrats very happy to vote for him.

He's also done a lot to rehabilitate the term 'socialism' - even if he is now using it to mean social democracy. 15-20 years ago, a self proclaimed socialist would probably have had no chance - now, at least, that's changed.

** [[/u/little_lou]] covers some excellent points to keep in mind - personally, I would take a few steps further to more structural ones. Obviously, we know very little about Wizarding France in Canon, so you have a lot of ways to take it.

One big one for me is that you do want it to reflect french culture and history, and so it should feel rather distinct from Wizarding Britain. One way to do that is to start the wizarding culture/society from scratch, and decide how it might have evolved. For instance, we get hints from canon that France is more open to non-humans than Britain is in the wizarding world. Emphasizing that might lead to ideals of the French Revolution playing a bigger role in the Wizarding culture of France - and so with much less of a pureblood focus than the ones we see in Britain. Other divergent points are always interesting to pick up on.

For Beauxbatons in particular, I'm personally not a huge fan of it. The way it's a school for half of europe in canon, and pretty barebones, just doesn't really do it for me. But it does give you room to take it as is - a Hogwarts like school in a castle - or shift it to be more along more modern french lines (eg, directly state-owned and nearer the major wizarding center of France instead of remote, etc). I'd be more than happy to have it renamed and retconned in a fic to something different... But that's beyond the point of this post!

Food wise, you'd definitely want to play up the much better and abundant ( ;) ) bread, pastries, wine, and other classic french dishes. When eating with family, meals tend to be very relaxed and take a long time - at least in my family & connections (I can't speak towards British culture on that front). My family tends to buy everything local when we're in France - so going to the local market, small shops in walking distance, buying fresh bread, etc.

Much will depend on how wizarding culture is decided to be portrayed. If it's more along governmental/centralized lines (ie, around Paris), it'll feel very different from being spread out in the countryside and across the whole of France. If you live in Britain, I'm sure you've been able to take a trip to Paris and/or the French countryside, and see some of the differences pretty visibly (I've run into enough brits in vacation in the Dordogne to notice that ;) ). But France is a lot more spread out and agricultural than the UK, I believe.

In some ways though, it's very hard to say. I've mentioned before that a lot of the british culture in the wizarding world got rolled over into the magical side of things, so it's hard to know what should change to really fit the same 'feel' as a british person would have reading the books, you know?

*** I never had any problems about Beauxbatons teaching students from around half of Europe. In my headcanon, the school was created later than Hogwarts, during the XIIth or XIIIth century.\\
At that time, the Dynasty in place were the Capet of Valois (a branch of the Capetian Dynasty), and other branch of the Capetian dynasty ruled most of Europe), so it's not that hard to imagine that the children of all these countries were sent to Beauxbatons. With the Statue later happening, the school kept teaching children ignoring what happened in the Muggle world.

**** The house of Valois only emerged in the 14th century, actually (1328 - they get their name from Charles, Comte de Valois who died in 1325 and never ruled France - the 'Rois Maudits' - or Accursed Kings - series includes him, if you're interested in that period.) - and you're incorrect as to how much of Europe was ruled by them. The Valois were originally only in France - at most, you could also say there was one Valois king of Poland-Lithuania in the 16th century, and a bunch of dukes, but they certainly did not rule most of Europe. You're probably thinking of the Habsburgs (who'd rule in Austria, Spain, Bohemia, the Netherlands, Hungary, Naples, Portugal, etc) or the Bourbons (France and Spain, primarily). Past that, of course, it doesn't really make sense for them to send their schools out of country to be trained for no real reason, whatever the muggle king's dynasty might be.

Like, there's really no reason why there wouldn't have been an Italian or spanish magical school /except/ that JKR didn't really care about anything outside the UK, and didn't bother to explain it. The language is different, the culture is different, etc - if we're going to say that those magical communities are intertwined enough to have Beauxbatons the only school for continental western Europe, then it's almost certainly going to be a single school.

Obviously you're free to find whatever justification you want to make that work... but if we're taking the muggle justification from that time period, you'd have no real reason for /Hogwarts/ to exist - if I were to hazard a guess to what region of Europe outside of France in the 12th-14th century would be most likely to send nobility to France to be educated/raised, it would be England.

They are also pretty close culturally because they all stayed catholic during the reformation and Spain, Portugal and France had a similar interior structure, unlike for example the HRE or the British monarchy. At least until 1692, when the SoS came into effect. Portugal even used to be in a personal union under the Crown of Spain.

There's also no deep historical animosity comparable to the ones between Poland and the German state(s) or Poland and Russia. Or anything in the Balkans. Therefore putting the Latin countries into one school would go over a lot smoother than trying the same with Serbia, Bosnia, the Ottoman Empire, Transylvania, Poland, the Habsburg realms, Greece and so on.

But again, unless there's a reason to argue that the magical societies would be integrated, it doesn't make any sense to me that the Spanish, Portuguese, or Italian magical societies would just happily send their students to Beauxbatons instead of making their own school. The histories of France, Iberia, and Italy are also certainly varied, and quite different by the time of the SoS - it's remarkably lazy, to me, to just group them together, and I'm sure that people from Spain and Italy and the like would be more than happy to tell you why they wouldn't have gone to France for school. (And again, around the time of Hogwarts being founded and for the next few centuries, England would have likely been more associated with France than Spain or Italy would have been.)

Like, at least if we were pretending there'd be one school for the HRE or the Ottoman Empire, we could make the argument that there was a single muggle state that encompassed the whole area - you can't do that with France/Italy/Iberia.

******** Seeing as Beauxbâtons is located in the Pyrenees I personally think that the school was created during the Reconquista. Or at least the original building was built during that time. See, I think Beauxbâtons was originally a ‘châteaux fort' in the Pyrenees used by Christian wizards and eventually around the time that the north of Iberia was retaken, noble wizarding families that spoke French and the Christians from Iberia sent their children to Beauxbâtons. Over the years the tradition went on until Iberia was fully reconquered and afterwards. I also imagine there being a school in Rome as vestige from the Roman Empire, but that it would have slowly transitioned into a wizarding Catholic school with a direct link of communication with the Holy See (depending on the reigning Pope) and with the Inquisition and the Witch Hunts spreading it would have gotten less popular in the Italian magical community. This coupled with the integration of Naples into Aragorn would have made Italian witches and wizards attend Beauxbâtons until there were more Italians there than at the Roman Catholic Institute of Sorcery. The classes would have been given in either French, Latin, Castilian, Catalan, Portuguese, and (maybe Basque) and the administration would simply have had to add two or three classes (I mean groups per year) in Italian. The fact Beauxbâtons expanded regularly through history would even explain why it has a Baroque architecture instead of the contemporary one of the time of its construction. You can also bet your ass Charlemagne would have made sure his wizarding subject (and others) would have an education just like he made (with varying success) to his Muggle ones.

***** I mean, Beauxbatons is canonically formed before the 1290s (assuming they've been involved with the Triwizard Tournament since the start, 1990-700 is 1290) and after Hogwarts in 990, so it's apparently 'definitively' some time between those two dates.

If memory serves, that was about when France started to become a unified thing and helped push a lot of intellectual/cultural/literature developments, so perhaps a particularly English-hating Manor Lord built up the school as an alternative and it was simply good enough to compete. Could have gotten lucky and brought in some big names to teach that pulled in other students. Or perhaps it originally was a French-only school and simply grew to include the other nations after it established itself. If it was after 1290, I'd note that I've read a couple of textbooks that say France was one of the most populous regions in Europe by the mid-1300s, matching and possibly exceeding Italy and Spain.

Plus, if Rowling's terrible maths is actually right and there's only 3000 Wizards in England, then there wouldn't be too many more than that in Western Europe, so I suppose more than one big fancy school wouldn't be overly maintainable or useful. But if it were right, then we'd be buried under a mountain of avian porcine and hell would be boiling over, so... Perhaps Not. :)

****** Right, so it's before the Valois dynasty existed ;)

For France, I'd point to the end of the 100 years war for it really becoming a centralized thing - yes, Philippe Auguste did a lot in the 12-13th century to concentrate power around the king, but that fell off after Philippe le Bel's reign again - so we're back to the 15th century for true royal, centralized power to become predominant (Louis XI being where I'd personally point to).

But I'm very much not picky with the chronology - so Beauxbatons or any other school being founded way before or after its Pottermore date is no big deal to me, as long as it works in the fic.

As for the Ancien Regime culture/structure to it, it's certainly an option! I personally find myself less convinced by it because of how relatively open wizarding France seems to be towards non-humans (Fleur and Madame Maxime are the only two French characters of importance that I can remember in the books, and both are part non-human and in important positions) - which implies, to me, more along the lines of the ideals of the Revolution compared to the Ancien Regime.

I mean sure it's not really a big deal, but it's slightly interesting to see how we can integrate Rowling's appalling worldbuilding and internationality into real life historical events and culture, no? It might be inconsistent bullshit, but with the power of fandom we can make it work. :D

It's a very good point - that does seem more Revolutionary than Regime. Which is interesting, since it was supposedly after the Statute was implemented in the 1600-whenevers. Though, it'd be more interesting to me if the structures and institutions continued, but were influenced by the Revolutionary attitudes (perhaps during the Revolutionary period between Muggleborn immigration and the French salon-esque habit of intellectual discussion and exchange-of-ideas, or perhaps the people in the older institutions were killed by Grindelwald and the Revolutionary-minded Muggleborns just filled the gaps). So, the French could've had a Monarchy that moved away from the 'Let them eat Brioche' ignorance to a more socially responsible mindset. Centralised authority does work really well with smaller populations like the Magicals, after all.

I am curious about your broad thoughts on the previously mentioned educational-situation matter though. You've not said anything that contradicts what I can find in other sources, so I'm pretty sure you know your stuff in this regard.

******** Oh, my bad - seems I misread you there!

I see what you mean with integrating Rowling's worldbuilding - I just find myself a lot more lethargic with doing so outside Britain, just because it's so lazy (the handful of schools, the names of the Brazilian/Japanese ones, etc) - it's just so... dead/boring. At least within Britain there's a lot of little details and fun tidbits to try to piece together for something canon compliant!

I've always liked the idea of the Revolution having had some wizarding involvement - not necessarily breaking the statute, but I could see an overlap between muggleborn rights movements in the WW and the revolutionary ideals (Plus, Danton could totally be a half-giant). It's easily possible that the WW would have stayed more removed and had the ideas of that tumultuous period slowly percolate through - or, if involved to some degree, had the more vociferous purebloods emigrate.

For the educational matter, I really don't like the idea of Beauxbatons as the only magical school for that whole area of Europe - it just doesn't make any sense to me, unless the magical community in those areas were to be united into a single nation. I don't see the Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, etc not having their own school if they're independent political entities, and willingly letting themselves be more or less at the whim of the French. What I can stomach is Beauxbatons being the premier and most prestigious school in continental western Europe, where families from other nations would plan to send their kids there for a better education. Like how some families in Britain would send their kids to Durmstrang, despite Hogwarts being right there.

I imagine there'd be a lot less orthodoxy (in the general philosophical/, not religious sense) in Tradition and Etiquette than the English Pureblood society seemed to have. Probably a lot more amenable to discussing new ideas, even if they never integrated them. Do you think there'd be a Wizarding Ancien Regime that was overturned then, or more slowly pushed out?

Hmm, yeah. Okay, that makes sense. Europe is a set of very... individualistic countries. Too much history to really integrate overmuch like that, huh? Hmm. The only unifying thing I could really think of is that they're all countries that had overseas colonies at one point. Well, and the obvious of them all being ex-Roman provinces that didn't join Byzantium. That could be an interesting beginning, considering it was a thousand years-ish prior to the formation of Beauxbatons. Your way is probably easier though. Occam's Razor, eh? :)

(Feel free to tell me I'm poking too much, I'm very aware that I'm close to basically pushing you to work through an entire novel setting at this point :D).

And yep. Danton is the most half-giant person since Andre. I still remember the Monthly Review line where he was described as of colossal height, athletic make, and coarse and displeasing features. Quick aside - I've actually been tempted to use him as a model for an OC Character that'd be a big general of Grindelwald's. That kind of righteous fury, and especially the reporting of that whole conversation with Robespierre about innocents being executed, really makes him seem like the sort of person that'd fall under Grindelwald's idealistic spell, then be stuck once the more terrible actions unfolded. Very interesting man to read people write about throughout the past.

********** That's what I was thinking about the difference in protocol/tradition between the French and british magical society, yeah - less uptight than typical fan-cannon, more open, etc. For the Ancien Regime aspect, it does depend on how we picture the WW in centuries past. To have a true 'ancien regime' setup, you'd really need to have a very sizable wizarding world - if it's small, you wouldn't really have the social stratification that characterized it, and there wouldn't be the various sub-units in wizarding France to have all the variations in local laws/regulations/privileges. I think you could certainly have had a fairly robust noble culture in wizarding france in the pre-revolution, I just don't know if it would really fit with what I think of the 'Ancien Regime' as something fairly specific.

Yeah, exactly - I imagine that already in the books, the Irish are probably somewhat unhappy at apparently being rolled in under Britain. There's just so much history across Europe, and it's not been unified in the last millenia+, that it's hard to think of them being so united without any pushback and still maintaining enough distinction to have their own governments.

That'd be interesting to use Danton there - though he was always more of a leader than a follower! His contrast with Robespierre is also always fun to read about (my favorite is a line from Robespierre's sister, where she tries to put it delicately that Robespierre was much less charismatic in person). Danton is a complex one, though - his reputation ended up a lot better because of how he ended up dying (and thus not getting the hit job that Robespierre got by the Thermidorans), and how his whole ethics situation got mostly forgotten... But I'd love to see a 'de l'audace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace' speech in a fanfic!

*********** Heh. Yeah. You make a good point. A third estate of seventy people wouldn't really work as well if the other two estates only have thirty between them. Could be that the magicals took the role of the First and Second Estates while the Third Estate were the Muggles, so post-Statute they were stuck without their peasant-caste. That could be an interesting thing to explore, how a society of Magical Superiority Nobles would change when they were suddenly bereft of their servants. So, their society falls in the 1690s when the Statute is implemented (and yes, I googled that) and then muddles along for a century until the Revolution happens and the influx of new ideas rejuvenates the society and they restructure to more Revolutionary ideals.

Oh, the Irish would probably be miffed, yeah. The division of North and Republic was only in the early 20th Century though, so a few hundred years post-Statute. At least some of them would be okay with it. :D

Oh, agreed. Very much a leader. But that provides some conflict. A powerful and self-possessed (l'audace, indeed) general who believes wholly in the cause but is... less than enthused about Grindelwald would likely result in some immensely vitriolic politicking and hierarchical jockeying. It'd be a fun balance to play around with, methinks. And you're right, he did have an excellently... 'reputation-boosting' death. The 'poor fisherman' thing, right? They even made a play out of it - Danton's Death - where he was portrayed as quite the hero.

Of course, I found out recently that a British children's comedy show called Chucklevision also did a special that was... quite 'special' indeed. If you haven't seen that, you really ought to. It's closer to the Pimpernel plays than actual history, but it's a truly spectacularly odd insight to what British Children in the early 2000s were implicitly taught about Robespierre and the French 'situation' back then. You'll either find it hilarious or be utterly horrified. :D

************ Using the muggles could be one way of having a third estate, yeah - an option there would be to start it off with muggles living on pureblood estates fill that role initially (since I imagine some purebloods would also be muggle nobility), but transition over time around the SoS to incorporate muggle-borns and poor half-bloods and non-humans - with the Noble Families filling the role of the 2nd estate in wizarding society, centralizing power in the same way. So then, a century later when the French Revolution comes around, you've got that same class of poor wizards/witches, and somewhat well off ones that aren't noble, that start to get the same sort of ideas.

For Danton's reputation, I was more referring to the fact that we tend to forget about his ethics problems (it's pretty apparent that he was enriching himself along the way) because of how he died - and how it fits into the anti-Robespierre narrative the Thermidorans wanted to push to distance themselves from the terror. A lot of the portrayals of the Revolution in movies and plays will make sure to play him up as the good Republican who gets unjustly executed in the final display of Robespierre's megalomania (like the one where Depardieu plays him).

I haven't heard about that comedy special, I'll have to give it a watch. Nothing would really surprise me about British teachings of the Revolution in general and Robespierre in particular, though :P

************* I do like that. You're probably still right about the size of the Wizarding population being strongly limiting in the Ancien Regime regard, as you said previously. There's likely some balance to find in there somewhere, but I think I'll probably end up using something close to this iteration when I finally get my current HP fic idea done enough to upload. And my fifteen other WIPs finished. :D :'(

I always forget that Thermidor is a thing that isn't just Lobster. They were part of the final days of the Revolution, right? The whole replacement of the Convention with the thing that Napoleon overthrew that I forget the name of. I wanna say the Directorate, but I don't currently have the opportunity to google things (long story) and I'm not fully certain on that. I know -ate was a Middle-English, Middle-French thing so would've been around in language by the Revolution, but I'm not sure what they went with.

And ah, okay. I think it is like I said, a good death often forgives a poor life. I do hope he got as good a last line as history and theatre seem to enjoy, though. A man like that would seem to deserve it - good and evil were often entwined in historical events and figures, but he seemed to do decently enough. His portrayal does get surprisingly accurate/'real' in some plays though - that Danton's Death play I mentioned does have him be a 'purported hedonist', despite his ascribed heroism.

...I don't know. This Chucklevision one is quite... something. I really can't describe it in any other way. I think... imagine if Jeremy Clarkson and Arthur Weasley were wandering through France during the Revolution and got involved/got front row seats to various events. That's probably the right vibe for it.

************** The Thermidorans are towards the end of the revolutionary period, yeah - that's initially the group that purged Robespierre (from varied ends of the spectrum politically) and then set up the Directorate (to replace the Committees), which puttered along for a few years until the coup of Brumaire, where Napoleon (+ Seyes + Napoleon's brother saving the day) set up the Consulate. Depending on who you ask, the boundary for the end of the revolution tends to be with Thermidor, Brumaire, or even when Napoleon ends up declaring himself emperor - like everything with the Revolution, it's not super clear!

Danton did indeed have a good last line - it's supposed to be "Tu montreras ma tête au peuple, elle en vaut la peine !" - "You'll show my head to the people, it is worth the sight!" But like you say, good and evil are not very clearcut in most major historical figures - and trying to reduce their complexity to a single facet is... not usually particularly useful.

Not particularly useful and also less fun. It brings them down to our level, making them both good and evil, I think. Makes them interesting instead of just admirable/worshipped. It's part of why I find the intersections of history and psychology and socio-anthropology so entertaining. It helps us realise that Heroes are always just people, and people are always just Human. And I'll stop that tangent there too. I'm just tipsy enough to get bubbly-enthusiastic about history and start asking you a million chirpily phrased questions about French history (because this stuff is incredibly interesting and, in case I haven't said it before, I'm wholly grateful at you taking the time to educate me on almost a dozen different threads now and would love pointers to some good textbooks and such that I can read more about this with without bothering you too much more) and aside from trying not to be 'that person' on the internet, I also have other things to do. :D

Oh, I did get Directorate right? Noice. Go me. And okay, the 'Consulate'. I definitely wouldn't have remembered that. Too much confusion with the modern sense of the word a la Embassies.

I imagine the end of the Revolution came before the end of the Revolutionaries, with my current tipsy-logic. When the big changes and 'revolutionising' finished versus when the last of the people who made those changes were removed from power. The two aren't intrinsically identical, after all.

** I'm French, but infortunately I'm not familiar with the British educational system. But on the top of my head :

- Bread at every meal. The baguette thing isn't a cliché, we really are fond of bread.

- Cheese. Cheese variety vary by region, and since students are coming from every part of France, there are probably a good variety of cheeses proposed at Beauxbâtons.

- In a fancy school like Beauxbâtons, a typical breakfast at Beauxbâtons would probably be either milk/coffee/hot chocolate, fruit juice, toasts with butter and jelly and pastries (croissants, pains au chocolat and pains au raisin).

- Students from overseas regions to add a bit of diversity. Fun fact, France has territories on every continent (we even share a border with Brasil !)

- French climate is very diverse. North students are probably used to rain, cold wind and cloudy sky, than students from the South who grew up in sunny regions.

I'll try to come up with more, if you have any question I'll be happy to answer them :)

** As a French that has a million head canon about Beauxbatons and French magical society as a whole, here's some of mine:

Administration : we love filling forms, there's no way inscriptions to Beauxbatons are just answering a letter. Same with the banks, there's always a form to sign, informations to give, etc..

Complaining and arguing : if you don't know how to small talk in french, complain about the weather, about your class, about teachers, about your boss, about government, anything you can think of. More seriously we're used to questioning everything, arguing a lot, not in an agressive way, more as an intellectual exercise, and as a result we complain quite a lot.

Strict teachers : the student/teacher relationship in France is a pretty distant one. My only point of comparison is Australia, and in France most students use formal 'vous' to talk to their teacher, and teachers are usually pretty strict.

Les surveillants/pions : not sure how to translate this, but the closest would probably be supervisor. In french middle school, there are young men and women paid minimum wage (usually students with a side job) that watch the students during meals, during study hours, and in the schoolyard when they have free hours. If it's a boarding school they'll also be there at night and checking everyone is there, they're the ones students go to when they have a problem outside class. They're kind of a middle ground between a headboy/girl and a teacher.

There are also other little things like :

-the marks aren't letters but a number out of 20

-obviously food, magical pâtisseries etc

-smoking, even though you can't legally buy cigarettes before 18, a lot of high schoolers and even middle schoolers smoke outside schools, and no one would make a fuss if they saw teens smoking in public.

Well, all that aside from university degrees which are rated on a first, upper and lower second, third, and fail mark.

I vaguely remember my primary school (This was over a decade ago) using numbers then letters where 1 was the highest and 7-ish was the lowest and each number grade had a letter attached like 1a was basically an A+, 1b an A, then 1c an A-.

Do you know why your system uses a number out of twenty? It seems an odd thing to pick, given ten or a hundred would make percentages easier to do.

Some notes can be out of 10, or any other number, usually if it's just a small test with only a few questions, but they're always converted back to out of 20 marks, so that we can calculate average for each subjects and an overall average. Not sure how this works in the UK, but we use average notes a lot, there are your own average, and you can compare it to class or school average notes in every subjects, or overall.

Also the marks aren't always whole number, you can have a 16,25 or 12,75 out of 20,and when you average all of them you can end up with something like 14,96 out of 20. So in the end is a really precise system.

******* Oh, that's interesting - grades not being whole numbers, I mean. That seems really precise and efficient, if a little more difficult to calculate. Britain's relationship with mathematics is quite... contentious.

Our version closest to an averages system is a weighted thing with a name I forget. I really wanna call it SARS or MEMS for some reason, but I think that's something from a video game. Essentially, each test is a certain section of your final grade, so you get a grade for that 20% or 40% of your grade, and then the test grades all add together to make the final 'average'. Meaning important tests or assignments will have a bigger influence on your grade than others. Otherwise, there's no real averages system.

From what I remember of our grade comparisons, it was more often done to 'excellence' than averages. So, you'd see pictures of higher scoring students on the walls with captions of "Name did really well on her tests, she got 8A*s and 2As" and things along similar veins. I don't remember any comparison to personal or class or school averages at any stage of my education.

Does French Education often focus on averages and the like? Is there a similar 'this student did really well, be like this student' vibe to either grade feedback or motivational literature/wall posters?

And we use personal and class average a lot, it's the main thing universities and other postgbac schools refer to to select students, and having a 14 average in a 10 average class is better than a 14 in a 14 average class. Also to validate your bac (A-level equivalent) you need a 10 average overall, I'm not sure how A-levels are validated?

We do compare with average, between students and also sometimes between classes, but it's never an official thing done by the school, more by the students themselves. Some schools will rank students from best average to worst, but nowadays its pretty frowned upon.
