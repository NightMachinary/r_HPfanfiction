I love Auror Harry, most generally for the mystery/adventure type of stories, but I've read a lot, and I can see him being something else, either from the title, or self employee, as something else, entirely.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new, would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes and the like, but doesn't have to focus on a pairing.

Maybe, he's an Auror, in the beginning, but decides to quit or retire, to become something else. That's fine, as well.

No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche. No Ron hating, please, love Ron, and hate when authors hate on him.

I'm fine with male pregnancy, as long as it's not detailed.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up. This Fic is now complete!

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.

**** Harry is a fashion obsessed pretty boy who is in danger of falling in love with everyone he sleeps with after just one night. He has severe trauma, which is not a bad thing in and of itself, but it seems that the story's resolution to that trauma isn't actually moving past it or confronting it, but a subset of love magic that manifests itself as Harry glowing like a lightbulb. It's not a bad story, and it's not poorly written, but for 750k words remarkably little has happened. If I was going to sum up the story in one tag it would be Metrosexual/Hippie!Harry.

Professor Harry

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24202201/chapters/58299106][Mirror]] (gen) has a pretty interesting Harry imho. He has had a /really/ good connection to his magic since he was very young and has been Dumbledore's ally since his first year at Hogwarts. He also lived the same day twice - his usual life in the first, then studying and running errands for Albus (spying, looking for ingredients etc) in the second. It's set after the end of the war. Harry is about to become the DADA professor and I'm looking forward to it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26590465][You Were Myth-Taken]] (snarry) - set 10+ years after canon. The puns. How everyone is so certain that Snape is a vampire. It's so funny.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15542445][A Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow]] (snarry) - 8 years after canon. First of all, the friendship between Harry and Draco is so hilarious. I absolutely love it. And it's a pretty sweet and heartwarming fic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8125531][Hogwarts, to welcome you home]] (harry/ginny) is the most popular professor Harry fic, I believe.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7769080][Don't Fuck With Florists (They'll Fuck You Up)]] (tomarry) - a funny fic featuring Master of Death Harry owning a flower shop right across Borgin and Burkes where Tom works.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2538955][Time to Spare]] (gen) - Harry and Draco are sent back in time (20 years) and there's no way back, they have to live it. They enter 7th year at Hogwarts. After they finish it, Harry becomes a spellsmyth (he got an apprenticeship during their 7th year). They participate in the war. They live their lives during peacetime. Then they again participate in the war. It's a good fic. Very interesting. The friendship between Harry, Draco and Severus is amazing and I love it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675435][October]] (eh... unrequited tomarry (tom has feelings) but it will be the endgame somewhen in the future?) - it's a timetravel fic. a great fic. really great. By the author of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1105731][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]]. Harry is immortal and very, very old. And it feels so in this fic. He's very strange from Tom's point of view. Full of strange words and riddles. Harry boards the train with Tom and is sorted into Hufflepuff. Harry won't finish his education at Hogwarts though because he will single-handedly finish the Second World War, break the Statute of Secrecy and claim that he's an alien from Mars. He really will go to Mars and found an empire there, reluctantly becoming its emperor. It doesn't end at this point at all. The worldbuilding, the prose, the plot, the characters. They are great. So it features an emperor Harry. The story is told from Tom's point of view, though. And it's really, /really/ very interesting.

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...
