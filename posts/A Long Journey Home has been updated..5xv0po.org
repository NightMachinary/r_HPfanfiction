** What this fic has that most don't even approach is a heartfelt charm and personal relevance. I opened this new chapter and within a few paragraphs I was back into the current story arc, running alongside an apprentice living in the Indus Valley, hearing the carts rumble and the merchants haggle and feeling the cooler air from a winter breeze as he makes his way to his lesson- a lesson with Jasmine.

She's already lived hundreds of years and has been struggling with an insurmountable problem: she can't remember everything. Using magic day-in-and-out, it never leaves her, but the experiences of a hundred years or more in the past elude her as they just don't stay relevant. Thus she'd traveled from her near-mythic existence in Egypt to work with an accomplished wizard in the Indus valley- the apprentice's father.

The story itself is fractured like that, but in a way that's enjoyable. We start in present day but then the present is suddenly feeling less immediate and more like a reunion of old friends. Gifts from the journey prompt thoughts about her past and then we're seeing a life 1500 years earlier, when Jasmine was trying to stay out of the way of history and in this case, failing.

Each arc is like that- personal stories framed by greater events and humanized by the view of our powerful but not in the least bit omniscient main character.

Can you tell I'm a fan?

*** The part that I love the most is the little things that stay consistent through all of her years. Her dry, cheeky sense of humor is prevalent in every single version of her that lets you know that this is the same person. Along with a few other peculiar traits (that I'll let the reader find out because they're actually slightly adorable), she stays remarkably consistent - while at the same time growing. The Jasmine in the Indus valley has obviously not learned the same lessons that time brings her as the one that found her in Arthurian times.

What this mean is those base personality traits let you know that she's /always/ Jasmine underneath everything. This isn't a simulacrum that the author has shoved in just to write their own versions of Arthur, or stories wizards in the Indus Valley. This is a character developed in this story that in good faith is displayed in each of those time periods.

Then around that is the fall out from living these thousands, upon thousands of years. She has obviously struggled with the weight of history that has been forced upon her and is /still/ trying to find where she fits in. She's all powerful, and yet she's still Jasmine underneath it all.

It's a lovely story.

**** In a lot of ways I love it so much more than the original series. It is in some ways so far AU that some might say it should just not be in the HP universe to begin with, but it does live in that world and expand on what we already know, so it still works.

This particular arc seems like it is working towards multiple things, which I do love. The recovery of her memories and the ongoing preservation into the future is very important, but I also get the feeling from this chapter that the arc is not going to have a happy ending, and may contribute substantially to the person that Jasmine was before meeting Myrddin.

It is a remarkable thing that this story is very much not a happy one, but is still a joy to read.

***** Well the Myrddin arc wasn't a happy ending at all, but massively bittersweet. To the point where his death is still something that Jasmine holds HUNDREDS of years later. Her life is defined by the tragedies she lives though and experiences, which is what makes the story so much more beautiful to read.

In fact, the only reason why the series has the hope that it does throughout is only because we know the end game. If we didn't know that before going in I doubt we would be able to handle the tragedy that is Jasmine's life. We know that she at least gets a "happy ending" in which she can bring closure to one part of her story.

This arc I actually didn't like at first, but the more it goes on the more I love it. Like you, I see it ending in complete tragedy so it feeds into the Myrddin arc. I do have to wonder, if there's a story that goes inbetween the two.

****** That seems likely, especially working with Durhmada in secret. Obvious foreshadowing is: Ayati gives birth, dies, Rahji attempts to raise her as Inferius, even an 'improved' one, cue everyone freaking out.

Seems to obvious to state that they /aren't/ going to solve the whole dying issue, though I have wondered if this is the origination of horcruxes. I seem to recall those being invented by Herpo the Foul, but names do change.

******* Horcruxes were started with Herpo the foul.

Honestly, I would love the author to do a whole arc on Souls. We know Jasmine creates the Soul Pocket magic at some point before Merlin and it would flow really well with her researching souls with Herpo.

******* Yeah, I don't know /exactly/ how it is going to play out, but it is fairly evident that this is an Anakin Skywalker situation. I don't know that he will turn evil as such, but he is certainly going to go too far, probably fail, and the outcome is going to have a definite impact on Jasmine.

***** The gender change is completely necessary in this story, it just isn't apparently why until you get a few chapters in. The other canon characters actually DO feature heavily in the story, and are a very important part of it - in the present at least. They are a solid frame of reference for the world building done by the author, and an easy point of comparison between what "was" and what "is."

I don't think I go more than a few days without telling everybody my love of this story. It is well worth the investment to start reading.
