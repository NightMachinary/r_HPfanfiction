I'm looking for a specific Harry/Harem fic I read a while ago, but I can't rememeber the title. It starts off as a Harry/Gabrielle, then one by one, more girls, mostly folklore creatures are added, a creature with a fox tail (think it was a huldra) and a lake spirit or something like that among them. He gets a castle, invites Gabby's parents, shares his man-cave with her father...

Oh yeah, it has lots of sex, rough sex as well as normal.

Anyone around that knows this one and could point me in the right direction?


** Nevermind, found it after looking for HP fics in connection with huldra, which MY IDIOT SELF SHOULD'VE DONE FROm THE START!!

It's called "Harry Potter and the Midnight Sun". It can be found on ficwad, f anyone's interested.
