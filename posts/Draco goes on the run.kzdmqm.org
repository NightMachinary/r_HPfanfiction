I just binged through Speechwriter's “The Disappearances of Draco Malfoy” and it's a WIP and it's killing me!

Until their next post I'd love to read more of Draco being on the run with or without the trio. If he's in on the horcrux hunting that's even better.

I prefer Draco/Hermione or Harry/Hermione but I'll accept others. Just looking for the main trope right now!


** The Secret Language of Plants. It's a bit later on (Can't recall when precisely), but there's a fun arc of on-the-run Draco.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhkäse.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
