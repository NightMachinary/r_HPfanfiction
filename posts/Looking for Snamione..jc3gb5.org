I am looking for long Snamione (50k and up but I'd rather 100k<) preferably a bit slow burn and no ooc pls. I would also like it to be completed or close to it.. HOGWARTS ERA if you ignore everything else, this is really the only MUST HAVE. Thanks so much!

** wtf is "Snamione" argh I hate all these silly ship names.

you want no OOC, insist taking place during Hogwarts years, so ... you think canon Snape was a a pedophile?

*** I know I'm a bit late with my reply, but I would just like to say Snape/hermione used to be a really popular ship and I thought it was gross at first too, but you'd be surprised how well they go together without much ooc. The stuff I like takes place usually in the 7th year, so hermione is of age.

** ok if you haven't already read it, Chasing the Sun by Loren is an INCREDIBLE read. it deviates from canon around OOTP and it's almost 500,000 words. nothing happens until it's legal, and it's all consensual. this story is the mother of all slow burns but the arc is SO. SATISFYING. i reccomend it to anyone reading SS/HG. the only bad thing about this fic is that it ends :( it really was such a gripping and incredible read, i forgot about actual canon. the author rewrites the last few books basically and i LOVE their interpretation of it and how they change the plot. 10000/10 reccomend
