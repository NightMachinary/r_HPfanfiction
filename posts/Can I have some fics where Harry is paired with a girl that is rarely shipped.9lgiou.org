I probably could have worded the title better but it's really late and my brain is fuzzy.

So yeah, say a fic somehow has Harry and Demelza as the main romance focus. Someone who is mentioned in the books, but is never really talked about in fanfiction. Honestly, I don't even remember Daphne Greengrass being mentioned in the books, only her sister. It's only because of fanfics that I know of her existence. I'm looking for girls like Daphne, but who have never really 'broke out' so to speak.

It's odd but I'm kinda tired of seeing the same pairings even though there's such a wide range of ships. It's like even though there's so many pairings, there's no real variety in how they're portrayed. Or at least that's how I feel about it anyways.


** For Lisa Turpin there is /Call Me/, which in turn inspired me to make her the love interest in /No Longer Alone/. The first one is a romance where people are reasonable (too much so in two scenes), the one I wrote is a 4th year AU with a romantic subplot (so the main focus is on other things).

linkffn(10751741; 12745758)

/Whatever happened to Bromance/ is Harry/Romilda, even if what's going on is more lust-driven than romantic. Also has a likeable McLaggen (I know). linkffn(5445767)

If you count Narcissa Malfoy, there's linkffn(10503844).

There are also a few Hermione/"background woman" rare-pairs I could recommend if you are into that.

Although to be honest, I have never even heard about the English rules of capitalization for titles. Not in school, nor anywhere on the internet. In German, you simply use the regular ones (we capitalise every noun, there are no "proper nouns" in German).

**** First of all, I remembered the only good Harry/Cho fic around, even if it is basically ancient by now. It's still very enjoyable. linkffn(4259161)

Given that the most common f/f Hermione pairings are Ginny, Fleur, and Pansy, I excluded those.

There is /Dignity in fear/, which is a 5th-year rehash with a Hermione/Tonks pairing. The recent chapters have moved into the summer before 6th year, but I don't like the direction of those since they feel like an author insert about homosexual solidarity. You can, however, pretend that it is a complete 5th-year story if you just read chapters 1-23. I really love this story because the author has a very unique, outstanding way to depict emotions. It also gave me the idea for /Under Guard/, which is a one-shot with the same pairing and a similar premise, but a focus on humour.

linkffn(10798339; 13053403)

There are several Fem!Harry/Hermione stories, which do not read like the usual Harmony fare. The first one is Hermione centric with a dark-ish MC. The second one is just fun entertainment which goes into crack territory (Fem!Harry goes drinking with Bellatrix). linkffn(11602420; 11629750)

For Hermione/Luna, there are a couple choices as well. linkffn(9940328; 3973687) Looking through Ao3, there are a few decent ones around there. In no particular order linkao3(1243798; 1678169)

And the sequel to /Call Me/ is Mandy Brocklehurst/Pansy Parkinson, which is decently written after the first chapter but sadly hasn't updated for quite some time (I offered to beta it but haven't heard from the author in months). linkffn(12884777)

  Once upon a time, three brothers came up with a plan to change the world forever. Centuries later, wizards still fight over the scraps of their power. However, only one person can truly lay claim to their destiny. AU. Harry/Lisa Turpin pairing in later chapters.

Fics with typos in the summary are a complete no-go for me.

**** The story is decently written and free of bashing. It has teenagers being teenagers (sex, drinking, parties, trying out drugs). The characters act in a believable way, even if Lisa's father is a little too reasonable in two scenes. There is just a small amount of angst involved. It's a good, character driven feel-good story, not a grand epic.

I would consider it top-tier because it is a nice change of pace to the usual "summer after Sirius died" stories. If it's the first fanfic you were to read with that setting, it wouldn't hold up well. But after 2846826 IndyHarry stories, bashing orgies and canon rehashes, it's highly enjoyable.

** Linkffn(Wolf Lord)

Ongoing story. Harry is about to be in a short-term to medium term relationship with Hestia Carrow. Long term will eventually be paired with Katie Bell, how knows how many others in between.
