YMMV on this one. Its quality is really just a notch above "average." But Moody's a prominent figure in it, and plays a huge role in raising Harry to be a warrior ready to fight Voldemort.

  A chance remark on the night of Halloween 1981 could have changed everything. Fate throws baby Harry into the custody of Kingsley Shacklebolt, assisted by a certain Mad-Eye Moody. And oh boy, heads will roll and history will change when this gets out. Dear Wizarding Britain: Your saviour has arrived. ON HIATUS.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

**** I say that so it is clear that I am talking about a story I wrote and not someone else's. It implies a certain bias.
