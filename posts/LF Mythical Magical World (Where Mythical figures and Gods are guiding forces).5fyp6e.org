Something along the lines of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11860415][Gorgoneion]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11188292][Deal-with-a-Devil]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11024296][Godling-Ascending]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093][Circular-Reasoning]] where there are forces of nature and beings so powerful that have become legends, while faded in memory through time they are still active. Whether they are (Un)Seelie, Demons, Angels, Vampires, Gods or Eldrich Horrors, as long as Harry gets involved with forces that are beyond even the magical world.
