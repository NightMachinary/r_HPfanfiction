** Following! Looks interesting. Quick question though -- I've read the Hobbit and the Fellowship and seen all the movies, but I don't really remember much. Will I be lost reading this?

*** You won't be lost, but knowledge of the source material will enhance the reading as it will give greater context to events and also enable you to see where things could head.

** An outstanding start. Out of curiosity, do you have it planned out or are you winging it as you go?

** I just hope the wand problem won't be stretched out too long. That sort of thing always irks me in crossovers. Aside from that, it looks great and there's a lot of potential for epicness (provided it doesn't get abandoned of course).

** Going to follow, of course. Just wish The One He Feared would get an update, you teased me with those first four chapters, and then left me hanging and uncomfortable.

** Very cool story my friend. First thing to capture my fancy in a long time. I really hope that you choose to continue it.

** Frankly, I think it's a little too realistic/mundane. At least the first chapter is, because absolutely nothing interesting happens. Harry walking around looking at things, while being hungry, cold, and thinking to himself is a bad way to start a story. It's realistic, but so is going to the bathroom and washing your clothes, except no one cares to read all that detail for it to be forgotten the next moment.

The writing is good but tends to feel monotone and dry after a while. There weren't any obvious mistakes which is good, yet there aren't any highlights that stand out either.

Overall, it's still good, but that's mostly due to the open possibilities and interesting idea you ended on in the second chapter. I would recommend cutting out the unneeded details and combining the two chapters so readers might be lured in on the first.
