Something were you legit enjoy and read just for it's uniqueness. If it has good fight scenes, pairings, or powerful main character and powerful enemies, even better! Thanks!


** Uniqueness and good pairing (for me at least, I love Kally and Harry from EoS). linkffn(Hell Eyes; Eclipse of the Sky; The Song of the Trees) All three of these have different races that are OG content by the author.

A new-ish WIP that I find to be quite good is linkffn(Novocaine) but its post-war with politics and BIll Nye's Motto "We can change the world". Or linkffn(The Mind Arts) with a different and unique Harry (you could argue OP and sociapath, but I like him) a likeable Albus and conflicting feelings about Grindewald.

If you're up to timetravel, there's linkffn(Found in Ashes) which is actually a spin-off from another post-war (completed) called linkffn(What we Lost) with a fairly believable Harry/Andromeda fic, even if you disregard the amount of typos and grammar errors from the author (He has dyslexia and appparently no betas). I find both of these fics to be quite lovely and have a uniqueness to them because of the pairing that I can go through any sort of typo because of it(I actually read every single fic from this author, so far, so maybe I'm biased).

  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards
