** Hmm, this is not quite it, but similar! It's one where harry couldn't save ron with the bezoar, and he and hermione go on to be... really dark. They take everything into their own hands, no matter how brutal it turns out to be. It's also really emotional, but i loved it anyway

*** For sure checking it out! I also happen to be a fan of angst and emotional fics. Thanks a lot for the recommendation, it seems really interesting.
