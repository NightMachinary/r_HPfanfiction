Any fics that bash Cursed Child's plot or have the characters try to prevent the plot from happening?


** (Why bother? CC stands on its own...er.../merits/.)

There's a brief scene in The Peace Not Promised where both Snape and Dumbledore scoff at the idea of Tom having a child, but it doesn't feature beyond that.

Delphini turns up as a baby around the end of linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions), with things set to go rather differently (eg Professor Snape survived the Battle of Hogwarts and is going to raise her).

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
