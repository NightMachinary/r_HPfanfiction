For me I enjoyed the “Harry can't get better grades than Dudley or he get punished” trope. It made sense the first time I read it, but then I realized it's just a way for writers to make their Harry smarter without any real effort. “Actually Harry's always been just as smart as Hermione, he just had to hide it,” it's pretty much just lazy character development.

I'll also admit to throughly enjoying the first few manipulative/evil Dumbledore fics I read. Dumbledore is stealing money from Harry? Cool! Dumbledore is paying the Weasley's to befriend Harry? Dope! Dumbledore actually wants Harry to die so he can swoop in a save the wizarding world again? Amazing! Now I actively avoid those.

**** To be fair, goblins have been oppressed by wizards for centuries, and the histories of the goblin rebellions are written by wizards.

As for the sword, Goblins have a different idea of ownership and maybe Gryffindor should have found out a bit about Goblin culture before having a goblin make a sword.

Things like these lead to misunderstandings when different cultures interact. It is unfair to blame it all on the Goblins, since from their perspective what they call "selling" is something completely different than what we mean, and they absolutely see it as stealing if you "buy" something from them and it is not given back when you die.

No, "buy" has a specific meaning in english language and law. One would assume the same goes for the wizarding world, since this is literally the stark foundation of contract law.

If the goblins do business under english law, they have to stand by the english meaning. If the goblins do business under goblin law, they can do whatever the fuck they want, but forgive me if I laugh at the idea of wizards doing business in gobbledegook when in the books the only wizards speaking the languages were diplomats.

************ "buy" in English literally means giving money and getting something in return. Nothing more. For Goblins, that means giving you something they created with the expectation that it is returned once you die. For most (all?) human cultures it means giving something without any expectation of ever getting it back.

Perhaps it isn't so much the meaning of the word "buy" but the concept of ownership or inheritance. In any case, if you buy something from a Goblin, knowing that it is expected to be returned on your death, your heirs should honour that.

This is transparently supposed to be a Native American/colonist metaphor, where neither side was aware of what the other was trying to buy (or, possibly, the buyer was actively misleading the seller).

Of course, the fact that the Native analogues in this case are a race of greedy, manipulative, subhuman creatures whose sole defining trait as a people are a number of brutal, bloody rebellions, and who control a major, predative financial sector kind of makes the comparison an insult more than an allegory.

*** Indy!Harry used to be my go-to. But it just became incredibly predictable. Harry gets emancipated, gets unrestricted access to the Family Vaults (from all 13 of his new shiney Lordships) (that equal somewhere around 14 trillion galleons, give or take), goes on a couple Diagon Alley/Muggle London shopping sprees which are described in excruciating detail of every. single. thing. he. bought.

Cut to the train (or maybe the school supply shopping trip), where Harry informs his friends on his new "Fuck Dumbles. Fuck The Order" way of life. They're both shocked by this. Hermione, who at this point is generally portrayed as a rule-lover, 'adults are always right', quickly falls of /that/ horse with some well placed evidence from Harry, while Ron accuses him of being an attention seeking git going dark, or something because he's a jealous prat that can't work past the fact his family's poor or he won't get anywhere near his brothers in accomplishments on his own. Thus /he/ joins the rest of his family in the "Weasly!Bashing" tag. Well. Most of them. The twins are still cool though.

I really like angsty fics, and i had found a few harry fics that werent all ‘woe to me', but they soon ran out and all that was left was fics that seemed to glorify depression and cutting, and they never delved into the cause of the depression, they made no move to try have harry deal with it. Like they have harry depressed and hiding it from everyone, until hogwarts has a talent show and harry sings some 90s/00s emo rock song perfectly and then all the characters treat harry as if he is made of glass.

I remember a megamatt09 fic (very terrible, full of smut, but it was back before I joined the community to get warnings about that stuff). She was killed due to being overconfident and confronting Mrs. Weasley, who killed Bellatrix Lestrange. It really wasn't that great, but it brought up the point that her character had ridiculously high confidence.

But it would be nice to see some variation once in a while.

It would be fun to see fics that are critical of Hogwarts and/or Magical Britain roll with the idea of all the elective courses being mostly useless instead of always going with the cliche of Harry just not picking the right ones, even though that's fun too. It's just been done to death by now.

I like the idea that Albus never really got over the "Greater Good" mentality of Grindlewald, but his ideas of what the Greater Good is changed.

For example: I'm working on a fic now with a Manipulative!Dumbledore, but he's still a good guy. He loves Harry, he's broken up inside because he couldn't save Grindlewald /or/ Tom Riddle, he does his best to keep his students, faculty, and friends safe, but ultimately...if sacrificing one person, or a few people, would help save the lives of many others, he would.

He also seems to have difficulties relating to people as equals, even though I think he does truly believe in equality after his youthful wake up call.

Gratuitously Evil Dumbledore can be fun in an over the top way, but the nuanced closer to canon version where he's Good But Flawed is more interesting to me.

***** I really can't see Dumbledore seeing McGonnagal as an equal. He's her direct superior in literally every organization they're a part of and she low-key worships him. Is there actually a case in canon where she doesn't fall into lockstep with him?

** Anything is lazy character development if you're lazy about it. 90% of everything is trash, but that 10% is worth sifting for. I love this trope because it makes sense and is a good way to get the Smart!Harry the author wants without needing to write an AU.

Overuse is no reason to cringe. I think you mean tropes you've grown out of or got bored with.

** I wholeheartedly enjoyed the ones where Harry, after having a shitty childhood with the Dursley's, gets adopted by someone that actually loves and cares about the poor boy. Although I'm kind of shocked that I've not seen any where the Weasley family adopts him. I feel like that would make the most sense. It's clear that Molly loves him as much as she would her own child.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** Minipulative chessmaster Hermione. I thought it was a nice change of pace initially but ive seen too much of it and Hermione was never that emotionally intelligent. She accidentally said the wrong thing and came off as insulting cold or hurtful when she didnt want to. Both Ron and Harry would be more suited than her since they do this less and I believe are both more capable of being minipulative in that way than she is.

But seeing too much of emotionally intelligent Hermione lately so maybe i just want a change of pace.

** I wanna see a fic where Harry goes and checks his heritage or whatever and woops look at that, since you're related to Slytherin by (bluh bluh bluh) and it's a more acknowledged household you can't be Harry Potter anymore, but now you're Harry Slytherin and wow would you look at that somehow the Daily Prophet knows now too! Woops. Dealing with the aftermath of that would be /fascinating/, but er, no. Harry Potter-Black-Peverel-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff (because, seriously, lets just add all the other houses without a good enough explanation for it) gets to claim numerous titles without a single person becoming aware and without a single ramification for it.

I would kinda love a fic where Harry goes and gets the above done, and /does/ end up with like, half of the Hogwarts houses as lines he's descended from, but the Goblin tartly points out that it's not unusual he's related to Gryffindor since the man would put his dick in anything with two legs (or even sometimes four) when given the chance, and no, you /really/ can't get anything out of it since you're 14 or 15 levels removed from the main line and the closest people to that bloodline are the /Longbottoms/ and they're still so far removed from it that they can't even claim it as their own.

Alternatively, I wanna see a good take on an abused Harry who doesn't just immediately become healthy after he gets a sweater from Molly and two friends. Brutal Harry and The Art of Self Shaping do this well, but for gods sake from one formerly abused kid to another /you don't just bounce back like that/. Abuse lingers, and I wanna see a Harry who deals with even /above/ canon-level abuse having to take books until he's comfortable with being overly friendly with another person or anything shy of goddamn paranoid half the time.
