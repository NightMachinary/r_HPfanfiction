Hey everyone, I'm looking for some dark Hermione fics, preferably femslash, or no romance plot at all. Anything goes, except for "Hermione is actually a reincarnation of a super powerful evil witch" trope, which has already ruined two otherwise perfectly good fics for me.

Edit: Also preferably no time travel.


** Although she had a justifiable cause, her actions (systematic liquidation of the ruling class in magical Britain) in "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution", linkffn(10595005), were very dark. She and Harry were one step away from falling into complete darkness near the end.

I like how her descent was written in "Broken Chains", linkffn(7718942). Not as bloodthirsty and prone to violence as Harry, she nevertheless went enthusiastically along with his megalomaniac plan of world domination. In the last few chapters of its sequel "The Stars Alone", linkffn(12040341), she again displayed significant amount of cruelty and ruthlessness, even if reasonably justified.

She acted for a long time as the voice of restraint in "The Sum of Their Parts", linkffn(11858167), but finally gave in near the end. She was also instrumental in teaching themselves various dark magic.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** I wrote a "fall from grace" Hermione once; if you like, I can link to it.

There's also linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer); the story is abandoned.

There's one where she's a necromancer in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lost Demon by Angry Hermione).

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.
