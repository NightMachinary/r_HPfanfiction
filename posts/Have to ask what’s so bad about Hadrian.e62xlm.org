#+end_quote

We don't know all that many Potter names, from my understanding. But Harry's ancestry /does/ certainly include some Latin names - for instance, according to the wiki, the 2nd Potter (Hardwin) married a Peverell, Iolanthe (greek) with a father who had a latin name (Ignotus). Later on we get an Abraham (from Hebrew origin). James' mother is called Euphemia (greek origin). That's enough of a grab bag approach to names that (particularly with the very varied set of names in the wizarding community), having a Latin name like that isn't the /worse/ that could be chosen.

Past that, most of those names aren't actually ever mentioned in the books, and are certainly not /prominent/ in the fandom. So, if writing a fic that includes a likely more aristocratic bent to the WW (in canon, it's hard to know /exactly/ how the government is set up with regards to family lines and nobility), having the Potters be more aristocratic in their naming scheme is not really something I'd see problematic. It's not going to fit well without a context like that - but then there wouldn't be a point to having another name for Harry, so kinda beside the point.

It seems... unbelievable that his parents gave him a secret name that is only ever used to sign documents. And no one in his whole life tells him until he goes to Gringotts and the goblins start bending over backward for him because he remembered Griphook's name. Thanks, but no thanks.

And anyway if Harry absolutely must have a secret name it simply needs to be Hardwin. Because there are no easy wins in life. (I'm not even remotely sorry.)

** Hadrian can work in humor/parodies. It turns out Lily was a giant nerd for the Roman Empire and she wanted what was best for her "little emperor", so Harry was getting an Imperial Roman Name like Hadrian Nerva Traianus Augustus Potter or whatever she could come up with. James was able to negotiate her down and settle for Hadrian James Potter. He intended to change it on all legal documents later to Harry when Lily was distracted but he did not get chance, and later they died.

So for most people Harry is just Harry, but for legal purposes - i.e. banking, identification, Hogwarts admission and classes - he is known as Hadrian. To his chagrin ;)

** Usually it's the connotation to how it's used that people don't like, I think - just like most other tropes people look down upon, they're not /actually/ bad in theory. Hadrian carries great connotations if used well - in my view, it'd warrant a tweak to the WW to make it a bit more conservative and noble dominated, probably with an influential part played by the Romans, but past that it shows that Harry fit into that more ancient/aristocratic world.

However, one of the failings (in my view) is when people actually start using Hadrian all the time. Harry is Harry - his birth name being Hadrian should not change the way he refers to himself, and works best if reserved for more formal occasions. We don't see Ron called Ronald all the time, or Ginny Ginevra - changing the way Harry is called is pretty jarring.

Beyond that this sub does have some fairly judgmental views on things, usually due to being in a bunch of garbage fics. If someone's read a bunch of bad fiction using, say, a super powerful/smart Hermione, that'll make the concept stick out to them as bad (or, at least, a sign of a bad fic). Same with magical cores (often used as an excuse to make Harry superpowerful), inheritance testing (ditto), manipulative!dumbledore, etc.

** I don't mind it either-- it's a nice name, and I could actually see the HP universe being one where some kind of secret, or extended, name is a thing, particularly because it's a universe where names do have some sort of power. Just think about the taboo curse on the name Voldemort. Sure, that isn't his real name, but it's used to refer to him much more than Tom Riddle ever was. What if similar things could be done with Harry's name? It then might make sense to his parents to name him one thing, like Hadrian, but only tell people that his name is Harry.

Sure, there's no specific reason to think that is the case. But an argument can be made for it that doesn't clash with canon, provided that's something you care about.

I can see where some of the other commenters are coming from, in that they associate it with certain tropes. Still, it's never bothered me. But that may partly be because the tropes themselves aren't always bad to me either.

** Honestly, I really like Hadrian as Harry's proper name (is that what it's called?) /nudge-nudge wink-wink community flair/. It gives off a really cool aristocratic flair to Harry's character and personality that screams out /don't-you-dare-fuck with-me-cause-i'mma-blast-you-if-you-do/. A completely Smart, independent, /'cunning' if i say so myself/ Harry who knows what his position is in the Wizarding World and knows/acknowledges his paternal pureblood roots. A Harry who's not just his mother's emerald but his father's little slugger too.

Hadrian and Hardwin are my most preferable choices for naming Harry as Harrison gives me the old man creeps and Harold just feels too close for comfort with Ronald. Even Tommy boy Redesigned his name cause it felt too simple or should I say /pathetic/ for his standing as a dark /cough-dork-cough/ lord.

And let me remind you that the Potter family is quite deeply rooted in the history of the Wizarding World, dating back to the Peverell brothers as Iolanthe Peverell (granddaughter of Ignotus Peverell, the original owner of Death's Invisibility Cloak) married Hardwin, son of Linferd of Stinchcombe, "The Potterer". That shows that his family dates quite back to the the times of Peverell Brothers and should have a sway in the Upper-class Circles.

So, it does seems nice to have Harry's proper name as Hadrian, while still asking his friends to /just call me Harry/. Like c'mon Atleast Fleamont and/or Euphemia (or Charlus and Dorea for me, I like these two more) would have said something about their grandchild. And even if they were dead, their Wizarding portrait would have seen baby Harry *atleast* once and could have suggested a aristocratic name or something.

Anyway, thats my rant on why Hadrian (or Hardwin) sounds way better as a primary/proper name for Harry. Cheers Fellas !¡! /~Ares Out/

***** Ah from the roman emperor Publius Aelius Hadrianus, well I think it would be ironic for slash shippers as Hadrianus preferred a male favorite.

****** Yeah. Quite ironic for slash shippers. Like, even though I normally go for straight relations, reading a slash shipping once in a while is quite fun too. I just keep on imagining Draco teaching Harry about the pureblood society.

*** This is so cool! /If/ you're writing Hadrian 'Harry' Potter as an American boy, that is. Then it fit perfectly, the reasoning is entirely sound. His ancestors came over on the Mayflower, all that sort of thing.

However, Harry Potter isn't an American boy, he's British. His 'proper' name, if he had one, is likely to be Henry, which /is/ an aristocratic name, umpteen kings and one of our current princes have that name and that short form of it.

** I agree. This is a series where the other main characters have names like Severus, Draco, Bellatrix, Remus, Sirius, Filius, Albus, Pomona, Argus, Rowena, Salazar, Astoria, Hermione etc. Among that backdrop, Hadrian isn't that outlandish, especially when James's closest friends had similarly outlandish names and Lily (the little that we saw of her in canon) showed willingness to fully integrate into the magical world.

*** To be fair, with the exception of Hermione and Remus, most of those characters you named are either from a much older generation and/or come from a dark/pureblood family. Even Hermione's name is only so strange because Rowling chose a rare name for her so little girls with the same name as that character don't get picked on. In-universe, Remus is basically the only true exception but even he only had that name because Rowling thought naming a werewolf Remus Lupin (or the far more absurd Fenrir Greyback) was the height of intelligent symbolism. Peter was one of James' closest friends and had a very normal sounding name.

Just look at the rest of the kids in Harry's year. Aside from Hermione, the only kids in Harry's year with outlandish names was Draco (dark, pure-blood supremacist family). That's it. The rest had pretty normal names (e.g. Dean, Seamus, Hannah, Justin, Terry, Theodore, etc). Some had some relatively old-fashioned names (i.e. Neville, Millicent, etc) but they weren't outlandish at all.

Even in the years above Harry, you had names like Fred, George, Percy, Oliver, Lee. The most unusual names from the older students were stuff like Penelope or Marcus, the former merely being a bit old-fashioned and the latter is very similar to the name Mark (which is a normal name). But again, Marcus Flint was a Slytherin from a dark pure-blood family.

People generally look down on the epilogue (be it because they think Albus Severus is a stupid name, because they shipped Harry/Hermione, the subjective quality of DH as a whole, or whatever other reason you can think of), but even in the epilogue the next gen kids names were almost all normal sounding unless they were named after a dead character. Even then, they weren't outlandish.

James, Lily, Rose, Hugo, Fred, Roxanne, Molly, Lucy, Victoire, Dominique, and Louis all seem like normal names. The names of Fleur's kids don't seem that outlandish, though I'm not well-versed on French naming trends. Hermione integrated into the wizarding world arguably even moreso than Lily yet she opted for normal names that wouldn't be out of place in the muggle world such as Rose and Hugo, rather than some ridiculous sounding names like Hadrian. The only outlandish names were Albus (named after Dumbledore and Snape) and Scorpius (from a dark and/or pure-blood family, also fits the constellation/star theme of many Black family descendants since Draco was name after a constellation).

*TL;DR: Hadrian is a stupid cliche because its a big neon light indicating an Indy!Harry who has like 50 Septillion galleons in his Gringotts account and is lord and heir to every notable wizarding family. In canon, everyone in Harry's year barring Hermione and Draco had normal names, and even most of the older students had normal names unless they were in dark pure-blood families. In the epilogue, the only weird names by our modern standards would be Albus and Scorpius, since the rest were normal.*

** It's indicative of a larger problem, for me anyways, because often you see "Hadrian" along with a host of other dollar store cliches. I personally see a lazy attempt to make Harry, a moderately talented but otherwise normal kid, into the most powerful and important wizard there ever was, or some variation therein.
