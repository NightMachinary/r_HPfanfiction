I'm reading this simply amazing fanfiction and I've come upon a dilemma. Chapter 19 is about the end of their first year, while Chapter 20 talks about the summer before their fourth year. What about the 2. and 3. years? What about the Basilisk and the whole ordeal with Sirius?


** Most of it goes like in canon and is summarized in linkffn(To be a student by Morgana deryn). Focus is on the relationship between OC and Draco for years 5 and 6. Year 4 focuses on the tournament and her preparations for it.

  Like every sister, I love my brother no matter what. Even when he's an idiot. Even when he's in the spotlight and I'm forever waiting in the wings. That's life as Lorena Potter. Can't complain, really. At least I don't have a psychopath out for my head. OC-centric DracoXOC
