What would Harry and his date (a girl) wear on a first date at Hogsmeade? It's in 3rd year btw, and thanks


** That would depend on how you imagine the Hogwarts dress code. If robes are mandatory at all times/outside common rooms, then that's what they will wear.

** Nobody ever mentioned anything in the books about his clothes after the first book, so I have always believed that while living for two weeks in the Diagon Alley (before his third year), he bought himself a set of normal clothes.

** Canon Harry is wearing whatever; his school robes or maybe someone will take pity and doctor up his muggle clothes.

As for the girl, I think it depends, but as a general rule she'd dress up a bit. Some makeup, straighten/curl her hair depending on its original state, and probably a skirt. It's the 90s, so probably jean or corduroy. Someone who was more aware during that time would be able to provide better details.

*** I should have given some context. It's Harry who actually has proper clothes (it's WBWL fic) and Daphne

** I think Harry would wear some suitable clothes. I don't know, maybe a shirt, black pants. Then, on advice from classmates, he would buy some flowers, take her to some store, buy her something, and then go to Madame Pudifoot (I think she was called).

How would a girl wear? I think maybe she would braid a thick braid, wear a blue dress, some elegant but not too much shoes and slightly paint her eyes and lips.

** I think they wear casual robes. Not their school robes but not as fancy as dress robes either.

Adult wizards are almost always in robes so, for me, it makes sense that any wizard teenagers raised in the magical world would wear robes in public too.
