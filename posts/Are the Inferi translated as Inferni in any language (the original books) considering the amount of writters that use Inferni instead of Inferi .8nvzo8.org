Rather than just being a typo or plain ignorance, is there a reason so many people uses that ?


** I dont know. The only weird translation error I know of is the translation of "exploding snap" to "Snape explodiert" ( Snape is exploding) in the German translation. And I think they fixed that one by now.

**** When I read the books first I thought Hogwarts students had invented an entirely new game in "honour" of their least favourite teacher. I loved that it never was explained further and thought it was a pretty clever little touch.

I was very confused, and then disappointed, when I first read one of the books in the original.

While you are right and it is pretty cool, correcting the error may make sure no other readers are dissapointed that way.

** Not to my knowledge. There /is/ an unrelated fantasy comic in France called /Inferni/, but it's quite obscure, so I doubt that's that. I think it's just a damn typo.

** Possibly, and in my case specifically, people are confusing the word with /inferno/ or /infernal/ - specifically, the definition of infernal that is:

#+begin_quote
  relating to or characteristic of hell or the underworld.
#+end_quote

If you think about that, Inferi are quite infernal in nature. It doesn't help that Dumbledore drove them off with an inferno.

It's natural that people tend to blend words together or add sounds or whatever when you've got similar or related words being used in a similar context.

Besides, if I wrote "Inferni" instead of "Inferi" when I'm talking about a hoard of Harry Potter^{^{TM}} brand zombies, you'd still understand what I'm saying.

And yes, this is me completely admitting that I'd been calling them inferni in my head for basically forever.

Of course, they're also inferal, if you know some Latin.

But I agree, it's easy for the brain to catch onto that “n” that isn't there.

**** After a quick google search to check latin verbs, do you mean that JKR used (maybe) pseudo Latin to name a type of creature "brought forth"?

Please say yes, it would do wonder for my love of the nasty buggers (and my opinion of JKR as well but that doesn't really matter).

***** Well, I did mean that that I did learn the basics of Latin and it wasn't too hard for me to make the connection with that, but after a quick check I found that Pottermore gives this:

#+begin_quote
  The name Inferius was a play on ‘Inferus', which is Latin for ‘below', but with an obvious connotation of being ‘lesser' than a living human. ‘Inferi' means the underworld.
#+end_quote

Take that quote however you want.

*** IDK if this works in english, but in my native, Inferi's singular, Inferius, the word itself implies command, and not an infernal zombie monster walker. So I thought that in some languages, they might've translated TO Inferni, even if Infernius is kinda lame, making so many people reffer to them as such. IMO, I really dislike reading a fic when the author purposely writes Inferni, simply because the singular seems foolish, even when they get reviews correcting them.

I think its the same with Patroni vs Patronuses debate. Really annoying, to my eyes, but sometimes you just gotta take it if you want to keep reading.

** Also, what is the canon for a single Inferi? I've always thought that it was Inferus but I see Inferius everywhere and it triggers me

**** Had a quick look on HP Lexicon since I don't want to move to go get my HP books right now :') and it uses Inferius as the singular: [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/creature/human-like-creatures/inferi/]]

*** AFAIK it is Inferius, it was in both my native and the english version that I read. I could be wrong, but that's what I remember.
