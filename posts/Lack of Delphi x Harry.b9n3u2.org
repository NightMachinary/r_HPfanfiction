Hey guys over the past 2 years I have really gotten back into reading FanFiction and have read close to 3000 stories in that time. One thing I have noticed is the lack of Delphi x Harry stories. Which is weird but doesn't she go back in time in the cursed child. Does anyone have any stories to share or recommend.

** Why not read Female Self-Insert/OC fics that pair the character with Harry?

They're basically the same character as Delphini, just under a different name. Parseltongue, super strong magical dueling abilities, unnatural hair color, related to a canon character, all the other canon characters think they're so amazing and gorgeous.

*ACT III, SCENE XVII*

#+begin_quote
  *RON:* He hasn't run away --- he's having a quiet moment --- he's got himself an older girlfriend ---

  *HARRY:* An older girlfriend?

  *RON:* And a cracking one at that --- gorgeous silver hair. Saw them on the roof together, near the Owlery with Scorpius playing the gooseberry. Nice to see my love potion being used well, I thought.

  */HARRY has a thought. And then he has a dozen more. And none of the thoughts are good./*

  *HARRY:* Her hair --- was it silver and blue?

  *RON:* That's it --- silver, blue --- yup.

  *HARRY:* He's talking about Delphi Diggory.

*** Adding it: Intelligent (I don't remember how much though), and she is powerful (Hermione, Ginny and Luna fight against Bellatrix and trio battling their hardest and Bellatrix is equal to them in the last book) and good duelist considering she defeated Harry and only defeated when Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Harry, Albus, Draco, and Scorpius combined their efforts.

** Lots of people didn't really like cursed child or the characters or story elements it introduced. Very unpopular, I think, especially among fanfiction writers.

*** I could probably write a book as long as the Cursed Child just by listing all the problems I have with this story. The only existence of Delphini Riddle (the child of a man so much engrossed in dark magic I'm surprised he even showed any interest in sex, even more that he was able to reproduce and can't understand how he would let a potential heir, ergo some competition, exist to challenge his immortal empire and a woman who is married to another man and is surprisingly still fertile after liver 14 years in the hell on earth that is Azkaban).

** If you're looking for fanfic about Cursed Child; look somewhere else other than here. It's pretty much universally hated on this sub.

The only thing you'll usually find here about it is people talking about how much of a steaming pile of shit they think it was.

** There is a really good fanfiction that I'm reading called "The Augery" it has been updated since October though. In it, Harry adopts Delphini as a baby. It's a Harmony fic though.

edit: Anyone knows how to link stories properly? Apparently, I'm a potato.

edit: So apparently I'm still a potato.....

edit 3: Just realized my phone autocorrected Delphini to Delphinium...
