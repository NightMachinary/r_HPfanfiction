Honestly, personally, I've never understood the argument about machine sapience. If it is simply pretending to be sapient flawlessly, it /is/ sapient. The same way we are, and do.

I mean honestly, you see it all the time with "but it's just a machine!" or "It's just ones and zeroes" or "It's just programmed to say that", and wonder "Yeah, but aren't we too?" Like, humans are nothing special, our minds don't contain some divine spark of free will, sapience is mostly an illusion. If an AI is clever enough to replicate that illusion to fool us, I don't see any reason to treat them differently than an organic human.

And yeah, I hope society realizes this when the time comes. I honestly don't want there to be AI slavery and then an AI cultural revolution, because I'd definitely be fighting on the side of the AIs and would probably be targeted by the state and those fighting to keep slavery and oppression.

A signal to an arbitrary collection of neurons within the organ we call a brain, a signal that has a flag of "high importance! drop everything else!!" ? Almost like an electrical current. Interesting that the concept of pain was evolved as it did, very effective in preventing an organism from doing whatever it is that's causing them harm.

All is not lost on the idea though. Maybe he could build a relationship of trust with Harry on the sly his last year, butter up to Dolores, and the following summer join the Ministry as a mole for Harry (not for the Order). Just two bad asses doing what they can.

******** I can definitely see that being pretty cool.

My main reasons for going with Cedric here is I think the start of the story comes pretty natural. Harry yells to warn Cedric when the killing blow is coming, with an ‚Äúoh fuck‚Äù Cedric dives out of the way. Not sure how the scene at the graveyard plays out but Cedric is Harry's man from there on out like the pirate in the Count of Monte Cristo movie.

Secondly the scene above gives Cedric a totally believable motivation.

If writing feels intimidating I can give little advice. I write a lot and I've been sitting on a multi week brain fog where I can't progress because trying to write a wholesome interaction between the main character and their loving father figure is triggering me because /drumroll/ I never had a loving parental figure in my life LMAO.

But enough about my drama, back to writing.

Writing can feel overwhelming. The best advice I can give is "Don't think just write." Because no matter how shitty the writing is, the shittiest writing in the world is better then the best /idea/ in the world. Because an idea is just an idea and isn't actual writing, and the shittiest writing in the world can be edited into something better.

And let me tell you, writing fanfiction is /bounds/ easier than writing original fiction, which I do nowadays. At least you'll have an already existing internally consistent world, while I struggle dearly for opportunities to put exposition in.

Really, the only major hurdle is always publishing chapter 1, and I usually punctuate that with a shot of whiskey. No time to second guess yourself if you wildly flail for the enter key while coughing.

** Different sites and forums have different ratios of male/female writers. The most male fanfiction-hosting websites I know of are the [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/creative-writing.18/][SpaceBattles]], [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/forums/user-fiction.2/][SufficientVelocity]], and [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/forums/creative-writing.19/][Questionable Questing]] forums, which each have various creative writing / 'questing' subforums. This trio of sites started with SpaceBattles, with the other two being splitters for various complicated reasons (well, the SB-SV thing is complicated and fraught, QQ exists mostly because people wanted somewhere the SB/SV userbase could host and discuss explicitly sexual NSFW writing).

The most prevalent fandom in those three sites is definitely [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]], but there are lots of other fandoms as well. Fanfics tend to be sci-fi, fantasy, adventure, action, comedy, and similar genres, with almost no romance-as-the-main-plot compared to say AO3 or FF.net - and what romance and romance-subplots there is there, tends to be way less M/M and more M/F or F/F.

**** A lot of people crosspost - you can host fics across all of them if you want to, and since they're all based on the same underlying XenForo software the formatting for each is easy enough to copy across. If you are looking to post your own work, you could try both SV and SB and see which you like better. SV and SB are pretty comparable, I'd give a slight edge to SB's culture over SV maybe, and I think SB has slightly more traffic and users. SV has a slightly more active quests and questing community, though, if you're into that. QQ has a lot less discussion and posters, but if you want a similar userbase and want to post or discuss things that would violate the SFW rules of SB/SV, it's the option with the most similar userbase. I wouldn't use QQ as the only hosting for anything that would inherently abide by the rules of SB/SV.

** I'm not sure how one would go about quantifying the split of male/female/other among the writers of Fan Fiction.

I'm male, 67, and have been writing fanfiction since the days of Trek Fanzines (ah, mimeograph, how I miss you) and I see the idea that most writers/readers are women all the time, but see no evidence of it.

Writers tend to group themselves (when they group themselves) in clusters of similar interests. The group I frequent most often is Rorshach Blot's Caer Azkaban group, where we are a fairly eclectic group. Blot himself is a guy, as are most of the others active in the group, but we have a sprinkling of women among us.

At first blush, I was going to say that what we had in common was our sense of humor, but on reflection, that's not true. Not all of us are as devoted to the funny as are others. Blot brings the funny, Cal (doghead 13) does epic adventures with a level of world-building most of us cannot match on our best days, I do (mostly) crossovers and so on and so on.

No, I think what bonds the group together is a fondness of Harry Potter and associated characters along with a desire to search out and share high-quality fanfics.

Oh, and we also share amusing reviews.

**** For practical reasons no, thing is I don't have a list per se. I use a bookmark and folder system that allows me to have all stories under a single folder simply labeled "fanfiction", which then contains more folders for different fandoms, which is then further divided into folders dedicated to specific things such as pairings (largest folder) specific fic types (things like premise, character study, unique elements) or all time favorites. All in all the harry potter directory comprises nearly 100 folders all on its own, each of which contains links to the various stories in their categories. While this makes it very easy to find stories (if they have been filed correctly) it does make it very difficult to compile a total list.

I'd say it depends on the fandom. Some fandoms are 50/50, others are dominated by either women or men.

However, I really don't think there is anything wrong with liking fiction that is mostly read/written by women. One aspect of fanfiction that sets it apart for me, is the lack of monetized marketing. Published works nowadays are heavily commercialized. They often lack technical quality, but are nevertheless promoted towards a certain 'target group'. Often works that are devoid of any substance gain popularity for this reason.

Fanfiction is community driven. The readers, regardless of gender or age, decide which work is the best, solely based on their own preference. This approach makes the entire process much more fair and egalitarian. In the world of fanfiction, the work of a twelve year old or a seasoned writer can both gain attention and praise, and I think that is truly a beautiful thing.

**** Amen! And not only this, but fanfiction allows writers to be creative and to escape the shackles of convention! Editors would rather publish the same story five hundred times than risk losing money.

I think this is also the part of the reason -aside from other forms of media gaining popularity- that the written word is not as profitable as it used to be. Before mass commercialization, writers took years to hone their craft and find interesting themes to critcize and parody society. Today, profit is the priority and writers strive to create 'readable' books.

That hasn't always been the aim of authors throughout history. I wouldn't say books like Oblomov, Madame Bovary or even Jane Eyre are 'readable', but they are undisputed classics because of their thematic and technical genius.

Edit: it also occured to me that the 'gendering' of books is a phenomenon that also came about because of commercialization. 'Frankenstein', a book that general audiences at the time considered horrifying, inspired the creation of an entirely new genre, science-fiction. A woman, Mary Shelley, wrote it.

I think this proves that genres (Like romance or science fiction) aren't necasserily meant for one gender. In the process of marketing, it's just easier for editors to heavily target one audience.

Yes exactly that is such an apt word to describe them! Mass production at the cost of quality.

That's the t. When I was younger I used to read historical fiction novels once in a while, but I don't bother any more. Another book that twists the facts for the sake of melodrama, revolutionary! /s.

There are definitely a few hidden gems, but as the reach of mass-media producers grows, so too decreases the quality of bestsellers.

I would rather support writers on the internet than become another consumer, like you said.

This is coming from a 20-year old guy who is reading fanfics(not only harry potter's) five years in a row.

I am quite annoyed however, with how many fanfics with yaoi pairings are there in Supernatural (Sam and Dean-...come on, they are BROTHERS DAMMIT!) and MCU fanworks(...SO MANY FUCKING LOKI/ANY OTHER MALE GUY PAIRINGS, bonus points if it's Barton or Stark).

Come on already people, a bit more fuc%ing decency(especially Supernatural part)? Seriously, if even ONE FUC%ING PERCENT of yaoi fics were actually decent stories, I would prob have enough stories to read for five or more YEARS.

For example, in one story called Child of the Storm by Nimbus, there is a pairing of two characters Uthred and Jean-Paul. The relationship between the two actually feels REAL when you read it

But yeah, there are some good slash fics. Just gotta know how to look for them.

***** yeah wincest is next level no no. When an author gets a slash pairing written just right, it can be amazing, even if they're an unlikely ship in canon. Sometimes an unlikely canon ships can be better, ive read my far share of drarry and sometimes they hit the nail on the head. My personal favourite being [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022]]. it's one of those trielt special fics
