So first impressions: 6k words, approx, 8 chapters. This is not a good sign. A chapter should tell us something of substance, and using a viewpoint change to justify a new chapter is not a great idea.

I feel like you're telling us how people feel, like the characters are puppets made to play out a specific emotion for the sake of moving the story forward, instead of people actually dealing with complex issues. It's a tough feeling to articulate more than that.

Your time skips could be flagged as such. I was a bit thrown at the jump early on.

I think you have a good premise here, but you need a little work to make your characters seem believable.
