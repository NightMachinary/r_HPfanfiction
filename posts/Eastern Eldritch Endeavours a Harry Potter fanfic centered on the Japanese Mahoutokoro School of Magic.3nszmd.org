** Interesting idea, but I'm cringing at the awkward use of Japanese along with very English spells. You lost me at "Rin-nee-chan". The extensive description of everyone's eyes and hairstyles, moreso than personality and story, also hurts. You had such a big description of the character (Mon?) in chapter 4, I thought it was going to be Sailor Chibi-Moon.

*** Firstly, thank you for submitting this comment. Regarding the English Spells and the Japanese language use, it feels like I'm in between a rock and a hard place: if I try and localize the spell chants, then it feels like readers will be completely lost and might think I'm rewriting spells. Another thing, although I'm not too sure, but I saw a few scenes of the movies in Japanese on YouTube, and the spell incantations were the same barring a change in accent, so that may have been a large part of my rationale behind keeping the spells the same.

With Rin, could you maybe specify how 'Rin-nee-chan' lost you? When I wrote that line, I wanted to have Sora call his older sister by name, yet still adhere to the convention of addressing his sister properly. Translated, it would be along the lines of 'Big Sister Rin'.

Regarding the description of characters' appearances more than personality or backstory, I was mainly trying to avoid making mistakes I had made in the past, where I would just outright state character personalities with their introduction. Looking back, it felt a lot like a case of telling as opposed to showing. I had the same problem with appearances (and still do today although to a lesser extent), so I mainly wanted to concentrate on making the characters distinguishable and bring their personality out through their interactions. With the lack of backstory, I wanted to try and find a place to comfortably weave it in, and it didn't seem like there were many opportunities for that as of yet. I will go back and see if I can improve things in those areas, but they're a few major aspects I struggle with when it comes to writing.

Finally, with Mon-chan, when I wrote her, I was thinking of a magical girl (especially with the wand) crossed with a maid. Personally, I just wanted to go with something basic regarding anime trends, and the creation of the physical characteristics was fairly random otherwise. I didn't specifically have Chibi-moon in mind at the time (Only saw the Sailor Moon Abridged up to the fight with Queen Beryl), but after looking now, I can see the resemblance

I will take a look at the chapters already online and see if I can revise them based on what you've brought to light. I'm not exactly sure when I will be able to post the revisions, though, but I will try to get them up as soon as possible

**** Wow, thanks for the long response - you certainly are a writer ;)

Maybe it's better just to work forward and keep telling your story before working back and fixing little things. I'll have to read it over again anyway, it was late at night and I was just curiously clicking around [[/r/hpfanfiction]]. It was a treat to find something different than the usual Dramione and Harem fics, and you should definitely keep writing!

It's a tough task to accomplish, taking Harry Potter and setting it in Japan. You have to capture HP lovers as your readers, without using anything familiar to them, and make them care about your characters and setting. Whereas all the tropes and likes/dislikes of HP fanfiction are already established and well known. The Japanese twist is based on your own knowledge of Japan and its culture, which could be wildly different from your readers'. With HP, there's a set text of 7 books to understand it, and we all have those. Japan, there's no one text of knowledge and understanding. Maybe you've lived there, maybe you do a lot of reading and research, or maybe you just really love anime and that's where all the magic is anyway.

And I totally understand trying to fit information in yet still having it seem natural, without turning the reader off. Perhaps I forget that you're having to do something other HP Fanfic writers don't have to, by making all new characters. I wish I had better suggestions and not just criticism - that isn't really fair, is it? - I guess it's all in practice and research.

I hope that makes sense. And yes, I have tried to cross Sailor Moon with Harry Potter. Come on, it has to happen some day ;)
