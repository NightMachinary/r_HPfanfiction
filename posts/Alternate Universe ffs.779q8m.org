** I might have something to contribute later, but I just thought I should say that you might want to be using the word "fic" instead. Not saying you have to if you don't want to, I just took "ffs" to be the abbreviation of "For Fuck's Sake" and thought this was a rant thread about AUs. X)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is an excellent postwar AU story, although it does not involve dimensional travels.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is an extreme AU fic where a major divergence happened in 1981.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), is a dimensional travel in which Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville made it to another universe where things went quite differently. It's a very good, very emotional story.

Canon Harry meeting his female counterparts in another dimension is done quite often, but completed fics meeting his male ones are rare. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3959072/1/Deepest-Reflections][Deepest Reflections]], linkffn(3959072), is ok, although it's the third installment of a trilogy, beginning with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][The Darkness Within]], linkffn(2913149).

**** It's good in most technical aspects - the author has a good grasp on the english language and grammar, spelling, characterization and pacing are well done.

It does have some glaring flaws; Kuri has a tendency, in all her stories, to manufacture angst where none is needed. This has the unfortunate result of derailing the greater plot of her stories and screwing up characterization - she will twist and turn events and people to squeeze as much artificial drama as possible.

Her greatest weakness is Harry/James angsty dialogue. She can't get enough of it. Therefore you will be reading along (and going, hey this is getting pretty good) and suddendly James or Harry will do or say some contrived bullshit, which will directly lead to 15 pages of everyone feeling bad and having conversations about feeling bad and how it's /so sad/ that everone is feeling bad, on and on until all characters have had a good outcry of misery and then after some time later everyone tearfully forgives each other.

Heavy stuff right? WELL IT HAPPENS TWENTY FUCKING TIMES PER STORY.

Just before I finished the second part, my most obsessive thought was /"why doesn't a nuclear bomb drop and put all these overdramatic assholes out their misery?"/.

***** Another weakness is that Ginny here is basically a damsel-in-distress.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
