Lot of fanfics utilize the ready made excuse of a powerful creature readily available to execute their main plot ideas.

There are also lot of them that use fawks as morality-meter for Dumbledore.

Are there any food docs that makes use of fawks but not just as a plot device?

Edit: good* fics*

But if you know any that have fawks as food item... Maybe?


** Is that a typo? Did you want to say good instead of food? Or are you looking for recipes for how to cook a Phoenix? Sorry... couldn't resist.

** From the top of my mind I would say linkffn(9036071). It takes a while before fawkes makes an appearance but then the little fellow becomes the most favoured sun bro out there. Unfortunately yet incompleted.
