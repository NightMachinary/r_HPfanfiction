Pretty self-explanatory;

Harry goes to get someone's hair for his polyjuice potion but ends up with the wrong hair and ends up in the wrong body

It's an assignment in potions class but someone sabotages his potion or switches it with theirs

Snape makes Neville nervous causing his potion to explode and hit Harry

Someone wants to see what it's like to be Harry Potter so they 'drug him' with Polyjuice so they switch places for a few hours/days

Anything that results in Harry ending up in a body he wasn't expecting to end up in via polyjuice. Could be one of his friends, one of his enemies, or a complete stranger.

Completely Optional points;

he ends up in the body of a girl

and/or the potion was imperfect leading to an extended stay in the body


** Not Harry, but Neville runs afoul of Polyjuice

** *A Little Knowledge is a Dangerous Thing* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1401424/vlad-the-inhaler][vlad the inhaler]]

I can link directly to the fic because of rule 8, basically Harry in sixth year needs someone to take his place for an hour so he can look what Malfoys up to. Warning the ending is pretty creepy.

*** Stay Away From Polyjuice? linkffn(12156244)

While it is a fun look on Polyjuice, it's characters are not really used (you could easily replace Harry/Hermione with any wizard/witch combo and it wouldn't affect the story at all). Character traits and histories are not really referenced at all.
