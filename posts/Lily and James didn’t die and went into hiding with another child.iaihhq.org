:END:
From what I remember, it was set after the war , and James , lily and another child come out of hiding due to not hearing from Dumbledore for a while because he died , and they walk around and see a statue of Harry, and it turns out they went into hiding to try and train the other child who dumbledore said was the real supposed boy who lived ( it was also somewhat of a James and lily bashing fic)

  Lily and James Potter come out of hiding so their son Alexander could fulfill the prophesy and defeat Voldemort. Things don't go as planned though, as they returned to the Wizarding World in 1999.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

  When Harry arrives at Gringotts, Hagrid produces the key but there's nothing else proving that the child is Harry Potter. What if there is a dark story behind the origin of the Boy-Who-Lived. Bashing Potters, Sirius and Dumbles. Good Goblins and Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. HEA in the end.
