I was always intrigued about Tom Riddle being sorted in a different house and I love "There's nothing to fear" series by callmesalticidae that has a Gryffindor Tom Riddle and Insurgere with a Hufflepuff Tom Riddle and I want to read fics in which he is not a Slytherin.

Completely on the other spectrum than "There's nothing to fear" as It's never stated that he uses force to get what he wants.

Edit: Nvm I didn't see the you already read it, well my reply is here to call the bot at least :)

  Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that.
