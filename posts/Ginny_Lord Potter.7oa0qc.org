Most of the stories about Lords and "Traditional Wizarding Culture" Harry ends up with Daphne or some other Syltherin. Maybe Susan Bones. Ginny usually ends up as s creepy stalker or "potion mistress" or a complete slut that was just using Harry for his money/fame. Ginny is one of my favorite characters so reading that gets pretty old pretty quickly. Are there any Lord Potter stories that are Harry/Ginny? No Harem. Harry/Ginny/Someone else is acceptable.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

**** I firmly believe Zion is only capable of one story. He just sands it down and resprays a new varnish over everytime he publishes it.
