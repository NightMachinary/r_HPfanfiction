** The best way to redeem him isn't to whitewash and excuse every evil thing that he did, its for him to recognize what he did was evil, wrong, be sorry/regretful for what he did, and do the right thing going forward

** Voldemort and Death Eaters, as depicted in canon, are beyond redemption, just as Hitler and his Nazi war criminals cannot redeemed.

If I want to make them redeemable, I would attempt a major rewrite of their motivations and actions, such as:

This Voldemort would be nothing like described in the Books. He neither looked like a snake nor did he mutilate his own soul.

Although he fought for a cause that might appear archaic to the modern Muggle world, it nevertheless made some sense in the Magical World.

His tactics were brutal and ruthless, but so were his enemies who were supposed to be on the 'right side on history'. Both sides did commit their shares of atrocities, as was generally the case in a civil war.

Voldemort inspired loyalty not through wantonly torturing his followers, as the Books often fondly depicted, but through persuasion, protection, and true leadership.

Potters, despite their young age, were rather efficient fighters and killers. They became such a thorn to his side, that Voldemort decided to take them out personally. He succeeded, but was severely wounded in the process. Harry himself never had anything to do with his defeat, but Dumbledore saw this as an opportunity to smear him as a baby killer and cook up that "Boy Who Lived" legend. Please keep in mind that realistic politics are always dirty.

The other option I see is to activate Diary Riddle. Instead of killing Ginny, he merged with her, fixing his own soul in the process, and became appalled at what his older self had done. He/she then tried to fix things as much as possible.

*** The first option reminds me a little of The Pureblood Pretense, except that that one never actually had a war. Riddle does turn out to have an intriguing motivation for his actions once you read book 4.

Option 2 is similar to The Imposter Complex (except that that one didn't actually kill Ginny, just used its stolen soul reserves to survive the Diary's destruction long enough to flee and possess someone else).

** Honestly for him to be redeemable he needs to be fighting for a different cause, because his canon one is pretty much wizard Nazis and as we all know there's no excusing or redeeming them.

I'd pick a morally sound goal, but keep similar methods (mostly just ditch the torture), he'd still have masked and mostly anonymous followers and still kill those who stand in his way, still leave the dark mark over their homes as a calling card etc.

It's really up to you whether horcruxes are ok here, murdering an innocent to prolong your own life is pretty evil, but whether you can keep them and be redeemed is hard to say (remember that canonically they don't negatively affect the creator).

Honestly you can keep his reasons for attacking the Potters the same, they're fighting against him and their child is apparently the only one who could ever beat him, simple self preservation says they have to go and a fear of death should still be part of his character.

** Or you could give reason behind his actions and not redeem him. He doesn't need to be a crazy murderer, he can have a well defined path to that destination

** you could make it seem as though they have been perceived all wrong. The potter killings could have been due to an Imperio etc. I also think that maybe explaining motives would be a good way to go about it. For example, instead of hating muggle-borns and muggles he just wants to integrate them earlier with classes that teach them about wizarding traditions. We can see that Halloween and Christmas replace Yule and Samhain, so we could say that Riddle just wants to ensure that the wizarding world keeps its traditions.

​

Another thing you could do is do some Dumbledore bashing. I know that not everyone is on with this so just skip this paragraph if so. However, I think this is also a really good way to go about it. Dumbledore is extremely respected within the magical community, so no one would go against him. This means he can say something, and the daily prophet would report it as truth. We can say that Ddumbledoor twisted the media into perceiving Riddle as a new dark lord and twisting his views and ideals. We all know that Riddle was a student when Dumbledore was there, so maybe Dumbledor deliberately tried to confound him or plant ideas in his head.

​

A third thing is to maybe explain to readers what the splitting of souls does to the mind. By the time he killed Harry's parents he had already made a lot of Horcruxes, so you could say that with each split of his soul, it drove him further into insanity and away from his original motivations. Instead of being fully in control of his mind and actions he does thing on impulse and makes rash decisions. It would be easier for his views to be swayed towards more murder because that's what Horcruxes need to be made. You could also say that through the destruction of the Horcruxes, those would pieces returned to Ridddle and so he gained more and more of his sanity back and then finally realizing that what he did was wrong and completely change the way he is handling things. Go the political route instead of violent, making plans instead of acting rashly, going back to his former beliefs and ideals such as integrating muggle-borns a lot earlier so that they can be accepted into society.

​

I think the last one is the best but these are just a few options! :)

** Don't make it about the Potters. Make it about Lily. She's the muggleborn, the anomaly. Trying to kill Harry as well is Riddle's way of containing said anomaly.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** Voldemort discovers that James Epstein and Lilly Maxwell (potter) are running a global child trafficking network.

Dumbledore had Sirius assassinate james and then pinned the crime on Voldemort. Everyone knew though that James didnt kill himself. Even if thats what Crouch led the people to believe through DP propaganda
