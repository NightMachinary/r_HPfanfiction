What are your favorite canon Dumbledore jokes and your favorite slightly insane but hilarious Dumbledore fanfics? I'm following Albus and Harry's world trip and something in that vein would be great.


** Favourite Canon moment is when they're trying to cheer up Hagrid after Rita Skeeters article, Hermione calls her a cow and then apologises to Dumbledore for her language, leading him to say something like "I have temporarily gone deaf and did not hear a single word you said Miss Granger"

** One of the best one off gags, really just a side note about Dumbledore is from Harry Potter, Geek of Magic linkffn(12703694)

One chapter is a series of letter from Hermione to her parents:

/Dear Mum and Dad,/

/.../

/I told you that our Potions Professor is a little scary and Neville is a nervous wreck around him. I'm trying to help him prepare for the class, but it's not going very well. Harry has decided that we should get him used to Professor Snape, so, to help Neville, he's made a Professor Snape mask. It's very lifelike, and Ronald is a good mimic. I'm a little afraid of how Professor Snape will respond when he finds out about it./

/Love, Hermione/

/#/

/Dear Mum and Dad,/

/Professor Snape has found out about the Professor Snape mask. He told Harry to hand it in, so Harry wore it to class. Professor Snape usually arrives just when class is about to start, and when he got there, Harry was standing at the front, lecturing about how potions is the best subject. Harry got five detentions./

/A lot of people asked him about it, so Harry's made more masks and he's started selling them. I told him not to. The Headmaster bought one./

/Professor Snape ignores Neville now. He's too busy with Harry...../

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

I'd like a character who's inquisitive and eager without being inexplicably better educated than every adult around them, and still actually fascinated and engaged with the magical world.

Because, let's face it, most of us at the age of 11 if introduced to the world of magic would be desperate to learn and understand more about it, but we wouldn't have godlike levels of experimental or theoretical understanding of science.

** My favorite canon Dumbledore joke is the enchanted drinks he conjured at the Dursleys at the beginning of Half Blood Prince:

#+begin_quote
  He placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair, but before he could do anything else, Uncle Vernon shouted, ‚ÄúWill you get these ruddy things off us?‚Äù

  Harry looked around; all three of the Dursleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls, their contents flying everywhere.

  ‚ÄúOh, I'm so sorry,‚Äù said Dumbledore politely, and he raised his wand again. All three glasses vanished. ‚ÄúBut it would have been better manners to drink it, you know.‚Äù

  It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts, but he merely shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and Dudley and said nothing, keeping his small piggy eyes on Dumbledore's wand.

*** There was a fic in which Harry says "I did not know you were into Muggle baiting, Headmaster" in this scene once the cups started bouncing against the Dursley's heads. Ever since then I could not see this scene as anything but bullying by the Dumbledore. Even though Dursley's deserve way worse for how they treated Harry, Dumbledore's actions right then was not going to make things better for anybody involved. And only makes it seem to be unnecessary bullying. In a way, Dumbledore was proving to the Dursley's that they were right to be wary of any wizard if his own actions can be this petty.

It's as if the headmaster is the only one who could do wrong and not our beloved saintly characters like Fred and George or Hagrid even though Dumbledore's act was the only one which was harmless. Harry is not a saint as portrayed in the movies he is imperfect and finds pleasure in Dudley's suffering (when its not life threatening) but whatever evil Dumbledore is evil.

****** I know it happens in that particular fanfic and that's what I'm commenting on . If i remember correctly harry wants to distance himself from Dumbledore and the author decided to use that scene to give us an ugly portrayal of him (how Dumbledore despite being an advocate for muggleborns/muggle was harassing a family of muggles). Now I don't mind harry breaking off from Dumbledore's shadow nor do I have a problem with Dumbledore being manipulative but doing it in a way without commenting on Harry's past action makes him look like a hypocrite and hence my comment. If you want to show an established character in negative light try not to take cheap shots. In that fic Harry smugly says that Dumbledore was muggle baiting despite the fact that he was fine with similar action before (until that point in the fic the actions I've said before were of canon harry).

Look inside before you look outside, people rarely see their fault in real life and that's fine too, but if you want show that your Harry is right and has a moral high ground than i can't let his dismissal of his own action pass.

******* In that fic, in that particular scene, Harry was concerned about getting Dumbledore to leave. He was not that concerned about the Dursleys, but was using that to get to Dumbledore. Atleast that was the impression I got. He was less being an hypocrite and more being manipulative. That's what I thought atleast. I would have to reread the fic to be sure.

Also, the tail happened 5 years ago and the toffee 2 years ago. People change. Besides, do you really expect fanfic authors to address the minor details that happened couple of books ago. I had to reread to remember exactly how that scene panned out.

And if you think Harry is wrong to expect better of Dumbledore than of himself, I will say only one thing. Dumbledore is about 100 years older than Harry.

******** About that fanfic author bit I know from personal experience that addressing the outcome of the change you as a writer make can be daunting and I don't have a clue on how to do it correctly but I try to do so even when I fail at adressing everything but it still isn't an excuse. Correct research and atleast trying to address everything whether explicitly or implicitly (atleast when it comes to results of your own change to canon) is what makes a good fic great and why some fanfic writers are held in greater esteem than others.

It might be that harry was trying to be manipulative and not at all concerned about the dursleys i dont remember quite well but the first reply made it sound that what Dumbledore was doing was such a huge issue, so that's why I commented.

And about Dumbledore being 100 yrs older than harry and being more responsible sadly it does matter in real world I guess but really it shouldn't. If age being an argument was valid than there would be no reason to not listen to your elders but old people do make mistakes and their actions because they carry so much weight make those mistakes look far worse than they really are. The scene in canon was set up to be comedic in contrast to the dark times ahead but because it's dumbledore (who we perceive as someone who failed Harry and should have done more) sound far worse. You commented how you can never read the same scene again in a positive light then you should also be unable to read every other scene with fred and george or hagrid again in a positive light. Imagine subjecting Dudley who wasn't correctly taught right from wrong and was a kid to have a pig's tail and having to go to surgery for it or nearly choking to death with his own tongue. How horrifying it would be to not able to breathe. Fred and george or hagrid didn't target the adults ie vernon or petunia but a kid but we still laugh at that incident.

** Favourite fanfiction Dumbledore is the one from "Itachi, is that a baby?" Hands down. some choice quotes.

"In addition to the forbidden objects, the Forbidden Forest is, shockingly enough, forbidden. This, too, is not a negotiable point. Any student stupid enough to go into the Forest will not be punished, we simply won't go look for you. Considering the nature of the dwellers in the Forest, I will remind the students that they should avoid it unless they are facing their Potions final."

"I have one further announcement to make. This year, the rooms on the east side of the third floor are forbidden to anyone who does not wish to die a truly remarkable death. I realize that in a school of young people, some of you are certain to go exploring because of this warning, but by giving it, I am now covered as far as the board of directors is concerned. I reiterate that the rooms on the east side of the third floor are forbidden and that any student who dies as a result of ignoring this warning will be buried in the usual mass grave in back of the castle reserved for those who have thankfully removed themselves from our society before their idiocy can do too much damage. Thank you. Now, time for bed. Sleep well." Dumbledore bowed and turned, walking out the staff entrance to the hall."

Dumbledore flung a burning hex into the bacon on the head table, causing food to launch into the air and rain festive bits of scorched pork-product on everyone.

"So, it is time to end a year of studying and learning new things. I realize most of you did so with members of the opposite gender instead." He gave a half-glare around the hall. "I have no doubt that most of you are eager to leave this institution of intellectual pursuits so that you may sooner empty your heads of all thought and focus on things more important to the short-sighted minds of the very young and innocently stupid."

"The House Elves have packed your things and loaded them onto the Express. As such, you are all free to go. A word of warning: after several incidents in which students were left behind by the train, we are instituting a new policy. Namely: alerting you to the fact that the train leaves promptly in one hour, at which time it will be your problem to return home." Several students rose and were nearly at the door when Dumbledore spoke again. "I probably should award the House Cup, but if you people missed the red and gold papering the walls, then I see no reason to bother your overtaxed brains now. But with that in mind, I need to make a few announcements. Please return to your seats. Thank you."

** Less 'slightly insane' and more 'completely off his rocker' Dumbledore is in Core Threads, in that story one of the things he did was wear a pumpkin costume for Hallowern, and the explanation for why Dumbledore had the Invisibility Cloak was that he kept 'borrowing' it to sneak past Mcgonagall and eat his candy(I think that's he did with it), and James got so frustrated he just threw the cloak at him.

A slightly more sane Dumbledore isnin Itachi, is that a baby?, he was crazy and does crazy things, and he gets away with it because it's a crack fic(sorta), some of my favorite parts was him being serious and snarky while everyone else is crazy, that and the food fights where he animates his chicken to defend him.\\
Edit: actually he is less crazy and more of a troll that is waiting for everyone to call him on his bullshit and is disappointed no one did that yet.

By the ‚ÄòDark Forest', I mean the place nearest to our game-keeper's home where the trees are thickest. By ‚Äòout-of-bounds' I mean that you are politely requested to refrain. I don't see how I can make this more plain, but if you need further clarification, please see me tomorrow, and I will try,‚Äù he added, smiling in Harry's direction.

** In HP and the Goblet of Fire, when Harry is guessing (candy themed) passwords to get into Dumbledore's office. Out of frustration he finally shouts out "Canary Cluster" which is the right answer. It is also an invention of the Weasley twins and as of then an extremely new, and prohibited item.
