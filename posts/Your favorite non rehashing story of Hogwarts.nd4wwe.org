I hate rehashes of stories where pretty much everything but a very few minor things have changed. What's the point of that?

I'd like more of a change, and stories not to take hundreds and hundreds of words to get the point of the plot.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New

Absolutely NO Character Bashing. Flawed characters are a yes, bashed characters are a huge no.


** Draco Malfoy and the Mirror of Ecidyrice it's really good.

It is slash though but Draco ends up back in time and is legit trying not fuck up shit (he doesn't know how Harry beat Voldie and whatnot) but keeps fucking shit up haha

Also he thinks he's trash cause he was an evil bully death eater in the original life so there's no hand waving of his actions.

** I initially avoided reading linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) because it sounded like it would be a rehash, but it's actually a really original storyline (books 1-4 complete, book 5 starting later this year). Even when aspects of it have similarities to canon, like the basilisk attacks happening in second year and the Triwizard Tournament in fourth, it's telling a very different story. No characters are bashed; actually, they're almost universally treated better than canon. Riddle is a very interesting case, with motivations that are partially sympathetic while still definitely being bigoted and cruel.

For a more deeply flawed protagonist, but still no one being bashed, linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) is something of a character study of Severus Snape. The plot is about him being sent back after he dies, to relive his life from age sixteen and try again, but what makes it interesting for me is how it gets inside his head and explores his motivations. Not quite finished, but updating regularly and just a few chapters to go.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.
