** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]] and its continuation books (7 in total), by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]]

Pros:

- Manipulative Dumbledore; ✓
- the protagonist has dark powers that he tries to control; ✓
- the protagonist's main life purpose is freeing magical creatures (✓), whose true abilities have been bound by wizards very long time ago;

  - con: creatures mostly just agree to behave well if freed, which ruins the intrigue and makes the whole thing into author's personal fantasy (imo);

- the author's writing style is quite beautiful (imo);
- many characters have well-written, strong personalities (that is, when their actions promote author's pre-constructed story arcs and would not contradict it).

Cons:

- idiot balls and Deus Ex Machina assistance are pretty much what author relies upon to construct his story arcs and to conclude them, which can get really annoying really soon;
- heroes have really hard time killing or incapacitating death eaters, especially the strongest ones, whom I guess the author was keeping alive as long as possible because of the work done on building their characters.

Can have major drawbacks depending on your preferences:

- *homosexual relations*: both male and female pairings, including the main characters: Harry/Draco;

  - sex scene descriptions from the 3rd book on, and you can't just ignore these blocks of text because the characters regularly kiss, hug, comfort each other and so on;

- psychological problems, therapy talks with each other, description of real-life emotions and reactions which can look annoying in a book setting (e.g. temper tantrums, guilt attacks etc);

- gore and torture descriptions.

**** You can get these on Ebooks!!?? Can you explain that to me? I am like stuck in the stone age, I always just get regular hard back books, but I would be willing to get a kindle or something to have this series on it. How do you download it? And what sort of device should I get? Would I be able to do this on an Ipad?

***** Use [[http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/][Firefox]] + [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/][GreaseMonkey]] + [[http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/33325][Fanfiction.net story export script]] + [[http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/179482][Fanfiction.net, make text selectable again]]. That will allow you to download whole books and put them in .doc or whatever else you like.

You can also convert .doc files into .epub, or whatever your smartphone or ereader accepts --- there are many programs and online services for that.

For other fanfic websites, you can also try using [[https://www.flagfic.com/]] and [[http://fanfictiondownloader.net/]].

****** I'm sorry to say this, but, since a couple of months ago, it is not possible anymore to download fics from FF.net and Fictionpress. Some of the changes that FF made it is blocking the download, FlagFic send some emails asking why and if they can make the download possible again, but they didn't answer yet :/

******* That's why I suggested the greasemonkey script combo for ff.net and left flagfic for other sites.

I think ff.net's owners try to screw its work up too, but since it's just a script, it's much more flexible to upgrade. But even if it stops working as well, there is also [[http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/102342][Fanfiction Tools]], which is more reliable even if somewhat less comfortable to use.

**** For Manipulative Dumbledore, you can also check [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]].

There was some discussion on it [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1ptycq/timetravel_fics_unafraid_of_altering_the_timeline/][here]].

** House Elf culture is covered in some detail in [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/White_Knight_Grey_Queen/1__Discovery/][White Knight, Grey Queen]] by Jeconais. Dumbledore is set up as manipulative and an antagonist to Harry. The story is a sappy love story with an overpowered, morally ambiguous Harry.
