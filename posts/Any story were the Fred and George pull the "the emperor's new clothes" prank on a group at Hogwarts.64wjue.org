In second year when the twins rescue harry while getting harry trunk the book of the The Emperor's New Clothes catches there attention and they ask harry if they can have it harry not caring says go ahead. Over harry second year the twins develop a potion that has the same effect. the only down side to there potion is that when it wears off the person that was under its effects remembers exactly what happened while under the potions effects.which for the twins when they tested it on each other in the privacy of there room was not a problem. but for the twins victims who spent the entire day parading around in front of the school it was traumatising.

When they pull the prank the also give the staff and prefects a second potion to make sure that they don't see anything wrong till the potions wear off.


** I do remember one I read where someone plays this sort of prank on Hermione where she was charmed to think she was wearing clothes and walked through he school and she blamed Harry for it. It really was a small thing though. In this story, I think Harry either jumps dimensions or travels back in time and things are slightly different. And when he get's there, he learns that he was never friends with Hermione, and someone did this prank to her and blamed him for it before the start of the story.

I'm pretty sure the story was decent, but do you really want to read it because of this one reason? I'd have to think hard to remember which this was.
