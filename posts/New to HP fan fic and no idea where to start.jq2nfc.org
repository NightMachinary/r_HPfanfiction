I just recently got into fan fic generally and love Harry Potter so I want to read some Harry Potter fic. That said, I have literally no idea where to start.

1. I like long fics (generally 100,000+ but that's not a requirement).

2. I like when they are generally well written---doesn't have to be perfect but generally correct grammar and punctuation.

3. I don't have an issue with romance/relationships (generally prefer F/F or M/F) but I don't want the whole story to be about the relationship.

4. I like when the story has adventure/suspence/action.

Thanks!


** I have a lot of faves, and I can list them for you if you'd like, but idk if we would like the same things

What I did was go to Fanfiction.net and sort all the HP fics by favorites or follows. Filter for word count, and scroll through and see if any of the most popular long fics in the fandom spark your fancy.

Once you've found a fic you like, that author might have others you like. Even if they don't, you'll get a bit of a sense of what you like, and you can come back and ask for more specific recs.

*** Thanks for this! That's probably a very good place to start. I've only ever used Archive of Our Own. Im guessing Fanfiction.net is similar. Do you recommend one over the other?

**** Oh lol I thought you were actually a newbie who's had no experience with fanfic, sorry.

FFN is much better for general “mainstream” HP fics in my opinion. The fandom on there is huge---much bigger than AO3 I believe. It seems that there are a lot of people who don't read/write in any fandoms except HP, and they tend to use FFN just because it's the most well-known.

Plus, the tagging system on AO3 can be a lot. I don't like it as if I'm searching for a pairing or character, I only want fics in which they're featured prominently, and FFN gives that feature to me.

***** Haha I am like one small baby step above a newbie with no experience, so no worries! I just sort of stumbled upon AO3 so that's what ive been using. Didn't know the one you suggested existed until you suggested it. So ill definitely check it out!

** Here's an interesting one for you then. It's mystery/suspense (with, unforunately, some Weasley bashing). I gave it to a friend that's only vaguely familiar with the movies and it seemed understandable. Let me know if you enjoy! :D

  Harry recalls that a pale little girl called Sally-Anne was sorted into Hufflepuff during his first year, but no one else remembers her. Was there really a Sally-Anne? Harry and Hermione set out to solve the chilling mystery of the lost Hogwarts student.

** You might also enjoy Northumbrians fics which are very canon compliant and even tho several are rather short, others a longer and they all take place in the same universe, chance are if you like one of these that you'll like the majority of the other 80ish fics as well.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Ratialonity by Elizer Yudowsky)

Best fic ever.

linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) Close second.

linkffn(New Blood by artemisgirl) Hermione-centric, hope that's fine. So is The Arithmancer, for that matter.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) 1M+ words, and only at 4th year so far. If this keeps up, it's going to be 8M+ by year 7...

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
