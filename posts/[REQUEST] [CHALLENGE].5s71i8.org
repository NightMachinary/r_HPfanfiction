Whatsup all,[[/r/harrypotterfanfiction]], this is my first post in this reddit section, so please excuse me if I have broken any rules or done something wrong.

If I have, don't hesitate to point it out so I'm aware of it and won't do it again. I'm looking for a fic that follows the following points. If such a fic cannot be found then this may be interpreted as a Challenge instead.

I'm looking for a fic that features a well characterised Dumbledore which shows his wisdom and magical prowess, as the Master of the Elder Wand and defeater of the Dark Lord Grindelwald, whilst simultaneously exploring and developing a magical system much like the ones found in The Denarion Trilogy, Prince of the Dark Kingdom, In Light of Silver Memories, What You Leave Behind amongst all other amazing fics out there, credits to them.

In regards to Harry himself, what'd I like is a Harry that develops and progresses in knowledge and power - I.e a Harry that has a great relationship overall with Dumbledore (Dumbledore helping Harry achieve the understanding the mysteries of magic that he himself possesses and what makes him such a strong character. I love duels so they are a must, duels must be realistic and employ as many fields of magic as they can, more fields may be made up as long as they are somewhat sensible (this is magic after all :) ) and I don't even mind if fields like Potions and Herbology or even Divination ( precognition?) are used.

While a Independent Harry is preferred, I don't mind a romantic aspect to the story if it is actually necessary (it makes Harry stronger?) and developed (on that note : no spontaneous soul bonds, no Veela bonds, no slash or Mpreg). As a "side request", it'd be amazing if there was a political aspect to the story (Dumbledore and Harry team up to take on the corrupt Ministry and so by extension Lucius Malfoy who is considered to be a master of politics perhaps). Voldemort, the worst Dark Lord seen in centuries, and his Death Eaters must be deserving of such names, for example they could be downright malicious and insidious wielding dark, horrific magic that's the stuff of nightmares.

I hate stories where Harry gains a spontaneous power boost and bosses everyone around or where Voldemort and Co are trapped or killed by some stupid trap. Beyond what I've said, the story can contain whatever you want(depending on if the reply is replying to the Looking for a fic or if this is taken as a Challenge).

Thanks


** Best I got is linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane.) Also, please put your walls of text in paragraphs next time, man.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

** linkffn(Lesser Evils)

This one fits most of the categories you've said - cool magic, duels, politics, independent Harry for sure - and Dumbledore is fantastically characterised in it. Although, his relationship with Harry develops fairly slowly throughout the story, so you might need to stick through the first few chapters to get to the stuff you're looking for.

  OotP AU. Dark magic, Death Eaters, politics - and in the middle of it all, Harry Potter. Tested against enemies old and new, he learns that power requires sacrifices, revenge, doubly so. No slash, no bashing, Crouch Sr is alive.

*** Thanks so much! Yeah I have to say that I prefer slow built relationships as they're more realistic.

**** Is this an ongoing story? Just wanted to ask how often the author updates but I don't mind because I understand that quality takes time.

***** It is ongoing - the most recent update was on January 11th, as you can see - but I can't confirm any kind of update schedule or regularity, unfortunately.

I've just discovered this one myself and there's nothing I can see on the author's profile about any kind of schedule, so I guess we'll just have to wait and see, sorry!
