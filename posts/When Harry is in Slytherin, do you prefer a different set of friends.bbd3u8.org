Do you prefer a different path to a Ron/Hermione/Harry friendship, or do you prefer authors have him befriend other Slytherins?


** I personally prefer different circle of friends because I want to see different dynamics and different mix of personalities and the The way harry grows and the way he is influnced by these relationships :) Afterall the fictions that I prefer are ones that provide me with what I didn't have in canon

** I prefer when he has a different set of friends. I think its mainly to change the dynamic of Harry friendship, because having harry in a different House but acting all the same with a 2 sidekick friends who are either a walking encyclopedia or a loyal but lost best friend is just boring.

For example, in an idea I'm toying with, Harry ends up with Theodore Nott and Blaize Zabini. Nott is a quiet guy who likes to read (what brings him with Harry in story) while Zabini is a social butterfly who is the "voice" of the group and stay with them mainly because troubles find Harry and it's interesting to witness it.

â€‹

I also like to have him friend, or at least social acquaintance with Ron and Hermione (if they both end up friends, I don't think the absence of Harry would stop them to investigate mysteries like the Heir of Slytherin, and so crossing path with Harry).

** A 11 yo Ron isn't going to keep being friends with Harry if he's a Slytherin. It isn't something realistic. He's not going to run around calling Harry a dark wizard or a traitor to his family like fanfics like to portray, but he won't be willing to break the mould that Hogwarts seems to have regarding friends from different houses. Neither would Hermione.

Harry wouldn't even know or care enough about Hermione crying in a bathroom to go looking for her, realistically speaking. He doesn't bother to do anything like that when any of the other girls from other houses are crying - the whole rescue Hermione from a troll and become friends with her is a really bad plot device on Rowling's part anyway.

I think it's more about the inconvenience of it. A large part of Ron and Harry's friendship is just how much time they spend with one another. I think they'd stay amicable, but they'd be nowhere near as close as they are in canon. It's entirely fanon to think that Ron is biased against Slytherins.

Now put Harry where he wins almost every game he plays in for Slytherin.

***** If Harry is in Slytherin he wouldn't be there on Halloween's Charm lesson, that means Ron may not insult Hermione and she wouldn't be crying afterwards. Hermione wouldn't be in the trio then.

It's interesting, the two best friends from two opposing Houses united against the school without Hermione as the voice of reason. The whole chamber of secret, pettigrew, and triwizard tournament fiasco will be more fun.

**** First real friend? From what, spending a few hours together in a train? Ron has a less than stellar opinion about Slytherin, and Harry would think that Ron wouldn't like him if he's a Slytherin. HP is emotionally retarded enough in canon to think that and never talk to the guy ever again based off that assumption.

You don't think that anyone else their age has ever spoken to Ron, ever, until Harry does?

The Weasleys are well-liked by many people. Even if you don't buy into the whole pureblood gatherings or parties, friends of the family would have visited them often, and they would have had children who are Ron's age. Some of those children would have gotten along with Ron.

The Diggorys and the Lovegoods live in the same area as the Weasleys. They would definitely have been invited to their children's birthday celebrations when they were younger (at least until Luna's mother died). Luna and Cedric would have been friendly to Ron too - they're not described as being snobbish at all.

****** It isn't as if Ron has anything good to say about Slytherin either. Or Hermione for that matter. Or literally anyone.

But that's just the way Rowling wrote her black and white books. She tried adding some other angles with Malfoy, but that just came flat.

Besides, this whole thread is about whether Ron and Hermione would be friends with Harry if Harry was a Slytherin. Harry's not going to hate his own House if he's sorted there.

That's because every Slytherin that Rowling gives a personality always turns out to be an antagonizing douche. Malfoy, Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle, Blaise, Flint, Bulstrode. And that's just in their year. There's also Umbridge, Bellatrix, Snape, Slughorn (who couldn't even be bothered to remember Ron's name), Voldemort, and Lucius.

Aside from those, he doesn't even really spare them a second thought.

Harry would definitely be an outcast in Slytherin, considering many of the ones in his year are the children of Death Eaters.

** My biggest problem with Slytherin!Harry is authors' reluctance in exploiting the potential of the butterfly effect to create very different stories.

CoS still happens in second year. Sirius still flees Azkaban in 3rd year. The golden trio (sometimes replacing Ron with Draco) still exists. And so on.

I much prefer when authors try to explore how things could have gone differently with the changed Sorting, to make the story more unique.

*** I think it could be pretty interesting if CoS still happened in a universe where Ron and Harry aren't friends and Ginny ended up dying, although I'm not really sure what would have happened if Voldemort came back through the diary. Would he become a person with a proper body by default, and if so, would Quirrel's soul fragment just continue floating about or would he somehow use it to create a new Horcrux? Or would he still have to create a body and possess it?

There are so many where he befriends Malfoy, and I do ship Drarry, but I really enjoy his interactions with like Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, etc. I also enjoy the interactions of 1940's Slytherins when Harry gets thrown back in time to Tom Riddle era.
