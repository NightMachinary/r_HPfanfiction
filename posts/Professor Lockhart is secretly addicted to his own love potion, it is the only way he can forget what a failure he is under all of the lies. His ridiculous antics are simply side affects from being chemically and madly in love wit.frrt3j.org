Professor Lockhart is secretly addicted to his own love potion, it is the only way he can forget what a failure he is under all of the lies. His ridiculous antics are simply side affects from being chemically and madly in love with himself.\\
It drives him to do despicable things like wiping the memory of successful witches and wizards to steal their accomplishments, because his own glory is worth more than anything.

Dumbledore arrives before Lockhart tries to Obliviate Harry and Ron. He understands at once what Lockhart has been doing. Dumbledore leans over the cauldron to take a big whiff of the Amortentia, and the scent of freshly laundered socks and Hungarian Goulash momentarily overwhelms him.

Dumbledore disarms Lockhart and tells the boys to return to their common room (which they decide to do for the meantime rather than disobeying an irate Dumbledore). Lockhart is frog marched to a hidden single room flat disguised as a broom cupboard on the outside. “We keep this room for the spouses of the school professors. Though your actions have been despicable, I understand that addiction is a disease. You will be given a chance to detox from your love potion, you will stay here for one month to get it all out of your system. If you attempt to brew as much as chicken noodle soup, if you steal so much as a single Leaping Toadstool, your fall from grace will be the first page of the Daily Prophet. I advise you to start reading this Potions Anonymous book. Each evening I'd like you to eat with Beany, a house elf who is recovering from a Butterbeer addiction. She will report to me on your progress. Good luck, Gilderoy, I hope this opportunity will bring you peace.”

Lockhart struggled to keep up his side of the arrangement to Dumbledore's demands, but since he could not risk being exposed as a fraud, he tries. He read the stupid Potions Anonymous book (which spewed nonsense that was fundamentally opposed to his highest beliefs: “No amount of spell work can create happiness, no strength of bewitchment can match the feeling of love”). He ate his meals with Beany, who ended up being decent company. She at least brought him his every requested food and snack with enough to stockpile. Her sheer gullibility was even better for his mood, smiling inwardly as Beany's wide eyes stared at him in awe as she believed every story he told. Lockhart's gratitude toward the Elf stopped sharply when she did not fulfill his needs, and when Beany forgot to bring seconds or dared to ask about Lockhart's Amortentia recovery, Gilderoy immediately began to regard the Elf as a tool who was wasting his air. More commonly, Lockhart appreciated the company and even in his worst depression he avoided openly berating Beany. Gilderoy has never enjoyed open conflict, instead preferring to crush an adversary through leaking humiliating secrets and performing horrific deforming jinxes in the dead of the night. The withdrawals continued into week 3 of his captivity, and the mood swings threatened to overtake him, and his extreme narcissism was being counteracted by serious bouts of self loathing. Against everything else, Beany and Lockhart struck up a friendship bonded through suffering suffering, and Dumbledore is impressed with Beany's reports on the matter. This sits perfectly well with Albus, who prefers that Gilderoy stays hidden from sight in the jinxed broom closet until the potion is out of his system, after which he can finally be sent far away from Hogwarts (and hopefully England too).

Beany brings new of the rescue of Ginny Weasley by Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. The whole school was whispering praise and admiration. Apparently, Potter took on a form of Tom Riddle alone after he was separated from Weasley in the Chamber antechamber. Weasley has attempted to light his broken wand and instead causing the tunnel to collapse with an unintended Bombarda Maxima.

Lockhart thought over the whole situation bitterly. He was so close to finding the entrance through those same boys. He would have saved The Boy Who Lived, who tragically lost his memory but who would have survived, and he would be known as the slayer of Slytherin's monster. The Wizarding World would have had no choice - he would be a legend. They would have been been enthralled, obsessed with him, to the 5 time winner of Witch Weekly's Best Smile (he would have won every week of the year). He would have been elected Prime Minister (and he'd do a much better job than that oaf Fudge).

These horrible thoughts overwhelmed Lockhart as his fantasies were ripped from him with a harsh realization of his current situation. He had no glory, Potter stole that from him. He was cold yet sweating, could barely hold his bowels. The mental suffering was worse than the physical symptoms; he cried in pain then screamed in misery then laughed in hysterics. These withdrawals were worse than he had ever expienced. This was to be expected as he had spent the last 3 years consuming a near toxic amount of Amortentia every single day, on each and every hour. His intake had increased dramatically after arriving at Hogwarts as to help him deal with the constant self-doubt that came from his failures as a teacher. Hell, Lockhart would never have took the job if there wasn't a nearly limitless supply of the necessary ingredients. He probably went mad years ago, but with no one there to watch, his defensive mechanisms utterly failed even himself. There was only one solution. He sat down slowly, endorphins going crazy as he thought through a plan. He felt the familiar physical reaction that came with plotting, the one thing he was truly good at (“You're the best at everything!” shouted his true love, that little voice in his head). Lockhart was not so foolish to ignore the obvious, that this would be the last time, and that this time was much, much different.

Beany arrived at the dusty broom-closet. Her light feet made barely a sound, but Lockhart had his ears pinned to against the door. Beany gently rapped the knocker thrice, and the door which separated them vanished into thin air. “Mr Locky Mr Locky you look an absolute mess you do. When was the last time he took a shower Mr smells like troll feets he must try to be clean Mr Locky!” stammered Beany madly, but with a smile at her newfound friend. Beany had taken the detoxing from Butterbeer rather well, and this alone was enough to justify the anger that Lockhart felt for the self. He flashed his dangerous smile back, and he wondered if he should approach this situation slowly or not. He decided against it. “Beany, you have been a great friend to me these past few weeks. However I regret to remind you that I am still employed as a professor at Hogwarts, and that you are still bound to answer my orders. Now first I must implore you to watch your mouth, and that your are banned from ever insulting my hygiene, looks, or magical skill ever again.” Beany looked absolutely horrified, her eyes grew massive as she looked up at Lockhart, unblinking as the tears began to swell. “Now Beany, I need you to do me a favor. Well, an order really. You see, I have been unable to do any magic in nearly 3 weeks after Dumbledore took my wand. As the most powerful wizard in the world, this simply will not due. Now I will not ask you to steal from Albus Dumbledore, if only because he is your highest master. Instead, I need you to do something else. Tonight, when everyone is sleeping, I need you to Apparate into the Gryffindor Common Room. I need you to silently sneak into the 2nd year boys dormitory. And I need you to, eh-em, borrow, Mr Harry Potter's wand. Then I want you to immediately come back here. Do you understand? You are forbidden from telling anyone what you are doing and who you are taking orders from. This is an order, and if you fail you will be punished. Because I know that you House Elves can tolerate a punishment, I'm going to offer you something else. I'm going to summon for you the tallest flagon of Butterbeer you've ever seen Beany, and I'm going to bewitch it with a never-ending Refilling Charm. You will never run out of Butterbeer again, and no one, not even Dumbledore will be able to take it from you.”

Lockhart spewed his psychopathic lies, and at the end he had Beany smiling, dreaming of the never ending supply of her favorite drink. How easy it was to took another addict, especially one of such sub-human intelligence. Sure, he had never cast a successful Refilling Charm in his life (“I could refill the Atlantic if he tried!”), but if all went to plan, he'd never have to.

Lockhart never intended to let Potter carry on with his heroic glory-baiting. He came to this school to highlight to the world that Potter was just a plain old boy, and how better to show this by putting Potter in his shadow. It was he, Gilderoy, who was chosen as the right hand and confidante of Albus Dumbledore, and it was he who would be chosen next to lead this school. After a year of accomplishments and fame, he would deny the begging professors and students his continued work at Hogwarts, and retire as a teacher until “a new Headmaster is needed”. If it wasn't so politically incorrect to even complain about the old man...

Lockhart's thought strayed maddeningly as he waited in silence for Beany to return. He looked over the 42 forged letters from Harry Potter he had painstakingly wrote without magic. The letters were backdated to the beginning of Harry's first year at Hogwarts. They began as fan mail, something like an obsessive teenage girl (of which there were many). The letters he had forged and dated throughout this year would paint Potter to develop an obsession, a longing, an anger he didn't get more attention. These were the genius of the plan. The public would not only accept the story that Potter had snapped, they would hear what he tried to do to Gilderoy Lockhart, they would read the letters claiming Lockhart was stealing the boys fame, and the would turn on him quicker than a niffler in a gold mine. And then the names would come. Lockhart dreamed of the newspaper articles. The Boy Who Lived? If things went his way, it would be The Boy Who Killed.

Beany had waited, invisible, until all of the Second Year Gryffindors could be heard snoring. Being a house elf was hard. She knew what was right and wrong. She had a conscience. She's heard stories about house elves that tried to act on their conscience, disobeying an order or trying to run away. But the ancient magical bondage was just too strong. The agreement between the elves and the wizard for protection during the Great Wizarding War likely allowed her race to survive, but at what cost? A sharp pain shot through her every nerve. The bonding was strong, just by thinking these treasonous thoughts she was disobeying her masters. As she crept towards young Harry Potters bed and pulled the wand off the nightstand from her tippy toes, a thought crossed her mind. As a disgraced but employed teacher at Hogwarts, she was bound to answer to the icky Lockhart. But the was no master, no master who could overrule Albus Dumbledore at this school. She was forbidden from informing him of the plan, but she was not forbidden from getting his attention, indirectly if she had to. Her mind began reeling, and she noticed that the sharp infliction of nerve pain ceased, as if the laws of magic realized this little loophole just as Beany had.

...unfinished!


** I love this. The title was intriguing, but what really won me over was how dark and twisted it became. I need more.

** I never knew I needed this until now, Lockhart never seemed like a master manipulator to me, sure he specialised in memory charms but still, but you've made me believe that he is much darker than what he seems to be (almost comic relief) and its intriguing. Please give us more!

** To respond to your edit, obviously the only reasonable conclusion is to finish the entire story through Year 7 or the defeat of Voldemort, seeing out the conclusion of your alternate reality. :P

Really, though, I'd love to see what you had in mind for what Beany does, whether or not Lockhart gets caught, and how it changes things. Even if it's just a story of how he gets away with it, but it lets Voldy win because there's no one to stop him.
