Every now and then I read a post-7th book fic that has some good points, but then misses the boat in other areas. What kinds of things should people include but don't think about? What do you typically imagine would happen? I imagine these things;

*Hermione would return to finish 7th year. Ron would only do it if Harry did.

*The castle would probably be under construction and certain classrooms--possibly even entire houses--would have to be moved elsewhere temporarily

*The school would experience a decreased enrollment of Slytherin students. After their blanket banishment during the battle and bad press from Voldemort's followers, I think a lot of parents would question whether they could count on fair treatment for their kids in an environment with fresh hurt. Probably a lot would be sent to Durmstrang and Beauxbaton.

*Narcissa Malfoy would suddenly be wielding the power in their family, as the only one without direct implication with the Death Eaters. Draco would probably be sent to Azkaban along with the rest of the surviving D.E., then soon moved to a maximum security wizarding prison. I like to imagine Narcissa'd pull strings to get him re-enrolled in Hogwarts for his 7th year. It would be very important for his image and trial that he's portrayed as an innocent schoolboy who was forced into something he didn't fully understand.

*George Weasley would probably have some kind of depression that either blows up into something serious or just looks all around scary.

I'm pretty clueless about the political environment and other things. What stuff do you guys like to imagine?


** The only thing I prefer reading is Harry /not/ choosing to be an Auror.

"Fuck it, I'm done with fighting Dark Arts. One Dark Lord is enough for a lifetime."

Then he goes back to Hogwarts (or Beauxbatons because Hogwarts is full of bad memories at that point), finishes his schooling and becomes something either adventurous (but in a good sense) like an explorer, or he settles down with something calmer but still along his alley, like Healer.

**** I don't like him going back to Hogwarts because whenever I've read fics that do that, it rarely comes across as natural. Even in fics, Harry back at Hogwarts seems off.

But I do like him maybe doing quidditch. I know in canon he becomes an Auror, but I never loved that he did so. It's like, all these people fought and died in part to keep you alive, and now that you won, let's keep putting yourself in danger.

Along those lines, even though it sorta goes against her character, I like fics where Ginny doesn't like him being an auror. Because realistically, yeah that totally sucks for Ginny.

*** Harry a healer? - Come on the guy (in canon) doesn't have the patience to learn a profession like that (and you got to admit: He is kind of a thrill seeker, as it's not always the danger seeks him out - he quite often does so himself and you also can't deny that he kind of feels at home when he's in danger (he'd rather put himself there than let anybody else face it - even if they should and are responsible for said danger in the first place, like Dumbledore was for Voldemort's rise! I mean Dumbledore could have shown Tom Riddle some compassion and could have looked into alternate living arrangements for the summer for example, but then again: Dumbledore doesn't care about people, he uses them like pawns!))

I could imagine him playing professional quidditch for a while (if he truly feels like he's done fighting dark wizards - not that his "saving people thing" would let him stop fighting forever, especially if there's still deatheaters at large or something), hell I could also imagine him working for the DOM (why? To look into the veil and the death of Sirius Black)...but a healer? Not canon Harry, sorry :( (Hermione would be better suited, but then again I kind of imagine her as a lawyer or something with her strict adherence to the rules etc.)

**** I'm not quite sure what to make of your argument.

You tell me Harry hasn't enough patience to become a healer, but end with saying he could work as an Unspeakable? That's like saying "he's too lazy to be a doctor, but nuclear physicist working on experimental fission technology seems reasonable". All we know of the Unspeakables is that they work on the frontiers of magic research. We can deduce from what we saw in the books that they research Death, Time and Fate plus some other weird stuff. If Healing, a thoroughly researched and documented profession, goes over Harry's head, anything the Unspeakables do will too.

Harry never had the patience to learn something he didn't care about. On the other side, once he made his mind up about it, he was only second to Hermione in mastering something, and far beyond her if it was anything Defense related. Plus, his grades were good, he got 7 OWL's, most of them E, with one A and one O. If, as a fanfiction author, you give him the motivation to learn to be a Healer, Harry is easily able to do it. He could cast a Patronus in third year because he set his mind to it, I dare say it won't be a problem for him to learn all that is needed to be a healer if he tackles it with the same determination.

Yes, he is a thrill seeker. Yet, after the war he settled down and got enough calm in his life to lead a successful marriage with three kids. Maybe fighting a war was enough thrill for him? Maybe he rather indulges his "saving people thing" while letting the bloodshed be a thing of the past? The argument is not that far out there, as far as I'm concerned.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore doesn't care about people, he uses them like pawns
#+end_quote

Complete and utter fanon. Dumbledore does care, he's just not infallible. Most of his mistakes are made because he cares and the others because he found himself in a tough spot with only the lesser evil to choose. Also, Tom Riddle was not his responsibility. Dumbledore was just the professor inviting the muggleborn students to Hogwarts. Beyond that he had no responsibility towards Tom other than teach him Transfiguration. Could Voldemort's reign have been prevented with a more compassionate approach to his upbringing? Maybe. Was it Dumbledore's fault alone? Absolutely not.

#+begin_quote
  Not canon Harry, sorry :(

I never got why people write "sorry" behind their argument. It's not like you just ruthlessly destroyed my vision of a Healer Harry. And even if you did, if you feel sorry about it don't post in the first place.

***** He could because of Sirius (if he believed that he could rescue him, it gives him the focus - just like missing out of Quidditch gave him the focus and drive to learn the Patronus!) - otherwise? I'd agree with you!

Successful...sorry, but I don't consider him and Ginny successful...Harry is doing a job he already did, the only difference being that he's now payed to do it - downside: He has to obey a crappy ministry bureaucracy and wizengamot (the minister after Kingsley might be worse than Fudge after all!)...he also is not realizing his full potential, sadly he never found something (magical!) he's passionate about and sadly he didn't even go into professional quidditch :( (hell, Weasley is our King did, didn't he? Coach for the Cannons, was it?)...IMHO he's got the live I'd consider a nightmare, he's a cop (not a job I'd like...I am thankful some people want to do it, but I wouldn't want to!), he's got family and he's kind of stuck because he can't leave even if he wanted to (now NEWTS!)

No, if Dumbledore cared he'd not given Harry to the Dursleys it's not like a Fidelius wouldn't have provided a much better protection without the neglect (even abuse, I mean Petunia tried hitting him with a frying pan for fuck's sake!) and he would have shared his info with the order (after having them submit to veritaserum, to route out any leaks!)...kids chasing after horcruxes was a damned stupid idea, also: He'd have trained Harry (I mean canon Harry can barely take on a weak low ranking deatheater in canon, every inner circle member would cut him to pieces in a fair fight!)

He would also not have allowed Umbridge into Hogwarts (or he'd have made her VANISH after learning about her torturing students - I don't buy that he didn't know, hell McGonagall knew and she had the gall to tell Harry "keep your head down" -.-)

I do, because I don't want to offend (people to easily take offense these days if opinions don't fit their own!)

****** As I said, it all depends on how you write it. Harry is able to do it all, but needs the drive to do it. Unspeakable, Healer, Curse Breaker, Minister of Magic, doesn't matter, he could if he wanted it.

#+begin_quote
  IMHO he's got the live I'd consider a nightmare
#+end_quote

And there we have it. It is the life */you/* would consider a nightmare and you bolster this argument up with a hell of a lot assumptions. For all we know the new Ministry could be an utopia. Though all we know is that Harry is a good Auror and got as close to what he once saw in the Mirror of Erised as he could get. He got a family, a huge one at that. He got a loving wife and three children and some great in-laws who basically consider him a son.

Sure, the placement with the Dursleys was, if anything, a lesser evil. Dumbledore even admitted that he knew Harry wouldn't be happy there. Though Dumbledore also knew that the Blood Protection acquired there upped Harry's chances of survival tremendously. A Fidelius is nice and all, but it wouldn't burn Quirrels face off. Instead you'd have a dead Harry in the third floor. For example. (And don't get on with some conspiracy theory about Dumbledore wanting to test Harry with that. It was a children's book. Of course the protagonist would best the tests. For all we know those were merely a distraction for the true test that is the mirror which had an ingenious protection in it, only destroyed by Harry's arrival).

What you do, and that is something I see in almost every fandom, is to judge a character by the decisions of the author. Yes, letting Harry, Hermione and Ron chase the Horcruxes alone was stupid. But in the end that is Rowling's decision. She wrote that convoluted plan, devised by a character she tried to portray as this uber-mage of wisdom and ingenuity.

Furthermore, no he should not have given access to this information to the Order. That is an immediate "T" on your military strategy 101 exam. Giving out the information that there are Horcruxes or just "important artifacts" of Voldemort that have to be chased down is like asking for the plan to fail. Remember, they have all been interrogated. Had there been even one whisper of the fact that they were chasing "important artifacts", Voldemort had immediately known whats up. The information of the Horcruxes are Dumbledore's nuclear codes, his Area 51 confidential files, his world leader assassination plans. The need to know basis is between the general and the operatives, full stop. Any more people in the know and you invite leaks like honey invites bees. The only alteration that would have made sense is to make the team bigger; add some actual beef to that mission by assigning Tonks, Kingsley, Fleur or anyone with NEWTS, really. But that is once more an author decision for the sake of the story.

Umbridge may have been a political impossibility. We don't know if there are even laws against physical punishment. There are some against the Cruciatus and had she actually used it, maybe she would have ended up in Azkaban during HBP? But we have been informed that actual torture was a means of punishment within Filch's time as a keeper. Blood-Quills aren't a big leap from that. For all we know, physical punishment is only frowned upon, not actually forbidden? Dumbledore, for all we know, could have seen himself surrounded by the political play of Fudge and Lucius and may have been helpless against Umbridge. Making her vanish would have only ended up being his fault anyway, and Harry's if the Minister could've managed to twist it that way (and isn't that an interesting premise for an AzkabanPrisoner!Harry fic?). McGonagall... well, she got the short straw as the bad, useless adult in the children's story. Of course Harry had to overcome the challenge on his own, otherwise the story wouldn't be called "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" but "Hogwarts Staff and the Intricacies of Politics". Doesn't make for a good title, nor a good story.

And concerning the "sorry". It does nothing to lessen offense. It infuriates me, even, as it sounds very condescending.

** As someone who generally focuses on the Harry/Ginny pairing, my ideal post battle fic would focus on them. A lot of people disagree that they would encounter any serious issues based on what's canon, but I like to see them go through relationship drama before winding up firmly together in the end.

- I don't need to see angsty Harry to the point that he is incapacitated by his guilt/grief. But I do want him to experience some of that.

- I do like it when, at least at first, Ginny is a bit angry. Maybe at Harry, but just angry in general for losing Fred, being kept out of the battle, thinking Harry was dead, and going through a year with the Carrows. A lot of people disagree with me on this. But I think Ginny had a right to be pissed off or upset at anyone and everyone.

- George needs to be a wreck, not to the point that it takes up most of the story. But canonically, it happened.

- Harry becomes an Auror pretty soon after the battle. The war isn't over, after all. I hate when they have him go back to school.

- In general, I want a post-battle fic to stick to canon from what Rowling said. Little changes are fine, but Harry and Ron dont go back to school, Ginny becomes a Harpy, etc.

- I loved a story I read where the press hounded the couple, which caused issues. Very realistic to what would have happened.

- I like a political subplot of Kingsley trying to reshape the Ministry

- I want Harry and Ginny to struggle at first to figure out how to start a relationship when there is so much grief surrounding them, get it right and work well together, but then go through issues when separated via school/Auror training. Even the best couples would have issues in a long-distance relationship (yes I know with apparating it wouldn't have to be long distance, but I'm good with a writer making it so they can't see each other much). And both Harry and Ginny are two of the most desired people in the wizarding world so I like the dynamic of them being hit on, and perhaps the other person getting jealous.

- I don't mind a Death Eater subplot, but I'd prefer it not be the main story. We just had that with the actual series. My ideal fic for after is about character development.

- Even if Harry and Ginny break up, I'd prefer them not to actually date anyone else seriously. Perhaps a date here or there to try to move on.

- One of my favorite fics in this genre had Neville become a bit of a stalker/creepy guy towards Ginny and for some reason I loved this, even though it likely is OOC for him. I just think the fandom loves Neville so much, and I never liked him as much, so to see him taken down a peg was fine by me.

- Along that note, a subplot where Harry realizes Ginny got very close with Neville and Luna and other DA members during that year is good and realistic. What they must've gone through would conceivably make them as close as Harry, Ron and Hermione. How would Harry accept this dynamic where Ginny is very close to Neville?

- I want Dean back at school hitting on Ginny. I know, I know. He is Harry's friend and Harry saved him in DH. But that's gotta be a weird dynamic.

*** Harry/Ginny bores me to tears, but it there was a story like the one you described, I'd probably read it if it were heavy on the angst lol. I'd definitely read it if they end up with other people! :p

Not being familiar with that corner of fandom, it surprises me to hear there isn't a fic like this out there already. To me it always went without saying that their relationship would be majorly tested post-Deathly Hallows for many of the reasons you mentioned.

I love Neville but I don't think it would be out of character for him to become stalkerish if written properly. If underdeveloped, his kind of personality has the tendency to do that IMO.

Second from last subplot about the "second Trio" is a great one I've always thought about as well. I wish there was a fic exploring that!

Being an auror isn't about just being good at DADA, it also involves Transfiguration and Potions, and presumably you need a full 7 years of schooling, plus auror training. But the war is still going on so I'm sure they worked out some hybrid 7th year/auror training program.

Well, if the DEs surrendered (their master is truly dead now after all) then there would be no need for Harry to become an auror (also: Why would he want to work for a ministry that ruined his life time and time again? A ministry that doesn't seem to change (the Malfoys getting a free pass for example...those guys, including Narcissa (aiding and abetting a known terrorist!), should be in prison for a long long time! Hell, without dementors Azkaban is too good for them IMHO!) much...sure Hermione gets her houself laws, but then again she's a war heroine, so she's got some clout now, still a lot of Slytherin students seem to get off too easy! Note: Don't chalk this up to "society needs to heal, so pardons are ok" - not when serious crimes, like torture, murder etc. have been commited and when the purebloods don't seem to have changed their minds!)

Well, I would want H/G in the first place (that couple never made any sense IMHO...Harry hates his fame and Ginny is fangirl number one worshipping at the altar of the boy who lived! Makes no freaking sense what so ever!)

Reshaping the ministry - looks more like trying and failing (on the larger issues) in canon :( (note: I've never read the crapilogue...couldn't even finish the last book, it's IMHO the worst in the series, especially because Rowling demolishes Harry, her hero, because she makes him out to be a bumbling fool - all talk and no real plans! Without Hermione he would be dead in a fucking day...this kind of seems like the male version of a damsel in distress :( This book should be called "The "great" Hermione Granger and the Deathly Hollows")

Rehashing canon is boring - I love Rowlings world, but I think she didn't use that world's full potential (I know fanfictions that are IMHO better than canon)

I'd think that Harry should go back to school (him not doing so proves Snape right in a way, because he accepts favouritism ("Here, join the Aurors and because you are Harry Potter we'll hand-wave the fact that you'd need NEWTs, especially that OUSTANDING in POTIONS!")...hell, isn't that something Harry hates about Draco Fucking "If my father hears about this" Malfoy and also about the Slytherins with Snape?)...also because it limits his options if he doesn't want to be an auror anymore (his fame might wane in the decades to come - people tend to forget bad times after all - so banking on that is a crappy idea!), who'd hire him without NEWTs? (He can join WWW, but that's a cop-out IMHO!)

Struggle? I want a breakup :) (but that's just me, as I've already stated: That couple stopped making sense once I critically examined it! Harry/Hermione makes more sense (if both of them mature a little)...then again I also can't wrap my hand around Hermione/Ron - what could someone with drive and ambition see in that underachiever (who IMHO is also a bad friend - see: Goblet of Fire!), who's got no drive what so ever!)

Neville was supposed with Hannah fairly early on, and he went into auror force with Harry and Ron.

I think there would be multiple stalkers/fanboys and even fangirls going after Ginny at Hogwarts.

Aurors were severely depleted after the War, so I imagine fresh Hogwarts graduates dominating the force, and creating frictions with the old guard.
