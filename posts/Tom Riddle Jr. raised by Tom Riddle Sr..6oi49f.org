Like the title is there any fic where after his mother death Tom Riddle Jr. Is raised by Tom Riddle Sr.? (I mean an happy childhood, that those doesn't make him hate muggles, he shouldn't grow up to be Voldemort, but if well done is fine anyway.)

Random example:

The orphanage were Tom Jr. Is manages to find and contact Tom Sr. And he is something like " although his mother was crazy, he still is my son, it's not his sin, he shouldn't be punished with an orphanage childhood"


** SPOILERS, but in the "for want of a nail" AU linkffn(Murder Most Horrid), we think we're looking at a Voldemort-less universe until an inconsequential chapter near the middle, where the characters encounter a somwhat clumsy, awkward server by the name of Tom Riddle. After he makes a mess by spilling a drink, Hermione says it's her fault, only for Riddle to insist on taking the whole blame, answering that his father used to say one should always pay the consequences of their mistakes rather than blaming it on others --- hinting this version of Riddle Sr. decided to raise Merope's child even after he stopped taking the love potion, out of ethical duty.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** I could totally see this launching into a Tom Riddle fights for Muggleborns story. Using his influence on his dad's side as a wealthy landowner and influence with teachers he charms at Hogwarts to still takeover the country, in a far less violent manner.

Tbh though, the Riddle family seems to be one filled with asshats, and also the type to totally sweep an illegitimate child under the rug

**** Or maybe if they need an heir to the family and Tom Sr can't (or won't) produce one?
