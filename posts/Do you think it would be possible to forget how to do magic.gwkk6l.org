The title's kinda weird, but I can't really explain it otherwise in the same amount of words. Sorry.

Basically, do you guys think it'd be possible to repress your magic so hard that you'd basically not be able cast spells as well as before? Not an Obscurial - those are based in more outside forces, and this would be more inward. Just kinda curious, sorry if it's a stupid question.


** Yes, According to Rowling thats what happened to Lockhart.

#+begin_quote
  By the time that he arrived at school, Lockhart's magical skills (once rather good) had become rusty almost beyond repair. The only spell for which he had real ability was the Memory Charm, which he had been using repeatedly for years. His classes quickly became a charade, as he was revealed to be completely inept at everything in which he claimed, in his books, to be expert.

** I don't know why not. You wouldn't even have to repress it, just stop doing certain spells.

I mean, I can't do integrals any more, or rig up a fishing line, because I haven't done either in literally decades.

** It does open an interesting question about wizards and if they can get dementia.

*** I think JKR mentioned that wizards are susceptible to muggle diseases, but they aren't as bad and can usually be treated. So maybe? But it doesn't affect them as much?

** To forget how to do magic altogether would be difficult, perhaps impossible. To forget various spells should be very easy
