I think Rowling should have killed Mr. Weasley in 5th year like she had original planned.

Now don't get me wrong, I love the guy, But I feel like Ron really needed something like this to grow as a character.

What do you think?


** Killing arthur would have allowed remus to live, and as much as i love arthur, i love remus more, and it would have been nice for him to finally have some happiness. That said- i wouldnt wish the death of a parent on any child, but yeah, ron would have had some turmoil to his character. Legit turmoil, not "my best mate is famous and i'm his sidekick" turmoil. I dont know if it would have made him a more sympatheric character, or if it would have sent him off the deep end, though.

*** Why exactly do you love Lupin? I mean, he failed Harry, he avoided contact and he did nothing to help Harry. Even Sirius showed up in Hogwarts during the tournament and he faced summary execution. The Patronus lessons with the boggart were shite because Lupin knew that Harry could not perform the spell and yet he released the fake dementor. And he was a dick to Tonks, followed by being a shitty husband and running away. Any marriage vow includes "in good and in bad times". That is not something that you shrug off, that kind of behaviour destroys trust and take years to heal.

I mean, I get it, Lupin had a shitty childhood but almost everyone besides the Weasleys has a tragic backstory.

**** Mrs. Weasley kinda has one, her two brothers...

There's a lot of Lupin hate out there, but I think he really strikes a chord with people suffering from anxiety and depression. He's standoffish with everyone because he doesn't truly believe that anyone can actually like him or want him around. He literally sees himself as making everyone's life worse just by existing. He's not exactly a resilient soul, and he doesn't reach out, but he has his good qualities if you get to know him.

***** This is a good point about Lupin. He has no self-esteem, is most likely depressed, and yet he still tries to protect others. He's not particularly effective, but he tries so hard and has so much more to overcome than other characters.

I genuinely adore Lupin. He has his faults, but I think anyone facing his difficulties would show much worse ones.

***** Honestly, I think part of the reason I love Lupin is that he was a.) At least kind of competent, and b.) The only one of the Marauders whose failures are due to inaction rather than action.

Lupin was the only one from that group that wasn't at least at one point a huge asshole. And he was also the only one who actually cared all that much about random students, etc. Snape, Lockhart, Slughorn... they all kind of let their bullshit get in the way of being a good professor. Lupin didn't. He tried to move past the bullshit of their youth, and I think he was pretty successful.

He's not a great heroic protagonist type, sure (though I do love when he's a protagonist), but... he is the kind of person I would want as a friend and as a teacher. I love Sirius, but if he were real I would probably avoid him because he may well have a neon sign saying "we will have fun but after that /you will be in trouble/". He's the kind of person whose life story it is probably better to hear than participate in (at least for me). Pettigrew is an asshole, James was basically another Sirius until the last year of Hogwarts, and by then when he was more "adult" and mature... he still never sought to atone for being a huge bully for years.

**** My guess is, it was Harrys eagerness about learning the Patronus. Harry told Lupin about the Dementors effects on him. Maybe Lupin saw James eagerness in Harry and knew that he couldnt talk him out of it. As for Sirius, he would still be in Azkaban in Year 4 and maybe further, because the only reason for him to break out was that he recognized Wormtail on a Photograph in the Newspapers

**** Marriage might be a crappy deal IMHO, but if you do get married then you better keep your end of the bargain!

Also: If your best friend dies then you should have the common decency to look after his kid a bit (if you can't get custody or don't want to then you should at least periodically check up on the kid!)

So yeah, I agree with you in Lupin! I liked him at first, but once I started thinking that quickly stopped and that was before he turned out to be a damned coward!

Lupin is too used to run from his problems. He's quite the shitty Gryffindor, because he isn't very brave (IMHO he, like Hermione, should have sorted into Ravenclaw!) - only Peter Pettigrew is worse!

The mandrakes are probably deadlier than mortar fire and can, on their own, completely stop an assault. They had hundreds of melee droids capable of slaughtering their enemies with complete disregard for their safety. A conscript could have directed the battle and won without even finishing basic training.

Then again, Voldemort's leadership skills are just as bad.

****** I think that was more jkr's writing more than anything. Harry was the pov character so he couldn't be too competent otherwise characters like Hermione would have become obsolete. There's also the fact that Harry had to be ignorant so that other characters could explain things to him, which in turn explained things to the reader. Honestly the one thing I didn't like about the Harry Potter books was that jkr made her main and supporting characters incompetent when she wanted to create conflict, rather than making the villains a bit more competent so the protagonists don't have to be written OOC.

#+end_quote

The easy and better way to handle that would be to have Harry/Hermione explain it TO someone who isn't the POV character. That way readers still get the info, but the hero/pov/protagonist doesn't need to be incompetent.\\
Yeah, not really doable with the cannon trio, either Ron or Hermione would need to be changed/replaced, but that'd be a small price to pay for not making the protagonist a dumbass.\\
Obviously the one being explained to would need to be a muggleborn/raised. Not because muggleborns are less intelligent, but because the readers need explanations to things that even Crabb and Goyle would already know from their childhood.

The character being explained wouldn't even have to be that important plot wise, just a tag along that the others are fond of enough that they don't mind explaining things. Personally I think Ron could have taken the role quite well if he wasn't wizard born. I'd probably swap out Ron/Hermione, with a competent!Harry and wizardborn!Hermione explaining things to muggleborn!Ron.\\
Hermione doesn't need to become obsolete, she still has a lot of background and culture that the other two don't, she's smart, etc. There's a lot of ways to be smart that DON'T focus on "How do I kill that guy?".

The Floo thing wasnt explained in Book 1, despite the fact, that the Pupils would surely talk about this during a Year. But as an Author you want to avoid confusing or "flooding" the (Child) Reader with so much information right at the Beginning. And as we learn in Book 5, The Twins are developing Items on their own, completely new in the Magical world.

** I think Rowling should've been much harder with her characters. I think I remember her saying in an interview that she hated killing off characters because she grew so attached to them. But you know - maim, cripple, scar, burn,... There are many ways to beat a character.

Killing Arthur would've been a massive shift for Ron and the entire Weasley family. Before you even go into the emotional and family-structure nit-and-grit there is the fact that he was the breadwinner. Without him the Weasleys are 100% bankrupt. But of course more important is the effect this would have on the kids, especially Ron. I think there was this rift between Harry and his two best friends where he realized "this is war", but Ron and Hermione, blissfully ignorant of the true horror of facing Voldemort, still remain very in the moment of their schooling, their love life and their teenage problems. Which is great for the reader in the original series. In canon they serve as this anchor to what teenage life should be. Broken hearts and awkward feelings and searching for belonging and your place in the world. With Arthur dead, Ron would've been brutally brought into the harsh truth of the world of civil war they live in.

Hermione would've remained as the one hurt, but relatively untouched by the war. But Hermione was always more the one to focus up on something beyond school work as per her character. Ron is the reference point. Harry is the executing character. Hermione is the solution delivery system. So with Ron in code red warmode, our reference point completely shifts towards a state of conflict one and a half books early.

I would imagine that the following storyline would be much darker and of course completely different. Just a few things I could see happening:

- Sirius doesn't die. The Battle in the Ministry either doesn't happen at all or differently. With Arthur dead the stakes of guarding the Hall are much higher.

- Draco is being actively investigated by the trio. Ron having his mind on war would probably make him more suspicious of Draco. Suddenly Malfoy being in Burke's is enemy movement, not just dark family doing dark family stuff. Hermione, being faced with both of her friends defending that suspicion caves in and helps. As a consequence Snape would have to either think of a workaround, or die.

- Maybe Ron never leaves the trio in the forest. His greatest fear won't be Harry and Hermione getting together and his jealousy wouldn't lead to him lashing out at Harry. He may lash out because of something else - maybe the lack of progress - but not because of his jealousies.

** When you do terrible things to a character, you can leave them alive. Arthur Weasley spending the better part of a year in St Mungo's, losing a limb, and suffering enough nerve damage to have trouble with wand movements, for instance. It only takes a few extra seconds to think of. It leaves another character around to have interactions with. It gives Arthur the chance for other character arcs. And it still galvanizes the Weasleys.

** I'm glad she didn't. Harry needed the Weasleys to be the happy family in his life, the thing he could look forward to. Ron provided much-needed levity. If Ron loses his dad, the whole series takes on a much darker and depressing tone. Same with Ginny. Perhaps Harry doesn't fall for her because her fun personality doesn't come through that 6th year.

Though, it would be interesting to see Harry using Arthur's death to distance himself from everyone. Seeing the Weasley family destroyed like that would cause this, in my opinion.
