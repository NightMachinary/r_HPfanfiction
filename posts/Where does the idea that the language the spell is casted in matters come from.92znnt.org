I've seen it many times, but what actually drives the idea that a spell cast in x language can only be undone in x language? Can someone explain the logic behind it?

I read Again and Again by Athey and they used the whole it was cast in parsel so only Harry and Voldemort could undo it. I really enjoyed the fic, but this has been bothering me because every thing else was so good.


** I know its been around since before HBP came out. Its dubiously supported by the fact that some spells are almost direct paraphrases of 'latin,' while others are bastardizations of multiple languages or straight 'commands' even (ex. 'Point Me' or 'Pack').

Words, like wand movements or even wands themselves, are likely a crutch used to create a pattern in the minds of a caster. You associate the effect with certain characteristics, but those components are not actually necessary for the effect to occur. The idea is what matters, not the 'formula.'

*** I'd agree with this except for the wand bit. I'd like to think that wands help magic by making it easier due to the magical core. Like sure you can cast without a wand but it is a lot more effort. Tools are what built modern society, I'd think magic would be the same.

**** That's what Xesh was saying. Wands make casting magic easier.

***** Ah I misread. Sorry I got it as they were not necessary. I...dislike those fics, since they usually have a over the top God!Harry.

** I've never seen this. Presumably wizards who speak other languages (especially non-Romance languages) can perform the same spells so the idea seems odd. Maybe the Parseltongue thing makes sense but whatever.

That's the only place I've seen it as well, but I think those were mostly special spells that were created by parselmouths

**** And heaven forbid a non-parselmouth cast them, lest they be impossible to undo. In one fic, Helga and Rowena had been stoned on potion ingredient fumes, and managed to charm the stairs to move, casting in parseltongue and locked to the caster.

** To me the logic is simply that magic has always existed on Earth, and spells are invented in every language slowly over time. So there are super specific spells in every ancient language, and when a spell is super specific it requires a specific counter, which is normally also developed in the same language.

Like for example a spell that only changes granite into acid, you would need the exact counter or a way to neutralize the specific acid. You can't just finite it away since the chain reaction has already begun.

However a spell that can turn someones hair pink should be able to be easily beaten by a spell that returns how back to normal or dye it brown, never understood why the Weasleys prank spells are often claimed to be impossible to reverse for days or something.

So curses and super specific spells that you can't understand the exact mechanic of should require specific counters, and the counters are normally developed in the same time and region, and thus same language.

*** Most of the Weasley's pranks like that are based on potions, which in many cases seem to operate separate from wand magic.
