This scene is already filled with affection in canon and if these two were ever going to take their relationship a step further, this would be the most obvious moment. Do any stories like this exist?


** It's not quite what you're looking for, but if you'll forgive the self-plug this is a shortish one-shot where I reimagine DH as a Harmony...

*** Self-plug all you want. I just gave it a read and it was beautiful. Makes me less hesitant to start looking for fics on AO3.

** You know, I never thought about it as a possible divergence, yet it makes a lot more sense than countless other divergences out there.

Edit:

Most Harmony stories diverge way earlier (GoF mostly) or later (Post DH, those usually involve cheating or hidden babies).

*** I honestly think that for a lot of authors the scenes in the last book are simply too mature.

The medical tent, the ball, even HBP.... thats all something a teen can relate to.

The Horcrux hunt is a lot more subtle in its emotion regarding love and relationships, with the one exception of Ron's Horcrux-intensified bout of jealousy. Suddenly there is a bit of grey-zone to it and I don't think a lot of authors who want to write a H/Hr story for the relationship only would know how to deal with that, let alone identify the scenes as the scenes with the most emotional depth.

** It's honestly a criminally underused moment for Harmony divergence. If they're waiting for DH, most authors will have it happen in the tent around the time Ron leaves, which makes perfect sense, but I see your point that this scene is so tender that it would work perfectly as well.\\
Unfortunately, only two stories come to mind off the top of my head, and I can't remember the title or author to either of them. The first involves Harry and Hermione meeting a literal angel in the graveyard scene who basically drops a lot of plot and kind of forces their romantic awakening, also giving an easy out for Voldemort's defeat. It ends with him instructing them to go get married at the nearby church because, as an angel, there's no way he's letting them go do what he *knows* they will do now that they're aware of each other's feelings and are confined to a small tent by themselves without being married, first.

The second is less romantic and involves Harry and Hermione getting married in the church when they go inside only to discover it's a service for older people who wanted to get married officially but never had the money or something. They're sort of peer-pressured into it all but they take their vows as an affirmation of how important they are to one another, though they don't think of it as necessarily romantic at the time. It causes some issues later at Ron and Hermione's wedding.

Hope someone else can think of some good fics with this idea or even take it as a prompt and write it themselves. It's a beautiful concept.
