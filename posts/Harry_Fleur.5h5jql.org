Anyone come across any decent Harry/Fleur lately? I've looked thru most of the longer stuff and it's not that great... I'd prefer completed stories, but shorter ones that are not abandoned yet are fine too... I just really feel like reading this pairing. I would attempt to write one myself but I wouldn't even know where to begin lol

Also I was wondering why so many other pairings, even Harry/Daphne (who only has like one line in the books) has a bunch of great fics with well-rounded characters, but Harry/Fleur is so lacking? She's in the books a lot and is canon-ly gorgeous, which JKR doesn't say about any other female character.


** People tend to like one-liner characters because they can plant their OC into a story without naming it an OC. Hence why Daphne & Co are so popular. We know some things about Fleur, so shes harder to write with a somewhat canon personality.

For recommendations:

This one is a rather new one that is still being written: linkffn(12048876) Its really new, as in, the prologue is just coming to an end. But it shows some promise.

This one I found interesting: linkffn(4152930) Its very AU, but has some great worldbuilding in it, a nice plot and a Romeo & Juliet kind of relationship between Harry and Fleur.

*** Thanks for the reccs I haven't read either of those yet.

I looked at One Step Foward first because it was the shortest of the two. I am very impressed. It's written well and it's different how Fleur's power is veela fire instead of the usual allure... I followed and I hope it is updated soon.

I will start on Perspicacity's story next. I find it interesting how you called their relationship like Romeo and Juliet. I can't wait to read it for myself...

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
