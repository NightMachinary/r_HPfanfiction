And preferably more than just "not a mary sue".


** Basically, why are they here. Is it just some character that the author added because as an expy of himself that would make cracks at the setting that everyone laughs at, or is the character actually important to the story. I have a list of fics that I assume that people have read, and Harry Potter and the Boy who Lived is one of those. Calypso, who is arguably the second-most important character in the story, is an OC, yet I can't imagine anyone complaining about her, because she serves as a source of exposition (natural-feeling exposition, even!) and helps further Harry as a character.

Of course, they should also be well-written, but that's not much help to say. But make sure that they have both good and bad sides. There is only one thing worse than reading about a perfect character, and that is seeing a character (OC or otherwise) constantly do stupid things, just to serve as a cheap source of drama.

** Character depth, personal conflicts, and an ability to stand independently of the Trio or canon characters while still maintaining depth and personality are some of the most important things to me.

** Imperfections. People we make ocs tend to make them perfect and unrealistic. Simply creating their flaw improves the character so much as long as the flaw is believable

** Not being a main character in the story, but still being necessary for some part of the story. I don't like OCs to take center stage; there are enough canon characters already. But if there's no purpose to their being there, then they shouldn't be there.

I dislike putting OCs into romantic/sexual relationships with canon characters, except the most minor of canon characters and only if the OC is also a very minor character, unless there's a /very/ good reason, especially. (I'm fine, e.g., with Goyle's girlfriend and Olivia in Blood Magic.)

** Most of the obvious answers about characterization were already posted, but here's something smaller that usually pisses me off...

Names. It's like fanfiction writers hardly think about naming. Too often you encounter writers that just throw off stupid names, either made-up ones that they think sound cool ('Rakesh'? 'Turais'? seriously?) or simply take some random name from the Greek mythology, and usually it sounds really bad and makes the character look laughable. Other times it's simply idiosyncratic names, like an English pure-blood named "Chad" or some such contemporary American name.

In my opinion, name is one of the most important things for a character, especially in the HP world where a lot of them seem to have some meaning. There's a reason Tom changed his name to Voldemort, after all. I'm not saying that a werewolf character must be named "Lupin", but it should somehow fit. The same goes for names of shops, books, and locations. Show a little imagination, people.

** I like them to be unoticeable.

No crazy personalities, people that wouldn't be out of place as background characters in the actual HP books.
