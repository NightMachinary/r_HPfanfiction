She accidentally runs into homunculus Voldemort who is now residing in imperiused Crouch's house and the two fall hopelessly in love. Once Voldemort returns to power, he has to deal with a jealous Bellatrix because now his most favorite Death Eater is a House Elf.


** I have always visualised Winky as a miniature Weasley in temperament, a redhead ... she will just go and tell Crouch what he needs to hear and =$DEITY= try to stop her! So, just the opposite, in her rage, while shouting at Crouch, she by mistake kicks the homunculus in the magical equivalent of the garbage disposal. That's the end of the feared Dark Lord by a lowly house-elf.
