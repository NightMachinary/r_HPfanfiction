#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

*** It's an extension of the overly competent children thing. You sort of have to suspend your disbelief, because otherwise the story wouldn't really work properly.

*** I lampshade it a bit in the epilogue of LdS. Mostly it happens because of plot.

But Hermione is a hard working and motivated girl who's pretty much devoted her life to her work since graduating. I don't picture the department to be that large and instead is more of an 'oversight committee' type deal so while she's the head of it, it's not a prestigious department to be the head of. But as a whole she's a brilliant young witch who's proven herself through effort and took a position that many people weren't lusting after. I have friends around her age in similar governmental positions so I didn't figure it was that hard to believe.

As for Harry, it's implied that Fudge was trying to rig the selection process for Percy. So there weren't really any actual candidates worth a damn except for Percy and Harry. Harry is younger than Percy, but has more actual experience in the field. Harry mostly gambled on the selection committee disliking the fact that Fudge was forcing their hand.

Harry is by no means the most qualified person for the job. He's just the one that waded (exploded) through the bullshit to take it.

**** Holy crap it's the author!

I just marathon'd your story, and just wow, it's one of the best I've read in quite some time.

Usually when someone swaps the gender of a main character, I'm wary of it, but your retake on the character was amazing and humanizing. I'm looking forward to the sequel.
