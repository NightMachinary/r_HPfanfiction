Basically, I'm looking for stories where Lockhart actually did do everything he claimed to do. Not one where's just a decent person, like in Oh God Not Again or When in Doubt Obliviate (which are both good stories, just not what I'm looking for at the moment) but ones where he really is the Wizarding Bruce Campbell he claims to be.


** I'd be very interested in reading one if any come up.

He hasn't done the things he claims, but Lockhart in linkffn(Harry Potter and The Prince of Slytherin) is an awesome character! Strong magically, has fascinating project groups, and involved in core plot at the current point of the story. It's ongoing, updates regularly and I think the next update (scheduled for today) should give us a better idea of what Lockhart's really up to.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.
