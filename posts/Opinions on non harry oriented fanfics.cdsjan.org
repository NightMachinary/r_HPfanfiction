Hey, I would like to get people's opinions on stories where Harry is not the main character and instead the main character is an OC. I am writing a fic that deals with the wizarding world after voldemort is defeated. thanks.


** I've been reading potter FanFiction for some time now, so I'm always in search of new stuff that's not quite mainstream. OC driven storys are therefore one of my guilty pleasures - especially if I get to see a new angle on the Wizarding world and culture (e.g “trivial” home life such as make-up or house hold chores but with a macical twist that somehow makes it new and exiting) or them interacting with lesser known side characters. And it's even better if there is some plot; to drive a story from an interesting read to an enchanting experience.

** Non-Harry is one thing, since there are lots of other interesting canon characters. OC as main character is something else. Lots of readers stay clear of OCs. I often give them a try, but too often they're cliche self-inserts, not true interesting OCs, so I click out.

*** Thanks for the input, ya I think alot of OCs in a community like this would turn out to be Gary Sue self inserts lol. But what if it is clear that the main character isn't and actually has flaws and a story arc? would you read something like that?

** The only non-Harry fics I've read were some humorous SI fics. There was this SI fic where SI's a sister of Vincent Crabbe. I do stick to Harry centric fics though.
