#+begin_quote
  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

  6/7th year fic. Harry decides he wants to do things his way, because Dumbledore's method of defeating Voldemort just doesn't appeal. He finds friends in unexpected places and embarks on a method of defeat in which he sometimes holds little hope. H/OFC.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts amidst an increasingly unstable political situation. And this year, for the first time, Hogwarts is no longer firmly under Albus Dumbledore's control. Threats inside and outside the school put pressure on some of Harry's closest friendships, and power struggles lie beneath the surface of every faction in the brewing conflict. At its center is the Potter family, and Harry's position is more critical, and more precarious, than ever.

*** It took Harry to find it, but once the location is known there is no information on the protection offered.

It can't be too fantastic, the school plumbing is connected. You might be able to blow open a wall and fly down the pipes.

The real benefit is that only Harry and Ron know the precise location, right down to the taps. Hermione learns later, and Voldermort wouldn't tell anyone. The slaying of the Basilisk wasn't common knowledge so he probably thinks it is still there.

Might even be one of the reasons he invaded Hogwarts.

  Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (slightly crack AU w/ some seriousness) MoD!Harry, kinda soulmates!TMRHP SLASH M/M
