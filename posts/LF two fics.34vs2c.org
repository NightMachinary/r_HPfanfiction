Hi! Ever since Checkmated got taken down, I've been trying to find two full versions of the following fics.

- The Price of Love by RogueSugah
- Hogwarts Pie by lavenderbrown

If anyone has a link to ebook versions of the full fics, I would greatly appreciate it!


** This one?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1496833/1/Hogwarts-Pie]]

And I have an epub version of The Price of Love. Send me a pm with your email or try making a request at the S.P.E.W. tumblr page, which is [[http://spew-rc.tumblr.com/]], for a pdf version.

Edit: I'll probably be busy for today. [[http://expirebox.com/download/06230f4d10dc18da65454f927d662eb6.html][Here's a link to to version of The Price of Love I saved from thequidditchpitch]]. The fanfiction.net one has mature content edited out.

*** Thanks very much! The site you linked to already had the full version of Price of Love, which is what I was looking for.

I think the version of Hogwarts Pie on FFNet is the censored version.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1914111/1/][The Price of Love is on FFN too]]. (Assuming that's the one. I've never read it but title and username match your request.)

**** Everything is pretty damn cool for a murderer that killed the radio star.

*** I think it might be an uncensored but different version to the one I read. I do recall it being different ... Thanks, anyways!
