Hi guys!! I was wondering if you have some other recommendations other than [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] which is the epitome of BAMF Harry/Sirius bromance. I'd really love to read a bar fight scene where those two idiots start everything and in the end the bar burns down. However, unlike other fics, I'd read one where Harry starts the fight and Sirius is the serious one and facepalms before dragging Harry out of there or joining the fight himself.

It doesn't need to be a comedy/crack. It can just be a normal fic where those two are just bamfing around like a cliche/trope without grammar mistakes.

Thanks a lot guys!!


** I can think of only Oh God Not Again. Though I can't remember specific details about the story, both Harry and Sirius both time travelled through the vile.

*** "Well, Sirius what are we going to do this summer?"

"The same thing we do every summer, Harry."

"Try to take over the world?"

"Too right!"

"That's it," said Remus. "You two are not allowed to be left alone ever."

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

*** In general, that story is good and I can recommend it. It's one of the most fun Peggy-Sues in the fandom.
