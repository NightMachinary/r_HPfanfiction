** At first my mind translated this as 'Looking for fics where Harry is a frightening, fire-breathing monster... or a girl, whichever.'

For the former:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5585493/1/Enter-the-Dragon][Enter the Dragon]] by Doghead Thirteen

Summary: It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

Crossover - Harry Potter & Shadowrun - Rated: T - English - Humor/Adventure - Chapters: 1 - Words: 41,653 - Reviews: 453 - Favs: 1,926 - Follows: 1,773 - Published: Dec 16, 2009 - Harry P.

** Well, if you want more words than you can shake a stick at then there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3302452/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Story-by-Dad][Harry Potter and the Story by Dad]] (amazingly imaginative name). It's an alternate Book 7 with H/Hr and Ron/OC.

I read another thing that had Harry as a dragon recently but for some reason my brain isn't on the right wavelength at all so I can't remember that it was called.

** [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=527][Dragon child]] /Harry Potter's Magic reacts to being so cold on the durlseys doorstep. interesting effects./ Only thing is that it is rather hard to reconise Harry as Harry. Mostly it's just an exuse to write a Mary-Sue-Dragon story under the pretense that it's a Harry Potter fanfiction. Still the first few chaptors will give you a good idea of whats to come.

** I just read Cold Blood by DerLaCroix. I can't link because I'm on mobile, but the gist of it is that Harry gets bitten by a basilisk, cried on by a pheonix, and gored by a dragon, and the result makes him... not human.

I think it's pretty good, I like it.
