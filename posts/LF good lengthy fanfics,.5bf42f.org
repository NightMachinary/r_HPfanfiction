I need good and legthy fanfics. I'm talking atleast 4+ books with 500k+ words each.

I'm taking all recommendations, just no major crossovers please. AU is welcome.

List of what I've read in the last while. Some on hiatus, but mostly completes.

EDIT: I dont understand bots. Trying in the comment-section. EDIT2: It's fine if the books are somewhat shorter, aslong as they're good.


** I'm currently in the middle of linkffn(Innocent). Series of several books and the last(?) one is in progress now. I'm enjoying it a great deal, but obviously I don't know whether that holds up.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061]]) And the sequel: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/836478/chapters/1593151]]) By far my favorite serie, with very realistic progression from the characters despite the very uncharacteristic development.

I'll sift through my list, I am also one for good, lengthy fic and will edit later.
