Yesterday I read: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6820445/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Phoenix-Burning]]

And the beginning (2 chapters) of the sequel.

I found them instantly captivating. I've spent quite a while today trying (and failing) to handle the search filters on Fanfiction and have come up with little that follows the premise of this story.

I understand that the pulsating, tumorous itch is unlikely to be 100% "scratchable", but I'd love some suggestions by you much more well read people than me.

Harry getting transported back to marauder days (preferably of the same age as his father or around that time)

I have looked up a couple of marauder fics and find them interesting, but the premise of future knowledge and secrets feels a lot more like throwing a spanner into the works and I do find it wonderfully attention-grabbing.

If I am being far too picky, I do apologize, and always, thank you for your assistance today :)

(Just throwing this out there, the "fight" scenes between Harry and Voldemort in the fanfic listed above were of a "Humble and Guardian" nature, rather than big and flashy. I love a Powerful Harry as much as the next person, but I find Harry with an ego to be a bit less stimulating. This isn't a necessity, only an extra "if you guys really are as awesome as I think you are")

Thanks for Reading, as always :)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4198643/1/Timely-Errors][Timely Errors]] might be of interest.

The first time I tried reading HP & The Phoenix Burning I was irritated at how weak Harry seemed. Supposedly he just beat V and then lets himself get pushed around by everyone. The second time I tried reading it I found it was better. Not perfect, but better than I thought. I remember being disappointed that the sequel is abandoned.

**** No problem. I'm always on the look-out for new stories too. Let us know if you find any interesting stories.

Actually, another one or two, with Harry going back to the Maurader days: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2538955/1/Time-to-Spare][Time to Spare]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delanda Est]]

**** I'm not aware that Timely Errors has a sequel. Phoenix Ashes (the sequel to Phoenix Burning) is abandoned.

***** thank you! just my brain not computing/comprehending like it should :P

just fyi 'Timely Errors Requiem/Ongoing' - A collection of moments missed from Timely Errors. No plot, but amusing. And I decided not to hide them away considering some people seem to like my time travel fic.
