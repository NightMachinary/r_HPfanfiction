So, I've been reading HP fanfiction for a while. I did read the books when I was younger and I'm re-reading them again since fanon has twisted my perceptions. Reading fics and searching for good fics and fics in genres I'm interested in, a plot bunny formed that I want to flesh out. Taking a page from [[/u/DeliSoupItExplodes][u/DeliSoupItExplodes]] and many other users, would people be interested in an FemHarry AU with adventure, sci-fi and and friendship genres? Relationships would be a part of it, but not until later and it wouldn't be the main focus of the story.

Here's the basic details:

- Slighty AU (Fem!Harry) up until Harry is five

- Upbringing is slightly different. Being a girl, Petunia was harsher on Harry than Vernon. Dudley treated her the same. Harry read books that Dudley didn't want and developed a love for reading.

- Harry makes a friend at Reception despite Dudley's best efforts, so she has a better view of muggles than in canon

- Said muggles are aware of the wizarding world due to their own secrets and help get Sirius a trial

- Sirius and Remus raise Harry from age six, starting her magical training early and school her in politics and such. They stay in the muggle world because of the blood protection at Privet Drive and because Harry wants to stay close to her friend.

- Harry has a slightly different personality due to her upbringing- she's more self confident and has a good sense of right and wrong. She asks questions and knows that adults have to earn trust. She doesn't take lessons and such too seriously because she's covered them at home before Hogwarts, so she alternates between slacking off with Ron and taking shortcuts so she can focus on more challenging pursuits.

- Hogwarts years stay semi canon. Harry befriends Ron and Hermione, defeats Quirrell, etc. Everything happens the same but different.

- After the events of Book 4 Harry reconsiders Hogwarts and after Christmas in book 5 decides to leave.

After this point it starts to get really AU so I won't spoil it too much but that's everything relevant. Thoughts, comments, questions?

If nothing significant changed, skip to year 4.

That must have been a really dark year if she's willing to leave her friends. Also, where does she leave to? Durmstrang? Probably not an option since Sirius would veto it, given his background. Beauxbatons? Possible. But why would they be better than Hogwarts? They took part in the whole tournament stupidity as well, after all.

I guess my question is: What is the plot? "Harry gets shit upon for a year until she finally leaves" isn't much of a plot - nor an original one. Where do you see the story breaking new grounds?

Nah, Harry will be shit on but that's not the main plot haha. After the events of year 3 Harry studies for OWLs and passes them a year early. The plot has to do with the graveyard events in book 4 which spawn Harry finding out more about her Evans background ( the Potter side was well covered by Sirius and Remus). It's tied into the sci-fi genre and with the muggle family she befriended.

**** If Harry passes her owls a year early, I guess Hermione, being smarter, does as well then. Would that strain their friendship with Ron? Or, how does that impact the plot? If it's just a "Oh, this Harry is more studious, so she's smart" thing, I'd suggest to drop it - it smells a little of "very special snowflake"-dom.

Also, what exactly is the main plot then? I feel a little confused if you ask if we're interested without actually laying out the planned plot. "It's tied into the SciFi genre" most certainly is something you should have mentioned in the OP.

** In my experience the Harry leaves Hogwarts stories are very hard to do well. When you are missing the backdrop of Hogwarts life most authors struggle bringing the story to live. The meat of the story seems to be how this changed Harry reacts to the events of fourth year, but it's a little hard to say based on that how interesting it will be.

Yeah I agree. White Angel of Auralon has some that do a fairly good job at it but it's a lot of summery and no dialogue, pretty much. I wanted to do something that averted that.

** My only advice: Stop rehash canon stations, even from Year 1.

There are enough fem!Harry fics that mindlessly rehash those, and I'm absolutely not interested.

Even before you begin Year 1, you have to make some major choices:

- Sirius free means people know Wormtail is guilty. I highly doubt Wormtail will hide as Scabbers at the Weasleys. He should have scampered off to find Voldemort. Could he have found Voldemort earlier? In the Books, Wormtail benefitted from the knowledge that Voldemort had been hiding in Albania before. In this AU, he has years to find the Dark Lord.
- How would the political landscape in magical Britain look like, considering Sirius is just as rich as Malfoy and knows all his own family's dirty tricks? Would Fudge even become the Minister?
- If Wormtail had found Voldemort earlier, even before fem!Harry started school, then what?
- On the other side, Sirius raising fem!Harry means they will get in touch with other Wizarding families. She should have known the Weasleys, the Tonkses, the Longbottoms, and the Boneses early on. In case of Weasleys, her best friend might very well be Ginny, not Ron. In case of Boneses, could Sirius have a relationship with Amelia, as many fics often alluded to? If Sirius hooks up with Amelia Bones, how would the balance of power in the Ministry and Wizengamot change?
- Will Sirius get 12 Grimmauld Place? Will the Curse Breakers he hires identify the Locket? What will happen to the Locket? What about Kreacher?

You see, the Wizarding could be a very different place before this fem!Harry even set her foot in Hogwarts.

**** Especially Wormtail scampering off is very likely. Just imagine Sirius and Remus bringing fem!Harry to the Weasleys, he's gonna run immediately.

But the question remains, will he be trying to find Voldemort or not? Because in canon, he knew that from Trio's actions in Year 1. In this case, he doesn't really know and the Dark Mark is very much faded considering Voldemort is still a very weak shade at this point. So my take is that Wormtail will try to hide outside Britain for the time being, but not seek out Voldemort.

With Voldemort not returning, Sirius out-bribing Malfoy in the Ministry, and fem!Harry making friends with other magical kids, those few years before the school could be really fun times for her.

Another plot point can come from Sirius's feud with Barty Crouch. Sirius has to obviously go after Crouch, hard. Will that affect the status of Crouch Jr? If he ever gets free, all hell can break loose. This guy is a total fanatic and very competent. But I prefer not, because then the plot becomes very destabilized and very hard to write.

***** Oof, writing this is going to be tougher than I thought. I want to keep everything familiar but then, that's the basis for 95% of fics out there. I think he'd run, because he's not going to risk staying in Britain with Sirius free and on the lookout.

Visiting other magical kids is a good plot point, but I was thinking of going for the Manipulative!Dumbledore trope and not having her visit them too much. He'd insist that the blood protection should be taken into consideration.

Excluding that, Sirius and Remus would probably be a bit overprotective of Harry (starting her training early and all) and have them stay in the muggle world until Hogwarts starts.

If you have Manipulative!Dumbledore, he's obviously going to sabotage freeing Sirius in the first place. No, I think that's a very bad idea and totally overused trope. I would rather raise Voldemort's competence level and thus the overall challenge. As for how to improve Voldemort from his dumbed down/idiot ball canon version, think about how you would have done in his place, such as:

- Do you really want to risk impersonating one of Dumbledore's oldest friends for up to a year? How about letting Jr impersonating his dad, a high ranking Ministry official who has access to both the Goblet and the Minister? Furthermore, nobody else knows Barty better than his son, so they couldn't even ask security questions! An added bonus, not that Voldemort knows, is that this scheme even gets to fool the Marauder's Map.
- Suppose you let Jr go ahead to impersonate Moody, what would happen if his jig was up? Dumbledore would know your hiding spot immediately! Do you honestly believe you could resist a raid led by Dumbledore himself in your weak homunculus body? And if Dumbledore ever gets to capture you, do you honestly believe that your Horcrux secret would stay safe from him?

--------------

I especially hate rehashing the CoS plot, because that either assumes Evil!Manipulative!GreaterGood!Dumbledore or Idiot!UselessAdults!PlotDevice!Dumbledore. Both options are bad. Let's just consider this:

1) Dumbledore was very certain that Hagrid was framed.

2) Dumbledore had to know the ghost of the murder victim, Myrtle Elisabeth Warren, was haunting that particular bathroom.

3) Dumbledore could ask only a few basic questions to identify the true culprit and the entrance to CoS:

#+begin_quote
  "Please tell me Miss Warren, what actually happened before you died?"

  "I heard a boy hissing near that sink, and I went there looking. Then I saw a pairs of big yellow eyes, and I just died."
#+end_quote

This is not some highly sophisticated detective work, this is the most basic common sense. I even heard excuses that because she haunted a girl's bathroom, men could not go in to investigate. LOL, I mean what a fucking moron and negligent shit head do you have to be if you let such triviality impede a MURDER INVESTIGATION?

4) Now if Dumbledore asked and Myrtle absolutely refused to talk, multiple times even, then the canon plot had a little bit more excuse. But not by much, because the monster was called the SLYTHERIN'S MONSTER. What was Slytherin's symbol? A snake. What was Slytherin's specialty? Parselmouth. What was the King of Snake? The Basilisk! And what killed people without trace? The Basilisk!

See, the all wise and super intelligent Albus Dumbledore should at least be able to make this almost basic logic deduction, right?

5) Therefore, if the Dumbledore you are writing is not of the Evil!Manipulative!GreaterGood type, you need to assume he knows it could be a Basilisk down there, and he would take immediate actions after the first attack, such as flooding the castle with roosters.

6) Finally, petrification in Basilisk attacks is the exception, not the norm. To get 5-6 petrifications is a chain of extremely lucky events and highly unlikely to repeat in an AU.

** First of all, write what you want.

Honestly I'd say just start in Year 4, when the story actually "starts," then refer to the background changes gradually/over time. You talk about "slight differences" a little too much for me to actually be interested in it as you've presented it right now. If you want adventure, how do you plan to keep it interesting in the buildup phase when you're incorporating so many fix-fic type elements? There are fics that can do this really well, but that's something that you really need to see in action.

** Well don't still call her Harry for a start, even if its short for Harriet.

There are way to many stories doing the first years canon compliant, not much point retelling the story again, unless you make significant changes to the 3rd floor corridor puzzles.

Being raised by 2 male wizards would make Harry drastically different to how she was in canon, play up the differences with how she reacts to the wizarding world and her self confidence of her rightful place in it.
