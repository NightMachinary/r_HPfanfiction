Hey, I'm looking for a fic in which 16/17yo Lily goes to the future in the body of older Lily (who is married to James, is already pregnant, has a job working with/reseaching potions, was friends with Marlene McKinnon when younger but discovers that in the future she's already dead). Older!Lily knew this would happen and made a notebook/book full of notes for Younger!Lily (also, Older!Lily did exchange bodies with Younger!Lily, and is enjoying being 17 again, and when Younger!Lily does get back to her proper time she finds out Older!Lily convinced Marlene to get a male stripper for Lily's birthday). I think the first chapter involves Lily waking up at St. Mungus. It's a multi-chap, I think it had a latin-based name (something begenning with T, maybe, I think the meaning was a synonym of sorts of epiphany/anagnorisis???), and it's older than 2010. I don't remember reading it on ff.net, but idk.


** *Younger!Lily and Older!James have several discussions about sex, because Younger!Lily wasn't in love with him - but in her future they were already married. Except Older!Lily was prepared for this (and for James' horniness) and made a note that basically said something along "to avoid having sex with james just tell him that sometimes wizard-babies make their father's penis disappear 'cause they see it as a threat!!!"

*** ?? not really, hun. if you mean the stripper, even if in any world I'd consider it cheating, if I remember correctly Older!Lily wouldn't even be present for his performance and basically just wanted to ruffle her younger self (Younger!Lily got back in time before her birthday, I think, hence the whole stripper debacle would happen with Younger-Single-Lily, not Older-Married-Lily). But if the chance is that I'm actually remembering it wrong, boy I don't blame her wanting to see some fine ass. Nor do I see it as cheating, so meh.

Now, if you're not talking about that, you lost me. And, anyway, if I ever find the fic again I promise to link it so you can have a go at discussing it, ok?
