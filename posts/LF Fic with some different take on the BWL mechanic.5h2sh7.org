Whether it be Hermione is now Harry's twin and its the Twins Who Lived, or Neville is the Boy Who Lived, or everyone thinks Neville is the Chosen One but it's actually Harry. Something along those lines. Also preferably well written and etc of course.

  Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter just another orphan. Without the scar on his forehead Harry is free to choose his own path. His Slytherin sorting is only the first surprise to his parents' old friends. Darkish themes. Dark!Harry. Rating could go up to M later.

  Thirteen years ago, the Dark Lord attacked Longbottom Manor and was defeated by the baby Neville Longbottom. Or so said Dumbledore. The Potters have a huge secret, known only by their greatest allies... and a certain Dark Lord.
