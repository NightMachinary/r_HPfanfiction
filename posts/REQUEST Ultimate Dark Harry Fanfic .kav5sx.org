What are some the best fanfic where Harry is Dark, competent and badass !!


** I am a bit hesistant to recc this one, simply because it is quite trope-y and full of clichees. But it was a fun read for me even though it is not a literary masterpiece. So I will at least point you towards it and you can decide for yourself if it would fit your request:

"Lord of Darkness by AngelSlayer135" on AO3

(not a direct link to comply with rule 8)

There is also a milder version on ff.net

3) Quo Vadis? by Ruskbyte

Summary: It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way.

Excerpt from story: "Did you come down here to try and stop me from getting the Stone?" Quirrell demanded.

"No. Don't worry; we won't insult the cliché of hero versus villain by ignoring your offers of power, glory and material wealth," said Potter as they approached. "So... please, begin tempting us.

4) The Sum of Their Parts » For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

**5) Uncrowned OatMilkLatte Summary: Unobserved and unknown to most, a bright star met its end and fell over the night sky. Whilst in Hogwarts, Trelawney trembled with the force of a new prophecy:

"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord is risen, born in a slaughter of souls, born as he thrice defies death...carnage will be his companion, as darkness will be his bride...a time shall come when the Serpent takes the world between Its jaws, demanding sacrifices promised...and none shall live as long as It prevails ...The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord is risen..."

In which a war between magic and the rest of the world destroyed everything Harry had ever known and loved. Traveling back in time, he will stop at nothing to carry out his vengeance. Veeery dark Harry veeery well written but there will be eventual slash so if that's not your thing skip this.

**6) you belong to me (i belong to you) Child_OTKW

Summary:

“What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said, stalking closer, “is you.” He marched forward, backing Harry up until he was pinned to the cool wall of the common room. “Do you know why?”

“No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely pleased. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro was a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

He leaned closer, “You look at me like you want to stab me.”

After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before.

He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.

One sided attraction from Tom but its not slash the pairing is Ginny and Harry The most badass dark Harry I've read

All of these stories are gen except number 5/ 6 is basically gen except that there is a one sided attraction but it's not Harry
