Looking for fanfics with Hermione as MC and a goddess that Hermione imteracts with somehow; she worships the goddess, is chosen by the goddess, has some relation to the goddess etc

Fanfics can either be complete or WIP with regular updates

Google gives me ONE fanfic and I call BULLSHIT on this

So, what have you got for me?


** I'm afraid if it's specifically female divinity centred I can't help, but if it's gods too:

Chershirecaroll and The Confectionary chronicles is good ðŸ˜Š

** You could search on Ao3, I heard they have a good searching mechanism

Sorry but I don't have any for Hermione, I have one of Harry living on Olympus and his mom being a goddess, he chose Hestia as a patron goddess though (Hestia is not his mom)

Linkffn(harry potter, squatter) if you're interested
