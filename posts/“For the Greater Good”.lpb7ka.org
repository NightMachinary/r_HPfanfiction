I swear to god if I read one more fic about Albus fucking Dumbledore talking about the fucking “Greater Good” I'm going rip out my eyes and scream until my vocal chords turn into paste.


** It is for the Greater Good that you avoid doing so. It is vital to the Greater Good that you are capable of reading the following explanation as to why everything that Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore wants isfor the Greater Good. This is also for the Greater Good, of course.

**** Of course eye twinkling is a little-known effect of someone using legilimency and the lemon drops are laced with loyalty potion and/or veritaserum which Dumbles has somehow made himself immune to.

** The only time I will accept this is in Phoenix Insurgent where Dumbledore and Grindelwald team up to defeat Voldemort and the ministry.

You should check it out. It's really good and badass!Dumbledore. Also has like no bashing.

*** See, that's more of an "ends justify the means" scenario than a "Greater Good" one. "The Greater Good" is just a ridiculous plot line. Will definitely check it out! I fucking love Grindelwald.

**** Exactly. I didn't watch Fantastic Beasts but I'm pretty sure even Grindelwald's Greater Good was an “end justifies the means.”

I have no idea why some authors think that the phrase “For the Greater Good” will ever come out of Dumbledore's mouth.

And yeah go check out the story. It's fucking amazing.

***** Lmao, exactly. Dumbledore noped that philosophy almost immediately after Arianna and even then, he never approved of violence---always a pacifist at heart.

Grindelwald is an interesting character to say the least. I wouldn't say he was evil per say, but he definitely had sociopathic tendencies and was machiavellian to an extreme. Also, it's never been confirmed in canon, but I'm sure going after the Elder Wand and then trying to maximize it's destructive capabilities probably gave him a “God-Complex” which definitely fostered a detachment from the physical world and furthered his already frighteningly clinical “Greater Good” philosophy.

Authors always assume that Dumbledore is some sort of “Emperor Palpatine-esque” figure that tries to manipulate everyone from the shadows and wants to be some sort of supreme, deity-likefigure when he's really just a flawed, but well-intentioned man with, arguably, too much weight on his shoulders.

Fantastic Beast series is pretty okay. Not perfect but it definitely has some memorable moments. I'm not a huge fan of their physical depiction of Grindelwald, but Johnny Depp went all out with that character and I appreciate that quite a bit. The movies do a good job at showing how OP characters like Grindelwald and Dumbledore are; nobody can even contend with Grindelwald much less attempt to capture or kill him. Also lends credence to the fact that Grindelwald and Dumbledore were equals since a lot of people, even in this fandom, like to think that Grindelwald was some cheesy villain that Dumbledore defeated with ease. It's pretty obvious in the movie that the outcome of a duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald is up-for-grabs---so to speak, and that most of Europe is pretty desperate for literally ANYBODY to save them---in this case, Dumbledore.

Look forward to reading that story! Let me know if you have any other good Grindelwald stories to recommend!

*** "Now, Harry," said Dumbledore, that manipulative old coot, "You need to kill yourself for the Greater Good," popping a lemon drop into his mouth, blue eyes twinkling, "and also, there's a marriage contract between you and Ginevra Weasley (purposefully misspelled), I am paying your friends to spy on you, I am stealing your wealth because I know that you might be Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Myrddin-Peverell one day and I, the most famous and respected wizard alive, am only looking out for the Greater Good. Also, I have blocked all your magical abilities and have purposefully allowed the Dursleys to abuse you--all for the Greater Good m'boy."

***** Bro, I've read so many GG stories that have this exact preface that I can automatically tell if it's going to be a Greater Good fic from the first page. Hell, if someone texts me GG I have "Vietnam flashbacks." I suppose it's just an easy way to write a fic but there's no originality lol.
