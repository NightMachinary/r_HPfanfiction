A fic based on the lyrics of Last to Know by Three Days Grace. A love triangle between Ron, Hermione and Harry. Ron and Hermione are in a relationship and Harry has an affair with Hermione. Preferably no bashing.

  She just walked away

  Why didn't she tell me?

  And where do I go tonight?

  This isn't happening to me

  This can't be happening to me

  She didn't say a word

  Just walked away

  You were the first to say

  That we were not okay

  You were the first to lie

  When we were not alright

  This was my first love

  She was the first to go

  And when she left me for you

  I was the last to know

  Why didn't she tell me

  Where to go tonight?

  She didn't say a word

  She just walked away

  You were the first to say

  That we were not okay

  You were the first to lie

  When we were not alright

  This was my first love

  She was the first to go

  And when she left me for you

  I was the last to know

  I'll be the first to say

  That now I'm okay

  And for the first time

  I've opened up my eyes

  This was my worst love

  You'll be the first to go

  And when she leaves you for dead

  You'll be the last to know

  I'll be the first to say

  That now I'm okay

  And for the first time

  I've opened up my eyes

  This was my worst love

  You'll be the first to go

  And when she leaves you for dead

  You'll be the last to know

I feel like this entire lyrics speaks about a situation if Harry gets into a relationship with Hermione behind Ron's back (not that he ever would). It's Just something I have had in my mind for quite sometime since listening to this song. Line by line you can adapt every single line of the lyrics to that situation.
