Okay, I understand it says he has to participate, but seriously, participate is so vague. He could literally walk into the arena with the dragon, attempt maybe a summoning charm on the egg and then say he gives up. And yet, in every single fic, he always says or thinks that "if they force me into this tournament then I won't try" or "I won't participate" or something along the lines of not complying. And yet in every single one he somehow manages to try and comply enough that he gets the golden egg, rescues his hostage and other, and makes it to, if not the center of the maze, then at least almost half way through it. How does 'not trying' equate to FINISHING every task?


** I've seen fics where he doesn't. I remember one where, in the lake task, he dips one toe in, then makes a boat and goes fishing for an hour. Wish I could remember the title!

*** That sounds amusing! I'd really like to see more stories where he makes good on his threat, but I guess a lot of authors just really want to write those scenes?

**** I think a lot of writers want to show off their 'clever' solutions to the Tasks. (Some really are clever! I'm not hating on anyone.) So yeah, even indy!Harry usually goes through the Tasks.

**** That's the actual chapter for the second task. But you get the idea. I really like this fic. Sadly it is WIP (the second book anyway) which makes me twitchy.

Actually you can't go wrong reading anything by Stargon1... the Cupboard series was good also. Lots of unique ideas in there.

** The vast majority of fics have Harry try because that's really who Harry is. "I can't believe this shit happens to ME. Fuck it, going to give it my best." The core of Harry Potter has always been play the cards you're dealt.

That said, I've read plenty of GoF fics where he blows off the tournament. Typically a low power Harry fic and he's all "why would you expect me to try and get killed?" which always makes Dumbles crazy(er). It's possible you are reading power_Harry fics. And if so, it doesn't make sense for Harry to be an ass kicker but somehow refuse to use the TWT as a place to let loose. Plus I've seen quite a few writers throw in a "you have to try or face punishment" clause on the TWT. That's a bit of Fannon at this point.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7279137/0]])

Has Harry pretty much refusing to do the tasks, while

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10485934/0]])

has him using some bureaucratic stuff to pretty much cheat his way through the tournament and make lots of money. It also doesn't have him cooperating with the goblins.

  Dumbledore had tricked him into becoming a Champion but Harry wasn't going to take it lying down. He may be forced to compete in the tasks but who says he has to complete the tasks?

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

  Harry Potter never wanted to compete in the tournament in the first place. And when his name mysteriously came out of the goblet, he still didn't. So he did what any sensible wizard would do, and didn't care. [Harry x Hermione - best friends to romantic]

***** If he's more afraid of being bullied than dying then there's something wrong there. Also a little weird that he would be afraid of 'not fitting in' or whatever it is the reason would be for going along with the tournament to "not be bullied any more" when his boggart indicates a fear of fear itself, instead of a fear of not fitting in, etc.
