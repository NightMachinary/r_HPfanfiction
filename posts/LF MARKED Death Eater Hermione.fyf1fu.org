I've read lots of stories where she's a spy etc, but in a lot of them, (like The Green Girl) she isn't actually marked. I would really like to read one where Hermione is marked as a Death Eater, whether it's as a spy or because Hermione's gone dark.

I'd love a good Powerful!Hermione with this concept too please!

Please something well written that's 60k+ words if possible. Any pairing (or none) is fine!

Stories I can think of atm that I've read with this concept:

- Falling into Darkness
- When a Lioness Fights
- Vengeance
- Desperate Measures
- In Too Deep

If I remember anymore, I'll add them to the list!

Thank you! :)


** Just read this one. /Our Mercurial Selves/ is a Bellmione fic where Hermione's parents are killed, so Dumbledore has the Malfoys raise her to be another double agent. Starts a few months before the "demise" of ol Voldies.
