Yeah, I'm looking for fics like Jeconais' Despair. Harry realises that he's being stretched too thin and that's he's on his own and he doesn't give a fuck anymore - not like Paid in Blood where he finds someone else to accompany him (Daphne in this case). More like Harry goes rogue/insane, maybe with the Hallows, maybe as Master of Death, etc.

Edit: Revenge fics preferred. OP Harry is fine, as long as it's well done - like A Pale Horse.

*** Not precisely what I was looking for ( was looking more for revenge-ish fics), but good nevertheless. Thanks!
