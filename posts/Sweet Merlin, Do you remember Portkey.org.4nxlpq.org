** I read one of my first fanfics there - Forever Knight (one of my favourites). Then there's Shadow Walker (Sequel to Shadow Walks by Lorien829). It's only complete on Portkey. Then there was a set of two fics written by Vicarious Leigh - The Power He Knows Not and its sequel, The Triumvirate of Resolve. Those are the ones I remember reading from Portkey.org. Good times!

**** Schnoogle! Only place you can read one of the greatest series of all time, The Paradigm of Uncertainty. If you've never read it, I can't stress how much you need to.

I also got my start on Portkey, to this day, 10 years later, I am still diehard Harmony ship.

***** And then get really pissed when she abandons the third story. PoU and Barb's Psychic Serpent Trilogy were my first back in the long ago.

*** Forever Knight is great. One of the few fics I go back and reread from time to time, and stay up all night reading it.

** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/1798/1][Lucky]] is one of the very first Harry Potter fanfics I read, now over eleven years ago, and perhaps the only one that holds up to any degree of scrutiny. Despite a maguffiny premise and at least one discomfiting moment w/r/t institutionalized power dynamics and consent, it's otherwise a refreshing take on H/Hr despite (because of?) its age. The author's grasp on canon character voice is stupendous, particularly Dumbledore (who is at once compassionate, mysterious, and subtlety arrogant, and who seems to think of Harry in many ways as an equal), and the alternate dimensions versions of the characters are at once drastically different and eerily similar to their canon counterparts. No Ron bashing, no "certain bushy-haired witch" . . . definitely a winner.

** One of my favorites is on there - Be All My Secrets Remembered. I liked its advanced search since it was tailored to HPverse, compared to the more general one in FFN.

The forum was hard for me to navigate though, haha.

#+begin_quote
  'Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall.' Spanning from spring of 1976 through the fateful Halloween night of 1981, the adventures and misadventures of Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, and their contemporaries, particularly those belonging to the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black, Toujours Dysfunctional. Warnings: contains dark thematic material, violence, innuendo, as many literary references as can be managed, and very mild slash.
#+end_quote

It's canon Marauders-era, which I usually avoid because the good fics always make my heart hurt.

** /Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire/ by Couldson Eagle: Hermione takes Harry's place in the Triwizard. As far as I know, it's the only detailed exploration about how someone like Hermione --- less courage under fire and athleticism than Harry, but more discipline, versatility, and generally better at magic --- would handle the tasks. The downside is that the fic launches some peripheral plot threads that lead nowhere, so it could be edited down by about a third, and the ending is too fixficish: everything turns out better at the end of the fic than at the end of OotP in canon.

** I found this site about two years ago and it really made a shipper out of me ;) I fell in love with that haven for us harmonians. I wish we could revive the website so it may again live and breathe like it used to in the past.

** I would never understand entire websites dedicated to just one pairing. Makes it obvious that readers are only really interested in the romance aspect, and probably fanatic about it.
