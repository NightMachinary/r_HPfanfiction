I don't know why but I love these types of fics. Some of my favorites involve things like Harry and Ginny going to Dudley's wedding or Harry and his wife Daphne visiting Dudley and his family. Doesn't really have to be bashing, I don't mind fics where Harry and Dudley are made up now that they're adults.

**** I dunno, I often see fics where dudley has suddenly smartened up and they just don't ring true for me - even when he was acting nicer to Harry it was made clear that he was still a bit of a moron. I don't think that stops him being kind or worthy of Harry's friendship, but even in DH he was like "why isn't Harry coming?" Which suggests, to me, that he's pretty clueless about how little the rest of his family cares about Harry. But yes, it was a little contrived for the purposes of humour, and it's my head canon that everyone's memories were modified except for dudley, hyacinth, Vernon and petunia. In future next gen fics hyacinth might pop up but I don't think I'll ever focus too heavily on them.

***** Yup, Dudley probably had the capacity to be averagely clever, but he never was made to, being almost literally spoon-fed throughout all his developing years. It wasn't just the weight that whoever it was was referring to when they said his parents had ruined him, it was his brain. He was a very screwed up young man.

Your story is hilarious, I don't think Dudley is too silly. It obviously never occurred to him that Marge would be so poisonous. If anything, I thought Ginny was a little too dumb - the word electricity isn't too hard to remember. Nor is DJ too hard after being corrected at least twice. I get that it's humour, but for being raised by a Muggle enthusiast and having muggleborn besties, the Weasley kids ignorance is rather silly (Ron having no idea how to say telephone...)

***** Darn, I like the character of Hyacinth, and I kinda want more. Maybe Hyacinth is so horrified at Harry's childhood, along with Ginny, that they team up and force him into counselling, and she tries putting everyone else into therapy as well, especially Ginny for the Diary, Ron and Hermione for /everything/, and the other Weasleys start refusing to meet her.

  Ginny persuades Harry to attend Dudley's wedding. Unfortunately, both of them forgot that Aunt Marge would also be attending.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".
