** I like how the Firebird series does the USSR; using the Holodomr to hide anti-wizard purges that destroys nearly all of wizarding Russia. This explains away the lack of a Russian wizarding school (it was destroyed) and explains why there are a bunch of eastern Europeans supporting Voldemort (they /really/ hate muggles)

Not sure if you meant explaining in context of the Firebird series or canon so I will write this anyway: There is Russian Wizarding School canonically. Колдовсторец - it was first mentioned in Book of Potions.

** I'd assume that wizards would completely cut themselves off from muggle world when communists reached for power (if they didn't do this earlier).

Notice also that Karkaroff ended up being a headmaster in Durmstrang and not Russian Koldovstoretz, which may imply that he wasn't from there in the first place.
