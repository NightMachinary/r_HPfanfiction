** Now that it has become somewhat of a requirement to disclose if you are bashing in your summary I propose we extend it to mugglewank/wizardwank. Not only for the people who want to avoid one or the other, but also for the people who enjoy reading that.

** For a motivated wizard, finding a Muggle gun should not be that hard. Said wizard has a lot of options about how to find it (a quick trip to the USA or Ex URSS, the use of Magic to find and rob a Mubble gang, or even straight up Transfiguring a Gun . . .). Sadly, in the few fics I have tried to read with this idea, it was more "Harry walks in the Street and meet the Covenient Merchant, who sells him anything he may need because he seems nice".

I also dislike the use of Muggle weapon in fanfics, mainly because I'm not a fan of how this idea is developped. Most of the time, the fic either Nerf the Wizards to death (Unplottable areas can be found by looking at the "White zones" on a map, bullets can pass through Shield Charms . . .), or by making them complete idiots. Wizards are generally pragmatics people, Blood Purist may refuse to use any "muggle trashes" into their fight, but if engraving a rune was enough to make a gun deadly even for wizards, Muggleborns would have tried this decades ago.

It is a bit sad, because it's not like Muggle weapons are completely useless. Theorically, a sniper should be able to kill a wizard if he manages to shoot him before the wizard is aware of his presence, and his bullet instantly kill him like a headshoot (though the problem would be to create a situation where a wizard is in a situation to be shoot at by a Muggle).\\
Thanks to magic, Wizards are inherently better than Muggles, but it would love to read a story about Muggle trying to kill a wizard despite their disadvantage, where carefull planning and contigency plans can beat absolute power (basically like in a Batman Vs Superman fight, or the serie The Boys).
