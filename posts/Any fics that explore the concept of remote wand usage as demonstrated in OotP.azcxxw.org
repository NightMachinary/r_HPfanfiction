In the beginning of OotP, Harry is able to use lumos without actually holding the wand. Are there any fics that explore, or even just use this ability, either as a special power for Harry, or as something that wizards and witches can just do? I've only ever read one fic where this was discussed and would like to check out more.

Thanks in advance!


** The fic that I was referring to is Apprentice Potter by draco664.

** I recently dusted off my notes for linkffn(We, Harry Potter by wille179) because I was thinking about something very similar to this. For the uninitiated, Harry gets turned into a five-headed dragon. When testing out whether or not he can still use magic, he found that even when he was using a wand, he could breathe out spells as if they were dragonfiire from any head's mouth, regardless of which head cast the spell.

My plan for it is that they can use each other as wands, even when separated by magic, as they're all a singular being. One casts a spell, dealing with the complex mental requirements and the magical strain, while another simply exhales the completed spell onto their target. I had an idea for a scene where one of the heads is speaking with someone they don't like - Malfoy, for example - and the other fires a confundus through his mouth in order to do something like Kaa's hypnosis from /The Jungle Book/.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (some fluff, no bashing, not power wank.)
