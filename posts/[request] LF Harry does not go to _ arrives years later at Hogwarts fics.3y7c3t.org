The search terms are just too common and I cannot seem to find any fics. I read linkffn(11610805) which is a WIP but thats it.

I want something were the Dursleys deny Harry his education so he doesn't go to Hogwarts, or for some reason he goes late (like the fic mentioned before, were goes because someone put his name in the goblet in year 4). Preferably something already complete and longer (30k words up).

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

******* I've read it. The fic is okay but the pairing sucks imo.

Edit: I've read several H/F that I enjoyed but these fics were never enhanced by the pairing. Usually they're good fics despite it. The only fic I've read that seems to be going that way, and will be believable when it does is Newcombs story linkffn(What You Leave Behind).

Harry/Fleur suffers from 1. An age gap. It isn't just the age but the fact that Harry has 3 years of schooling after she graduates. If the story isn't post-Hogwarts this is a nearly overwhelming hurtle. 2. Fleur is way out of Harry's league. Not only is she by far physically more attractive than the very average Harry, but she's far more emotionally and mentally mature. She's a Triwizard champion and not just a pretty face. Harry is not a suave or mature person. He's an average kid, which is why this doesn't work.

******** I disagree with the Emotional and Mental maturity, okay maybe not so much the emotional. Harry does get fairly emotional from time to time. But mentally Harry is probably one of the most strong and mature people in the story. He'd have to still be functional after all he went through. Hell even his emotions seem fairly stable for someone who's been through all he has.

Harry isn't just an average kid. But yeah the 3 extra years of schooling is pretty insurmountable.

She's classy and etheral and he's very very common and down to earth. Not that thats a bad thing, they would just make better /anything else/. Also,I think she'd dominate him or mother him to death, in a Narcissa Malfoy way. Yeah that fits, she's like a nicer Cissy, lol.

Denarian Renegade by Shezza. it is a cross over but you dont need to know anything about it. and While I dont like it like [[/u/tusing][u/tusing]] does, I do recognize that it is one of the best crossovers ever written in the fandom. Also I would recommend this community. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Other-schools-for-Harry-Potter/41499/]]
