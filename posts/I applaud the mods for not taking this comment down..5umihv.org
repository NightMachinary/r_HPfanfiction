** So, you posted a thread asking for creepy disturbing fics whose authors should be on watchlists, then you're offended when someone calls out an author who writes creepy, disturbing fics? He does, and everybody who's a regular on this sub knows it.

#+begin_quote
  despite people reporting the comment multiple times
#+end_quote

It was reported once.

Based on your account being a couple days old, your comments in that thread and you now posting this one I'm pretty sure you're GryffindorTom's sockpuppet and were baiting exactly this kind of thing. And if you're not, you're a troll. So kindly fuck off.

*** If I may ask - why wasn't it taken down if it was reported? It is an insult, no question, and a personal attack. The whole thread is pretty much asking for a witch hunt and inciting arguments since, you know, it asks people to list authors who you think are present or future criminals.

**** The original request was for creepy and disturbing fics. There are certainly plenty of those to go around. The title was a bit over the top, but It didn't seem to merit removing.

Maybe I should've removed herO_wraith's comment, but I didn't consider it an attack... possibly due to my own bias. Everyone around here knows that his fics fit the creepy and disturbing description, but linking to his fics would have been more appropriate than calling him out.

And as a note, I also don't remove most comments that are reported, only extreme violations or repeat offenders. I generally let votes take care of it or give a warning.

***** Why do you not remove content that violates the rules? A user will read them and think it's allowed. Or think you condone such stuff. Especially if the comment is upvoted because a clique thinks it's funny, or the (insert your insult of choice - sexual or racist) deserves it.

******* That's pretty much saying "Homophobic/racist slurs are allowed, as long as they don't really cross the line". I might be biased, since I just re-read the wiki article about lynchings, but "mob rule" should never replace "mod rule".

Imagine a school teacher telling you "Oh, I don't care about bullies unless they go too far, since usually, the other students will deal with bullies".

Yes, a number of slurs will get downvoted - but insults? If aimed at outsiders, people will vote them up, as seen in the thread that started it - 36 people voted the comment up. I think that pretty much shows a failure of your system.

******** So, I think you have a different perspective on this because you don't actually have to deal with the reports. A lot of them are not the kind of thing you're describing. They're people reporting someone who argues with them or criticizes something they like or for just.. no reason I can discern whatsoever. It's pretty annoying.

Sometimes someone will go overboard in an argument and start calling someone stupid or something like that, and I feel downvotes and warnings are a better way to deal with that. I've already said I probably handled this particular instance the wrong way, but that doesn't mean I should just start removing every comment that can be interpreted as a rule violation.

And yes, it certainly is annoying - been a mod myself on another forum. But if you have rules, you need to enforce them. Consistently.

I disagree, strongly. I think that different responses to violations are called for based on their severity.

*********** That works, as long as there is a VISIBLE response. Otherwise people will assume that calling someone this or that slur is OK. In the long run, you'll either keep getting reports because people break rules "less excessively", or people will assume that you approve of that stuff.

A simple comment how something breaks a rule, for example, will take care of that problem, and show that you are actually responding - and will inform readers that yes, that comment was breaking a rule, even if the comment was not removed for it.
