I've already read through My Immortal at least twice, and I've just started Harry Potter Becomes A Communist. I've also read Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles and Imma Wiserd. I listen to the Fanatical Fics podcast and really enjoy it, but they mostly cover shorter stories. What are some other long troll/crack fics that you enjoy?


** You could try mine:

Harry is a fitness buff who calls everyone dude & acts like he's the hero of an action movie. He's convinced Dumbledore is evil-- but he's actually just a stoner. Also featuring his two mentors-- badass Minerva McGonagall, and the Thicc Daddy himself, Thanos.

*** Calls everyone dude, except his honeys. I think the interaction between Harry and the Patils are one of the best parts of the story.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.
