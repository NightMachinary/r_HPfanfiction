I can't help but wonder what Voldemort's reaction to this would have been, had he ever witnessed Umbridge using /Slytherin's/ locket to 'prove' her pedigree.

And just how much it would derail the final book for him to realize far earlier that his Horcuxes weren't nearly as secure as he believed.

***** Looks like it's going that way in this fic. Not the same plot device by any means but antihero Tom is so underrated imo [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15629688/chapters/36291033][Dark Lord Who]]

*** She's way too young to have gone to school at the same time. HP wiki puts her birth year at 1965 or before.

But if she were that old, it would have been nice to read a fic where everyone hates her.

I know one where Rita admits to being her dorm mate and how horrible it was

** "S, It stands for Selwyn" explained Umbridge. Umbridge wasn't sure how she got to Sesame Street, nor how she became a guest-star, but something had to be done, there was a Vampire running unchecked, teaching Arithmancy of all things! Arithmancy was after all, just glorified counting.

** Could be fascinating to see Umbridge accidentally start a third side to the war - New Bloods. Like New Money, but for Blood Status. All these 'faux' Purebloods desperate to fit in amongst the rest of their blood type, turning the bigotry up to eleven because they think that's what they need to do to be in the Pureblood Posse.

I wonder what her reaction would be to finding out all her little associates are first or second generation Pureblood, or that they're also faking their status like she is.

**** Thanks! I quite agree. :)

Self-aggrandisement aside, I do think it'd be really interesting to almost look at the 'rise of the Middle Class', but in the Blood Status paradigm. As a folk taxonomy, it's as much a socio-economic thing as a race thing, it seems. I like the idea of examining Blood Purity by the creation of a new category.

Out of curiosity - are you using Newbloods as a new phrase for Muggleborn, or is it a new thing in the Blood Type Spectrum? :)

***** yeah, for me it was changing the view, trying to get people to think of them as a gift from Magic to make sure the gene pool isn't stagnant, and trying to change the way people look at it.

she was also trying to get the world to look at the different races different as well

*** Yeah. Her claiming to be a Selwyn through an artifact of Slytherin's strikes me as an example of gross ignorance, given the historical significance of it.

I could just imagine Voldemort's reaction to seeing it.

"Selwyn? /Selwyn/?! That's /Slytherin's/ locket, /my/ locket, you fool! /Crucio/!"

"Now. How did you obtain my locket?"
