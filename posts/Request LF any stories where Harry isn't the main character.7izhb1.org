Tired of reading stories where Harry is the main character, any character can be the main character but Harry. Any Era, any Rating, am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash. No Harems, no Character Bashing.

Harry can be in the story of course, but I'd rather him not be the main character.

Would also rather not have Hermione as the main character unless it's a story that's not recommended a whole lot, read a few Hermione as the main character stories already.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

*** I did somewhat like Half-Blood Emperor, biggest virtue and vice is its pacing. It's both too fast to get a grip on any sort of plot or character progression, but if it hadn't been this fast pace I'm not sure if I would have read it. :/

  In hindsight, the signs were all there. Maybe if they had just paid more attention they could have been more careful. Probably not, but looking back at the events that had unfolded that night they all wished they hadn't had to learn this lesson the hard way. For this lesson may very well cost one of the Marauders his life.

Perhaps, a collision was exactly what they both needed. Percy/Audrey.
