:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Like... It's an alternate universe where there is something like the zombie apocalypse? only it's muggles? Harry cuts somebody's face off and wears it like a mask while on a mission to infiltrate something... He also takes muggles to a room and tortures and murders them? And like...

He's just pretty unhinged?

And like idk I was reading it one night like 4 years ago and I haven't been able to forget it because I never finished it. It was on FF.

I would love to read it all the way through. It was a badass fic.

Does anybody else know what I'm talking about? Any help is appreciated. I have been searching for years.


** The cutting the face off isn't a zombie apocalypse, it's a war-torn hellhole apocalypse in which the SoS has been shattered, Britian has fallen into anarchy, and Voldemort left some seriously evil dudes to manage Britian, which he refuses to re-enter due to the threat badass Harry represents.

I remember all that but not the name of the damn thing.

#+begin_quote
  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.
