  He was only twelve, going on thirteen. And shouldn't Madame Pomfrey been able to detect this and stop it while he'd been in the hospital wing? Because seriously? This? This thing right here? It had to have been something to do with the Basilisk having bitten him. A whole new spin on the Snake!Harry Genre with some Ancestor! thrown in.

** Okay so for the sake of linking these are two posts. One is my own request for a specific kind of challenge with examples and the other is just someone who asked. I'll make another post with direct story links to my favorites, but basically these are all pretty good

*** Echoing my post in the second link, I heartily recommend linkffn(Son of the Western Sea). Good writing, good characterization, and just plain good. Unfortunately, like all great things in fanfiction, I have my doubts that it will be updated again. It's not a crossover, but if you like PJO you'll like this.

  All myths are true. Outside the borders of Western Civilization lies the rest of the world. After the Second Olympian War, a restless Percy Jackson sails for the horizon, and never stops. AU after The Last Olympian. Percy x various mythological figures, het and slash.

** So idk if anybody even knows what I'm talking about, but I'm looking for DZ2 twice blessed challenge fics or just good demigod Harry fics in general. These are some I can think of right now.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11024296/1/Godling-Ascending]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11309061/1/Consul-of-the-Underworld-The-Game-Begins]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11324421/1/The-Ever-Twisting-Wind-The-Lightning-Thief]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10793290/1/The-Unrelenting-Frozen-Seas-The-Journey]])

Are some of my favorite. I was really into linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11715537/1/Pandemonium]]) and it's predecessor, but I have to agree with the author it is kinda cringe worthy at times.

There are others, but I'm of the mind this is a good place to start

  The Sea has many moods, many faces. This is mirrored by its children greatly. The icy seas shift and tide against the shore of a difficult path. Watch as a small ripple becomes a mighty typhoon in the world of monsters, gods, and demigods. Fem!Harry. Years One-Three, complete! Thanks for the support guys and gals!

  Every Half-Blood has one godly parent, this we know: however, Harry is different because of one reason: through the ways of the divine, he has more than one god for a parent - and those parents are NOT happy at being entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will. The solution is simple, give their son the power to make the whole shake and quiver. DISCONTINUED.

  Response to DZ2's 'Harry, the Twice-Blessed Half-blood' challenge. Fem!Harry. Herakles Potter knew she was odd. Exactly how odd turned out to be far odder than she originally thought.
