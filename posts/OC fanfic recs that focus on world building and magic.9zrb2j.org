Are there any fics with an OC or even a self insert where the story focuses on magic and the magical universe and builds on it? I haven't found a single fic with an OC in the HP fandom that isn't just a bunch of romantic drivel but maybe I've just been looking in the wrong places.

Any fics that have an OC/self insert as the MC where magic and/or world building are a main part of the story would be amazing! Can be female or male OC and there can be romance, but I would prefer it not be the main focus of the story.

I vaguely remember a fic where the self insert was reincarnated as Ginny and she had some interesting things happening with magic but I dropped it for some reason...I think because she was overpowered and it got too melodramatic or something. If anyone knows the fic I'm talking about let me know! I'll try and give it another shot, maybe I was wrong to drop it.


** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick]] series follows a cast of entirely OC's attending a wizards-school in America. It has a tonne of world building, especially with regards to the history and political structure of wizarding America:

#+begin_quote
  America is an old land, Alex. The New World is just as ancient as the Old World, and just as full of secrets. But when European wizards came here, they wanted everything to be just like it was in the Old World. The problem is, back in Europe, wizards had been there for thousands of years. They controlled all the magic. They'd gotten rid of anything that could oppose them, long ago.

** Well, linkffn(11815544) features an OC in a prominent role and doesn't focus on romance. It's a mystery fic about Harry as an auror in his early twenties, and the OC is his new partner, fresh out of training. The OC does get into a relationship eventually, but not with Harry and the romance ties in heavily to the main plot. It also has a sequel in progress, linkffn(12778140). However, neither of them really focus on magic in depth; it's about the mystery, but there is some world-building that goes along with that.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

  When a mysterious woman comes to the Auror office claiming to be the victim of a terrible crime, Theia and Harry want to do everything they can to help her. The problem is, she has no memory of what has happened. As they piece together the sinister events, their own troubles and traumas rise to the surface, causing them to question who they really are.

** linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff]])

Recently found this W.I.P self insert fic that is just awesome. I usually really don't like self inserts or OCs or first person POV but I really love this story.

It's a gen fic with no romance about an OC who gets transported to Hogwarts as an 11 year old. She ends up befriending a bunch of side characters along with Hermione and Neville after getting sorted into Hufflepuff much to her surprise and annoyance.

The story follows her time at Hogwarts as she attempts to learn magic and influence canon events, (although things often don't go the way she expects them to).

Overall its a fun fic with lots of little worldbuilding details that make the Harry Potter world feel magical. There is a focus on friendship and adventure with lots of humour. Its also nice that while it follows canon in a way, almost all scenes are entirely original and not everything goes the way it does in canon.

** someone already posted Victoria Potter but the Pureblood Pretense series is entirely OC (technically still Harry Potter, but she's a girl, Lily & James lived because Voldemort is a politician not a mass murderer, Hogwarts only accepts purebloods because he's a really /good/ politician, she swaps places with Sirius' son, who is her best friend, so that she can go to Hogwarts and he can study healing at the American Institute of Magic). Violet does a really, really amazing job at world building - even the most minor characters are interesting and multi-faceted, there are many magical locations she made herself outside of Hogwarts and Diagon, there is heavy Potions building (and of all types of magic) the plot is entirely new.... I could literally sing the praises of this series for years to come, I think it's basically replaced canon in my head. But let me stop typing and just give you the link so you can read it, the series is currently on book 4 but is already double the length of the OS.

That's not very tactful. Plenty of writers of that very same 'drivel' are here on reddit.

*** It doesn't matter if it's tactful or not. Most of Cabbie is mentioning is true. I dislike reading fanfiction that is taken over by what I call a "romance tumor" (fanfiction author came up with that, and I've used it since), since if romance is focused on too much, it takes away from the story. /Which is bad when you are trying to tell a story/.

Of course, there are other ways of putting too much focus onto unimportant elements of a story, and it doesn't necessarily have to consist of romance (such as OP powers the OC gets repeatedly, or the story shifts to another characters perspective for too long, etc).

But as I said, it doesn't matter what you think. In fact, responding in the way you did, could be misconstrued as */you/* being the rude one. But, to be honest, that doesn't matter either. And you shouldn't get defensive because a bunch of letters strung together offended you or what you think to be others. They're just words. I don't blame you for getting upset about the words, as I was like that too, till bout' six years ago, when I finished school (funny how that works :P). "Drivel" is just a word used here to describe something, not offend anyone. And if it does, it doesn't matter, /because they're letting themselves be offended by a group of letters strung together, a simple word./
