I have read The Pureblood Princess and Life and Times and have enjoyed both thoroughly. I am just looking for stories similar to those stories, preferably with a happy ending. Just a quality romance. Lemony scenes are ok, perhaps encouraged, but don't need to be the focus. Any m/f pairings are fine with me. Maybe an eighth year fic to prevent Voldemort from being the focus. Thanks


** I remember really liking the romance in "Harriet Potter and the Minister of Magic" by slytherin-nette. AU with Fem!Harry where James lives. No lemons though. Note that the author changed their mind on the pairings and did NOT end with HG/RW even though the first chapter says that pairing will be in the fic. Harriet pairs (separately) with Cedric Diggory and Draco Malfoy in a way that seemed realistic without being annoyingly juvenile as teen romances can get.

** Is the Pureblood Princess worth it? Since you put it together with TLAT I checked it out, but the first two chapters were disappointing. Nothing happened to catch my interest, just a boring monologue from Daphne about her equally boring view and summer break.

I get that in a first persrson fic, the thought of the character is more fleshed out, but those two chapters 'telling' way too much instead of 'showing'. I don't need to be reminded that Daphne and her family are neutral, and that she always has a plan or making up one at least three times a chapter.

*** The Life and Times is undoubtedly the better story but I have set the bar low when it comes to fan fiction
