  Lists had never failed Hermione before. So when her feelings for Ron get out of hand, it's only natural for her to write a list to clear her mind. She would come up with a list of boys most objectively compatible with her, detail the reasons why, and choose someone from the list to serve as a distraction. Of course, she never dreamed that her notes would all magically get sent out. (Inspired by To All The Boys I've Loved Before)

  Once a week, every week, Dean Thomas allowed himself to pretend nothing had ever happened.

** linkao3(Noticing by DistantDusk)

Sixth-year rehash, and we mainly see Dean through Ginny's eyes as she's dating him. It paints him in a surprisingly sympathetic light. The author takes the few canon details we know about him and extrapolates them into a surprisingly insightful look into his character and mindset, and why he and Ginny were ultimately incompatible.

In a similar vein:

linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince)

As you can tell from the title, it's another sixth-year rehash. This one I don't think does as good a job exploring Dean as a character, but he's still prominent (obviously).

Enjoy!

  Ginny suddenly realizes two things, in very quick succession: One, that Harry's never really looked at her that closely before, and two, that he is absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, doing that. Right now.This is the story of how Harry comes to notice her... but more importantly, it's the story of how Ginny comes to notice that he noticed.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.
