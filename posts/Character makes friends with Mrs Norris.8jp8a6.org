Can anyone recommend a story where one of the students is friendly with Mrs Norris, and/or Filch, and it has a significant impact on the story? Or even if it's just fun background fluff.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

I don't think it affects the story at all but the main character cares for Mrs Norris for a short amount of time

  Harry winds up in Japan and lives a completely different life from the one Dumbledore planned for him. He returns to England and ... you need to read to find out.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8132578/chapters/18642415][the anti heroine]] it's pretty dark and kind of torture-porny but hermione gets crookshanks earlier and makes friends with mrs norris. they end up having kittens.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4829807/chapters/11061878][faith and the devil]] SI by tozette. their main motivation is enjoying the magic enabled ability to eat gluten. befriends mrs norris. is probably dead but has at least 60k.
