** Pretty sure /That Boy is Trouble-Extended/ over on HP Fan Fiction Archive is the one you're looking for.

** There was a very quick comment with a name for this fic... but it's gone now. I managed to read it, but I was on my way to buy some groceries and could not really take note of the detail. The name seemed familiar, but I can't remember it now üò£ that potter boy .. or something similar

It might be that the post were removed because OP found out it was the wrong story or some other reason. I just don't know.

It's annoying because I feel like I should know the name and that I'll hit myself when I finally manages to find the fic
