Plot can happen, but it'd be interesting if it was more minor or in the background, or done in a few chapters or whatever.

Looking for more stuff like teenagers doing truth and dare, people getting in trouble with teachers, exploring the castle, and coming up with pranks, for either the teachers or students or both.

Not looking for pairings, would rather keep that minor, to be honest. Though I'm fine with Het/Slash/Femslash. No Draco/Hermione.

Harry/Hermione ONLY if Ron is a good guy. No Weasley bashing.

No Lord Potter, no Harem Harry. No Harry super strong or super smart or anything like that.

Can be drabbles, oneshots or multichapter. Can be on ANY site. Anyone can be the main character. It can be any era.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** I'm working on something like that right now. It's Hufflepuff centric with original characters (post war). It's intended to be slice of life with a Quidditch plot backdrop.

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.
