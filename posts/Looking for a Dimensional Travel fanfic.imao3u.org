:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfiction I read a while ago, however I don't remember too much about it. What I do remember is that Harry had multiple parts of his body replaced by the silver metal like Pettigrews hand. He traveled to a dimension where is parents were alive and they had a daughter (at least one child) in addition. If anyone knows what I'm talking about that'd be great.

#+begin_quote
  His fight finished, his enemies dead, Harry Potter expects to move on from a life of conflict and pain. Either to the peace of oblivion, or to the embrace of those already fallen to Riddle's army. But fate does not have such a happy ending in store for our protagonist, and he arrives in another world to be found, covered in blood, by a familiar face.
