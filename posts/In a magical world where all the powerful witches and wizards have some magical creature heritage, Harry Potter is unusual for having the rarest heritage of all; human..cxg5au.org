It occurred to Harry that he had never seen a goblin look as surprised as he was seeing now. Though Harry would never say it out loud, Springford's bulging eyes made him look, in Harry's opinion, like a well-dressed house-elf.

"Ah, Mr. Potter, do come into my office." Springford said, his tone vaguely uncertain as his bulging eyes continued to examine a sheet of parchment in front of him, "Your genealogy results from G.G.R. have arrived."\\
Harry quietly sat down on the seat in front of the desk, "Is something the matter?" he asked quietly.\\
Springford shook his head, still wide-eyed like he had overdosed on caffeine, "No, no, everything is acceptable, young Mr. Potter. Would you like to view your results?"

Accepting the offered parchment, Harry let his eyes browse the report on his heritage.\\
James Potter, Lily Evans...further up were more names in the Evans family, the Potter family, and several generations back there was a mention of the Peverells...and at the end was his own name, with an appended comment: /Harry James Potter (100% human)/\\
Harry raised an eyebrow, before mentally shrugging it off; keeping Flitwick the part-goblin and Hagrid the half-giant in mind, it wasn't unreasonable to include species in a genealogy report.

After reading the report for a few more minutes, Harry nodded and passed the parchment back to Springford, who seemed like he was waiting for some kind of extreme reaction from the boy-who-lived.\\
"Have you concluded your browsing, Mr. Potter? You don't find anything...unusual, about your heritage?" the goblin prompted.\\
Harry tilted his head puzzledly, "No? I mean, Fleamont and Euphemia are funny names, I suppose, but no, nothing unusual. It would have been cool to be descended from Godric Gryffindor, though."\\
"You don't find anything unusual about being fully human?" Springford pressed.\\
Harry blinked, "No." he confessed, "I, well I suppose it'd have been nice to have some Veela blood or something. I saw this one book in Flourish and Blotts once about me where I had dragon blood..."\\
Springford raised his eyes ceilingward, "/He supposes it'd be nice to have Veela blood./" he muttered in disbelief to himself.

There was an awkward silence for several seconds before Harry coughed, "Uh, Mr. Springford? Is something wrong with being only human?"\\
"/Only human, he says./" the goblin once again muttered to himself, before he lowered his gaze and focused on Harry again, "Mr. Potter, it may surprise you to find that being a pure human and having as much magical strength as yours is extremely unusual."\\
"I'm not /that/ strong of a wizard." Harry objected half-heartedly.\\
Springford just Looked at him, "Over one hundred dementors with one Patronus Charm. The entire Triwizard Tournament." he pointed out.\\
Harry looked sheepish.\\
Springford theatrically shuffled some parchments and put them aside, "I assume you do not know then, Mr. Potter; it is very common for human witches and wizards to.../cross-breed/ with other magical races, for the sake of gaining more magically powerful offspring. Even so-called 'pureblood' humans do this regularly. While attempting to seduce a dragon would be foolhardy, there are rituals dating from ancient China that use dragon's blood to endow a bloodline with tremendous magical power, so whatever fiction you saw in Flourish and Blotts isn't completely raving mad."\\
Harry contemplated that for a few seconds, again; Flitwick, a master duelist, Hagrid, a prodigy with magic despite his expulsion, Fluer, a contestent in the Triwizard Tournament. "I see what you mean." he agreed. "But lots of my classmates at Hogwarts are all-human...I think they are, right?"\\
"Mr. Potter, if I were to view genealogy results on your classmates, rest assured that unless they were as unusual as you are, they would have at least a fraction of a percent of some creature heritage. Not even muggleborns are exempt, their family trees often have...cuckoos nesting in them." Springford responded, smiling ever so slightly at his pun.\\
"Yet I'm fully human? How strong is a full human supposed to be?" Harry questioned.\\
"Mr. Potter, as a pure human you and your parents should rightfully have barely enough magical strength to levitate an apple. That you are one of the most magically potent wizards of your age, and that your parents could stand against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, quite frankly boggles the mind. I cannot even begin to imagine what kind of special abilities could lie in your...bizarrely potent human heritage."

***** No. I'm pretty sure I'm parodying Warhammer 40k (Blood for the blood god/skulls for the skull throne), but pretty much all of my knowledge of that franchise comes from pop culture osmosis and not actually engaging with the games/books.

** This was the basis of a fic I'd started, where all purebloods had some degree of inhuman ancestry in their family tree, due to rituals that mingled their blood with a magical creature in order to ensure that every child was a wizard. The Weasleys were going to be redcaps, explaining their trademark red hair, while the Prewetts would be ghouls, explaining the ghoul in the attic at the Burrow.

Dumbledore was going to be part dragon, explaining how he was so adept at both transfiguration (in D&D, high dragons are skillful shapeshifters and intelligent, well known for having half-dragon offspring), and at finding uses for dragon's blood.

The Gaunts were going to be Dementors, the Blacks were going to be Vampires, the Bullstrodes going to be hags, the Parkinsons were going to be dwarves, the Lovegoods were going to be fairies and/or ghosts, the Notts were going to be giants, Quirrel notes that he'd always had a gift with trolls, the Zabinis were going to be part Siren, and I think the Longbottoms were House Elves, and obviously Flitwick was part Goblin, while Metamorphmagi were the result of very old boggart blood resurfacing.

** This is really awesome! In this ficlet, I'm curious what the heritage of James Potter is then, if all the other wizarding familys are mostly mixed? I'm not sure what JKR's current version of the Potter family tree looks like, but I remember a Dorea Black in there, and it's hard to imagine the Potter family being so prominent and strong (James was an auror) without some inhuman genealogy.
