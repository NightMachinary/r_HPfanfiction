I LOVE fics that focus on villains. And while OP, morally grey, Lord Hadrian Black-Potter-Slytherin-Griphook-Dumbledore-Riddle has its place in my heart, I am searching for a fic with a well-developed dark/villain as the protagonist. I'm thinking on the lines vaguely of Coriolanus Snow from Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (if any of you are THG fans), Thanos from the MCU, or Emily Riddle from Limpieza de Sangre. I'm looking for a villain you /almost/ start to agree with a teensy bit if you don't pay attention, or a scenario where neither the hero nor villain are good, or a villain who is sympathetic and three-dimensional, or something on the lines of good/meh goals & bad method where the justification is “the ends justify the means”. No qualifications, just preferably no intense smut. I also love “slow burn” villain stories --- where a character goes dark slowly --- but this is not a necessity

** Although I wouldn't call the Hermione in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]] evil, she was certainly on the way.

** It's an odd pairing for sure, but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3037156/1/Twelve-Dark-Moons][this fanfiction]] explores Voldemort in a different light that I found myself oddly enjoying.
