Even though I love the aesthetics of a black HG, I can't help but wonder if that would really be plausible, considering both her parents were dentists in the 80s. Still, I'm not from the UK and am not really sure how likely it would have been to see a black or interracial couple, both (man and woman) with university and possibly higher education degrees and a quite possible high income in that setting. Any thoughts? Please correct me if I'm making any wrong assumptions :) Edit: I also think the way she talks and acts may be sort of posh, suggesting an "upperclass" upbringing


** London (I'm assuming Hermione's from that area) is a lot more diverse then the rest of the country is so it wouldn't be impossible but there's a lot of historic discrimation against BAME (Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic) students. Especially in higher education and older institutions.

** There's a [[https://dentistry.co.uk/2020/06/16/black-lives-matter-experiences/][collection of interview from British black dental professionals]] and they all mentioned the rarity of fellow Blacks in school and career. [[https://acda-uk.org/][ACDA UK]] were only founded in 2012, hinting it took that long for enough of them to start the organization.

Even if we go with the idea that Wizarding Britain is far more color blind than their Muggle counterpart, when Hermione mentioned her parents are dentists the Muggleborn and half-bloods would likely notice how rare they are.

*** When talking about stereotypes, how common is it for dentists in UK to be Jewish? For us (Czechia) before the Holocaust, a girl with bushy hair, bookworm, and with two parents dentists (or lawyers), had to be Jewish. Thus may head-canon that Hermione's grandparents were German-speaking refugees from Reichenberg (what's now Liberec) in then Czechoslovakia.

** Blacks made up 1% of 1979's UK population, but since you have to account for her parents too, I'd say the chance of Hermione being black is less than 1%.

But 1% is not a small odds either, considering COVID's Infection Fatality Rate is only 0.6% according to US CDC, but has given the world so much fear and death.

****** The wiki says he's "dark-skinned," and cites HBP, though I don't have a copy nearby to verify that. And "dark-skinned" isn't exactly conclusive either, but between that and the movies, it's definitely very solidly held fanon at least. And it doesn't really ruin my point anyway.

  Harry glanced around at their fellow guests. He recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall *black* boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two seventh-year boys Harry did not know and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there, Ginny.

  "Now, do you know everyone?" Slughorn asked Harry and Neville. "Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course--"

******* Oh I see agree with your point I was just curious. I tended to think of him as more olive-skinned, but likely I am remembering a fanfic that had him as Italian.

******** Zabini is an Italian name, so it is pretty common for people to give him a connection to Italy. But that doesn't mean he isn't also black, or at least some sort of multiracial. It's also not clear if Zabini is the name of his mother, biological father, or one of his many stepfathers.

***** Well, Lee, Dean, and Blaise are never actually described as black in the books. Lee was only described as having dreadlocks, Dean was described as black only in the original draft of PS and the American version of the books, and Blaise was just described as dark skinned.

That leaves only two black people in the books, and given that there are much more than 200 characters, they're underrepresented.

Edit: Oops. Zabini was actually described as black. My point still stands though.

Even if there aren't any other references in the books to his race, I'm pretty sure that like 99% of people with dreadlocks are black, so this is still a very strong indicator. If nothing else, Rowling would know that most people would assume the person with dreadlocks is probably black, so she would be more likely to specifically say if that wasn't the case.

Are you also going to argue that Cho Chang wasn't Asian because the books never explicitly said that she was?

#+end_quote

I'm usually pretty resistant to accepting anything as canon that wasn't actually in the books, but even I think that's a bit of a stretch. Rowling still very clearly intended for him to be black, and he even shows up in some of her early art as a black kid.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It really doesn't. Even if we only accept the three characters who were explicitly said to be black in the British versions of the books, they're not underrepresented. There may be more than 200 characters, but only if you count every single minor character who was nothing more than a name or look into canon outside of the books. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_characters][Wikipedia's list of Harry Potter characters]] is not exhaustive, but it at least seems to have every character who got more than a passing mention. It barely hits 200 characters, and at least two dozen of them aren't even human.

Three out of about two hundred characters is pretty much exactly how much representation you would expect. And even if there are a few hundred more characters that are technically mentioned in the books, they're all such minor characters that you can't conclusively say anything about them except maybe their names, so there's no reason to expect that a few of them wouldn't be black too.

Honestly, I'm not even sure what your point really is. You're arguing that blacks are underrepresented, while also trying to argue that as few characters are black as possible.

** Funnily enough I just finished reading a fanfic with a black (mixed race really) Hermione that puts some focus on this topic in story and author notes. Its a 56,000 word one shot though. I'd rather enjoyed it.
