:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi I'm looking for a fic mentioned in passing in another group: This fic is where Harry tops Draco most of the entire fic, and Harry REFUSES to tell Draco about the man who took his other virginity, only come to find out that there was some time travel thing and Draco dies and it was Draco the whole time.

Idk the name of it, but it was beautifully written.
