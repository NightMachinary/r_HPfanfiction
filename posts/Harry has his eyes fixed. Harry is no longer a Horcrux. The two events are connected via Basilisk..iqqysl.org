Ginny Weasley could not stop crying. She'd almost done what Voldemort himself had been unable to - she'd caused /Harry Potter/ to die, or near enough.

It was her own suggestion that Harry, her childhood hero turned crush, get his eyes fixed at that shop in Diagon Alley. It was her writing in that diary that caused the Basilisk to turn loose - she started realizing it now, her mind clearing up due to the shock.

Some part in the back of her mind argued that things could have been worse - she woke up just in time to see Harry breathing shallowly on the floor, a dead Basilisk right next to him. He'd survived the impossible again - he'd met a Basilisk's gaze head-on, and while he was grievously harmed the /Basilisk/ was the one that now lay dead in the hallway.

The shock of seeing Harry laying there, a dead basilisk within spitting distance of her childhood hero, was enough to clear some strange cobwebs from her mind. Several blank spots in her memory filled themselves - every time she'd blacked out, gone to that second floor bathroom, and hissed at the sink to set the Basilisk on people. Every time she'd felt a strange compulsion to keep writing and not tell anyone.

In a fit of rage at her paper manipulator, she ran up to the dead Basilisk, yanked a fang from it, and drove it as deep into the black leather and parchment as she was able. Black smoke and ink came from what had undoubtedly been some very dark magic within the book...

--------------

Welp, had another plotbunny.

I honestly think my brain is going too all-over-the-place with this one to make it anything better than what I've written - but I think someone else might be able to do the concept more justice, and maybe explore a bit of what happens next, with Harry surviving /two/ impossibilities and Ginny's guilty feelings at what happened.


** I think in the moment jabbing the book in its mouth and slamming it would be easier and more visceral than yanking a tooth out; the tooth had come out on its own in canon, right? But the shorter battle described here makes that less likely

*** My headcanon is basilisk fangs are biologically inclined to come out, to get as much of the leftover venom into the victim as possible. Kinda like bee stingers, except the Basilisk would just regrow its fangs instead of dying. That'd make them fairly easy to remove postmortem.

The fang comes out /way/ too easily in canon for it to be meant to stay in the snake.

**** I thought that the fang broke off when it was lodged in Harry's arm.

***** It does say "splintered", but then again that just means it broke off anywhere. Stuff's interconnected in the body, doesn't mean it can't be made to break off - see also, bee stingers and salamander tails.

Harry also refers to it as the whole fang, not a splintered-off part, elsewhere in the book.

Either way, I think it's a weird bit to pick apart in this prompt.

****** Oh, I wasn't trying to pick apart your prompt, I was just clarifying as I didn't quite remember what happened. I think that you have an interesting idea with this.
