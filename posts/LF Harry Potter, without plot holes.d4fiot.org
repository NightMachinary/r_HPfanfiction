  Instead of putting the key to immortality and infinite wealth in a school full of children as a trap, put it... anywhere else?

"Today, it seems, Professor Dumbledore has decided to give all Potions students a /treat/," Snape sneered, spitting out the final word as though it was poison. "Far be it from me to question our venerable Headmaster... though I doubt very much that any of you miserable dunderheads would comprehend the value of what is being presented today. Nevertheless, the esteemed Headmaster has deemed it /appropriate/ to allow your ignorant little minds to gape and gasp at a /priceless/ masterpiece..."

Hermione Granger looked as though she was about to vault from her seat and scream at the professor to get on with it, so great was her anticipation. Harry exchanged a glance with Ron. They were both reluctantly interested by the prospect of this valuable object. Snape's voice had an undertone of admiration that Harry had never heard from the condescending, perpetually dissatisfied Potions Master.

Snape flicked his wand. A large, opaque orb was levitated out from his office, drifting steadily across the classroom before coming to a halt before Snape. Snape's eyes glittered as they stared down at the orb, a strange expression on his face that made Harry uncomfortable. The class was deadly silent. Even Granger was perfectly still in her seat, both hands - for once - folded in her lap.

"Behold," Snape whispered. With a wave of his wand, the orb turned transparent. All the students leaned forward, their breath held. Harry craned his neck, unable to help himself despite the distant thought of how very much like Aunt Petunia he must look. Within the glass orb, nestled at the curved bottom, was... a rock.

Harry swallowed his disappointment, slumping back into his seat. It was a pretty rock, certainly - a unique, reddish-brown with dark veins sprawling over the surface. But...

"It's a rock," Ron blurted out. His comment inspired a ripple of snickers.

"Five points from Gryffindor for speaking out of turn," Snape said, quick as a whip. Harry rather thought the words had already been at the tip of the professor's tongue, even before Ron had said anything. "Thank you, Mr Weasley, for the demonstration of your extraordinary idiocy, which I have no doubt your Housemates share... This is no mere rock, as you have so inelegantly put it. Mr Potter!"

"Yes, sir!" Harry said, startled.

"Do you know what this object is?"

Harry blinked. He glanced at Ron, who shrugged. "It's... a magical rock," Harry ventured.

"Yes," Snape whispered. "How very /astute./ A /magical rock./"

Harry flushed.

"Perhaps Miss Granger knows? No? Well, our resident /know-it-all/ is stumped, at last," Snape sneered. This drew laughter from the Slytherin's side of the class, though that quickly faded when Snape turned his attentions onto them. When it became apparent that no one in the class, not even Malfoy, knew what the rock was, Snape tutted. "I see you are all as woefully ignorant as I presumed... the Headmaster's gesture is certainly wasted on all of you, as I had told him it would be. This 'magical stone', fools, belongs to Nicolas Flamel." There was a sharp, collective gasp. "Yes, at least, some of you know of Nicolas Flamel, I see... I suppose not all hope is lost. Miss Greengrass, you seem to be one of the more better-informed - though clearly still quite lacking if you were incapable of recognising the artifact..."

"It's the Philosopher's Stone!" It was a blonde Slytherin girl who spoke, a quiet girl who often was seen at Pansy's side.

Snape's lip curled in an approximation of satisfaction. "Very good. Five points to Slytherin for not being a complete dunderhead. Indeed, this is the Philosopher's Stone and -"

The classroom door was blasted open with a roar of wind and heat, prompting several shrill screams. Harry's scar burned at the exact same moment, the pain so intense that he thought he lost consciousness for a moment... When he came to, he found a strange sight before him. Stuttering, cowering Professor Quirrell had his wand pointed at Snape, a cold, hard look in his eye that did not seem right in his face at all.

"Oh dear," Snape said dryly. "Quirinus."

"Severus," Quirrell said without a trace of a stutter. "The Stone, if you would."

Random plot bunny that came up when I read that line. Like what if they'd just not even bothered with hiding the Stone and paraded it around the castle?

Anyway, it was supposed to be more cracky but it somehow turned out like this...

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)

*** Someone's clearly forgotten there are plenty of Rated M fanfics out there already, and that FANFICTION is, by definition, not strictly beholden to its source material. Isn't that what you people always whine and bitch about here, about "canon railroading" and "stations of canon" and shit? Thought you'd be happy someone wanted to write some fresh, new shit away from the main, tired old plots...but whatever, I guess...

You should be encouraging this guy, not shitting on him. Unless you WANT to keep seeing the same old bullshit, again and again and again?

Fuck, you're the reason people keep copying each other ad nauseam with that Daphne Ice Queen 11 year old political bullshit. Because you don't want to see anything different from your little comfort zone.
