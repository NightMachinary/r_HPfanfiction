Can anyone recommend a good fic with a cold/emotionless Harry, kind of like the one in "The Art of Self-Fashioning" with passable grammar?


** Definitely passable grammar, definitely cold Harry. Linkffn(10493620)

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.

  In canon, Harry sought the acceptance of the adults around him. Tom Riddle sought to exercise power over everyone else. This Harry never wants to feel helpless again. Sociopath!Harry, some minor Harry/Fleur.

  When Harry Potter does things, it's never in halves. By the time he arrives at Hogwarts, our little champion has discovered a way to keep everyone at bay. What happens when you've taught yourself to become untouchable? Shameless AU. Rated M for dark themes, eventual slash & implications of child neglect. Happily Ever After, Voldemort style.
