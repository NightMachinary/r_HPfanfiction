Which stories have the best dueling scenes? Do you have a favourite one that stood out for one reason or another? What makes a dueling scene good in your opinion? Flashy new magic, creative use of known spells, a lot of running around...?


** I have to say, in the Denarian trilogy, there are some really incredible duels. Some of my favorites definitely. There were very solid duels in the Firebird trilogy as well.

** The dueling portions of The Lie I've Lived, by JBern, were pretty good.

*** The dueling scenes in Lie I've Lived were a breath of fresh air to me. Often Harry is portrayed as a tank who just goes into battle wands blazing and just uses sheer power. Lie I've Lived really highlighted the transfiguration aspect of the HP Universe and it did so with a solid explanation. Great fic, one of the best.

** For me it's mostly the creative use of known magic plus a good dose of 'running around'. Flashy new magic can work, but a lot of authors don't handle it well and it starts resembling a DBZ crossover with ridiculously over the top displays of magical power.

** I've always been of the opinion that the best dueling scenes are realistic ones.

You know, where a single hit can potentially cripple/kill you and you and your opponent are desperately dodging for their lives while trying to get that one critical hit in and there's no towering constructs and rituals and transfigured golems and summoned dragons, just a quick light show that ends with a winner and a loser.

*** Yeah... No, magic is magic because it can make the fantastical a reality, stuff like golems and dragons and snakes made of fire and animated statues and water elementals are all far *far* better than a lightshow, which is why the movie fights where bad.

** The most important criterion for me is that the battles---and by extension the magical system in general---must be realistic inside the story's universe. This means that if everyone has more or less the same access to knowledge and the same levels of power, schoolchildren must not be able to stand against---much less so dominate---grown wizards in a direct confrontation. Even only /escaping/ from a mature enemy should not be an easy task for them. Same applies to magic as a WoMD (if a voldemort can create a devastating virus, how is anyone even alive by 1990+?), to magic as a tool for gathering even more magical power (same as above---only several very powerful wizards would've remained in such a case with everybody else rendered squibs), etc.

Other than that I also like when the author builds a detailed magical system and also tries to fix JKR's bugs in the canon.

So, in this context, here's a matrix with some generally good stories rated through the above-discussed qualities.

- 2. Realism --- 0 (no realism, Deus ex machina solutions) -- 10 (realistic battles and plot development);
- 3. Originality --- 0 (no original magical system or battle descriptions) -- 10;
- 4. Amount of battle scenes --- 0 -- 10;
- 5. Ignored consequences --- 0 (robust and stable world-building) -- 10 ([[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsAlwaysDoomed][The World Is Always Doomed]]);
- 6. Plot and Power armours --- 0 (aSoIaF) -- 10 (imperial stormtroopers everywhere);
- 7. Overall quality --- 0 -- 10.

***** I agree with [[/u/denarii]] - they appear to be backwards. The preferred value would be a high one, so stable world-building and the 'all Should overbuy Insurance awarding Fatality' would seem to be the optimal 10's.

On the Way to Greatness has low values, yet Forging the Sword is mid-high, when both are essentially canon-compliant, with the former actually killing earlier and more often than canon.

*** You sure put a lot of thought into this. I'll definitely take a look at the stories. Your first entry makes me wonder though, does the Well Groomed Mind really have dueling scenes? I only remember them being mentioned in passing (the lessons Barty gave Harry). Thanks for sharing.

**** Thanks for pointing that out as well, I must've confused it with another story which had one or two confrontations throughout the story. I'll put a 1 there for mind attacks and training sequences. : )
