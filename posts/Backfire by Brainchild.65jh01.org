Can anyone help me find the fic Backfire by Brainchild. It was taken down by the author a few years ago as they wanted to pursue their original work. I just thought someone might have it downloaded. Thanks so much!


** I have two copies. One is labelled "original", the other as a rewrite (but both by the same username, although an author's note in the rewrite says it's two seperate authors).

The original is 218k, 17 chapters, rated T, with the following summary:

#+begin_quote
  This is the story of the girl who stood next to The Boy Who Lived, the second of two young women who looked evil in the face and did not flinch, who stumbled upon the kind of love that comes along once in a generation. In the Prelude to Destiny universe.
#+end_quote

The rewrite is 253k, 22 chapters, rated K+, with the following summary:

#+begin_quote
  School was a game Ginny Weasley didn't have to play particularly hard. Lessons came naturally. Exams were easy. She was in control. But the summer after the Department of Mysteries her ordered life starting blasting itself apart. And it was awesome.
#+end_quote

Which do you want? Or both?

*EDIT:* Can now be downloaded here: [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwfE6l6RtZAsODdoSmllRGxyb1E][original]]; [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwfE6l6RtZAsU2trb09yWEZHY2c][rewite]]

*** Thanks so much! Could I possibly have both? Or if you can only send one then I guess the rewrite? I really appreciate it.

**** Both is fine. They're in .txt files at the moment. You cool with that, or want me to convert to something more readable like PDF or epub? (Wouldn't take me long to do and it's no trouble for me.)

***** Oh wow - I would really love either an epub or a pdf (whatever is easiest for you) but only if it really is no trouble. Thank you thank you!
