Here is [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]]'s list of the top Harmony fics, chosen by Adjusted Score (which is a ranking based on the number of people who voted and the vote). So if you ever wanted a list of the Top 20/10 (Longer vs. Shorter) Harmony fics, here you go:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPharmony/wiki/index#wiki_top_20_longer_fics.2890k.2B_words.29]]

Edit: To clarify, since this seems to come up. /This is not my personal list, it's what [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]] voted on. There are rankings here I disagree with. There are rankings here I think are great too./


** Courting Hermione Granger - seriously? That fic is so bad, its full of 'Lord Potter', dragon-animagus, Ron-is-a-rapist bullshit.

Keira Marcos has some good stuff - I enjoy several of her Stargate Atlantis fics, but I couldn't get through half of Courting Hermione Granger, it was eye-rollingly bad.

Same for the Soulmate bond - its been a long time since I attempted that one, but I know I didn't finish it because it was just so bad.

Keira Marcos is a good writer, but her characters rarely have any flaws and she gives them too much power without any balance.

A lot of these fics are not up to the standard I would consider for a Top 20 of Harmony. What was the criteria for being chosen for the list?

*** If you leave out abandoned fics, I'm sure the number of good stories would be reduced drastically. Most of my favorite stories are abandoned.

**** Fair enough - sounds like you were pretty thorough! And I'm certainly not trying to be mean to you (it obviously took time and effort to orchestrate) or those who enjoyed those fics.

The biggest problem with trying to compile a list like this is that it is so subjective. One person's 'favourite fic ever!' is another's 'not a chance in hell'.

And the fact that Harry Potter has so many fics (750,000 on FF.net) means that it can be hard to find the jewels in the sand. When faced with so many fics people need to cut the options down to make it more manageable - I myself don't read incomplete fics meaning I probably miss many good stories.

People tend to sort by number of favourites or reviews in order to find something they will enjoy, which generally finds fics that appeal to the widest range of people and therefore (in my opinion) play it quite safe content wise and fail to take risks. Some of my favourite fics have less than a few hundred reviews, and even less favourites, and they end up buried by the multitude of new or popular fics.

** Vox Corporis should not be #1 on ANY list. The first chapter would be a great one-shot. But the next 67, yes that is 67, chapters just drag on. This fic is extremely overrated and did not age well. Of course this is just one harmony shipper's opinion.

*** tbf most shippy fics, regardless of what particular ship it is, are barely passible. h/hr just tends to be especially meh because the people who write and read it are still the saltiest motherfuckers alive over the ship not being canon. Which is a shame, because if they got over hating on the Weasleys for one goddamn minute, they'd realise there's actually a fairly interesting relationship to explore between Harry and Hermione.

Thank you for the LOLs. And I agree, most H/Hr comes hand-in-hand with lazy bashing and insta-love nonsense.

*** Thats the way I feel about my main ship too (Drarry). The top 40 ranked by Kudos on Ao3 has about 8 that I would say are really good and the rest are a mix of PWP, OOC, badly executed tropes and Lomonaaeren. Who is reading (and liking!) these fics? Is it teenagers? In my ideal universe, Ao3 and ffn would have a way to remove comments, favorites and kudos left by anyone under 20.

** IMO you shouldn't have things you haven't read on the list.

I have read everything on that list several times over and some of them really don't deserve their particular spots.

Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor is not exactly bad but putting a glorified smut + parody fic in slot #5 is an insult to everything else in the top 20 and more.

** I am a member of [[/r/hpharmony]], but I did not vote as I have not read the majority of the stories listed. (And I didn't have time to catch up during the voting period.) The subreddit is still new. I hope we can put things to a vote, for a longer period, once we have more members and are better known. I believe that will give a more accurate depiction of the top stories for the ship/fandom.

** This discussion is mainly about difference between hpfanfiction and hpharmony demographics. From list I would guess that 80% of voters were 30year old housewifes.

I had seen but do not understand why they want fiction after Hogwarts where canon plots are resolved so they could focus on romance, modelling Ron after their husband so they could divorce and marry Draco, being in love with two men and other serious stuff.

On other hand hpfanfiction contain vocal group of males (me included) where plot comes first, want cool battles and on ocassion Harry having harem of hundred witches.

If one did same list here there wouldn't be much overlap. Here number one would be Harry potter and temporal beacon or something other with similar genre. Only fic that I am certain that would be in both lists is harry potter and champions champion which is great.
