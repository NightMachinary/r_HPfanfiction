Reading fanfiction got me about 1-2 years ago, and I must say it's quite addictive.

I find some really addictive and interesting, and others very bad or frustrating (I guess for other people it might be the other way around.)

But overall I find that within each story there is often a reccuring pattern of scenes. Though what is repeated is different between each story. It quite feels like the authors have their bread-and-butter and keep making more of the same.

For instance I just read Faery heroes, which I enjoyed, but it's like robbing death eaters / doing some pack-back at Hogwarts, then again : >! robbing death eathers / doing some pack-back at Hogwarts!< and repeat to the end.

For other stories it will be entirelly something else, but the pattern is often there and impact the story quality.


** A consequence of JKR having Malfoy show up at least twice every book to be embarrassed and adding Snape to scenes just to be a cunt.

** You'll find that the longer you're reading fanfic the more esoteric your tastes go. One day you're trying out Harry/Hermione as you're bored of Harry/Ginny fics and in a year or two you're wondering why there's such a lack of indy!Harry/Lisa/Luna fics out there now that you're bored of the regular stuff.

*** It's funny I actually noticed that happenning. First I wanted only things very close to canon or completing canon. And now I don't care at all and I'm indeed looking for things like harry/bella or harry/hermione/luna lol

** Formulas in writing are a thing, and a rather common one at that.

A good example of it is actually romance novels: pick any two Nora Roberts book (and she has hundreds to choose from) and they'll be almost identical. Each one has its own characters (even if they're often similar archetypes), each one will have their own setting, and hook, and so on. But they're all the same. Don't like romance? Mary Higgins Clark writes suspense and does something very similar. And both women are filthy rich (well, were. Clark died earlier this year).

*** Danielle Steel does this too. And she starts at least one sentence on every page with the word "And" which really annoys me.

**** Yeah, oodles of prolific authors are like that. Then there's 'formula fiction' where you get different characters in the same setting: just look at high fantasy. Medieval world? Check. Dragons and evil wizards and sword-fights and... hey, let's throw in a prophecy or an ancient evil! That'll make it unique!

Isn't there that theory that there's only llke, five different stories? And that we just keep making up new ways to tell them? (I don't remember the number, obviously)

***** It's doesn't apply to "every" story, but the monomyth, or "Hero's Journey" say that a loooot of story (from Harry Potter to Lord of the Ring), follow the exact same pattern, just told differently.

****** So, what I'm thinking of is the "seven basic plots". You can read a review of the theory/book [[https://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2005/10/the_seven_basic.html][HERE]] and those plots if you so desire. The book itself is [[https://www.amazon.ca/Seven-Basic-Plots-Tell-Stories/dp/0826480373][here.]] There was a pretty big to-do about the book when it was released iirc.

** One popular fic does something, and a hundred thousand others copy it.

I call it the Ward Effect. Named after the constant, sometimes gratuitous use of the term "ward" in Potter fic, despite it never once being used in cannon. Though it could also be called the Shotgun Effect, after the oft-repeated "quote" of JK Rowling saying that a Muggle with a shotgun will always beat a wizard that no one has ever managed to produce the original source of.

** Ive been reading fanfic for ages and what I've found that I can still enjoy basic plots and reacurring scenes when the writing makes it feel like something new. And generally trying diffrent things out of your basic zone.
