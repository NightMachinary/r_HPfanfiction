We only had one suggestion that actually met the theme, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4238384/1/Aucune-Defense-Pour-Toi][Aucune Defense Pour Toi]]. I read it just a couple months ago myself, but I'll be interested to hear what others think.


** Do we have an archive of or links to previous months book club posts?

** I had never read this pairing before, and I quite enjoyed the story. However, here are some things that irritated me:

- This is not specific to this story as I have seen it many times before, but each time it causes me to lose a little bit of interest in the fic: The author, in order to underline the severity of the problems which the characters encounter, draws out the certain plot elements over long chapters, often causing the protagonists to repeat themselves and overall to seem stubborn and unwilling to resolve a conflict. In this case, [[/spoiler][Fleur's continued taking of the Nun's Potion, despite its obvious physical side-effects and her own qualms about it creating distance between Hermione and herself]] seemed rather out of character, relative to how she is presented in the rest of the story. Similarly, why did Fleur think it a good idea to keep Hermione in the dark as to the meaning of the necklace for several chapters? It is certainly hard to imagine canon Hermione accepting this sort of recitence.

- Another peeve was that the author made no remark as to the Second War or the struggle against You-Know-Who right up until the last few paragraphs of the last chapter, in which we learn that /"The war, despite their wishing, loomed above them all"/ , and Hermione must depart to help Harry and Ron in their quest after all. Not at any point beforehand was the subject of the War broached, nor was Hermione's involvement in a wartime Golden Trio. Bit of a nasty surprise there, as it leaves the whole relationship in a very precarious spot.

Now, here are some things I found particularly well-written and generally interesting:

- The author manages to convey a certain quiet "foreignness" to the French characters' speech which was far more enjoyable to read than JKR's horrendous Fleur-speech.

- The use of some one-word sentences ('Forward.') at certain points in the story felt forced at first, but it quickly blended in to the text, and their use becomes more sparing and thus significant later on.

Romance is often hard to pace, and fanfiction authors don't always manage to give their story an even flow, but outside of the complaint I raised above, the pacing in this story was remarkably good. The main characters do not overpower one another, as they both take the lead at different times in the story. Despite how much bad I have said about the plot, I spent an entire day reading this fic non-stop, which should say something as to how captivating the author can be. Overall, an enjoyable first F/Hr fic which made me interested in the pairing.

Thank you for the suggestion [[/u/denarii]], I have really enjoyed the last couple of Book Clubs. Keep it up!

It's been a while since I read it, but iirc [[/spoiler][it came down to her insecurity and anxiety about "forcing" anything on Hermione even when Hermione was clearly reciprocating her feelings. I think there was also pent up resentment and distrust of her Veela side for putting them in that situation. Her issues had obviously created a self-destructive streak.]]

Personally, I liked how this fic avoided the confident, aloof, unrealistically 'perfect' characterization often used for Fleur, even if she turned the angst up to 11.

And thanks, good to hear that people are still enjoying it. :) Participation has declined somewhat.

**** I can see now how that explains it. One thing I found interesting as well was [[/spoiler][how calm Fleur was in the face of death from literal heartbreak]], though this might be a part of a mechanism to try and reign in her feelings after the [[/spoiler][Veela incident]]. Regarding the reduced participation, I think it might be beacuse Fleur/Hermione is an uncommon pairing and even though selecting fanfiction by its pairing is far from optimal, most of us do it anyway. Slash is a small subset, femslash even smaller, etc.

***** There wasn't much participation in the suggestions thread for this month, which was a bit disheartening. This was the only fic that fit the theme I chose. I thought "unusual pairings" was a theme that would yield some interesting suggestions too.

** Quick question. I see that the start says that it's a companion story. Do I need to read the other story to understand what's going on?

*** No. It's basically a retelling of the other story from Fleur's perspective instead of Hermione's. I think the original is incomplete as well.
