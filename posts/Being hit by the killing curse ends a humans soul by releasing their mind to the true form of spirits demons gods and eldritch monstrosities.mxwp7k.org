But when harry survives it he is able to see them all he gains a relatively good reputation among those he sees. He gains favour with many gods and goddesses cold neutrality form the demons and intrest from the eldritch entities

He has a luna like personality of talking about creatures (spirits) but sometimes mentions God's demons and on a very extreme case he mentioned one of the elder beings but that ended with the child in the hospital for a few months

Eventually when he gets to hogwarts he learns that the founders invoked a ritual to bless the grounds of hogwarts by certain gods and goddesses

Salazar requested the blessing of the snake god JÃ¶rmungandr to bless the grounds with protection from beast and wishing to harm those who call the castle home

Rowena requested the blessing of Athena to bless this school with protection for those seeking to learn the intricacies of magic

Helga requested the blessing of Moritasgus to bless the school so that those who are healing here may live long and wisend

Godric requested the blessing of Virtus to bless those that dell upon the grounds to be courageous of hear and stand for what the believe in

Harry makes friends with these God's and goddesses by being himself and helping those around him

. . . .

Well i didn't mean for this to be quite this long but it is i tried to make sure the God's weren't all from the same pantheon i couldn't think of a god for helga so i searched badger god apparently there a cletic epithet of healing and there name either meant sea badger or great badger

Anyway have fun wuth the prompt my only thing is harry has to be friends with luna the bond over being able to both see nargles

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
