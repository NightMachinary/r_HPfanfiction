I read this years ago, so I do not remember title or author. What I do remember: - hp is somehow transported to Konoha and grows up with naruto in the orphanage - the wizards find hp and kidnaps him back to the wizarding world. This happens during naruto's journey with Jiraya -so team 7 goes to Hogwarts to get hp back 'home'. This coincides with canon 5th year I hope someone knows this
