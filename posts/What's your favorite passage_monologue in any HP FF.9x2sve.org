I'm currently reading linkffn(Antithesis) and had to read Adrian/Harry's speech to his parents multiple times. It was that great and brought some tears to my eyes not gonna lie.

I was curious what other great passage's are there out there.


** When Harry and Luna are watching Luna's mother doing a spell called Imago Dei from HP and PoS inside Lockhart's (kappa) Pensieve. I get chills from it even remembering it.

I also love that passage from Realignment that Harry says to Grindewald, "I've killed immortals before". BAMF moment.

EDIT: I also remembered(actually, I remembered a few, but just gonna say this one) a cute moment from Grow Young with Me, where Harry is debating telling Abby about magic, and he asks for Hermione for help to find a loophole, and she says "I'd do anything for you, idiot". It just summarizes their friendship of almost 20 years in a single sentence that brought me to tears, and this is coming from a Hermione Hater. (TBH, I hate the common fanon Hermione's, not every single one. This is one I absolutely love, aswell as the one from Stages of Hope)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** From Matou Shinji and the Philosophers Stone:

#+begin_quote
  *Hello. My name is Tom Riddle. Who might you be?*

  So...it /was/ an enchanted book. Well, this could be interesting indeed. But, she figured there was no need to be honest about who she was. In her experience, lies often worked better than truth. So, it seemed only fitting that she thought of the most powerful practitioner of witchcraft she had encountered - why, the very one the Dark Lord himself had once feared - and had borrowed his name as a talisman to conjure by.

  To her, *My name is Albus Dumbledore*, seemed a most appropriate response.

  Unfortunately, the diary didn't seem to agree, as "Tom" promptly stopped writing after that.

***** I still haven't read the last 2 chapters. But my thoughts so far are:\\
There were some plot holes at the start where you tried to fit the story with canon.\\
But the story is really unique and well researched in how abuse and trauma affects a person. The characterization of Adrian was really well done and I have to say it brought tears to my several times.

I read the Abuse chapter 3 times already and was emotional every time. I loved it.\\
There are not many stories that can show emotions that well (the other one I would say is Stages of Hope).

Oh another negative is maybe, I always skipped your A/N, because there were just too many spoilers.

Also you said there was a spin-off somewhere of the story. Where could you find that?

********** Hello! I had to grab my laptop so I could properly censor the spoiler section!

/The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches ... Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies ... And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not ... And either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives .../

Alright, lets go!

/Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies .../ For this bit, the 'him' refers to Adrian. The idea of a Dark Lord is basically a "powerful being which is dark", since the parasite is inherently dark and Adrian is powerful, he fulfils the requirements in a weird backwards way. Plus the fact he was the heir to Voldemort, he inherited the lord position after Voldemort died. In the chapter Abuse, towards the end Mylla states how Adrian's parents have failed him three times, first as a son, second as a student, third as a human being. This directly relates to the 'born to those who have thrice defied [Adrian].

/born as the seventh month dies ../ This was a fun bit, because I always wondered if the prophecy meant that it was the prophecy child or the Dark Lord in question that was born as the seventh month dies. In this case, it's both.

/And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not .../ Marking him as his equal. There are multiple instances where Adrian does this in subtle ways- having Skylar hold him upright while facing Voldemort, allowing Skylar to be with him in his final moments. Generally, this ties down to Adrian giving Lutain to Skylar, marking him as his equal. The power that the Dark Lord knows not can be the general information regarding a Horcrux which Adrian never really learned about, or the basilisk fang he had in his pocket when he met and consoled Adrian on his deathbed.

/And either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives .../ Either Skylar dies at Adrian's hand (assumed at wandpoint which is why it's hand), or Adrian dies at Skylar's hand. This boils down to Adrian dying at Skylar's hand- literally, since Skylar stabs and kills Adrian with Adalonda's fang at his request. In turn, Skylar dies at Adrian's hand by infecting himself with the parasite (also tying into the marking as an equal). Skylar can't survive if Adrian lives due to the deal he made where Adrian is allowed to murder Skylar; Adrian can't live if Skylar does due to his own mental illness obsession with murdering Skylar.

*********** *Story spoilers below obviously*

--------------

OK, so I'll list the things I disagree with:

- *Dark Lord:* I'm still unsure about calling Adrian a Dark Lord. I guess it depends on your head canon, but for me a Dark Lord is someone, who opposes the ministry in a violent way. Also calling him a Dark Lord, because the parasite is "dark" is a little far fetched imo. Edit: Ok so I'm stupid and just realized that it doesn't depend on your HeadCanon but of course on whatever definition of Dark Lord suits you as a writer for your story :D. In that case it should have been made a little more clear.

- *Mark him as his equal:* The word "mark" is still not fulfilled here for me. But not taking the word mark so literal - Lutain was also with him in his last battle, and Lutain and Luna were there while he was dying, not only Skylar. And I never got the impression from the dialogue that he saw him as an equal, maybe expect of "Take Lutain, I don't trust anybody else", which he said AFTER they were discussing that part of the prophecy.

- *Power:* Neither the information about Horcruxes, nor him having a fang with him count as powers for me. A "Power" here for me would be a powerful ability or an item, gives the wielder power. Neither of the tow does that. Maybe you had another definition in mind.

- *Die:* I can see why Adrian can't live while Skylar lives, i.e. why he wants to kill him. Though why the opposite is true. They never reeaally sealed that deal magically, and even if, it sounds more like Skylar has a death wish to INSIST on Adrian killing him. I can imagine him begging Adrian to kill him at his deathbed, because he might have made his peace with death, but to basically straight out kill himself by drinking his blood was strange.

And I didn't get that Skylar would stab him with a fang, which would turn him into a Thestral. I thought he would simply somehow transmit the disease to Luna, who would transmit it further. Didn't Adalonda saythat one has to beg for his death (or life?), to then be turned into a Thestral?

************ First off, I want to stress that I 100% respect and appreciate your opinion. I genuinely don't mean to argue in any way, and this is all super helpful feedback that I can hopefully use in my future works to make sure I don't have any confusing parts! I think at this point of time, It would be easiest just to give my own take on your ideas, since your ideas already are completely reasonable and I essentially agree with them anyways. The last thing I'd ever want to do is to argue that the way someone interprets my work, is "wrong" just because I'm the author. Everyone gets to read and think about context in their own unique way, which is why I love using Reddit for discussions like this,

*Dark Lord Drama!* Like you said, most of the time people interpret Dark as someone who actively uses forceful or malicious means to someone affect others. Most times and in most stories, the word "dark" is synonyms for "antagonist" or "rebellion/opposing". In my story, I tried to make Dark equal to a category of magic itself. Thestrals are dark because they deal with death for their creation. Dark magic innately causes dark magic addiction. I tried to make it seem that dark and light were simply categories, not necessarily something reflecting your morals, but I completely agree that I didn't address this enough to make easy sense! I've already written out huge philosophical differences for Dark and Light magic so my next story wont have this same issue.

*Separate but Equal.* Your take if I comprehend correctly, was that Adrian didn't operate and generally act towards Skylar like he was his equal. Once again, this is completely my fault. I felt very rushed in the last few chapters and I didn't want to betray the dynamics I had created for both Skylar and Adrian, but I did try and display some sort of equality or reluctant respect towards one another. Skylar staying with Remus and Tonks when Adrian ran off. Skylar taking Lutain when Adrian ran off to kill Adalonda. Adrian asking for Skylar's help when he couldn't stand and see. I think that I should have stressed and fixed this earlier on and built more of a codependency in the earlier chapters, but the whole idea of a double prophecy came to me when I had only around eight chapters left to work with. I think I got a bit too ambitious honestly.

*Power Play.* I believe you stated that you take the idea of 'power' as something of a more physical property. I was using the idea of power more as a concept, or the ability to cause someone to act in a way they otherwise wouldn't have. (I believe that's a political science idealization of power? I'm not entirely sure.) I always thought that the information of the Horcruxes would be a complete swap of action for Adrian if he understood what exactly they were. I felt like they were a small bit of knowledge that Skylar could have used or mentioned to change Adrian's actions instantly. The fang also was something last minute- I was running low on time and trying to bludgeon this prophecy's wording to fit my lousy shaped container.

*He ded* Okay /yes,/ I completely agree. One of my earliest ideas was that Skylar would always be infected with the parasite at the very end, it was the easiest way to satisfy people who wanted Skylar to live, while others wanted him to die. Originally, Adrian forced Skylar to take it. Then Skylar accidentally got infected from cradling Adrian. Then I tried to work too much on the equality front and it would betray both Skylar and Adrian's character development for any of those to happen. I think it was rushed, needed another good bonding scene to get it to work completely, and maybe honestly in a few months I may go back to try and transition it easier.

And the thestral question! Yay! Alright, so, this is really easy to miss and I completely get why people are confused over this. The process of being bit by a basilisk is agonizing in itself. The curse takes place when a child is bitten, and during the venom process when they are dying, they begin to beg for death due to the agonizing pain of the injury. That means, that once someone is bit they do not instantly turn into a thestral. Instead, they suffer in prolonged agony until they are wishing/begging to die, and then the curse activates and turns them into a thestral. Adrian was stabbed with the fang, died incredibly agonizingly and his soul began to depart. The parasite which infected his soul departed as well- and was exposed to the thestral curse. Since the thestral curse was man-made, and the parasite was organic, the organic natural killer of evolution easily destroyed the thestral curse and essentially murdered all of the thestrals and Adrian then and there. No more thestrals can come into existence ever again, even if bit by a basilisk.

************* Nah, argue along. I'm personally of the opinion that after an artist finished his work, any opinion is as valid as his. But I have no issue with you arguing any of my points, and I have no issue with us not agreeing on something, or you dismissing one of my opinions.\\
Honestly, I just hope I don't make you feel bad by voicing my opinion.

*Dark:* I see your point here and agree with you. I understood the distinction between light and dark, and you made it clear in your fic. Thanks for pointing that out. My issue was more with the /Lord/ part in Dark Lord. There are of course different opinions of what a Dark Lord is, e.g. I read a fic once which labeled Dumbledore as a Light Lord. That's what I was trying to say in my edit, because I realized that it of course depends on the definition you choose for your fic. Though I might have missed it but I don't think you ever defined what a /Lord/ is for your story, which resulted in my confusion.

I rationally know there are massive issues with my story, but by hearing the problems I can work to make sure my next story is even better.

The Lord issue, completely valid. I think that if I had more time I would have dedicated more time to proper lordship or what exactly that title meant.

With the thestrals, the parasite destroyed the curse itself. The curse was existing in magic itself, so any basilisk biting a child anywhere in the world would have made a thestral. It was only coincidence that Adrian was at Hogwarts at that time. The parasite being exposed to the curse destroyed it. It was more that the curse itself was destroyed, which destroyed all the thestrals since that was what was holding them in the state of not alive and not quite dead.

** I know it's a controversial series but there were some beautiful lines in The Draco Trilogy and this is from Draco Dormiens:

#+begin_quote
  Harry spun around, walked a few paces away from her, and then turned to face her. ‚ÄúIt's funny,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut I was talking to Malfoy yesterday, and I actually realized something. I realized I owe you an apology.‚Äù

  She stared at him. He was so pale that his eyes seemed the only colour in his white face. He said, ‚ÄúI'm sorry. I'm sorry I never told you I loved you. I'm sorry I waited until it looked like I might lose you before I did anything. I'm sorry I lied to you when you asked me if I loved you. I just never thought of it like that. You've always been like a part of me, like how I can do magic. I never sit around thinking about how I love being able to do magic, what it means to me. It's just a part of my life. But if I lost it -- if I couldn't do magic anymore---‚Äù He broke off. ‚ÄúI'm not like Malfoy. I don't make fancy speeches. But I know what I feel.‚Äù

  Hermione just stared at him. She couldn't say a word. Couldn't even think a word.

  ‚ÄúI want you to be happy,‚Äù he said slowly. ‚ÄúAnd if I don't make you happy, then you should be with the person who does.‚Äù

  He looked at her. Harry. Who she had always loved, not because he was brave, although he was, or clever, although he was that too, or a good dancer (which he wasn't) -- but because he was kind, with the sort of kindness so rare among most people, and teenage boys in particular -- kindness that not only gives, but gives up.
#+end_quote

Also this part from The Boy Who Died a Lot:

#+begin_quote
  He missed Potter. He missed him like a fire in winter, melting the snow off soaked robes and the chill from his bones. He missed him like a thunderstorm in summer, wild and terrifying and beautiful, bringing the clean wash of rain to parched earth. He missed him like a hunger, like the taste of fresh fruit, the first trickle of water after starvation. He missed him like life; he missed him like death.

  He missed him like the heart he did not possess.

** This one's fresh in my mind at the moment. From The Debt of Time, where the class are learning the Riddikulus charm. It turns out that James' worst fear is hearing his sister having nightmares. There's something so perfect about a brother's worst fear being his little sister in pain.

#+begin_quote
  She sighed as she watched her brother approach the pile of confetti on the floor as it shifted in front of him. Though, instead of the large snake she had expected to see, all she saw was a set of double doors. Her mouth fell open as she looked up at those familiar white oak doors.

  "Is that my . . . ?" she began with panic in her voice, and almost immediately she felt two hands on her shoulders, holding her steady. One belonging to Remus, the other to Sirius. She turned back and the looks on their faces said that they knew what was about to happen.

  Mia looked on as James stared at the silent white doors, and suddenly a sharp scream echoed from behind them.

  Mia's scream.

  James stood frozen.

  "Go ahead, James," Professor Prewett encouraged as the door continued to hold back the screams behind it.

  "Riddikulus!" James finally shouted, and the scream behind the door turned to laughter.

  Instead of looking proud or even smug, he spun away from the boggart with his head low and his brow furrowed in anger. Without another word, he turned and walked out of the room, not giving a passing glance to anyone as he left.

** My most favorite passage from any Harry Potter fanfic is from /Faith and Understanding./

Long story short, it focuses on Ginny's friendship with Luna, and Ginny's musing therein.

It's really quite beautiful, giving glimpses to their friendship throughout their years at Hogwarts.

Ginny develops the habit of a guessing game, trying to figure things out about Luna before Luna tells her herself.

The story's ending lines are my very favorite passage:

#+begin_quote
  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

** The poem in the Unbroken Universe (it appears in all 4 parts) has always been really powerful to me.

#+begin_quote
  True friendships never really die

  And family isn't defined by blood

  It's made strong by bonds that won't break

  Tempered and tested by trials and pain

  What we are is brothers, and as such we remain

  Loyal to one another until the end

  And no matter what happens between this moment and then

  I shall always be thankful to have had such friends
#+end_quote

The whole trilogy (plus a prequel) is about what could have happened if Sirius had been Secret Keeper.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
