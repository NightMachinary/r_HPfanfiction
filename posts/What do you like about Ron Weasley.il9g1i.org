If you don't like him please ignore this post. I'm craving for good vibes only here!

I've recently reread the books and have a new-found love for Ron. It is even more intense 'cause I've been used to stupid and mean Ron in fanfiction.

He is actually hilarious and supportive to Harry, he's up to all kinds of crazy stuff which I find fun.

He's not perfect, but I feel like his flaws only make him more human. I also like the fact that he grows as a character and learns from his mistakes.

Your turn :)

*** I honestly love how turbulent his character is. How often do you read an article online and you nod along with it bc it makes good points and then a few days later you see the contrasting opinion and suddenly you begin questioning the first thing you read ? Well that to me represents the changeability of opinions and that's what Ron represents to me. At 11-16 it's totally legitimate for a kid to side with the mob or with whichever argument he heard first. He's a child and can't really have fully personal opinions or ideals bc most of it was taught. Growing up is realising that what you were taught isn't inherently right. And Ron Weasley really represents what growing up for me is, in the last book.

**** Not OP, but Zahila summerises my own opinion rather well. No matter what else I might say, he and the twins did more for Harry in that scene than any adult in the entire series other than Sirius when he returned to Britain in GoF despite facing summary execution.

As for why I don't like Ron, he is unrelatable to me. I am a single child and therefore his main theme "shadow of his siblings" is alien to me. Likewise the bouts of envy are just completely unappealing as a character trait (it is not an interesting flaw because it should not be a flaw amongst friends). Being envious of a friend is complelty normal, but if you are friends your reaction ought to be "what a lucky bastard, good for him" and not the shit Ron pulled in GoF (and whatever he was thinking that the Horcrux decided that Harry/Hermione was the best avenue at splitting the trio up again rather than projecting horrific fates for all Weasleys with the Death Eaters involved in those atrocities blaming Ron). It is understandable where he comes from and why, but it makes for an unappealing character IMO.

It is not that I dislike Ron, I am just completely uninvested in his character beyond his romance arcs (he was a massive dick to Lavender and Ron/Hermione is a mismatch for both of them).

***** His betrayals really aren't that bad.\\
While he's in the wrong in GoF it's hardly unusual for 14 year olds to fall out over stupid stuff and he comes to his senses soon enough.

Deathly Hallows is decidedly worse, though I can certainly understand his frustration, they're accomplishing literally nothing with no plans to actually find a new horcrux or destroy their current one, every time they try to do anything it just ends up with pointless arguing and the horcrux is making them worse, not surprised someone snapped and gave up, and of course it was Ron, he's the only one with anywhere to even go.

******* the scene is good writing, and it's particularly good character portrayal, it's a brief exchange between the two of them. there's not a long drawn-out attempt by Harry to justify himself, and Ron isn't giving him any slack.

#+begin_quote
  To his great relief, he found Ron was lying on his bed in the otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed. He looked up when Harry slammed the door behind him.

  "Where've you been? Harry said.

  "Oh hello," said Ron.

  He was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin. Harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it was knotted very tightly. Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.

  "So," he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner. "Congratulations."

  "What d'you mean, congratulations?" said Harry, staring at Ron. There was definitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling: It was more like a grimace.

  "Well ... no one else got across the Age Line," said Ron. "Not even Fred and George. What did you use --- the Invisibility Cloak?"

  "The Invisibility Cloak wouldn't have got me over that line," said Harry slowly.

  "Oh right," said Ron. "I thought you might've told me if it was the cloak ... because it would've covered both of us, wouldn't it? But you found another way, did you?"

  "Listen," said Harry, "I didn't put my name in that goblet. Someone else must've done it."

  Ron raised his eyebrows

  "What would they do that for?"

  "I dunno," said Harry. He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, "To kill me."

  Ron's eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair. "It's okay, you know, you can tell /me/ the truth," he said. "If you don't want everyone else to know, fine, but I don't know why you're bothering to lie, you didn't get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady's, that Violet, she's already told us all Dumbledore's letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? And you don't have to do end-of-year tests either. ..."

  "I didn't put my name in that goblet!" said Harry, starting to feel angry.

  "Yeah, okay," said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric. "Only you said this morning you'd have done it last night, and no one would've seen you. ... I'm not stupid, you know."

  "You're doing a really good impression of it," Harry snapped.

  "Yeah?" said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his face now. "You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect you'll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo-call or something."

  He wrenched the hangings shut around his four-poster, leaving Harry standing there by the door, staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding one of the few people he had been sure would believe him.
#+end_quote

Think about where Ron's at. First year, Quirrel was Voldemort, so someone was out to get Harry. Second year it was Lockhart and Ginny with the diary, there was no conspiracy to hurt Harry until the end, and Ron didn't see the encounter with ghost-Riddle. Third year it turns out Sirius is good, Lupin obviously cared for Harry, and Snape fucked things up but is obviously not homicidal to Harry, and Wormtail got away to do who knows what. The "conspiracies to kill Harry" element doesn't appear until the end of the story. So up to this point Ron has watched Harry flaunt the rules and get away with it, and the rulebreaking itself doesn't bother Ron, that's why we don't see him criticize it here - he thinks that Harry hid the secret from him.

Harry of course knows he didn't put his name in, so it's the most obvious thing in the world for him when he says "I didn't do it," and thinks 'How does Ron not know I didn't do it?'

On top of this we have a short exchange. You can picture this happening over just a few minutes. Harry enters, Ron greets him, Harry takes off the cloak, then it's the brief back-and-forth. Harry snaps at Ron first, he doesn't really try to explain it, he just says "It was someone else" and "I don't know why" and when Ron responds, clearly feeling a bit hurt, Harry calls him stupid. This is exactly the sort of thing that happens in real life, we're in a conversation, it might get heated, and then we go a little overboard. In analysis it sticks out to me as a very adept bit of storytelling.

I'd also point a bit to Hermione here. I don't think narratively she was trusting Harry except through reverse reasoning. She didn't believe he could get past the age line and she didn't believe he could confound the goblet, so he couldn't have done it. It's "you're not good enough at magic" disguised as "Sure, I believe you"

******** Given that the objective would be to out magic Dumbledore, that's hardly a "you're not good enough at magic" since literally no student is. Of course, you can simply Lob your paper and let gravity do the rest, but that's neither here nor there.

And the issue with the Ron scene is not that they have that spat, it's that Ron does not apologise until AFTER the dragon. Which, just as Mrs Weasley's apology after Harry calls her out later the same book, makes it absolutely worthless.

***** I don't think it's fair to hold the Horcrux fantasy against Ron. He obviously cherishes his family very much, although the way we know this (“your family is dead!”) doesn't paint Ron in too bright a light either. Showing Ron his dead family would've run the risk of invigorating him further on the hunt to kill Voldemort. Showing him ultimately outshone by Harry and rejected by his love was the sure fire way to make him fed up not only with the mission but also with Harry and Hermione to the point that he'd leave.

He wants to get out of the shadow of his family and friends but doesn't do anything to achieve that. He gets really jealous of them, and he can blow up because of it. But he doesn't /try/. That's what really makes me dislike him. He betrayed Harry twice, though I can understand why he did it the second time. But Ron just...I doubt I could stand him as a friend. He's far too immature and prejudiced. He has potential, sure, but he needs to get his head out of his own arse and think for himself and /work/.

********* Slytherin in a nutshell:

1. Sort the kids who value cunning (i.e., deceitfulness) and ambition (i.e., self-interest at the expense of others) over other traits into the same dormitory.
2. Have them venerate someone who was considered xenophobic /in his time/ as a founder.
3. Set them to up compete against kids from the other Houses and each other.
4. Leave them to stew for 7 years.

Just where are these "truly good Slytherins" going to come from? Canon's portrayal of a house of brutes, arrogant heirs, con artists, sycophants, and an occasional psychopath is spot on.

Overall, the world would be a much better, more peaceful, more prosperous place, in which a quarter of the children would not be raised in an environment in which antisocial behaviour is consistently rewarded.

- Ravenclaw and Gryffindor are perfectly capable of producing scientists. They would be far less likely than the Slytherin ones to commit fraud, because they would embrace curiosity and public good as opposed to embracing self-aggrandisement by any means necessary.

- Hufflepuff and Gryffindor are perfectly capable of producing politicians. Unlike the ones from Slytherin, they wouldn't be self-serving and corrupt to the core.

- All houses can produce leaders, but Slytherin is the one most likely to produce the manipulative, exploitative boss who ends up destroying team morale and productivity and driving off the best employees before he or she manages to lie his way into a promotion; the CEO that guts a 100-year company in order to show profit growth that lasts just long enough for his or her stock options vest; and the demagogue who would say and do anything to gain and maintain power, who then uses that power to enrich himself or herself and his or her circle.

Don't get me wrong: I love me a good Slytherin!Hermione or Slytherin!Ron fic, but only when the focus is on the protagonist's growth, empowerment, and corruption through /conflict/ with the house that upon the whole doesn't want them. Unfortunately, such fics are outnumbered by Slytherin persecution cmplex Bizzarro-worlds in which Slytherins are welcoming and supportive but ever so oppressed by Dumbledore and the rest of Hogwarts.

Obviously there's the bigots (death eaters, jr. death eaters, the Black family etc.) but even the few we see who might be exceptions are pretty terrible people.\\
Snape, the man who obsessed over a girl who wasn't interested for his entire life, bullied children and only turned against the death eaters because Voldemort wanted to kill the woman he was obsessed with, not because he actually changed his mind about genocide.\\
And Slughorn, a man who clearly does hold some mild prejudice against muggleborns (he seems to see people like Lily and Hermione as amazing exceptions who managed to be smart despite being muggleborn more than anything), keeps the secret to defeating Voldemort to himself for decades, attempts to decieve Dumbledore on the matter (imagine if Harry hadn't got him drunk and they'd missed a Horcrux), and has dedicated his life to manipulative favouritism and nepotism, the club is the sort of blatant favouritism teachers really should avoid to begin with (sure they have favourites, doesn't mean they should be letting the students know or treating them differently) but while some people get invited for their potential (and therefore future value to him) plenty are there because they're related to someone important.

**** Honestly I'm tempted to write a fic in that vein. Have four friends in four different houses who remain friends despite constant bullshit from the outside.

Harry in Slytherin, where he weathers idiots on the calibre of Draco in the beginning, and learns to contend with junior Death Eaters towards the end. He would become sneaky and almost supernaturally effective at seeing plots, plans and secrets, and I'm tempted to give him heightened empathy for the ability to step into anyone's shoes and deduce their actions from that alone.

Hermione in Ravenclaw, which fosters her love of knowledge to incredible degrees, turning her from a brave person with smartish tendencies to a knowledge demon who always knows a solution, or knows how to find said solution.

Ron in Hufflepuff, which boosts his team spirit and gives him a support network to rely on. He would become the "I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy" guy and bring stability, motivation and endless perseverance to the dynamic.

Neville in Gryffindor, where he grows from a cowardly, shy lad into an unquestionable leader figure. In the beginning he would have moments of greatness, towards the end he would have an aura of valor and inspire people to follow him by his pure countenance, but still rely on his friends for support when it gets too much.

I've long waited for a dynamic where they're all equally important, powerful and effective, but still have different talents and weaknesses. None of those strange passages that make Harry's friends slightly weaker than Harry himself, just a power dynamic to end all power dynamics.

** Sorry I'm late to the party, but I'd like to contribute:

*His compassion.*

Ron likes taking care of others--he writes to Mrs. Weasley to say that Harry wasn't expecting much for Christmas. While he certainly didn't expect her to send a sweater, we can reasonably assume he expected some sweets or perhaps some baked goods.

He repeatedly invites Harry and Hermione to the Burrow, and welcomes them with open arms.

He enlists Fred and George to help him rescue Harry from Privet Drive.

He makes Hagrid a cup of tea when Hagrid is most upset over the inquiry regarding Buckbeak, because it's what his mother does when someone is upset.

Ron holds stereotypical views of giants and werewolves and house elves, until he gets to know them on a one-on-one basis. He develops a friendship with Dobby, giving him a pair of socks and a sweater. This is in stark contrast Hermione, who stands on a soapbox and ignores what the house elves actually say.

Later, during the Battle of Hogwarts, it's Ron who remembers that the House Elves should be evacuated. "We can't order them to die for us."

*His chivalry.*

Over and over and over again, we see Ron step up to the plate when someone is in trouble and risks his neck to help.

He stands up to Malfoy from the beginning, putting a target on his back for Malfoy's taunts for six years.

He is instrumental in fighting the troll on Halloween.

He helps Hagrid with feeding Norbert, and gets bitten by the dragon for his trouble.

He follows the spiders, his greatest fear, into the Forbidden Forest and comes face to face with dozens of them.

He confronts Professor Snape's biases against Hermione the Know-it-All /two years/ before Harry shouts at Professor Umbridge.

Upon realizing he has let Hagrid down with Buckbeak, Ron pours over books in the library, taking over from an over-worked, exhausted Hermione.

He stands on a */broken leg/* and stares down "mass-murderer" Sirius Black, boldly declaring his intent to die for his friend.

He helps Harry study for the Second and Third Tasks, sacrificing his own valuable study time.

He joins Dumbledore's Army, despite the very precarious situation his father is in at work.

He fights in the Department of the Battle of Mysteries.

He fights in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.

He /shoots to kill/ during the Battle of Seven Potters, saving Tonks's life.

He dives into a pool of freezing water in the dead of winter to save Harry's life.

He fights throughout the Battle of Hogwarts, and is one of the most outspoken in defying Voldemort himself.

Hermione speaks for justice--but she's got a vicious streak to her that undermines her case, as she is more than willing to abuse others to get her way.

Ron fights for justice and is willing to kill but is not nearly so grey is his methods.

He faced his worst fear to support Harry in the Forbidden Forest and several times over showed his willingness to face lethal danger to support him.

He is fiercely protective of those he loves, and defends anyone who insults or hurts his friends or family. (When Draco calls Hermione a mudblood, when he verbally attacks the Weasley family, when Percy criticises Harry through a letter in OOTP, when he thinks Sirius Black is going to kill Harry, etc)

He's not as stupid as many in the fandom make him out to be. He recognised Lockhart as a fraud (not really hard, but Hermione "brightest witch of her age" could not). He grew up to become an Auror (you don't become an auror if you're stupid, nor do you become a successful inventor). He's not overly Hermione level smart, of course, but in my opinion that makes him even more likable and relatable.

He is hilariously funny, and for Harry, who's living a pretty stressful and dangerous life, it's great to have someone around who brightens the mood and teaches him to have fun. I don't imagine that friendless, isolated pre-Hogwarts Harry had that much fun before he met Ron.

In my opinion the few instances where his negative traits are more visible are justifiable. The falling out with Harry in GOF happened because he assumed they were in it together (as in, if one put his name in the Goblet, then the other would too), so I imagine he felt cheated since from his perspective it felt as though Harry had gone ahead and done it without him and then lied to him. When you're 14 and you grow up as being the most invisible of 7 siblings, it can be hard to understand that someone /doesn't/ want glory. After all, that was exactly what Ron saw in the Mirror of Erised. I imagine he found it very hard to put himself in Harry's shoes.

Considering his argument with Hermione after the Yule ball, he was jealous that his crush went to the ball with someone else. Of course, most people would, and I actually think that his point that Krum could be trying to spy on Harry is fair enough (even though we find out that it wasn't actually his intentions in the end). I think Ron (and Harry) had a good reason to be suspicious, considering who Krum's headmaster is. He could very easily had set Krum up to try and lure information out of Harry through Hermione.

For the instance during the Hurcrux Hunt in DH, I blame the horcrux, hunger, and the horcrux. There's a reason why the term "hangry" exists after all, and top that with some dark magic, you can get some pretty bad results. We know for a fact that he wanted to return as soon as he left.

People accuse him of being immature. I don't think he's immature for a teenager. Especially because people always compare him to precocious Granger. His negative traits make him more human to me. He is believable as a character and, as I said before, relatable because of it.

Sorry for the rant. I just really think Ron is the good guy who people love to hate, and I feel that it's completely unfair on him.

I already said it in another post, and I'll always say it but Ron litteraly went out to cool his head. Without the Snatchers, he would have been back 10 minutes later and say he was sorry. And if Harry had not decided that they had to leave right after Ron departure, he would have done the same thing 1 hour later. Harry is also partly responsible since he told him to leave (both influenced by the Horcrux).

Basically, I refuse to recognize this as a betrayal, it's just bad luck (or Rowling needing drama for the plot).

** It looks as though most people have already spoken about his bravery and loyalty, so I want to look at three of his other character traits: his humour, compassion, and selflessness.

*Humour:*\\
Well, I think this point is fairly straightforward. Harry might provide some sarcastic remarks, and the Weasley twins may be the experts at pranks, but Ron Weasley has always been a constant source of humour throughout the books. His ability to crack a joke in a stressful situation is what lightens up the mood and keeps the trio going.

#+begin_quote
  “Well, I don't know how to break this to you,” said Ron, “but I think they might have noticed we broke into Gringotts.”\\
  All three of them started to laugh, and once they started, it was difficult to stop. Harry's ribs ached, he felt light-headed with hunger, but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was raw.\\
  /- Deathly Hallows/
#+end_quote

*Compassion:*\\
I think a lot of fans forget about how truly kind and compassionate he is.

#+begin_quote
  “Ah, no, Harry, how come you didn't spot that?” said Ron, grinning over from his own bed, which was now strewn with wrapping paper. “Tell you what, Dobby --- here you go --- take these two, and you can mix them up properly. And here's your sweater.”\\
  He threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped, and the hand-knitted sweater Mrs Weasley had sent. Dobby looked quite overwhelmed.\\
  “Sir is very kind!” he squeaked, his eyes brimming with tears again, bowing deeply to Ron. “Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard, for he is Harry Potter's greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless ---”\\
  “They're only socks,” said Ron, who had gone slightly pink around the ears, though he looked rather pleased all the same.\\
  /- Goblet of Fire/
#+end_quote

(A quick reminder that Ron Weasley has the kindest heart, and I will fight anybody who says otherwise.)

He gets a lot of hate for dismissing Hermione's SPEW campaign, and fans tend to ignore how kind he was to Dobby. In the seventh book, he (and Dean) helped Harry bury Dobby, and Ron took off his own shoes and socks to lay inside his grave. Then there's obviously the fact that is was Ron who remembered the house elves in the Battle of Hogwarts.

Another example of Ron Weasley being the absolute best:

#+begin_quote
  “Blimey, I hope they escaped,” said Ron, leaning back on his pillows. The tea seemed to be doing him good; a little of his color had returned. “I didn't get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all that quick-witted, though, the way everyone was talking to me when I was him. God, I hope they made it... If they both end up in Azkaban because of us...”\\
  Harry looked over at Hermione and the question he had been about to ask --- about whether Mrs. Cattermole's lack of a wand would prevent her Apparating alongside her husband --- died in his throat. Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the Cattermoles, and there was such tenderness in her expression that Harry felt almost as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing him.\\
  /- Deathly Hallows/
#+end_quote

*Selflessness:*\\
This is incredibly easy to write about, because there are numerous examples of Ron being selfless throughout the series. I think the two best examples to look at are in Prisoner of Azkaban and Deathly Hallows.

#+begin_quote
  “No, Harry!” Hermione gasped in a petrified whisper; Ron, however, spoke to Black.\\
  “If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!” he said fiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.\\
  /- Prisoner of Azkaban/
#+end_quote

I also want to bring some attention to what happened right before Ron confronted Sirius as well, because that certainly wasn't the only selfless thing he did.

#+begin_quote
  Harry tried to stand up; he could hear [the dog] growling as it skidded around for a new attack. Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry aside; the dog's arm fastened instead around Ron's outstretched arm. Harry lunged forward, he seized a handful of the brute's hair, but it was dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll.\\
  /- Prisoner of Azkaban/
#+end_quote

It's important to remember that it was actually Harry who was originally attacked by the dog, and if it wasn't for Ron immediately pushing Harry out of the way (leaving himself unprotected in the process), then it likely would have been Harry with a mangled arm and broken leg. I love how Ron doesn't even hesitate before putting his own life at risk for Harry's.

Another incredibly selfless moment is in Deathly Hallows, when Ron begs to be tortured in Hermione's place. It shows both how self-sacrificing Ron is, and also how much he loves Hermione, because he was literally willing to be tortured to insanity to protect her.

#+begin_quote
  “Wait,” said Bellatrix sharply. “All except...except for the Mudblood.”\\
  Greyback gave a grunt of pleasure.\\
  “No!” shouted Ron. “You can have me, keep me!”\\
  Bellatrix hit him across the face: the blow echoed around the room. “If she dies under questioning, I'll take you next,” she said.\\
  /- Deathly Hallows/
#+end_quote

Obviously, there are so many more things I love about Ron Weasley: his loyalty, his friendship, his loving nature, his bravery, his ability to apologize and make up for his mistakes, his growth throughout the series, and his strength.

I only wish we'd been able to see his expert strategist skills come into play more in the later books, rather than he depending so much on Harry or Hermione.

Ever since he saw himself as Head Boy and Quidditch Captain in book 1, and even including his bouts of jealousy in book 4 etc., I wanted Ron to achieve something great just by being himself. I feel that he never got a real chance to shine in the entire series. Some in book 7, but it wasn't enough for this little Ron fan here.

Because let's face it, most of us are like Ron; we aren't as smart as Hermione nor as brave as Harry. We are normal people with good and bad, annoyed with our siblings and parents, no huge talent in any area perhaps - just, ordinary people.

So I wish Ron had gotten to shine more and had more individual achievements of his own with 0 help from others. Because as a young or old reader it would have shown us, “yes, you can achieve something great, too!”

** I know it's not everyone's goblet of pumpkin juice, but one of my favourite Ron moments is from Cursed Child, when he approaches Hermione to renew their vows.

It's such a sweet moment, especially when she's concerned they're drifting apart - it shows her that he's just as devoted to her as ever. In that moment you see how the gangly youngest brother with an emotional range of a teaspoon has grown into a caring and loving husband, just like his father was.

Also all the other points everyone has made about him in this thread. I just wanted to highlight this great moment from an unpopular source.

** I feel like, unlike the other two main characters, he is a lot closer to the average person of 11-17. Myself at that age included. A bit lazy, not extremely smart, has one hobby he's amazing at (well, two with chess) while being average at the rest, somewhat difficult to motivate, just a mostly nice dude that sometimes gets overly emotional and says something stupid.

I wonder how much of the Ron hate stems from people seeing themselves in him tbh.

** He's confident. Whether it's food or sleep or 'Glory of Gryffindor' and 'Evil of Slytherin', he's very assured of himself.

It's nice. Specially when compared to the 'doormat' that let everyone walks all over him, that Ron has the misfortune of having as his friend. They should stop calling him Harry James Potter and more, Harry 'There is no spine, /i mean spoon/' Potter.

Just once, I would like to read a fic with Ron as MC and Harry bashing. It should be fun.

Extra points for Hermione bashing too.

**** "Let's go to the staff room and tell the teachers that the entrance is in the 2nd floor girls' bathroom"

"Okay."

"Shit! No one is here, maybe we should wait for the teachers to come back."

"Okay."

"SHIT! The teachers are coming! Come, let's hide in the closet and eavesdrop on them instead of telling them what we came to tell them."

"Okay."

"The Heir took my sister to the chamber! Come we must go talk to that one teacher which we all know to be useless and enlist his help. Instead of this room full of other teachers that are far more competent."

"Okay."

Remember that scene from book 2? I admit my memories are a little hazy cuz I haven't touched that heap of trash in years, but i'm 98% certain that's how that scene played out, perhaps not word for word but the spirit was the same. And that was just one scene from the top of my head.

Harry Potter is like Skyrim, the original thing is inconsistent, nonsensical piece of trash, the only reason it is famous is because of the Fans who go around modifying the source material.

That one actually was Ron, though it happened in a different scene. And being fair to the idiot kids, this is before they know for certain that he's a total fraud.

I think I understand your confusion. The protagonist of the series that makes up for his incredibly bad ideas with steadfast determination is named Harry. The comedic sidekick that goes along with the protagonist's dumb ideas because he's doggedly loyal is named Ron. Clearly you got them mixed up somewhere along the line.

Also, I take offense at your description of the series as a "nonsensical piece of trash", and I think most people here would disagree with you.
