It could either be Harry Potter himself or some other muggleborn but I think it would be quite entertaining seeing them hassle draco for being posh, insult Snape and his long hair, downing cans of special brew and calling people dickheads.

For the non-brits this is a depiction of a chav

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

*** Not really. It's really hard to explain to non-Brits, but it's heavily associated with class and education level. Chavs stereotypically live in govenment funded (council) housing, wear tracksuits/tacky clothes, speak with a heavy accent (i.e, whatever the regional accent is - a chav in liverpool will have a strong scouse accent, a chav in london will have a jafakian/cockney-like accent), have low paying jobs/are unemployed, teenage pregnancies, etc. A closer descriptor would be white trash but british chavs come in all shapes and sizes. I associate rednecks with being religious and rural, and both features are unlikely in the british chav.

**** I think I've seen that stereotype in British shows before (there was a character in The Misfits like that? And maybe Rose's mom from Doctor Who?). Thanks. I was generally curious.

***** Yes, they're all over British tv as characters, which is funny because the people who make the shows are almost exclusively middle class.
