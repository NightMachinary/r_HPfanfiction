I would love if no character bashing occurs in them too, and especially no canon bashing. Just same events from the books, but not from Harry's perspective, also things that are mentioned to have happened, but as the narrator mostly follows Harry in the books, we only get the bare bones of it, so expanding upon them, like Charlie recruiting for the war in Romania, or the Weasleys visiting Bill.

Also, characters not being ooc, which I know is hard to write, so at least closely resembling their canon counterparts.

I don't mind reading about any characters, but prefer Cedric, Cho, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore, McGonagall, the DA, the Order, Dudley, Petunia, Andromeda, Teddy (though his will be post-canon, so won't mind tiny baby Teddy POV either), Krum, Fleur, BCJ, etc, etc.

Just the canon story from different perspectives from different points in canon.

Also, if possible, all the memories shown in pensieves and diaries, and learned via veritaserums, those expanded upon, from Lily's POV, or Remus' or Peter's, or Winky's or Hagrid's.

I know this is asking for too much, but I haven't found any Alternate POV fics. Granted I didn't look that hard, but I figured this sub will likely know of them or find them faster at least.

Sorry, if this is a huge bother.

I've got one of my own about Sirius during OotP. The plot isn't much to do with canon but it does have the battle at the DoM from Sirus's PoV. I'm happy to link it if you think you might be interested but it is an OC fic and probably a bit niche.

** I love filling in missing details in canon. I'm working on a story about how wee ickle firsties Fred and George acquired their reputation as pranksters when they first got to school.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14846531/chapters/34366397]])

I'm also working on one about how Remus and Tonks first met and started their relationship. It includes stuff like the details of the anti-werewolf legislation that Umbridge wrote in 1993.
