I'm planning on writing a pretty elaborate time-travel story and I'm curious about some of the things that make you hooked and make you run away instantly. All advice or complaints are super super helpful and I appreciate all I can get!

I'm hoping to hop on the Angst and Dark/Twisted story train, so suggested stories that have really shined in this area would be super helpful.

A task force consisting of Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, Flitwick, Kingsley, Tonks, Arthur, and Sirius should do the job.

Once Voldemort was in custody, push him through the most extreme form of interrogations, make him spill ALL his secrets, ALL his followers, ALL their hideouts, ALL their resources, then fully obliviate him, petrify him, and lock him behind wards stronger than Nurmengard until ALL his Horcruxes had been accounted for.

Maybe he was just being dramatic, but I also hate the constant idea that authors totally reject veritaserum because "Voldemort's just too strong". Like that kind of makes veritaserum useless if you can't really be sure if they're lying or not.

Unfortunately, there just isn't a ton of info out there about veritaserum and it's laws.

*Edit: there are some who can resist veritaserum. I just looked it up. However, it doesn't really imply how one can resist it, other than being verifiably insane. (As in your perception is everything, so you could answer sincerely, but not really be telling the absolute truth)

** Considerations:

- Do time travelers have freedom of actions?
- Do time travelers actually end up in their own past or in a different universe where things could be significantly different? For example in “The Red Knight”, Ron ended up in a different universe in which Hermione and fem!Harry were actively trying to kill him!
- What advance knowledge do time travelers possess? For example in “Delenda Est”, Harry did not know about Horcruxes, and that fact greatly increased his difficulty level.
- If the traveler indeed had critical advance knowledge and ended up in their original universe, DON'T BOTHER with maintaining the timeline! They should try to maximize the effectiveness of their advance knowledge. For example, if Harry ended up back in Year 1 again, he could come clean with Dumbledore right away, out Barty Jr and Wormtail immediately, shut down Lucius Malfoy, confiscate the Lestrange vault, get most of Horcruxes within a couple weeks, and maybe even neutralize Quirrellmort. They would now have plenty of time to deal with his scar and remaining Death Eaters. The story might be less challenging, but it's still far better than to write about STUPID protagonists who tried to keep that BS timeline.
- Finally, if you have Hermione going back to the 1930s, just kill Tom Riddle in his orphanage. We already have WAY TOO MANY fics in which she raised or shagged him.

No, it wouldn't, but Riddle was just too damn powerful. He absolutely had to go. The time traveler should not take any chances here. Without a super powerful dark lord leading them, picking off remaining blood purists should be a lot easier.

The bigger issue I see here is whether killing Riddle would have an effect on the war with Grindelwald. Did Riddle have any a major contribution to his defeat? If yes, then simply killing Riddle might actually let Grindelwald win.

**** The "kill Hitler" fallacy gets really old, and so does the "go back in time to kill Tom Riddle" idea.

If Hitler was killed, another figurehead would have stepped in to capitalize on the same opportunity that Hitler found. The man did not singlehandedly invent and run the Nazi party, nor was he some kind of mastermind who could have engineered the underlying sociopolitical climate in Germany (reparations, the Great Depression, etc.) which prompted the entire nation to turn to xenophobic imperialism.

Similarly, if Tom Riddle was killed by a time traveler, I would expect the blood purist faction to resort to violence within roughly the same time period as the original series due to the increasing tensions between purebloods and muggleborns.

My point is that killing Riddle doesn't remove the underlying problems in wizarding society that sparked the war in the first place.

But supposing that they were equally opposed by Dumbledore's faction and couldn't make any headway: Then tensions would continue to rise and the Purists would feel justified resorting to vigilante violence. Cue the wizarding war.

** One of my favorite things about time travel stories and other AUs is seeing how just changing one thing can effect the HP Universe. Like with the butterfly effect, so I typically drop stories where characters act out of character (i want to know up front if characters will be OOC in the description) to rehash canon or in general really. Malfoy is kind of a dick. He wont drop his prejudice against Hermione / muggles overnight.

Having Hermione/Luna randomly guess or know that the person is a time traveler.

Having a time traveling kid that doesnt downplay their abilities but acts incredibly pretentious "uses words like henceforth unironicly, it doesnt make your character sound smart , it makes them sound like they have a mental disorder."

Bashing in general.

Another issue that frequently comes up is that time travel stories often have characters who are so powerful that the plot naturally resolves very quickly and in an uninteresting way and if not on a contrived way. Like , if Harry knew about horcruxes and their locations he could easily obtain and destroy them. Having harry wait until he is 15 to begin hunting them breaks my suspension of disbelief most of the time. I mean , what exactly is he doing for the first 4 years? bingo ?

Manufacture angst, drama, and suspension of course.

However, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059), has handled this issue quite well. Harry finished off Voldemort relatively early, but waited 5 years to gain more power, before finishing off the remaining Death Eaters and blood purists. Since this Harry didn't trust Dumbledore at all, the challenge level of this time travel increased somewhat.

** Watch a YouTube critique of Cursed Child for a good overview of the pitfalls of time travel in HP.

And for a more general list:

- Avoid the stations of canon. If 30 year old Harry still ends up in the Graveyard after 4 years, the story's got issues. It can't just be Harry Potter and the Protagonist with the Foreknowledge of Everything but still decides to do Nothing. That's just canon with a Harry that's powerless.

- Avoid the standard tropes (Super Lord Harry, Evil Dumbles, etc.)

- Choose the time of time travel. There are a few kinds: Back to the Future style, where the future can be rewritten and create multiple timelines; PoA style, where the future is set and everything that changed already happened; Rick and Morty style, where there isn't time travel per se but infinite alternate dimensions, where the current dimension can't change, but you can travel into others.

- If the future can change, don't forget to butterfly effect! This is the plot of Back to the Future, basically.

- Don't stress too much about the wonky details. If you need some techno mumbo jumbo, that's fine, but it shouldn't be a crutch.

That's a very good rule, but it could be violated in a fun way.

The two keys are novelty and struggle, right? Stations of canon isn't novel at all, and there's no real struggle to deal with. The time traveller just tries to remember how things happened the first time around and tries to avoid showing off any future knowledge. I mean, there /is/ a bit of struggle, but it's not an interesting one.

So, start with a "the timeline must be preserved" thing: if you start changing the past, the universe will unravel, and all but the most powerful people will die. Add another time traveller who wants to change things. Aberforth Dumbledore, Eloise Midgen, Rita Skeeter, it doesn't matter who. Just give them a motive and make them willing to damn the consequences.

Now our protagonist must strive mightily to keep the timeline on track. We can cover tons of new content dealing with their conflict. For instance, maybe one of the things they want to change has to do with the Department of Mysteries when Nagini attacks. So they poison Arthur's drink the day before. Our protagonist has to feverishly work out a cure. And then the challenger unleashes a ton of cursed Muggle artifacts, so our protagonist has to find and disable them as fast as possible so Arthur's not overwhelmed with work.

** Do:

- Actions have consequences. If Harry wakes up twenty years in the past, naked in a hotel room with Lily spooning him, I doubt that Voldemort will get defeated by Lily sacrificing herself for her one-year-old toddler after her husband was brutally murdered downstairs.

- The time traveler will be biased. Harry and Hermione certainly would judge people for the shit they have yet to do. Especially Hermione knows how to carry a grudge. The whole "Maybe things will be different this time around" just seems like a stupid excuse to make something bad happen.

- No return to the present. It makes the whole plot feel inconsequential if all that changes is that Harry has banged Bellatrix at some point but then went back to the present as if nothing happened. Return to the present ruined Delenda Est.

Do Not:

- Preserve the timeline. It just is a stupid excuse why an author rehashes canon instead of writing an original plot

- "I can safe him". Instead of trying to redeem Riddle/Snape/Malfoy, taking them out is the far safer choice because otherwise, every death they cause will be the fault of the time traveller, who could have easily prevented it by taking permanent measures. Seriously, Snape "loved" Lily twenty years after she died, he ain't gonna care about a brunette Mudblood. He willingly joined the magical Nazi ripoff, he isn't just some misunderstood teen.

- Angst. Most stories including it go way overboard to the point where you either laugh at the ridiculousness of the whole thing or cry in despair because the MC doesn't have his shit together.

Use it to make a point, but dose it carefully. Is Harry moping around and feeling sorry for himself? Does he feel responsible for Sirius/Hermione's injury/Cedric?

Perfectly fine to include some angst there. But if you write ten chapters instead of a couple scenes, they lose all their impact and you will most likely lose half your readership.

There's a German proverb which translates to "In shortness lies the spiciness".

Yet most authors pile a ridiculous amount of shit on the MC to prove that they are in a bad spot but don't realise that all they achieve is creating a comedic vibe.

Popular does not mean good. Most of the "big" stories on FFN are shit if you bother to analyse them (bashing, Death Eater whitewashing, completely distorting characters).

In your personal opinion, do you think it would be more effective to do minor statements of angst scattered throughout instead of periodic events? Instead of writing a character having a breakdown, maybe add a couple sentences instead of observing that they haven't washed their hair in a while? Along that sort?

Of course! I didn't mean to sound arrogant by any means- I can see how it came across that way. I try pretty hard not to bias characters and write everyone equally but I can always improve!

  do you think it would be more effective to do minor statements of angst scattered throughout instead of periodic events?
#+end_quote

That is too vague to really answer and depends a lot on the general plot. Your explanation doesn't really help there, so maybe give a short outline.

Here's an example for the most angst I ever wrote (Harry sees some pictures of his family while visiting the Tonks after his third year)

#+begin_quote
  Seeing these pictures made Harry feel strangely fuzzy in his stomach. It was the first time he actually saw his family together. Thanks to Hagrid he had a couple photographs from his parents' school time, but the most recent one was taken during their wedding and none showed him. The pictures also proved that the Dursleys had been lying to him when they said that nobody wanted him. Finally having solid proof was a great relief for him.

  Harry felt something warm on his cheek but needed a moment to realise that it was, in fact, a tear. Strong arms came around him, pulling the young wizard back until his head rested on his cousin's shoulder.

  Being held tightly reinforced the warm feeling but also made it difficult to maintain control over his body. It was only a small gesture but when the metamorph began stroking her fingers through his hair it was enough to bring down the emotional walls Harry had erected to protect himself at Number Four. His resolve crumbled and the happiness was overshadowed by a deep wave of sadness. Because for the first time he actually felt like he was part of a family. For the first time, he had evidence that he had been part of one. And for the first time, Harry realised how much he had lost during that fateful Halloween night nearly thirteen years ago. He could have grown up happily, without his cupboard, endless work and Harry Hunting. And once the floodgates were opened there was no stopping it.

  Lost to his own world Harry didn't even think about the fact that he was clinging to someone he barely knew. With the tears now flowing freely, he burrowed himself in the crook of Tonks' neck and cried until he was drained of both anguish and energy. No more tears would come and he felt utterly exhausted. For the first time, he could remember someone had been there when he had been overwhelmed by emotions. Throughout his breakdown, she kept stroking his head and began humming a tune only known to her.

  It was at this point that Nymphadora Tonks connected the dots. The scars on his arms and his strong reaction to the slightest bit of familiar love only lead to one ugly conclusion. She silently vowed to do anything she could to help her cousin. To help him heal, to protect him and to be part of the family he desperately longed for.

  Tired after a five hundred mile journey and emotionally spent Harry fell asleep on the living room couch using the metamorph as a pillow.

To be honest, this is one of my biggest pet peeves with time travel fics. I would expect Hermione to be intelligent enough to have read some philosophy/ethics books at some point during her life. She would at least be familiar with the concept that you can't hold someone morally responsible for actions that they haven't even begun to contemplate yet. Keeping in mind the "ship of Theseus" paradox, orphan child Tom Riddle is literally not the same person as teenage murderer Tom Riddle.

I could see a battle-hardened Hermione making a decision of moral calculus, murdering in cold blood to improve thousands of future lives regardless of whether child-Riddle "deserves" death, but I lose all respect for the time traveler if he/she acts like a prepubescent child is inherently evil and therefore deserves "justice."

** Oh time travel is the only Harry potter I read!

My personal pet peeve is when Harry or whoever your protagonist is just says some dumb revealing shit for plot convenience. Especially when the character is older and taking up a younger body. Like, they have a wealth of experience and may be ahead but they should also have some kind of idea to play off the reasons for being as such or limit themselves. Or not want to stand out and only end up doing so because of happenstance or a personal flaw/personaility trait. If they have to reveal their knowledge or power in a dire situation, that's fine, it's not just plot convenience for them to be found out easily. This also applies to having knowledge of the future.

And also if there's a side character who is meant to put the pieces together and figure things out, I find it illogical for them to instantly think "Time traveller". Have them look through a few options. "Wear me like a locket around your throat" does this well. It can be cool if you link it into the side character in questions own wishful thinking. E.g. Tom wants immortality. Here is a person who appears young yet has knowledge for the ages and is so powerful. Wouldn't immediately guess this but his personal desires for immortality to Be A Thing may lead him to want to think someone else could have achieved it, desperation and obsession clouding his better judgement. After many clues and connections.

Please let me know when you start uploading it! Like I said, time travel is literally the only genre of HP fanfic I read.

** I have read a lot of timetravel fics and I know what works and what doesn't.

First a few questions to think about:

- Who travels to the past? Just Harry? or do Hermione/Ron join him? this matters.
- How? Or more specifically: by accident or on purpose? And can he choose what time to land in? Or is he stuck at a certain point with no choice.
- Is he keeping his own body or does he inhabit his younger self?
- Is Harry an accomplished adult and fully graduated wizard? Or still at Hogwarts level? Sure, upper years of Hogwarts but still a student. One of them can duel Lucius to a standstill, The other is just a bit more talented for his age.
- Similarly but from another angle: does hHarry know "the truth" when he travelled? If he did it during the Horcrux hunt for example, he wouldn't yet know the full location of every Horcrux nor that he is one. He would also assume that Snape really killed Dumbledore and not know what happened behind the scenes etc. This could mak a for an interesting story: the timetraveller has advance knowledge, but is actually wrong/incomplete.
- Do we start from a strictly canon world? Or are there other changes, like an "evil Dumbledore" or "twin brother"?

All of those will drastically change the story.

Apart from that a few general do's and don'ts:

- Actions have consequences --> Arrest Pettigrew/ release Sirius and suddenly Voldemort doesn't rise in fourth year the way he did in canon and Harry has no clue what the fuck is going on anymore when Moody really is Moody and he isn't chosen for the Triwizard Tournament at all.
- Enemies adapt to changing situations. Harry completely ruins Quirrel's cover early on, so in response Voldemort just says "fuck it, time for Plan B" and releases the basilisk earlier and goes on a rampage.
- Some things are set in stone and are out of Harry's power, other's can be influenced. Know which is which and be consistent about it.

** Time travel does not destroy the universe. If time travel is possible, it creates new timelines rather than rewriting anything. Also, as other people have said, give serious consideration to how your universe works and the motivations and inclinations of your characters as well as their personal histories so that you don't end up getting hate for inconsistencies, unless you're going somewhere with them.

** I am of the theory that Time Travel paradoxes are impossible and it's not possible to change anything that has already happened. The future and past do not exist, only the present.

Here's my reasoning:

Not every timeline is perfectly matched up. Time is like a V shapped ripple in water, the further to the side you move the more "in the past" the other concurrent but otherwise identical timelines are. Time travel is moving to one of those offset concurrent timelines.

Timelines don't cease to exist because you aren't there. This also means that your family and everyone you knew still exists and to them you just disappeared.

** Chose your time travel method. Is it accurate? Is it reliable? Is it repeatable?

If it's a one-shot, you need to have a pretty good excuse for why. If it's not one-shot deal, it doesn't matter how hard it is to set up, the main character /did it./ That's the premise.

So if it's not a one-shot, if it is repeatable, you need to either incorporate that into the story, or explain why it's not been incorporated into the story.

And then there's prophesy to deal with. How does that interact with time travel? Fortunately the few verified prophesies in HP canon are pretty vague and ripe for creative interpretation.

And another fun thing to consider: If it's an adult who comes back and ends up the body of their child-self, well, image hanging out almost exclusively with 11 year olds learning basic algebra while being treated like an 11 year old for 10 months straight.

If the main character wasn't already insane (they'd have to be to attempt a big time travel), they'd certainly be insane after /that./

** Just please remember that going back to when Harry was eleven and then making him super powerful is kind of unrealistic.

One, Harry was never the most powerful guy in the room. He was talented in some fields sure, but he certainly was not Dumbledore or Riddle, who were literal prodigies. Make him know a wider range of spells? Yes. Make him be able to blast through a whole army without breaking a sweat? No. (That's also really boring unless you're going for power wank)

Two, Harry could train for an entire summer but he is NOT going to be some ripped Adonis. The kid has been underfed his whole life which can result in it being more difficult to gain muscle. Like, maybe with five to ten years of intense dieting and training, Harry could be rocking that six pack everyone wants to put on him, but I can tell you from experience it takes a LONG time to really put on muscle.

** I've read a ton of time-travel fics in the past, but so seldom enjoyed them, that I pretty much completely avoid the genre at the moment. The trope definitely has a lot of potential, but it rarely works for me. The main issue I have with it is that the time-travel is often used as an easy fix: 'The love interest is dead? No problem, we have a time-turner!' 'Voldemort won a battle? Let's use this time-turner and try again!' 'How can we find out what actually happened to this person? Hey, I touched this stone and it transported me 20 years back in time. Weird, but the person I was talking about is here, how convenient!' You get the point. A story loses all it's tension if everything can be solved by just turning an hourglass around a few times. And if there's no tension, I'll be bored.

The very, very few time-travel fics that I have enjoyed all had in common that the time-travel itself didn't solve any problems, but instead created them. I want to see the time-travelling character struggle with not being in their own time anymore. I want their knowledge of the future to be a burden to them rather than an advantage. I want the (repeated) use of time-travel devices to have consequences, whatever they may be. And most of all, I don't want the time-travel itself to be the final solution to any problem or conflict, ever.
