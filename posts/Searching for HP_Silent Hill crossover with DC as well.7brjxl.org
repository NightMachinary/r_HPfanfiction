I read a fic that was an HP/Silent Hill crossover, I can't remember the exact setup i think it was the triwiz portkey or something like that. Anyway Hp ends up in Silent Hill at the begining of the game and he goes through the town, meets the sheriff and works with her for a bit to uncover this pretty intricate way the Silent Hill Demon stuff fits in to HPverse Magic. Eventually HP finds the source of Silent HIll and tricks the Demon into loosing its power so it forces it on HP. He gets teleported out or something and gets picked up by the JLA. They find out what happened and after they tell the US Ministry of Magic send HP to learn to control his new tainted magic from Raven and the Teen Titans. It stopped there but i'm pretty sure it was a recent update so I'm hoping to find it again. Any help would be awesome. Thank you.

**** YES!! Thankyou. That's the one. I can't believe I didn't check generic X-overs.. I checked JL, Teen titans, silent Hill. I was even checking non x-over stories to find it.
