I'm looking for stories like Xerosis by Batsutousai, the Ninja Wizard series and Mischief's Heir series, both by mad_fairy, etc. No harem or evil Harry, and prefer active or complete fics of decent length. Also no Harmony or Hinny.

Edit: I mean no muggles at all (not even muggleborn parents) can interact with magical world, and magical also stop being able to visit the muggle world whenever they want. Harry would be working towards this conclusion for one reason or another.


** Linkffn(11773877) Dark lord never died Lengthy, it concentrate on the magic world and war but also Ron/Hermione focus. There is Hinny but not in focus. Not the best rec for your you so I hope you will find others.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Extreme AU. In a world where contact between muggles and wizards is strictly forbidden, where love blinds, and power is corrupt... an orphaned Hermione Granger struggles to make things right with the help of some unlikely allies. HG,SS.
