We all know Indy!Harry he acts like at 11 he knows more than everyone who has ever lived combined and thanks to his "Lordships" he can get married to every woman under the sun and they'd love him for it.

I want fic where this would be played realistically (or at least as real as possible).

As in, every "political" move he makes is something that everyone can see and react accordingly; Dumbledore is so much smarter than him is not even funny and his plans against him all fail; all of his acting like a victim doesn't fool anyone; and all of the girls he tries to woo think he is a creep and compare his need for validation on the basis of his name to Malfoy.

I /think/ that's all folks.


** I could see it where the girls he approaches aren't interested for whatever of many reasons, and the girls who want to bed him for his fame aren't the ones he wants anything to do with because they're ugly or manipulative or clingy or have weird fetishes he isn't into.

** Interesting. But I would not call it realistic. I mean, the usual trope isn't realistic in any way, sure. But neither is what you describe, like at all. He is "The Boy Who Lived" after all. How exactly would it be realistic if the things you describe happened? Like why would anybody find him creepy without him doing a 180 in behaviour?

Anyway, I think there was a similar request a few weeks ago that was a lot more realistic than yours, you might want to search for it. It went for Harry being inexperienced in politics and getting outplayed by the old guard that have been at the game for decades.

The fandom as a whole forgets what this means. People were bowing to him before he turned ten, weeping at his return, and Scrimgeour damn rolled out the red carpet for him in HBP. If Harry Potter wanted to use his fame not too many would deny him anything.

The only way indy Harry could be humbled would be magically by a talented adult. I would say the political arena, but the idea of a well written Indy Harry I have is a Slytherin one who allows himself to be used so as to get what he wants.

It's also worth remembering how quickly the tide of public opinion could turn on him even without him doing anything to deserve it.

***** As it can for every political figure. But realistically, and that is what OP wanted, for Harry it should be a lot harder to convince people of misbehaviour than it would be of others.

**** Well, I could also see him humbled politically. Sure he would have a lot of followers from the get go. But there would also be a lot of opposition to him. Make that opposition intelligent and cunning and it could make for some great political drama.

And about the BWL stuff. Yea, thats what I meant. People forget that. I think its because the few small incidents where the public turned a little bit against him in the books are SO overused and blown out of proportion in fanfiction.

*** I mean more within the tropes of the usual Indy!Harry, but if an 11 yo or even the usual teenager acts as Harry does in those fics they get called out, and fast. And if he doubles down on it, as he usually does when he doesn't get his way, it gets progressively worse, or it jumps straight into bashing. Sadly, these things happen enough in real life that it isn't even a stretch or SoD breaking.

As for the BWL thing, it rarely, if ever, actually helps him in anything. Remember, it is incredibly easy to be hated if someone can create a reason at Hogwarts, take the second book for example. And countrywide it was easier still, with almost everyone believing he was a liar thanks to the media.

And all of that was rumors and baseless accusations! If it was true it would have been a lot worse for him.

*** I mean everyone does a complete 180 and starts hating him multiple times in canon. It's not really that unrealistic for it to happen occasionally.
