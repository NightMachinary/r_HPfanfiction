** Yeah, any DLP contest winner is great. I loved this one and how it explored what magical warefare might look like for a third party organization, i.e. the order.

#+begin_quote
  In 1996 Dumbledore contracts a fatal curse. He had always considered himself ready to die, but when he considers the burdens he's leaving for those who remain, at the onset of the Second Wizarding War, he is faced with a dilemma. What can he shoulder? What can he bear? Winner of the "What the Professors get up to in the summers" 2019 competition.
