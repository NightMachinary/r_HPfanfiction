Hey, guys! I've recently got back into HP fanfiction (can't go out due to COVID so might as well do something, and it's been such a nostalgic trip so far) and was wondering if you could recommend some good Spanish-language fics to me. My Spanish has grown kind of rusty and I'd like to get back into it and what better way to do it than reading about something you love :)


** Oof the Spanish fics I read are all trashy slashy smutty fics.

I've read the majority of these.
