What it says on the tin.

I'm currently writing an AU HP fanfiction scene where an Auror trainee (OC) is working as a mole in the Auror office for Lord Voldemort. He's a relatively young for a Death Eater initiate - only a few years older than Draco Malfoy - and thus, is sent with a senior DE on a mission to try to recruit werewolf clans for Voldemort's army. However, the two get separated during a full moon. The initiate makes a stupid move and goes off by himself. He gets attacked by a rogue werewolf, getting infected with lycanthropy. He survives the attack, but ends up in St. Mungo's for quite a while (weeks to months) afterwards.

Naturally, the attack will not be a pretty affair. From what I know, due to their gruesome nature, werewolf attacks were not fully described in the books, aside from the aftermath (scars, hunger for meat, etc.). However, I've started watching /Being Human/ for a better description of an actual attack. I still, however, need advice on writing such a scene, mostly from the POV of the attack victim.

Any thoughts? You may also suggest HP fanfics to me to read. That also might help me a lot in writing this scene.


** look up a wolf attacking a bison. or similar beast What people seem to forget is that Werewolves while under their transformation are BEASTS. They are ruled by the instincts that would be extremely similar to Bears, Wolves, or possibly tigers. A werewolf is at least as strong as a bear. A bear can claw through a car door. play that up in the attack. Make the OC hide in a crack in a cliff. You can not have the OC fight off the werewolf. In the HBP, Bill survived the attack because of Harry blowing Greyback off of his back. And greyback was just as strong as Bill. (he was not transformed). Thats because Greyback was vicious. Imagine that with a fully transformed werewolf.

***** Good idea. As for your suggestion, I decided to write a scene where the senior Death Eater the lad is with ends up saving his life. The junior recruit is still badly injured enough to be placed in a magical coma for a few weeks in St. Mungo's to recover after the event. That, and the junior recruit is attacked by two wolves, and the wolves end up fighting each other over the 'kill'. That leaves enough time for the senior DE to hear the noise and fight off the pair of them.

** Well I think if you will make the gic to M survive the attack there are the prongs of plot you can take to explain why the victim survived. One the werewolf wanted to change the victim like fenrir did to lupin as a child. Two the victim escapes cause of sheer luck, maybe the werewolf smells another one in the middle of the attack and if she's in heat maybe it's enough to leave the victim alone. Third the victim was smart even during the attack or expected it or on some level welcomed it. This one is the hardest to believe for audiences and might ruin it for readers but also could make an exciting plot. Details and level gruesomeness about the attack are important. If you ever read the sacrifices arc by lightning on the wave you will know how bad it is for some werewolf victims that they commit suicide to escape the hard life and the shame. I hope this helps

*** Thank you for your advice, it was very helpful! :)

However, the initiate does not want to be a werewolf, and the attack was more so a result of his own human error. Yet the DE he is with saves his life, preventing him from dying. While the attack itself is from a first-person point of view, I don't want to make it too gory. I'm looking to keep it in a PG-15 range.

**** Oh ok cool that makes sense. Sounds interesting for the auror to maybe owe a life debt to the de. Could create some nice conflict.
