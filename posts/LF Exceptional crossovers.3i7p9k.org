Hey there.

As the title suggests, I'm looking for crossovers between HP and any universe that stand out among the mass of bad ones. Its a bit of a guilty pleasure for me, since most of the times the merge is rather wonky and needs a benevolent reader to work.

I'm currently reading a HP/ Fairy Tail crossover and am surprised at how entertaining I find it. I enjoyed many HP / Star Wars crossovers in the past and would very much like more of those, if you got any, but am open to whatever combination you find.

So, please, suggest your favourites to me. Bonus points for crossovers with Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Marvel universe and several animes including, but not limited to Fairy Tail, Ghost in the Shell, Soul Eater, Hellsing and Attack on Titan. I'd also be interested in crossovers with games such as League of Legends, Dota 2, Elder Scrolls, Witcher,....

A list of crossovers I have already read (or found):

Star Wars Crossovers:

The Havoc Side of the Force linkffn(8501689)

I still haven't found what I'm looking for linkffn(11157943)

This Crude Matter linkffn(7882249)

Swords and Magic linkffn(6353083)

Equilibrium linkffn(11417036)

Dresden Files Crossover:

Denarian Renegade linkffn(3473224)

Fairy Tail crossover:

Dance of the Fairies, Flight of the Phoenix linkffn(10453666)


** I'm not much of a crossover reader myself, but I admit to being partial to this one myself:

linkffn(Crumpets Aren't My Style)

It's HP/Stargate, which seems to be quite lacking both in volume and, in my opinion, quality. It's a shame really, because the two worlds go quite well together without any need for contrived dimensional jumps or time-travel, both being secret program/communities existing in the modern world.

It uses quite a lot of Stargate, so that might be a little off-putting to a primarily HP fan, but I think it ties together the worlds quite well and is overall an enjoyable fic.

** Very good HP/Avengers is linkffn(Wand and Shield).

Just read amazing HP/A:TLA (Avatar), but unfortunately incomplete. I don't know whether it is abandoned or not, but linkffn(Harry Potter: The Last Avatar).

I read this HP/Star Trek (or was it Star Wars...?) a really long time ago. It was a highly reviewed HP with the filter Sci-Fi. Basically Harry travels forward in time, and there isn't much of a wizarding world left, and he joins something like the intergalactic army and goes to space, falls in love (twice, I think) and kills Voldemort. I'm pretty sure it was abandoned as well. If anyone remembers or recognizes it, please link it.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is the best crossover I've ever read. Really long, changes the canon timeline a lot in a believable way (but still set at Hogwarts), and the author has finished the first two years already.

The changes to the plot ripple out from a failed attempt by the remaining Death Eaters to summon Voldemort back from the dead. Instead, they get Milo, a 3rd-level Wizard from the Eberron setting in Dungeons and Dragons. He's a very well-written OC in that he has believable strengths and weaknesses, as well as being rather funny. There's also some significant character development.

You don't need to be familiar with Dungeons and Dragons to enjoy this. It helps to know how Vancian casting works (you memorise spells, and when you cast them you forget them again) but in general, if you've played a game similar to Skyrim that would be enough. I'd only ever played an older edition of D&D that's different enough to be a completely different game before reading this, and I enjoyed it immensely.

It has been ages since I found these fics, but I am pretty sure that the authors do a good job of explaining what needs to be explained, given I read them fine before I even touched the canon books.

Edit: Of course, knowing basic concepts such as the White Council, the Vampire Courts, and who Dresden and Murphy is are probably needed, but you must have picked these up from the denarian fic.

Shame only one crossover amongst his stuff, as whatever he'd write would most likely end up hilarious.
