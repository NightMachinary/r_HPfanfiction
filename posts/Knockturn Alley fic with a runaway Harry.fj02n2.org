:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find this fic but I can't remember the name for the life of me and my Google fu has failed.

Harry is a runaway I think and discovers Diagon/Knockturn Alley. He runs into Fenrir and befriends a hag.

Lucius Malfoy and Snape see him and try to find out who he is on a slapstick kind of way.

Hopefully somebody remembers this!

Thanks in advance.


** I think I know which fic you are talking about but can't find it.

In it Harry and Dudley get kidnapped and when the Drusleys come to pay ransom they decide to keep Harry because of the various signs of abuse.

Harry is raised by them and can do a few tricks. In one scene when a gun was pointed on him he managed to magik the magzine out.

The kidnapper Harry is closest to gets into an accident and is dying but Harry manages to save his life. But the problem is that he is in a coma and would not wake up.

If someone can guess the fic from this please do.

***** Yep

Actually, I remembered it only because of your description as I haven't progressed far in the story. But I checked for Fenrir and Snape&Lucius and those are there just as OP stated
