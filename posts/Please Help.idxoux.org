:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Fan fic trilogy where in the first one, Harry meets a vampire in the forbidden forest and almost kills her, but they end up falling in love. Think her name was RJ... she dies at the end of book 1. I think he was out there because there was a griffin in the forest and he was working on his animagus form? Maybe mixing two stories. Then I believe in book two after LV is dead, he becomes a pro quidditch player and gets engaged to cho, but then she cheats on him. Think Sirius is alive during this trilogy. Driving me crazy and been try to refind it for the last couple days
