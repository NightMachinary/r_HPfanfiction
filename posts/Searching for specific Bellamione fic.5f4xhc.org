I'm trying to find this fic I saw a while ago, wondering if it's been updated. It was on fanfiction.net My google fu is failing me, I'm ashamed to say. Baby Hermione's parents die and Dumbledore decides to give her to the Malfoys. They agree to take her, so she can be Voldemorts pawn and they can spare Draco. Bellatrix does some weird spell that gives them a mind meld, basically, and chats to her from prison. It's all very creepy and hilarious.


** You are probably looking for linkffn(10922077), though I don't recall it being creepy or hilarious, so I might be wrong.

  In the wake of a tragedy Dumbledore seizes an opportunity to use a mother's plea to his advantage. Unfortunately he did not factor a certain Death Eater into the equation. (Not a part of the "Time Heals All Wounds" series)

*** Yes, it's this one, thanks! By hilarious I meant strange. And it does seem a tad creepy to me to have a grown woman telepathically communicating with a child she is related to and wants to seduce. I guess I have weird standards.
