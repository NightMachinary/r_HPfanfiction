With magic based entirely on belief and to an extent, faith, the magical world's belief that Harry could do anything actually caused him a noticeable increase in his abilities. Whoever wrote the Harry Potter storybooks (the ones that Ginny read as a little girl) actually was helping him by shifting public perception towards him.

​

In a world where belief is everything, speeches are everything and perception becomes reality.

​

For example, Harry's speech at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts caused all within hearing range to believe that Tom was mortal, negating several rituals he went through as backup for the Horcruxes, and maybe destroying several other Horcruxes at the same time that the trio didn't get to.


** Everyone believing Harry was a delusional and damaged person in OotP caused him to be really angry and made it really difficult to get over Cedric's death. In HBP when everyone believed him to be The Chosen One and a Hero he got over Sirius' death very quickly and transformed him into a lot more mellow person.

*** Interestingly, you see a similar effect after traumatic experiences - social support reduces the severity, intensity and occurrence of PTSD and the same for complicated grief. So, that's a real world thing written before it became mainstream.

** So, something like orks in 40k? Like they believe that painting a vehicle red will make it faster, and that belief changes reality enough for it to work.

Would be cool to read a story with Harry getting a hold on some Ork miniatures, or an Ork codex (game one, not an actual book of spells), and somehow his magic adapts to his own beliefs

The only way to get rid of them is to burn the whole planet down.

****** It's worth noting that sometimes, enemies who beat the orks pick up orkish weapons, only to realize that they're literally just twisted bits of metal or wood in gun-like shapes. Orks can still make them shoot.

  A prank in Professor Trelawney's class leads to Ron being hailed as a seer. But nobody could predict how that would change Harry's fate. AU, starts 3rd year. Powerful!Harry. Adventure/Humor.

** [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/e4z5hd/collective_unconsciousness/]]

It's a very good idea and the thread above puts some other spins on a similar idea/gives some other information on a similar idea that I think would be useful here - the modification of the collective unconscious and Jungian Archetypes is a really interesting concept and there's a lot of old Psychological Theory that can be brought in to help create a system for that sort of thing.
