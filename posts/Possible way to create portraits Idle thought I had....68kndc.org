There is some speculation about portraits in the fandom. Do they retain the memories of the person? Are the sapient? Etc. I think I've formed a suitable theory.

Imagine if portraits could be created by using the memories of the deceased's loved ones. When Dumbledore died, all the Hogwarts faculty and students as well as his friends and political allies would donate their some or all of their memories of the man. These memories would be mixed into a potion. This potion would be applied onto an ordinary painting of Dumbledore's, giving it the "personality" of Dumbledore himself.

...Or at least his personality as his loved ones saw it. If Dumbledore had some secret side of himself that he never showed to anyone, the painting wouldn't have that side because no one donated those memories. The painting Dumbledore would also only know the secrets that were in the memories. It wouldn't know about Horcruxes, for example, if Harry didn't donate those memories into the potion. I think this works well with what we know about paintings from canon, aside from being an interesting way to celebrate a witch or wizard's life after their death. Maybe these memories could be donated during a wake or something.


** Pottermore has an [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/hogwarts-portraits][article]] on magical portraits.

I like your idea (I think using memories is really interesting), but I think the article in question is fairly conclusive on how portraits are created specificaly headmasters/headmistresses' portrait:

#+begin_quote
  Once the portrait is completed, the headmaster or headmistress in question keeps it under lock and key, regularly visiting it in its cupboard (if so desired) to teach it to act and behave exactly like themselves, and imparting all kinds of useful memories and pieces of knowledge that may then be shared through the centuries with their successors in office

** I'm 99% certain that I've seen your idea actually executed in a fic like that. As a way for Harry to get a portrait of his parents, but I don't remember the story anymore.

**** In this one they collects memories of harry s parents but his godmother insist that they also take memories of Snape so that he also knows his parents bad sides. I wouldn't recommend the story because its not really that good. linkffn(8769990)

** Portaits act the way the painter perceived the person he painted and the degree to which they can interact with the people looking at them depends on the power of the witch or wizard painted. Dumbledore had a portait painted prior to his death and taught it to be as much like him as possible.

** Given that memory extraction is a thing, wouldn't it make sense to have portraits run off of extracted copies of memories? Perhaps Dumbledore's pensieve is school property, to assist in that purpose...

** A story i'm doing has three types of portraits. One where it's taught by the paintee as it's painted via a stone held/worn. The second has the memory copies extracted and used as the emulsifier for the pigments with the stone also used which enhances the intelligence of the painting. And the third has special runesets that combine the first two and also allow it to continue learning.
