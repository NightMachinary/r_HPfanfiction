I've read and reread linkffn(13022013) and I really like the idea of Harry being a philanthropist and businessman with any money he may have inherited. In Novocaine, he felt very Elon Musk/Mark Cuban and it was very interesting. So I'm looking for stories similar to Novocaine. I would prefer no slash please. It does not have to include Lord Potter or any titles. In fact, if Harry is just smart with his money that would be interesting as well.
