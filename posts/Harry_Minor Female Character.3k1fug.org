I'd like some stories featuring Harry and a minor female character! That is, him paired up with a side/secondary character. Like, Pansy, Romilda Vane, Parvati, Alicia Spinnet, Hannah...etc. etc.

No Fleur/Harry please! No Luna/Harry either...Luna is too much of a "main" character than a minor one.

To be honest, I don't remember the details of all of these since it's been a while since I've read them. But I do remember that I enjoyed them at the time, and that they're all pretty well-written. Most of them unfortunately aren't complete, but I still think they're worth the read.

  Despair over the loss of his godfather in the Battle of the Dept. of Mysteries, followed by abandonment, isolation and hopelessness drive Harry to try and end his own life. Though death itself cannot halt his just vengeance against the Dark Lord, nor keep him from attaining that which he has ever been denied; someone to love and be loved by.

  Pansy told herself to act natural, but she couldn't quite remember how she naturally acted around Harry Potter. She certainly wasn't nice to him, but she didn't think it exactly fit to glare at him when he hadn't done anything wrong yet. Shameless PPHP.

*** Vengeance from the grave gets really bad after the initial arc. The author just kind of wants us to also read this second arc in which Harry/Susan gets actual traction, but fails horribly.

  Set post OOTP AU NonHBP. Harry Potter and Susan Bones. Gritty realism, independent Harry and a believable Voldemort all in a desperate battle to control the fate of the wizarding world. Rating increased to Mature.
