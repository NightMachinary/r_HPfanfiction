I hate when people try to make Ron unjustified in hating slytherins during next gen stories. especially if the story is canon compliant.


** Unaware bashing.

I'm all for bashing that is gleefully entered into and acknowledged as such. I generally don't read it, but I'm glad that people who enjoy it have an opportunity to read and write and share.

But I don't like to see a fic explicitly labeled "no bashing" that then goes into how the Marauders were the worst people ever with no redeeming characteristics and Snape is a flawless bunny rabbit. Because "that's not bashing, that's just canon." No, no it isn't.

** Where Harry overhears how the Weasleys or Hermione aren't his friends and they're in it for the money and all

I don't mind bashing and I don't mind if Hermione/the Weasleys aren't his friends and in it for the money, but I specifically hate Harry overhearing it because it's proceeded by the most cringy, unrealistic dialogue

** I think Harry bashing is so strange and makes me click away the fastest, I used to see it a lot in Draco or Snape redemption arcs and it was always a trip

** The way Ron is portrayed as a selfish, lazy character, making him into a glutton who only cares about food, and is dumb, ignorant and incompetent.

Abusive Ron or Ron who sides with a manipulative Dumbledore for money

Or generally being portrayed as a toxic friend.

And before you ask; yes, Ron is one of my favourites.

** Bashing James and Lily in WBWL fics. I genuinely don't understand the obsession. Is it lack of originally? Is it people projecting their own abusive parents (and I don't mean that as an accusation)?

** I once read a fix where Ron was abusive towards hermione and the author portrayed him as this evil villain. In that case it was justified because he was abusive; hitting hermione and calling her worthless etc but it put me off of reading any fics with Ron in them for a long while

** When a character in a serious story is evil AND dumb. If it's a comedy, ok. But when reading a dramatic story a character starts cackling about his evilness out loud, it really kills it for me.

** I remember one that I was blindsided by Luna bashing. Luna is like my favorite character and there was no reason for it. It was just total hate from the second she was introduced and BAM everyone was dicks to her.

** I remember reading a fic that seemed okay until some pretty extream Ron bashing started happening I stopped reading when Ron and Draco teamed up to help Astoria's uncle rape her (she was twelve) and the author in author's notes had been trying to gaslight Ron by talking about his actions in the fic as if they were canon or at least within Ron's character in canon. So yeah, whatever you call that is my least favorite form of bashing.

** I recently read a fic where there was constant low-stakes bashing of one character (among lots of other elements) that got super annoying since it wasn't played for laughs nor after a certain point did it illustrate any character or plot elements nor did it ever go anywhere or develop into anything interesting.

This sort of thing, when it is repeated so often for no good reason with no meaningful variation just kills the mood of a story for me. It begins to feel more like a hit-piece and I just can't manage to tolerate it.

** Bashing in the form of emotional manipulation makes me really uncomfortable and is likely to make me drop a fic. A fic featuring emotionally manipulative James is the reason I no longer read Jily (in any form) as main focus, and nowdays I avoid fics that stray even close to featuring major emotional manipulation. This also includes Obliviation abuse, which I've seen some evil!Dumbledores practice. In fact, Obliviation abuse by an evil!Dumbledore in a fic once caused me to drop a fic I was 70% done with and was invested in, because I want nothing to do with that kind of stuff, no matter what (The fic had other problems, but that was the last straw for my willingness to finish it).

Bashing to me is always a flaw, but while most forms of bashing gets penalized in my willingness to recommend a fic to others, usually only this form of bashing is enough to make me outright drop a fic.

** Any form of bashing. I get it that most stories are written from the perspective of a character and that character might dislike other characters thus emphasizing their bad traits. But being unjustifiably thought of as a piece of shit for any character is not to my liking.
