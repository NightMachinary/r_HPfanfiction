** A day in life of Professor McGonagall.. Featuring rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, absent Dumbledores and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa.

Frankly, the best damn portrayal of her I have yet to read. The author did a wonderful job of capturing her dry humour. All the other characters too have been brilliantly depicted. Not to mention the chaos that is Hogwarts. A note of warning though -- this will send you to hysterics, and possibly crack a rib or two..
