How would you fix your least favourite cliche?


** Here are a couple:

#+begin_quote
  The "trunk" (you all know which one I'm talking about!!)
#+end_quote

Solution: The trunk Bartemius Crouch Jr used in GoF was a one-of-a-kind family heirloom of the Crouch family. It was created by a Crouch years ago and isn't for sale in the open market. Other people don't even know this exists at all. The wizarding world is filled with rare one-off heirlooms like this that aren't widespread.

#+begin_quote
  The Potter "mansion" with a vault containing a billion galleons.
#+end_quote

Solution: The potters were well off, but not anywhere near millionaires. Their only house was in Godrics Hollow and James' father's (more on James' father later) house was destroyed by Voldemort in 1980.

#+begin_quote
  Charlus Potter and Dorea Black
#+end_quote

This is 100% JKR's fault for making these people canon.

Solution: Charlus Potter did exist in the 1970s but he isn't related to Fleamont Potter. The two families just randomly had the same last name independently from each other. Charlus Potter and Dorea Black are dead now due to old age.

#+begin_quote
  Irrational fear of werewolves.
#+end_quote

Solution: Remus is actually an exceptional calm werewolf who is in control outside the full moon. Other werewolves are far more like Fenrir Greyback and have wild and murderous tendencies even in human form. Werewolves genuinely are a threat even when not in wolf-form. Remus is simply an exception because he was turned before puberty.

*** Why is a direct relation to house Black a bad thing? It's not like the relation alone gives Harry a ton of gold and five mansions. Given the size of the magical community Harry is bound to have some distant magical relatives. The Malfoys and Tonks would be third or fourth cousins/aunts/uncles, not a second mother/father/sibling.

*** Or, alternatively, the trunks take a long time to make but it just so happens that Harry does have a trunk he inherited, with self-shrinking and all. He tries to move it but it's no dice, too heavy, so he tells it to shrink and it actually unshrinks, becoming huge, because it was already shrunk and looked the normal size then. Now what are you going to do with an 8x8x16 feet trunk, Sir Potter?

*** Charlus and Dorea were conveniently dead quite some time before Harry was orphaned, though, so it doesn't matter how closely related they were. (The ministry probably wouldn't dare to be openly anti-muggle just after Voldemort's fall anyway, so the Dursley's "claim" was probably more valid anyway than those of the Malfoys.)

Also, Rowling stated that magical Potters, Smiths, Blacks, etc. were related, despite the names being very common muggle last names.

Although personally I don't care much whether Harry's descended from Charlus or Fleamont (or both, since Fleamont Potter is old enough to be well known in the 20's for Sleakeasy) as long as it doesn't spawn too many cliches.

If the Charlus theory had held, she and Harry would have been cousins.

** A magical core is but the word used for a concentration of magical energies within the world - in a magical being, a wand, a magical house,...

A "powerful" magical core merely describes the ability of the described object or subject to channel and form magic into effects, other than weak magical cores found for example in squibs, or objects and subjects devoid of a magical core, like muggles.

Magical cores cannot be trained, made bigger or smaller. They just are a binary measure of the magical capabilities of a subject or object. Also a wizard or witch does not /have/ a magical core, they /are/ a magical core.

Or just don't even mention them.

** EDIT: Misread the thread title, but keeping this up

Lord Potter cliche

Oh, Heir Potter, you also have thousands of Galleons of debt that you owe to several Houses, including Smith, Bones, and Longbottom. Your holdings as de facto Heir Black will be enough to cover that debt, but you will not have any money to throw around until you are of age.

Also, you ave other responsibilities, including a welfare check on everyone in your family. Here is a list of all of your family members and how to contact them. Please contact them at your earliest convenience.

Finally, you do indeedhave a marriage contract... it seems you have to marry the next heiress to House Finnegan... which means your betrothed won't be born for another 10 years at least (according to our estimations)

** Generally a deconstruction is what you want for an overly chiched trope, but that isn't fixing it really.

If you are asking how to deconstruct them, that is easy: (Plot Armor a problem? Make it so your characters explicitly seek to do important/risky stuff because they know it reduces their mortality. Harems? Have it fall apart for all the reasons multi-marriage is normally banned)

Unsure how you fix them while playing them entirely straight...

**** Pssh you have magic, we can come up with better ways to play with it than that. You can go all Wrasse on them, spell them so the strongest of the group becomes male while all the rest become female, and if the male is away too long the next strongest female becomes male, and if you have two males in the group the weaker becomes female. The drama basically writes itself

Or you could reverse it and go all cownfish, the largest and strongest becomes female and the rest are male until the leader dies or is removed.

Plop it into your standard 'we discovered coven ritual that will maximize all our powers but didn't do the research on what it actual does' and you have a story.

Or, you could go with "The three girls proposed a relationship, and after the guy agrees, they spell him to split into three copies of himself. The copies don't get along"

Or you could take the whole 'only one wizarding school in all of britain' thing to its extreme: If one male is taking up 80% of the eligible females in their age group, there is bound to be repercussions with the rest of the male population. Either fighting back, leaving the country, or whatnot.

But I was more practically saying those who write it should read up on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygyny]] and try to actually make some social commentary, instead of using it as a way to get characters together. But since most of the fics written just want to get characters together...

Alternatively, you could, you know, set up a world similar to real-life conditions that Polygamy shows up: eg: the persistent and significant imbalance in the male/female ratio.

** Lord Potter --

Harry inherits the Potter lordship, which includes a seat on the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, he can't claim the seat until he is 17, and once he does turn 17, the Ministry has been overrun by Voldemort and friends so it's useless for Harry to try to politic his way around. Besides, who is going to take a 17 year old seriously in government, even if he is a celebrity?
