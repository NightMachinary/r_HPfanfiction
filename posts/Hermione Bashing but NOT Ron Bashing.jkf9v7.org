Ive seen so many fics with either both being bashed, or Ron being bashed but not Hermione. I like Ron as a character way more and would love to see him done well!!!!! And while I prefer Hermione bashing, im at the point where ill take any fic with a well written Ron!!!! C'mon!!!! It has to exist somewhere!!!!!


** I agree. If one character from the Golden Trio had to be excluded, it's Hermione

*** Exactly!!! Ive never really liked her, even as a child. And fic tends to portray her as an all knowing, gorgeous, sex bomb, who never makes mistakes. And I blame a lot of that on the movies for giving her all of Rons positive personality traits. This girl is not perfection. She can be bossy, and rude, and almost never thinks shes wrong. She hold the opinions of books higher than those of her friends and never trys to stop her cat from chasing scabbers instead saying 'its not his fault'. Shes not all bad but she has some major flaws.

** Sadly, I can't find anything like that. For some reason, whenever I search up "Hermione Bashing" it always gives me Weasley bashing instead.

  Hagrid wins a dragon egg...only what is inside is no dragon. Harry is the first to make eye contact with the creature inside...and ends up with a most unusual familiar. Watch out Hogwarts...things are about to get prehistoric!

** Begone, blasphemer! +Siriusly+ Seriously, though, most fanfiction I read was only bashing Ron and/or other Weasleys.

*** Im just so tired of it by now y'know? Ron is so much more that a jealous prat!!! And hes a really hard character to get right, trying to write him is a constant struggle to find the balance between jokster, jealousy, seriousness, loyalty, and loving warmth. Half the time bashing Ron feels like a cop out and im sitting here like "Where's the kid who stood on a broken leg in front of his friends and told a serial killer to his face that he would have to kill him first to get to them"? "Wheres the boy who offered a lonely boy his only food to make him happy"? "Wheres the person who would give everything including the shirt off his back for his friends"?

I just want Ron to be done justice.

**** Everyone talks about that time he left Hermione and Harry during the Horcrux Hunt. I have to ask one thing, tho.

Where is the boy who spent monthes following the guidance of a ball of light that entered his body, in the hopes it could bring him back to his friends? The boy who saw a friend dive deep into a cold lake, and didn't hesitate to jump in to save said friend?

We always talk about Ron's failures as a friend, but never about his shining moments.
