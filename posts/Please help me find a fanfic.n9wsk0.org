:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello all!

I was having a discussion today with another Potterhead about various “after the war” fan fictions that we've read, and I remembered a very specific one that was on Amazon as a Kindle book. The basic plot of the story involved the death of Xenophilous, and I'm also pretty sure that Ginny dead near Azkaban....it was also around the 500 page mark. Please help!
