LF fics where Harry is questioning his self worth, where he doesn't believe in himself, doesn't think he deserves his magic etc. I mean, he grew up in an emotionally abusive household. He was told he was a freak, an unwanted burden. Dudley gets thirty nine birthday presents and Harry gets socks and a coat hanger. Preferably with no shipping, but I'll take what I'll get.


** I don't tend to read fics where he's actually depressed, other than the inevitable beginning of half post-GOF fics and all post-OotP fics, but I've thought of a few that definitely show negative mental effects of his upbringing. Or lack thereof.

linkffn(2006636) features very clever abuse by the Dursleys, where they teach Harry to hate and fear magic and thus himself.

linkffn(7093738) explores the consequences of a neglected and abused child, and how his abnormal psyche would cause some very different behavior and choices.

On a related note, linkffn(11585823) has a Harry who isn't depressed, but is definitely broken by the way he was raised, and focuses on one goal and one path, no matter the cost. A more light-hearted equivalent of this fic is linkffn(12703694), where Harry is also obsessed with Transfiguration but more along the lines of HPMOR's experimentation, crossed with a strong dose of according-to-the-author-not-autism.

  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
