So many crossovers with GoT ends up nerfing HP magic. I want to read some where it doesn't, and magic is a huge game changer.

  It only takes a single disharmonious element to throw off the entire composition. Fifty years before Robert Baratheon ascends the Iron Throne, Westeros receives one hell of a bad musician. Harry never did care about any player other than himself.

**** I have just read it myself, and it is good in quite unique way. It is way better than most crossovers that make Harry respawn, so to say, in a new body. This Harry has a big story-background that enables him to do as he pleases, because we already have an established count of his abilities. And while the views of the author certainly bleed into the story, one must treat it like what it is: fantasy. There is no need to be offended if one disagrees.

*** That entire intro is plagiarised from another fic. I remember the other fic having voldemort doing a ritual to go to another world, but until that point, this fic's intro is a pretty nast copy paste job.

You can tell as well, the writing not copied has a much worse quality and a weird tonal shift. Really shoddy work, and pretty disgraceful to steal others' work.

EDIT: Found the fic its copying as well, "Im still here," by kathryn518, linked: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/]] Just compare the intros. Its pretty pathetic.

Also, kathryn seems to be real nice when it comes to people using her ideas, considering there's a fic where even the whole premise of I'm Still Here is identical, called From Ruin. So I don't see your point of "plagiarizing" a FANFICTION. But Ok. You're free to do and say whatever you want. Best of luck.

  Hermione realized it began with a sense of Impending Doom and finished with a battle outside her tent. The deciding line between staying and helping Robb Stark, or returning to her universe, is getting harder to see the longer she's in Westeros.

** I hit this thread last night wanting some reads and did most of the ones noted here.

Best one was Winter Witch, by far. Hermione felt a bit OOC at the end due to how fast she accepted medieval standards related to justice and killing, although it felt more like the author just skipped over some critical development than truely OOC. It is written in a more 'HP' style, heavy focus on individual characters and their progress.

The other one that worked well was The Wizard of Harrenall. This was written in more Game of Thrones style narrative rather than HP narrative (Lots of jumping around and skipping critical events, leaving readers to fill in).

I skipped A Road to Hell as it was described as everyone being psychotic, and I hate it when GOT fics insert characters and they gleefully dive into brutality, as if the only reason they weren't murdering killing bastards was because society was stopping them.

​

I also skipped Discordant Note, as it was a sequel.

Difference one Man can Make needs an editor. It suffers badly from the 'whole first chapter of background that has no impact on the rest of the fic and could be cut'. Harry's motivation seemed way off for why he stayed in the north, he is entirely too comfortable with leading/politics given his previous development (and why not go south if he liked politics). Romance also wasn't great. Unimpressed

Legend of the Gryphon had an interesting concept, but I couldn't read their version of Ginny/Sirus as related to HP cannon and they didn't seem be challenged much by their situations. Didn't make it far in.

​

State of Grace was... meh? Certainly a fix-it, with things going way too well for everyone involved given that it is an insert where the character doesn't know the plot beforehand. Also the romance is forced and not convincing.

** There aren't many worth talking about.

I would say that "Last Hero's Heir" by Newmic should be on this list. The story is set prior to the book or show canon and starts in the late 270's or early 280's AC. Basically, Harry and the house-elves arrive in the world of ASoIaF/GoT and unleash holy hell. Some minor spoilers for the setting: turns out Godric Gryffindor fought against the Others eight thousand years ago and house-elves are Children of the Forest. How that all came about is actually pretty interesting and definitely a step up from the typically /very original/ methods of "Harry is reborn in Westeros" or "Harry travels worlds for no believable reason whatsoever". Sadly the author never properly finished the story and when I looked just now, it seems to have been deleted.

As unlikable as I find the Harry in Noodlehammer's recent work, the author knows how to worldbuild and knows how to work in original ideas. Because the story begins two or three generations earlier there won't be any stages of canon in this one.

My favorite out of that genre fitting your request is "The Wizard of Harrenhal" which has already been mentioned. I'm a bit sad though that the author won't be writing the Dune crossover he teased us with at the end.
