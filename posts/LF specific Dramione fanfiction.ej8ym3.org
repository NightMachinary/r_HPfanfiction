:END:
I just thought about it for the first time in a while and wanted to reread, it was about Hermione and others going back to Hogwarts to help rebuild and attend for their final year. They ended up having a club for those in her age and became friends with a bunch of Slytherins and Hanna Abbott. I think they might've had a special common room for the “8th” years but i can't be 100% certain


** Rebuilding by Colubrina. One of my favorite fics of all time [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11439594/1/Rebuilding]]
