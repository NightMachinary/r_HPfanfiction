Ive been looking for this obscure fanfiction forever now, and I have basically given up hope. Its this weird dark harry fic, where for whatever reason after the Tournament three spirits wake up in his mind. They are all dark lords of some degree. The first one is the guy who made azkaban, the second one was Morgana LeFay, and im not sure who the third one was. I also vaguely remember he could turn into a raven. I know this has to be like the edgiest sounding thing ever, but if that one guy could request a snarry dadslash fic i can request this. Thank you in advance!

Please forgive me mods im not sure how to flair on the mobile app.


** I'm pretty sure you are talking about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959046/1/The-Lesser-Sadness][The Lesser Sadness]]. linkffn(10959046)

After his death, Harry gets sent back in time to the night of Voldemort's resurrection in the graveyard with part of the soul of three dark wizards in his mind. Through them he gains their knowledge, abilities, etc. One is a dark witch from Italy (not Morgana) and one is the man who created Azkaban. Harry could turn into a raven because the dark witch was a raven animagus.
