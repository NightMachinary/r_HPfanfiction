It's getting harder and harder to find new, original material. I've browsed through the first hundred pages of the FFN 'favorites' list, and it's just getting increasingly inane. Searching through the vast quantities of sub-par works just isn't my thing. Anyone want to bring some hidden gems to light?

Any pairing, any plot, any time-period, anything. I'd like to be cursing some of you guys for productivity lost while reading.


** linkffn(Becoming Neville) is really good, but I've never seen it mentioned.

** linkffn(Cursebreaking Hamunaptra by Zenzao) is short, incomplete with sporadic updates and is utterly brilliant. Plus it is Bill Weasley-centric.

  She walked into his office with a map and a plea for help, out of options to turn to and desperately short on knowledge. How could he say no? A Bill Weasley versus the Mummy challenge fic in progress. AU - canon divergence and fusion, some humor. Rating may change with future updates.

#+begin_quote
  Just as he finishes one war to save his world, Harry is literally pulled into another. The trials of living in Zuellni aren't as bad as back in England, but the Contaminoid threat will rear its ugly head. Harry has to fight to protect what he holds dear, but that is nothing new. A certain silver-haired manipulator just has to be put in his place first.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** linkffn(10847788) is essentially about religion being practiced at Hogwarts in the perspective of a Jewish wizard. Knowing nothing about Judaism, I found it interesting to read, even if I didn't understand some parts of the religion. I think this fic does well in dealing with the balance between magic and religion in religious muggle families.

  What's a nice Jewish boy like Anthony doing at Hogwarts? Well, for starters, his name isn't really Anthony. Winner of the Fanfiction Booker's Prize 2014.
