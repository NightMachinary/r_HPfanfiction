Basically, I like the idea of Harry/Ginny yet am tired of the common interpretations since it usually is either Weasley bashing (love potions, stealing money) or Weasley wank (look at all those "cute" children not contributing to the plot and Molly being her "loving" self). Being a single child, the idea of having such an extended, lively in-law family is nothing short of a nightmare and yet almost every H/G story either makes them (especially Molly) the antagonists before the eventual reconciliation or makes them out to be the best thing ever. And for some reason, if Harry is with Ginny, Hermione has to be with Ron (and quite often both are bashed or they do nothing but fight since they love each other SOOO much).

So are there any stories where Ginny is:

- paired with Harry

- friends with Hermione

- Hermione is NOT paired with Ron, Snape, Malfoy (or Neville)

- neither Ginny nor Hermione are part of the "big Weasley family". The occasional visit (once every month or so) would be fine, but certainly no weekly, scheduled visits.


** Brennus's Thorny Rose Series fits well, linkffn(9631998;9969456;10288020).

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

  The third and final part of the Thorny Rose trilogy. Voldemort is again without a body, Ron has vanished and our favourite couple now know the contents of the prophecy. More importantly, Sirius is getting married. What will Harry and Ginny do now to finally put the Wizarding World to rights.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.
