We all love him, he's clearly passionate, and I'm not trying to bash him but it does seem like his knowledge is lacking a bit and when he actually interacts with muggles he seems a tad condescending. It would be interesting to see a fic where he focus on learning about muggle society or maybe some kind of crisis forces him to.


** To me, given that his job in canon seemingly involves going to visit muggles who've been given cursed objects, the way he talks lacks all credibility. I wouldn't have thought he could be successful at his job without a really good understanding of muggle culture.

** Imagine the interaction between him and Molly's squib cousin.
