/"It was the most wonderful feeling. Harry felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness. He stood there feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of everyone watching him."/

Based on that description, any fics that use imperius as some kind of drug? Or using the curse to motivate self to do something?


** I do remember Harrymort using it in Seventh Horcrux. Yes, he is addicted to it. Like, addicted addicted.
