I finally posted the final chapter to my story after a very long hiatus.

Lily and James set up trust fund in the muggle world for Harry, overseen by a muggleborn who practices as a muggle solicitor. This has many consequences for Harry, most of them positive. The story ends after first year. There are no pairings and I tried really hard to avoid bashing.

Be warned, this story has fix-it elements. Also, I'm not a perfectionist so don't expect perfection. I believe I tell a good story, but it's not a great story. Maybe a solid 3 1/2 stars. This is not me being fake humble - I'm being kinda generous. I know there there are weak spots (the chapter where the Gryffindor Trio become friends is problematic) but I'm too lazy to fix it so there.

  Lily and James left Harry a muggle trust fund with a muggleborn trustee. This will impact Harry's childhood, leading to a more grounded Harry going to Hogwarts. Quickly runs through Pre-Hogwarts in the first few of chapters (gets the letter in chp 3). Anything recognizable belongs to JKR.
