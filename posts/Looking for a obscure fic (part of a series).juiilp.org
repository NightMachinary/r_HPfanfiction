Ok, I gotta get this out of my head. I've been looking for this for WEEKS and I'm dying. I remember this series of fics where in one Harry thinks he's breaking the law and flees to a old potter manor, but sends mcgonagall a letter about transfiguring rocks into dragons?

I remember that Harry ends up staying in a manor during the GOF part, and it becomes your usual â€˜oh now let's make this a 4th School' but with McGonagall and Flitwick as teachers.... I THINK it was HHr?

I found the whole series to be fluffy and not that bad of a cliche read, and would love to see them again! Any help would be great!!
