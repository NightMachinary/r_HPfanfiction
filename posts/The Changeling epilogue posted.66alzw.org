** Summary: "Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why."

Last line: "But just a house."

I like that.

*** Yes, its a good ending. I like the sentence before that line too.

  She'll teach them what it really means to be Slytherin---choice and ambition and cunning and all the murky shades of grey. Subtle. Useful. Unexpected.

  But just a house.
#+end_quote

Good description of slytherin ideals. It's too bad canon just made them the evil house and never did not really explore the good qualities or even just portray them as normal.

** But what happened to Smita?!!!!!????????!!!!!!

I love the last line, and the reveal of Ginny's tattoo at last. Her being in Slytherin really knocked down house barriers. I love that members from all four houses worked harmoniously throughout Year 6 and hang out like normal kids all being friends in the last scene.

*** I feel the author deliberately left Smita out for some plot development in the sequel. The author was too thorough for it to have been accidental.

**** Yea, you're probably right. I was just really hoping for a Ginny/Smita and Tobias/Smita reunion! Especially after Tobias was so badass in Year 6. Guess we have to wait!

** Is it just me or did that epilogue feel a bit off? I would've thought we'd get more about the summer. Also, [[/spoiler][so Harry goes with Ron and Hermione to look for her parents in Australia and that is still ongoing? ? Harry just sorta abandons Ginny, and Ginny thinks finding them will take a long time and Harry might not return for a very long time, if at all, and she is ok with it? I don't quite understand that little tidbit. Why would Harry not come back to her?]]

Overall amazing story and if there is a sequel, excited to see where this goes.

*** Yeah, that part is a little weird, but i think you can rationalize it pretty well.

Before they really couldn't focus on their relationship due to the war, and right now Harry is making the choice to be there for Hermione. It almost gives the sense that those three will always be going on adventures by themselves, excluding and leaving others behind, but stopping back every now and then to catch up. Harry, Ron, and Hermione have a very strong bond that will last their entire life, and Ginny might see just how hard it is for another person to break into that, and carve out a place of belonging within that group, since Ginny doing the same within Slytherin was the whole premise of this story.

Overall, I don't think Ginny has given up on the relationship, and will be more than happy to pursue it if Harry is back and ready by the time the year ends. But I think it comes down to a couple truths, to quote The West Wing a couple times, 'decisions are made by those in the room', and 'at some point you need to choose to have a relationship.'

**** I just found it a bit odd that was really the first only mention of Harry, that by the end of the summer he went off with Ron and Hermione. No real mention of whether they were together even, though based on the previous chapters I'd guess yes.

I know their relationship isn't the focus of the story, but perhaps it's treated too nonchalantly in the epilogue.

*** It's a decent Slytherin Ginny who brings Slytherins into the DA/fight against Voldemort. The prose is a bit too purple and the plot lines just follow canon but the character interactions can be nice. Several interesting OCs.
