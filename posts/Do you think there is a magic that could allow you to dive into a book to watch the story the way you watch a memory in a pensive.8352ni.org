In canon we see the ability to dive into memory's with both the pensive and riddles Diary, but do you think that if you let the weasly twins study a pensive they would be able to create a item that lets you dive into and watch the storys into books? Or mabye even join the adventure?


** I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility. I think as time goes on and video games become popular in the muggle world, a magical counterpart will come. A muggleborn would definitely think along those lines, and Fred and George may too.

*** I think if anyone were to do it as accidental magic as a child it would be Hermione.

*** Yea although if would be nice if they were remeber more often in fanfiction

They seems like a really a product that could almost be turned into the wizarding worlds Netflix. they could also be used for education by haveing the person have a day dream were they use what they are trying to learn or are learning in the day dream from someone the user finds very attractive, like learn French from a French Veela.

** Sure. The problem is creating the false memory for it to use and mass production.

I imagine it would start with people selling their real memories.

Imagine Victor Crum selling his memory of a winning game.

He would never sell it, but Boy-Who-Lived fans would kill to get Harry's memory of the Dragon task, or the basilisk encounter.

Etc.

** That sounds interesting, but I don't think it would be anything like a Pensieve. See, I see Pensieves as materializing the actual memories of the soul. That is to say the Pensieve creates no data, it's just an interface for something that already existed. A magical story-immersion system is definitely /possible/, but would work along completely different lines.
