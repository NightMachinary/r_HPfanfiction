****** You can download a PDF of it via Goodreads [[https://www.goodreads.com/ebooks/download/10207687-dumbledore-s-army-and-the-year-of-darkness][here]]. But before reading it, please check out the [[http://web.archive.org/web/20120114061932/http://wiki.fandomwank.com/index.php/Victoria_Bitter][FandomWank article]] on its author, which I promise has more absurd plot twists than any of the fics suggested here.

** Does reading back what I wrote as an 11 year old child count? Highlights include one fic being written like a script. In that same fic, I had Hermione's parents die because Voldemort killed them, Hermione sobbing all the time with McGonagall as her mentor, and all three of the Golden Trio lived with their teachers because Hogwarts was really dangerous. Oh, and I had Minerva turn into a phoenix for no reason other than the fact that Dumbledore was giving her an order. Sadly, it just gets worse from there. My 11 year old self just wrote whatever came to mind, no plot at all. Maybe that itself was the plot twist. :P

**** Oh god. I mean, I could, since I had all of my fics uploaded to HarryPotterFanFiction and FanFiction.Net for years before I took them down out of embarrassment, I managed to copy them all though. I'd like to think that even my Reddit comments can prove that I'm a better writer than I was as a child. People would comment that the characters were way too OOC and I'd cry, haha.

** There was a a HP/ASOIAF crossover I was following that just completely lost the plot, started out as your typical wizard powerwank and gallivanting across the Essos with a pretty lady, not excellent but better than most crossovers. Then in the space of about 3 chapters it went from Harry the wizard badass and devolved into harems of freed slaves, boring home life and a truly creepy pedophilia angle out of nowhere, the author must have got bombarded because they just tied it all up with a summary of what they would have done after. If for some reason you want to witness the dumpster fire it turned into it was called The Last Hero's Heir, though I really couldn't recommend it.
