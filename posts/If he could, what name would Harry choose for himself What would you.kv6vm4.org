So imagine the following scenario: Harry gets back to the Magical World, and he gets the opportunity to choose the first name for himself, for whatever reason. Now, you're 10/11 years old child, who believes that his parents were useless drunks who abandoned him, and his name does not bring any happy memories. What would he choose? Something cool? Something magical? Both?

What name would you choose if you found yourself in a similar situation? :P

*Edit: I'm asking about the first name, not surname*

Go wild!

** I'm pretty sure an 11-year-old boy in 1991 would, given the choice, call himself something like Dr. Awesome or Han Skywalker.

** Other than something nifty and fierce sounding to a kid, like Saber or Fang, he might embrace his new heritage and choose to be Gandalf. If he's in a bad mood, perhaps he'd become Sauron.

** Questions:

- Does Harry know Muggle literature/pop-culture?
- Does Harry put two-and-two together?

If yes to both, I could see him naming himself after a wizard in muggle pop-culture - or, in the case of Merlin, trying and getting talked out of it. If he's even aware of the series' existence (I wasn't, at 11, but then I couldn't actually read English yet) he might try Sparrowhawk or Ged, from the Earthsea novels - the parallels between Ged/Sparrowhawk (same character, Sparrowhawk's a nickname) and Harry would be very striking.

If he doesn't know any Muggle-pop-culture wizards, it'd probably be of the "sounds cool to an 11-year-old" variety. Or he'd just stick with Harry and tack something edgy on.

** Currently going through legal process to change my 9yo name and he wants Charmander/Charizard/any cool pokemon as a first name. So.....I imagine Harry wanting to be something super "cool" and utterly ridiculous.

And no, my son is not going to become Charmander. ðŸ¤£

** fuck, i don't know, maybe Leo? Leo is a pleasant name. It's also a star sign.

Wart, maybe? Or some Lord of the Rings-esque name?

I mean, if he knows astronomy, he might go the Black route.
