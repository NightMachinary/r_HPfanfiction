:END:
I originally found it via a post on this sub, but I've looked for the thread to no luck. It was set in an alternate universe with no Hogwarts, where society is divided into the distinct higher and upper classes, centuries in the past.

From what I remember, Hermione was a lowborn, under the tutelege of Snape, who also tutored highborn Daphne Greengrass (?), and at least at one point the two girls see each other/interact and are interested by the other. There was a rebellion of some sort, that I think Harry and Ron either led or were a part of, as Hermione ended up meeting with them under cover of darkness. She steals something from the Malfoys near the end, at a party hosted by them, where she had previously been dancing with Draco.

I gave up because I thought it rambled on quite a bit, but I wanted to give it another try, only I can't find it now. If it helps, I remember one review of it saying the language used was too purple prose-y...

Hopefully someone can help!

  Prince Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III of Berk has a problem. And that problem is Duke Aster Hofferson of Meathead Island. There's just something about the Duke that Hiccup is drawn to... but could the "Duke" be hiding something? [Hiccstrid, AU]
