I was browsing through my favourite fics for something to re-read, and wondered if there where any fics similar to perfect lionheart's Chuunin exam day ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/1/Chunin-Exam-Day]]) but set in harry potter of course.

The closest i have ever found is harry potter and the temporal beacon, ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon]]) which unfortunately hasn't been updated in over a year.


** /[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651][Sisyphus]]/ (6k words, complete) is a very nice short story on the topic.

*** It's certainly interesting, and definitely thoughtful, but a lot more of a downer than most stories of this type.

**** No problem. I would recommend reading Temporal Beacon. It most likely wont ever be finished (says so in author notes in chapter 1 iirc), but is still very good.

** When you can look at the "sequel" of Chuunin exam day. Not by PL and no time loop but it takes the Kitsune clan and puts them into the HP universe. Focus of the story is on Harry though. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9700763/1/The-Potter-Attraction]]

** There's one called the Fox and something...Harry's family are long time thieves and he Hermione take up the legacy. It's really good.

EDIT: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/7/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood][It's actually Larceny, Lechery and Luna Lovegood, it's is a bit crack!ficy but you might like it]]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6966314/1/DOOM-Day][DOOM Day]] is good. It's incomplete unfortunately. Someone posted a PDF of the most updated version a while back that included all the smut (surprisingly little considering) but I couldn't tell you where to find it now.
