I was just daydreaming and remembered reading this fic which included this really eccentric and insane version of Dumbledore who was pretty entertaining and funny to read about so I decided to seek help from my fellow readers at reddit. If you would be kind enough to recommend some fics like that I would be grateful.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)

Dumbledore is competent, yet also completely silly - highlights include taking Harry to a restaurant "owned by a famous Scottish chef" (they end up at McDonald's), half the plot hinging on how badly he trolls the Ministry regarding non-human students, and literally everything he does in Harry's fifth year.

The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond: linkffn(9818387)

Dumbledore takes basically any excuse to dodge paperwork and have fun. Sadly unfinished fic, but the highlights include him getting into a snowball fight, sneaking into the kitchens, and basically trolling McGonagall.

Aww, I saw this request and thought of recommending that! Saphroneth does a really good job of blending the competence and silliness. It helps that Dumbledore is humble about it, freely acknowledging that he may overlook or forget things. But when the chips are down, he always proves why people should take him seriously.

**** Agreed. The way he handles the Ministry is /exemplary/ for competent manipulation.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

** linkffn(Itachi, Is That A Baby?)

Harry is found and raised by the Akatsuki, learning some of their less fortunate tendencies. Dumbledore is a master at just shrugging and enjoying the madness from his seat at the head table, occasionally joining in and making things worse for poor Snape.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

*** I wasn't that into this fic when I read it years ago, but the one thing I remember is that Dumbledore is WILD in this. So so so hilarious, and actually I plan on re-reading soon just for that.
