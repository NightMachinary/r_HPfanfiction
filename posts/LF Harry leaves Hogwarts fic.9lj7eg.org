I've been trying to find a particular fic but I can't seem to find it. From what I remember the story involves Harry leaving Hogwarts around 2nd/3rd year. Sirius escapes Azkaban, and finds Harry at a previous apt he shared with James. Somehow the muggle prime minister gets involved, and Sirius starts informing him on how to deal with the magical ministry. End with Harry and Sirius running a magical school that integrates both muggle and magical subjects.


** I believe you're talking about linkffn(Screw them! by White Angel of Auralon). It also has a sequel linkffn( We're Screwed) which is less entertaining and more Wizards bashing.

  Harry Potter had enough of the stupidity of the Wizarding World. If they all believed that he was a dark wizard, just because he could talk to snakes, screw them! He didn't need them. And who ever said that all prophecies did come true? (No horcruxes).

  The Wizarding World is confronted with a problem they never had to face before. The consquences of their own arrogance and bigotry. After Hogwarts lost dozens of students each year, they try to change things again. But what do you do if you realise that things aren't that easy? Sequel to Screw Them

  The fallout from the Dueling Club was worse than in Canon and leads to the release of one Sirius Black from Azkaban. And he is not amused. 1 SLASH couple.
