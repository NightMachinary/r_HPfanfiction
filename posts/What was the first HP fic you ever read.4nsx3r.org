** HPMOR was the first fanfic I heard about. When it just started one of my friends mentioned the premise and I thought it sounded amusing.

Years later, about a month and a half before the story finally wrapped up I started reading it on a whim, mostly to check out my new kindle and how it would handle web content.

Conveniently I caught up just in time fore the whole "review and tell me how to end this," event. The HPMOR subreddit looked like someone had kicked over an anthill.

*** Pretty much same for me, except I had to wait for a while to see the aftermath of Hermione and Harrys fight.

Then I went by some of the authors recs on his note page, read Natural 20, Worm (not fanfic but /awesome/), and Nightmares because it had more reviews than anything else... and here we are. I've read hundreds of them now.

** Funnily enough, the first one I read, I had no idea was a fic. This was right when the 7th book was coming out (or maybe the 6th? I think 7th. Because I remember Horcruxes were talked about in it.)

I googled the book and tried downloading it a week before it was out, but of course, anything out at that time wasn't actually the real book. I stumbled upon melindaleo's */The Seventh Horcrux/* and I started reading it. It was pretty good, in terms of just raw ability of the writer, so I didn't think it /wasn't/ legit. Halfway through, though, I started getting suspicious, and later found out it was a fanfiction.

That said, I thoroughly enjoyed it, which totally changed my view on what I thought as 'cringy', and I've been devouring fanfics ever since. lol.

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

** Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent

linkffn(288212)

I found it as a "leaked" copy of the next HP book, which the entire world waited impatiently for. Downloaded it from /idontrememberwherebutitwasntffnet/, and soon realized it wasn't the genuine JKR.

But it was a long, well-written story, and I enjoyed it very much while waiting for JKR. 2 sequels, too. I hated the ending, though. Not in character, and suspension of disbelief shattered.

The author took it down from FF.net a while ago but it was archived on fictionhunt. I LOVED that fic for so long. But I was twelve, so...

It hit all my favorite points. Ginny-centric, powerful Ginny, long, and semi decent plot. Looking back the writing is not so good, kind of cringe-worthy at times but nostalgia makes it somewhat bearable.

** I had been reading fics for a while and even though I could see there was a huge number of HP ones, I had the vivid impression that the HP books were for children and I assumed the fics would be the same, so I never gave them a shot. Then an author of a story I greatly enjoyed suggested linkffn(9238861), which became the first HP fic I've ever read.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** Mine was a Draco/Hermione (it was nearly ten years ago so tastes have changed). I don't know if it still exists on FFN anymore, but it was definitely not canon and Draco and Hermione end up time travelling from an explosion in potions to medieval times (or Victorian?) where Hermione ends up being a Lord's daughter and Draco is the farm boy. They eventually meet on the farm after waking up in this time and through trying to get back home fall in love, yada yada. I don't remember what it's called, but the concept and the writing hooked me to fanfiction for good.

The first story I really remember the title of was Send Fudge. I don'tk now the authors name off hand and I can only find it in Portuguese now (even though it was written in English originally) but it is a great Draginny fic set during war and told through letter format.

Back then, I sorted by length and went at it. I read a LOT of Sirius/OC and then Regulus/OC and wow have my tastes changed. I read more Next Gen now or Post Hogwarts, wanting an after.

It took some effort to dig this one up but I knew it as soon as I saw it. I'm tempted to reread it but I'm worried about realizing how not great it is after all this time since my standards have risen, lol.

**** Ah, I'm a bit out of practice.

linkffn(Etc Etc --- and Life Goes On by justonemorefic) (which can also be found on AO3 and HPFF) just finished and was great. I really loved the main character, I won't call her a heroine though. It was a great look at a possible (albeit dramatic) turn for the next generation at Hogwarts. There's also linkffn(8555026) (which can also be found on AO3 and HPFF) is another next gen in a completely different universe from Etc which involves the (what I consider) inevitable melding of muggle and magical.

There's dirgewithoutmusic on AO3 who writes current gen and a little post Hogwarts. They have a series called, "we must unite inside her walls or we'll crumble from within," which examines different characters during and after the war but I'm a big fan of everything by her. The first in that series is linkao3(overemotional: in defense of cho chang by dirgewithoutmusic).

Let's see... I'm way out of the loop because I've been under a pile of schoolwork, but I'm really into Post-War political fics, mostly Drarry because I've decided if I'm going to hell anyway, I might as well enjoy it. For that there was linkao3(A Young Radical's Guide to Love by blamebrampton) which is a very possible post war scenario of a government that's gone too far in the efforts of security.

linkao3(Little Red Courgette by blamebrampton) is so funny I actually cry from laughing every time. It's a bit ridiculous but it's a satire so it's okay. It's the kind of ridiculous government that doesn't hurt me emotionally (something that the show Scandal can't say).

Other than that, I don't have any saved. I've been on and off binging while in University and not actually saving things. If I come around to finding any particularly good ones, I'll let you know. I'm actually really interested in some decent next gen at the moment, right after I go kill the spider that scared me off of my treadmill. I hope this was helpful (especially because it really is too long of a reply).

  When this season's purple courgettes are woefully thin, Draco Malfoy thinks it amounts to small beans. Next thing he knows, the Department of Standards is over-run with leeks, Brussels sprouts all sorts of legislative difficulties, and somebody appears to have put a roquette under Harry Potter. Can Draco seize a marrow victory? Or will his plans for peas be squashed?All along, Kingsley Shacklebolt finds himself pining for the good old days, when, instead of governing, all you had to worry about were Dark Lords and imminent death,

  "The power of friendship isn't an actual form of energy, Al." Armed with spunk, sugar and a blatant disregard for the laws of physics (or laws in general), inventor Bea Chang is determined to finish her electricity-to-magic device, even if she has to drag in half of Fred's extended family for her ragtag heists. That smarmy entrepreneurial Malfoy, on the other hand, can shove off.

  Memories of the war are still fresh, which is all the excuse Decent People need to do appalling things. In this quietly waged conflict, Draco Malfoy is happy to be on the right side of things for once, and even happier to find he's not alone.

  Cho cried and she survived Pansy Parkinson's cruel jabs about a dead boy. She wept and she passed all her classes, kept up with Quidditch, watched fairweather friends scatter in the cold wind. She got very good at wordlessly summoning tissues and she joined the DA against her parents' wishes.They had told her to behave, begged her, ordered her, as the threatening darknesses of the world clung close even inside Hogwarts, and Cho walked out to the little pub in Hogsmeade and wrote her name down on Hermione's list.I hope someone in the DA told Cho that she ought to have been in Gryffindor. I hope she laughed at them, hard. Integrity. Truth. Honor. Dedication. These were the tenets of her House, of the blue and the bronze, the eagle called raven (called nerd, called stuck-up, called so many things that were not their names). Bravery was only one way to be a hero.
