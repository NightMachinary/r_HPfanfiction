** Actually, Muggles might find it cool if someone was named after a constellation.

But Andrea would be my pick too.

** Sentient android avatar of the Andromeda Ascendant starship from Andromeda tv series went by Rommie. So you can probably use that too, if you want.

*** Maybe Nora/ah. A little less obvious than Dora, but still along the lines of Nymphadora. Or maybe Mandy--taking some of the letters from her name and mixing it up Voldemort-style.

***** Knott. It's basically Tonks reversed with the S removed. It's a variation on Knut, which used to be a name, so it's got double clues.

***** Why do you wanna change the last name? I thought Ted is a muggleborn (not sure, maybe halfblood?) so Tonks might just be a muggle last name. But if you want Black family clues you might go with Schwarz, which is german for black and used as a last name as well. Ro go all matrix and just call em smith. For nymphadora how about dorea or nova? Though you might want a muggle name thats maybe outdated or something so you can have the 'call me tonks not xyz' part still in your story.

***** How about Starr as a last name? Stars and constellations are a Black thing so. Anne, Ted and Nora Starr.

"Recorded as Starr, Starre, Sterre, Sturre, and the patronymics Starrs, this is an ancient English surname. It derives from the Olde English pre 7th century word "steorra", and means a star.

*** Nat. Short for Natalie or Natalia, but it'd actually be her initials- Nymphadora A. Tonks. The A could be for Andromeda, Aphrodite, or any number of other muggle-unfriendly options, but the end result is an acceptably common nickname.
