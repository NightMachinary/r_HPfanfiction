The Word of God from JK Rowling is fairly debatable on the value of Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts. What are your preferences for exchange rates with the coins? With or without backing from the books.

I personally feel that Galleons should be closer to $100 than the $5 Rowling has given on occasion. It makes more sense with many thing especially for when ratio'd down to ~.20 for a Knut. Which leaves the daily prophet costing a dollar.

Sometimes I feel that in some fics Sickles and Knuts are completely ignored and Galleons are the only currency.

I doubt there are any perfect exchange rates considering the guesses value of things purchased in Harry Potter, but what are your preferences?

Also, I know that I am Amerocentric with my dollars rather than pounds. Sorry.


** Most mint-running economies have a number of denominations defined for convenience of use. There's usually a basic unit; the dollar, the pound, the franc, the euro, the yuan; from there and subject to the rigors of inflation over time, denominations either add up or subdivide. The Rupee used to represent a silver coin for which there were several subdenominations. Due to inflation the partials became mostly worthless, so they use notes in multiples for most cash transactions. Bitcoins, in comparison, have grown in such value that the meaningful unit for incidental purchasing is a millibitcoin, or 1/1000th of the base, and now there are satori, or 1 millionth of the base. This is a lot easier to allow without worrying about practical denominations, since all transactions are digital.

JKR had a sense of this, so created three coins designated with a set value /relative to each other/. Since there are only the three, my expectation is that the Sickle is meant to be base. With 1 Galleon= 17 Sickles = 493 Knuts, we establish a multiple and subdivision where the smallest coin has just enough purchasing power to be meaningful and the multiple isn't so extreme as to never be handled. (Anyone you know carrying 500 or 1000 dollar bills around? Or even 100's?).

A Knut as a meaningful coin has to be worth more than a penny. People toss pennies, but keep nickels, dimes and quarters. So for an effective price guideline for purchasing power, I go with this:\\
1 Knut ~ a nickel, making\\
1 Sickle ~ $1.45 and\\
1 Galleon ~$24.65.

Newspaper, sent once or twice daily depending on amount of news- 3 knuts ~ $.15

Wand, the sword/sidearm/professional toolbelt for everyone - 7 Galleons ~ $170

Knight bus transport to anywhere in England, one way - 11 sickles ~ $16

*** I've seen quite a few people using the ~$25 Galleon. I feel like this rate works great for Sickles as the base. I really like ~$100 Galleons and how they make things costing Knuts and Galleons make sense, but it kind of screws things up for Sickle based pricing. $64 for a bus ticket doesn't really come across as reasonable.

*** More-nerdy information:

20th century floating average of Gold:Silver value by weight (despite being set as 1:15 by Revolution-era US govt) is ~1:47

The historical (like since birth of Christ) Silver:Copper ratio is ~1:110

Assuming the goblins would abide by something near these practical ratios...:\\
.1 oz Gold ~= 4.7 oz Silver\\
1.0 oz Silver ~= 110 oz Copper\\
.1 oz Gold ~= 517 oz Cu

.1 oz Gold Galleons (slightly less than the mass of an old penny) == 17 x .275 oz Silver Sickles (mass roughly like a Susan B Anthony dollar coin)== 493*1.05 oz Cu/Bronze Knuts (20% heavier than an Ike silver dollar)

Since a Washington quarter weighs ~.2 oz, those hubcap-sized [more like drink coaster-sized] coins were actually Knuts!

"Err... keep the change."

Or... a 'bronze' Knut is .03 oz silver + .194 oz copper, a substance known as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinthian_bronze][Corinthian Bronze]]

As we're talking about relative purchasing power, the actual valuable metal content in goblin-made coins may be half of what's represented, the other half counted as anti-forgery charms and craftsmanship. Either that or they run the conversion from muggle cash at twice the metal value. A Galleon may include .1 oz of gold, but it may cost you $80 to buy one in the 90's when gold traded ~ $400/oz.

***** The Weasley's /could/ afford a new wand for Ron. When he broke it during his second year, it was replaced with a brand new one fairly quickly.

The problem with our thought process on this is that we, the readers, are perfectly aware that passing down wands doesn't work well most of the time. However, it seems to be pretty uncommon knowledge, in the series.

Some people, like the Longbottoms for instance, view using an ancestor's wand as a religious-like showing of respect.

In the case of the Weasley's, while they're not in abject poverty, I agree, it was probably viewed as an unnecessary expense, despite the fact that we, the readers, are perfectly aware of how misguided that is.

No it wasn't. He spent the entire Year 2 with a broken wand, even though it backfired multiple times (slug spell on Ron himself and memory charm on Lockhart in the Chamber). It was only when the Weasleys won the lottery at the beginning of Book 3 that they purchased him a new one, which implies that they didn't /choose/ to skimp on the wand purchase, they literally couldn't afford a new one even when his old one is dangerously broken.

I don't buy it. What, does nobody ever pick up a friend's wand to cast a quick spell? It's too common-seeming an occurrence to be some esoteric piece of wandlore. Anyone would notice that other people's wands don't work as well as their own. Plus, everyone experiences the Ollivander try-wands-until-you-find-the-perfect-match routine. Anyone who's /ever/ bought a wand firsthand would know that most wands don't work for most people.

Neville is an outlier, trying to fill in his father's shoes. He's the exception, not the rule.

Yes but there's a caveat there. While yes, the results are visible, the whole “measure everyone and have them try wands one by one” thing of Ollivander's is a fairly recent thing (officially, he's the first wandmaker who does this), so while young people are expected to know, with older people it's not necessarily a given because even if, let's say, Molly, got her wand the same way, at the time the whole thing may have been seen as the wandmaker's weirdness that one shouldn't dwell on.

Still bad of those people to not pay attention to it over the years, and in any case Ron's passed-down wand was in a horrible shape even at the very beginning so him not getting a new one back then feels like some kind of caricature. So yeah, Madame Rowling kind of dropped the ball with how poor they seemed to be.

******* Actually, Ron said he didn't want to write home to ask for a new one because he thought he'd get another howler for breaking it. I suppose that explanation could have just been to save face because he thought his parents wouldn't be able to afford it, but canon usually has Harry noticing something off with Ron when that is the intent. There's no evidence in canon that Molly or Arthur knew about Ron's broken wand until the end of second year and he got a new one shortly after that.

** I am writing a story at present and the internal value that I am using to price things is that 1 Knut = $0.05.\\
Therefore 1 Sickle = $1.45 and 1 Galleon = $24.65

I chose these values for several reasons. I wanted to preserve the sense of a Galleon being a lot of money to a nonwealthy Hogwarts student. I remember growing up lower-middle class, being fifteen or so and looking for my first job. At that time a $20 bill was a lot of money to me! I feel a value somewhere around $25-30 for a Galleon is consistent with Ron's comment in OOtP that he'd never owned a Galleon of his own.

I didn't want Galleons to be massive amounts of money either. I want to sort of keep to the values given in the book, and paying 7 Galleons for a wand should be pricey, but not insurmountable. If a Galleon is worth even as little as $25, 7 Galleons means a wand at Ollivander's costs $175! That's a lot of money for most households and I couldn't justify making it any higher. $175 feels like a good price for a premium wand without making it unobtainable for all except the extremely wealthy. The poorer families may have to make do with cheaper manufacturers or go with hand-me-down wands until the child is older, but most families should be able to afford an Ollivander wand as long as they manage their money decently.

So far in the story, I haven't felt the need to specify any of this. I feel it works better that the economy in the story is consistent but not explicitly stated to the reader. I can have my spreadsheet of item values hidden off the proverbial written page. So far I've settled on values that I like for most items that a character would need to buy, from a small box of Chocolate Frogs to an Owl to various clothing items all the way to separate prices for family, personal, school, and professional broomsticks.

I admit not being familiar with Euros or GBP but I haven't needed that knowledge so far in the story, and honestly can't see I would need it going forward. USD works for my figuring. A nickel for a Knut is a good rule of thumb and I haven't had any troubles with it so far.

** I prefer to have a smaller exchange rate, and I prefer to have the value of a pound (the buying power) be very different for muggles and wizards. I like the idea that wizards can be self-sufficient with every part of their supply chain, so their prices are not affected by anything going on in the muggle world at all. So yeah, that 7 galleon wand seems dirt cheap when it costs a million pounds for an apartment in london, especially when it's made of extremely rare ingredients, but that's from a muggle's perspective. The Weasley's aren't buying food from a muggle grocer, and they're not buying clothes at Walmart, and they're not ordering books from Amazon.

Everyone always brings up the gold exchange rate, but I think that's a bit of a misnomer. I actually prefer fanon methods of limiting arbitration. Like, "goblin gold" can actually be an alloy or even just a plating, with a very small amount of gold (perhaps enough to be roughly 5 pounds worth, depending on the day), or it could even be pyrite or some other similar mineral. Or, the coins can be enchanted when they're minted, to make them impossible to melt perhaps, or for some other purpose..

Regardless, none of this really matters, and any time it's brought up in story, you know you're in for a treat. I'm just not interested in authors trying to justify it, since even if you adjust it to what you think is "realistic" (whatever that means), if a galleon is an ounce of gold, calling it equal to a hundred pounds still isn't anywhere near the actual value, so it's still pointless.

So, for me, despite JKR being absolute shit with numbers, I don't touch the canon exchange rate, other than to change it to approximately 5 pounds per galleon rather than exactly 5 pounds per galleon.

Several characters spend months hiding out without food supplies it being an issue. I don't think Kreacher ran to Tesco before he made french onion soup in DH. Plus JKR loves talking about food, it's hard for me to believe that she wouldn't have mentioned wizard-only grocery stores if she intended them to exist.

The only remaining option is a system where the food is available at-will, but you'll be billed at the end of the month or for each individual item. I'll note that this theory dates back to before Amazon Fresh or Amazon Dash buttons, but basically imagine that but with a wait time of 1 second instead of 1 day.

There is no real reason for the PPP rate to be close to the nominal exchange rate if there isn't much in the way of trade. Since, IIRC, someone did a pretty detailed calculation on the PPP for a rate of around 25 to 1, I think that 5 to 1 for the actual exchange rate is plausible.

Or the wizarding world's level of inflation might be stuck in the 50's, considering the community isn't large enough for an economy to blossom like in the muggle world. In that case, seven galleons would be equivalent to what you'd have to shell out for an iPhone X today.

That makes a knut worth 17 pence, and a galleon 85 pounds. A 7 galleon wand would be almost 600 pounds -- a lot of money, but not wholly unaffordable and not entirely unreasonable to try and make due with a used wand if money were tight.

It also turns the triwizard prize from a respectable 5000 pounds to a whopping 85000 pound prize, the kind of money that could get a joke shop off of parchment and into a location.

*** If you think about textbook prices from college, the £25 or $25 Galleon starts to seem a little more reasonable. Percy's bet with Penny can be written off on the grounds that Rowling just /decided/ on her £5 figure without much care, and that this was based on that. If most things that /aren't/ that bet make more sense with that figure---the primary tool you'll use /for the rest of your life/ being purchased secondhand despite the meaningfully weaker results makes much more sense with a £175 wand than a £35 wand---you can just headcanon that into compliance (though a headcannon may be required to enforce said compliance).

Most items don't though.

And yeah, some prices are hard to speculate about because they have a very different economy and we don't have a point of reference. In some cases, manufacturing is going to be easier, but they also don't have the same economies of scale.

But we can guess that Harry didn't buy his friends £330 souvenirs on a whim, Bagman wouldn't pay £180 for a trick wand, and the Weasleys' Egypt trip didn't cost £25,000.

As I said, the canon rate pretty much works for all of the books after PS. Probably because that's when JKR realized that she was definitely going to get to write the other 6, and should probably work out some sort of base rate.

If she was good at math, she would have looked at what she already had in the first book and said, "Okay, I said a wand was 7 galleons and 'Everything on the candy trolley' was 11 sickles so let's set a rate of, say, £25=1 galleon."

But she's not good at math and didn't know people were going to be arguing about her books 20 years later, so she just decided that £5=1 galleon was easy for even someone like her to remember going forward and seems to have mostly stuck with that.

You have to adjust for inflation as well. £5 in 2001 (when JKR published the rate as part of Fantastic Beasts/Quidditch Through the Ages books) would be about £8 in 2017.

Fair enough. I guess we need to recreate PS pricing based on the later rate if we want something rational, then?

** I prefer canon and I argue this, is one of the things the fandom overthinks, the wizarding and the mundane are almost completely separated, so it is not really that hard to assume, that even gold has a different value, maybe the goblins have means too procure massive amounts of gold, if galleons are made of pure gold that is. Also the conversion rate doesn´t say how much the material is worth, there have been cases where the silver coins were molten, because the silver in it has more worth than the coin itself in countries with hyperinflation the money is not even worth the paper it´s printed on. That galleons don´t adhere to international gold prices isn´t unrealistic, then there is the question how galleons are backed, are they backed by the goblin version of the gold standard or is it basically agreed upon that currency itself has no inherent value, like most modern currencies, even though they technically are backed by oil. Now I feel like I´m overthinking this, if you don´t understand what I´m talking about, watch the whole series [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZkP2b-4vo]] it might clear some things up or not, I could be talking out of my ass after all, it´s also really interesting and well worth your time.

** I like what was done in linkffn(10914042), which was to make it not linked at all. Gringotts had to exchange money due to law/treaty/whatever. There was no real exchange rate as there is no real exchange of goods. The bank ended up with tons of muggle money so spent it on stupid stuff.

If you think of it that way there is no value, just whatever the wizarding world' wants to give muggleborn to get started. It also means the rate can vary based on your political climate. The light/tolerance side wants muggleborn involved so sets it up so they can exchange for cheap. More anti muggle politics could see a higher rate or no exchange at all.

I mean actually doing an exchange of goods would be hard. Muggles like to track things. Most stuff that is expensive in the regular world is useless or can be cheaply conjured. IP can just be taken, not like the owners will ever know it is happening.

Of course, this depends how integrated your wizarding world' is. If you have thousands of squibs and muggleborn living in muggle London it is hard to go this way. But if it is more isolated, with few wizarding interactions with the muggle economy.....

** The material value of a galleon greatly exceeds its monetary value.

This is inferred from the facts available: the goblins enforce a set monetary exchange and it's illegal to melt down a galleon for its gold. this actually happened in the USA with silver dollars. their material value exceeded their face value. it was still illegal to deface the currency.

I like to throw in my own bit of fanon and say that galleons are secretly enchanted by goblins to gather various ambient magics from wizards, the earth, and magical creatures which is why the goblins horde them. It doesn't matter who owns the galleons. So long as goblins maintain a certain proximity they can benefit from their gathering properties. This is why they'll revolt if someone tries to start a non-goblin bank. The money is literally their major source of magic. This also means muggle gold isn't very valuable to goblins.

** £5 to a galleon as stated by Word of Author. 1000 Galleons or £5000 a month for a senior auror. Sweets are ridiculously cheap and Ollivander makes money goodness /knows/ how as he's pulling in about 1400 galleons a year if we're being generous. Perhaps he sells a lot of wand polish.

A knut is worth 1p, a sickle 29p, and /really/ a galleon is worth £4.93 but the 7p is commission on the exchange.

I just take the madness and run with it. It lets me flesh out the wizarding manufacturing economy and takes into account the price difference from being able to conjure raw materials like food from a small base amount (which is canon, you can make much from a little).

Obviously there are very few senior aurors and they're stinking rich. Malfoy and Black, on the other hand, are worth about 250 000 galleons at most because there isn't enough economy to support them being richer than that.

Perhaps senior aurors are so well paid because of the price of their uniforms/armour? Clothes seem to be a real sticking point as goes poverty. (But then the Weasleys couldn't afford to save up 9G for a wand for Ronald in eleven years and had enough for a trip for three to Romania by Christmas, go figure).

The Daily Prophet costs about 3 knuts, 3p, because it's conjured, and has a circulation of probably about 2000-5000, generating about 6000-15000 knuts a day or about 1200-3000 galleons, split between reporters, article writers and the editor and printers.

Books are expensive by comparison.

700 galleons is enough for a trip of a lifetime and some new stuff, but not enough to change the Weasley's general poverty (with Arthur being a department head, I think money just flows through their fingers tbh).

1000G is enough to turn a mail order company into a full shop /over the course of a year/, which I think matters. If they multiplied that 1000G into 3000G or more and are building their customer base the whole time, there is room for them to be able to rent the shop without having to scratch heads over rental rates when compared to that 1000G a month for senior auror.

From this, I have low paid jobs being about 100 galleons a month (£500), remembering this is 1991 I base most of these prices on. 10 galleons (£50) a week is enough to rent a room (again, this is 1991!) Wages rise very rapidly from this near-poverty level though.

** My personal take on it is that Galleons are real gold, Sickles are real silver, and Knuts are ... well, copper, and the price of a Galleon is dependent on the price of gold (since, you know, gold coin), but how many Pounds it costs to buy a Galleon depends on the price of silver (at sone point a Pound was worth one pound of silver, and wizards are an insular enough society for the change to potentially go unnoticed for some time), with Sickles and Knuts being valued as a set part of a Galleon because with them being transmutable metals they're basically worthless as metal and their value is thus assigned arbitrarily based on some old ... something.

Since the wizarding coins are protected by whatever the goblins put on them (charms, I guess, or other magic), it means the Muggles see coins but are incapable of seeing them as actually made of precious metals, this means that Muggles can only exchange Pounds to Galleons and vice versa at Gringotts and the value discrepancy is not a problem.

** I don't really go by exchange rates as muggle money has no value to isolated British wizards (as someone else said). However, in terms of value I think 1 Galleon to £50 is about right.

£350 for a wand you need for school and work is similar to a laptop. Knuts then come in at about 10p so a few of them for a tabloid paper seems ok, I think that the express is now about 45p. Then £50,000 would be a life-changing amount of money that would easily compel teenagers to enter a tournament (that was meant to be safe). Also Fred and George's life savings being £5000 seems high but with two people working flat out to scrimp and save every penny they could over the course of 4 years while at a boarding school full of rich kids... not impossible.

I think 1G to £50 just seems to fit.
