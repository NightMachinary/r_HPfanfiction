I read this a long time ago. I don't remember whether it was any good or not. Harry and his twin lives with Dursleys. They were close but Harry gets sorted into Slytherin and Ron corrupts Harry's twin mind against Slytherins and Harry. I think Harry has a theory that Dumbledore wants Harry to die at the hands of his brother.


** Was it this one?\\
