A fic that follows him since he was in the dursley's. I just finished reading linkao3(grey space) and it was amazing. It must be harry centric and no slash or harem. No boring canon rehashes as well. Something that keeps you captivated and something that's different


** If you don't mind a work in progress I've got a series on AO3 that starts with linkao3(Harry Potter and the Deep Dream) though I've only just started book 2. The series link is here [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1995562]]
