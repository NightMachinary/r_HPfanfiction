  (AU) In 1979, Regulus Black vanished with horcrux in hand, obscuring himself and destroying the locket. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again in '95, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the ashes.

  Gryffindor isn't what Slytherin sees in it, and the reverse is even more true. The Potters don't know they look different depending on where you're standing, the Blacks know precisely how they come across and like it that way, and Severus Snape isn't quite who anyone thinks he is---least of all himself.Britain, Spring of 1980. No one cares what's fair when their people are on the line, and truth would be subjective even if everyone told it. Brute-force bloody battles are how Gryffs (and Lestranges) think; when a sane Slytherin wants power it's all smoke and smiles, masks and mirrors. Roll up your sleeves, slip into your cloak, and slap that dagger on your belt. This is war, people---pick a side! ...What the hell. Pick three.Ch. 1: Hogwarts has a history, Narcissa has a party, Rodolphus shares a fun craft activity with a friend, and Severus is left with the body a bit of a dilemma. He thinks all the mysteries he's read will help him.Aha. Ha. Ha....Ch. 72: July 31, 11:45 pm:Potter vs Snape, round 993,234,546,878. Snape vs Potter, round 1.  Love this fic, hate it, or be totally confused: I solemnly swear that this is not a ride you've been on before.

  'I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--?' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all?'

#+begin_quote
  At the height of his power, Lord Voldemort employed another failsafe next to the horcruxes: his most loyal followers would be able to retrieve them and resurrect him with their help. As a result, Barty Crouch Jr. breaks his father's mind control early and goes off to seek his master.While he is unsuccessful in locating him, he manages to find surprising but welcome allies in the Boy-Who-Lived and his godfather. With the support of the Ancient and Noble House of Black on his side, Barty needs to use all his cunning and guile to navigate the world of politics and Dark Arts. And so, four years after their first meeting, a different Harry Potter will arrive at Hogwarts: one who wants nothing more than to bring Lord Voldemort back and who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal.

  Regulus faced death in the cave, accepted his fate, but Kreacher had never been very good at following his orders. In this instance, it saved his life. Now, Regulus must decide where he falls in the war. How much of the war would change with the life of just one man?

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different.

  When Regulus volunteers Kreacher for Lord Voldemort's mysterious task, what he expects to be a vaulting honour crushes his world at its very foundation. Throwing himself into a whirlwind of research, he learns of the dark secret that changes the course of his life in more drastic ways than he ever could have imagined. Faced with death if he leaves, or death of self if he stays, Regulus makes a choice that shapes events to come, over a decade later.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

  Christmas 1979---danger, secrets, lies and their shared history looms large over the Blacks' first Yuletide season as a reunited family. While life as a fugitive proves bleaker (and more boring) than Regulus could have imagined, a botched espionage mission at Malfoy Manor draws Sirius deeper into the Black family web---and his cousin Narcissa's social set.Meanwhile, Walburga hatches a daring scheme to restore her wild firstborn's damaged reputation in the family---finding him a suitable bride---while Orion grapples with the past, and the high price his two sons have paid for his inaction.[Regulus Black Lives/Black Family Witness Protection AU. The continuing story of how Regulus stealing part of Voldemort's soul brings a broken, dysfunctional family together]
