Going through the history of Harry's lineage, I found a little official description of the Potter family thrown out by Pottermore that goes like this:

"The Potter family is a very old one, but it was never (until the birth of Harry James Potter) at the very forefront of wizarding history, contenting itself with a solid and comfortable existence in the backwaters. Potter is a not uncommon Muggle surname, and the family did not make the so-called Sacred Twenty-Eight for this reason; the anonymous compiler of that supposedly definitive list of pure-bloods suspected that they had sprung from what he considered to be tainted blood."

This gives me to understand that the Potters certainly lacked a special status in their world, that they were an ordinary family and that it was not until Harry's birth that they acquired the fame they have, but it doesn't make sense, I say, regardless of whether they were as rich as the Malfoy or the Black in the past or not, I see that in their history they had great wizards or were associated with influential wizard families, not just Harry. We have for example Henry Potter, Harry's great grandfather and a respectable member of the Wizengamot, Fleamont Potter, his grandfather, who was the creator of a hair potion that would make him rich some time later, and Charlus Potter, possibly his great uncle, who even married a witch from the House of Black, who certainly had special treatment compared to other families. I am very surprised that certain fanfics make incapable in this supposed influence that seems not to be really important as it could be expected, what do you think?


** They were /very/ influential in the community of wizards who cared a lot about their hair. The Malfoys turned to the dark only after Fleamont Potter refused to give them a bulk discount on Sleakeazy's, and it would have ruined them if they hadn't killed Fleamont and Euphemia and stolen a cache. When that runs out on Scorpius' 17th birthday, a new dark lord will rise.

** No, they weren't influential. From the post, it seems they collectively preferred the quiet life and didn't really care to involve themselves in politics.

It does.

  His sales of such cures to fellow witches and wizards enabled him to leave a significant pile of gold to each of his seven children upon his death...The Potters continued...to live in the West of England, for several generations...each one adding to the family coffers by their hard work...

They appeared to have enough money to make certain, and probably most, families not care they had several muggles on their tree.

And yet the Black family made the list.

On [[https://www.surnamemap.eu/unitedkingdom/most_common_surnames_ranking][this list]] of the most common surnames in the UK, Potter comes in at 220, while Black is at 180.

Also on the list, but below Potter, are Burke (251), Parkinson (325), Abbott (326), and Flint (996).

I think it's clear that while the muggle name thing might have been the justification given, the real reason was probably political or personal.

I also noticed that there are a few Sacred Twenty-Eight names that have close names on the list, including Greengrass (Green at 18 and Greenwood at 279), Rowle (Rowley at 499), Macmillan (McMillan at 609), and Nott (Knott at 980). I think my new headcanon is that those families might have intentionally changed their names to distance themselves from their muggle relatives.

*** Firstly we don't know who wrote the list, though the wiki says that it is widely believe to be written by a Nott, also unlike those other names, the Potter name originates from an occupation a common method of naming form working class families, something the was most likely associated with muggles.

**** That is a good point. However, the list was created in the 1930s, which was long after surnames stopped having any connection to occupation.

I find it very hard to imagine that the Potters wouldn't have been included in the list of they were acting like the typical purebloods at the time, if only because the author would want them to support the list as legitimate. So the connection not muggles really seems like just a convenient excuse.

Although it's also interesting to note that the Smith family didn't make the list, despite being directly related to Helga Hufflepuff. Maybe they were disqualified for marrying muggles or muggleborns, or maybe it was because Smith is the most common muggle name in the UK and because it's associated to another muggle occupation.

**** They were excluded due to Henry Potter, Harrys great grandfathers idea on how to deal with the muggle world wars, he wanted wizards to help defend Britain, but the other members of the 28 denied it

** Doesn't the passage you cited contain the answer? They were rich, old, but comfortable staying out of politics. They very likely /could/ have thrown their weight around, they just chose not to. This isn't uncommon IRL either. Plenty of wealthy families like to be as unflashy and inconspicuous as possible.

Perhaps it's also a matter of defining "influential" or "important": There's something very nouveau riche about constantly needing to hear your name and getting other people to do as you say. If you actually /are/ Old Money, you know that you matter; you don't need external validation.

** Didn't Harry's grandfather invent some sort of potion? That leads me to think that they were sort of nouveau riche and were probably just an ordinary family of pure bloods that came into a lot of money in later generations through trade instead of inheritance.

** I'm OK with this. After all, it's only a fanmade theory that the Potter's vault 687 is a trust vault and that there's a larger vault somewhere out there. The lords and ladies thing is also a fanmade concept. Only the Blacks called themselves a noble and ancient house. The writer of the "sacred 28" was probably just some pretentious guy who wanted to puff himself up. He might have just included the other families based on who he thought were worth marrying.

I totally believe that vault 687 is the only one Potter vault and the rest of the stuff written in n the original post.

** The Potter's weren't influential until Harry, but they did contribute a lot overall to wizarding society. From what i remember the original potter was viewed a bit like the lovegoods in fanon, a crazy man always pottering about in his garden full of strange plants, said original potter went onto invent several important potions and many of his decendants followed in his footsteps, basically being somewhat reclusive inventors who rarely got involved in politics.
