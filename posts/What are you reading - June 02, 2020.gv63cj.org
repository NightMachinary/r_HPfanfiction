** Title: Victoria Potter

linkffn(12713828)

Impressions: I've really found this work to be a great read. It's a female Harry fic with a deeper magic system, great world building and most importantly, amazing atmosphere.\\
The struggles and victories in learning magic can be best compared to What You Leave Behind linkffn(10758358), which is one of my favorite pieces of fanfiction.\\
If I wanted to compare to others it reminded me of, it's like Brandon Sanderson's world building with a magical world that feels lived in, an almost Name of the Wind style Hogwarts, all within the atmosphere of Anne of the Green Gables.

I agree that that seems like a weird combination. But it actually works really well :)

*** The author of Victoria Potter, Taure, is a member of this sub, and is, IMO, a jewel of the HP fandom. I personally adore all of Taure's fics and hope that at least a few of them will be updated, and hopefully completed, eventually. If I were Taure, I would write my own novel and give up my day job (I understand that Taure is a barrister/lawyer IRL, which shows their level of intellect). Taure has, in addition to writing awesome fanfic, created at least one survey (for this sub or for the fandom in general), shared views on HP through writing extremely detailed meta (essays), and has shared their personal favorite HP fics with the fandom. If a Taure fan club existed, I would join it in a heartbeat!

Thank you for reccing Victoria Potter, and giving me an opportunity to show my appreciation and admiration for Taure!

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

*** I really want to know how you are taking it. I stopped reading it a while ago. And it has been updated at least ten times now.\\
I started hating it when Harry went too OOC too soon, and his whole character basically became a wish-fulfillment.\\
The sub-plots were too tedious to read. The whole Hogwarts and other magical schools setting, fob-dandy, Wizarding-lordships, etc got old real fast.\\
It seems like Harry is on a war-path to change each and every component of the wizarding world. It's just isn't possible that the wizarding world is so fricked up and everyone is wrong other than Harry.\\
It's really sad that the actual setting, about Harry playing quidditch, is extremely engaging. But the author HAD to go full Gary Stu!\\
Never mind the fanon tropes (which if fact got broken a lot along with canon ones. Btw I love many fanon tropes)

***** This has become the story I catch up on when I've got nothing better to read.

It's just about bearable but the world is just far too easy for Harry to make it an interesting story. If you'll forgive spoilers: Thinks about playing pro Quidditch? Bam - next morning he's accepted by a team. Thinks about getting a hot girlfriend? Bam - here's one! Thinks that he'd like others? Bam - the first one just wanted to bang him and move on - and here's another gorgeous witch throwing herself at Harry! Starts actually playing Quidditch? Bam - he's the best in the league.

You get the occasional little thing that gets in his way but by and large it's like trying to slow down traffic by placing pebbles at intervals on a road: Almost nobody will notice at all and anyone who does will probably find the effort more amusing than useful.

The actual writing is good enough that it's not totally awful, but that's the best I can really say about it.

** “O Mine Enemy” by Kirby Lane. It's a really well-written mentor Snape 6th summer fic, and it's being regularly updated.

This fic features some amazing writing, plot, and pacing, but the real highlight is the characterization. Snape and Harry are both their canon selves, and their relationship grows slowly and realistically. There's some truly amazing moments in this fic that make it worth the read. 10000% recommend.

Standout chapters to look forward to when reading (no spoilers): - chapter 18 - chapter 34 - chapter 35 - chapters 38-41 - CHAPTER 44!!!! - ch 47 for some good snape pov - and more to come with the updates... (up to chapter 47 as of this post)

** I finished reading The Inquistors Son today. It's a Scorpius Malfoy/Lily Luna Potter fic. It's a solid read. I feel the author came up with some really good characterizations of the next gen kids. I wish there had been a little more of the romance (towards the end especially), but overall it's a satisfying read. I really wish there were more stories in this pairing, I feel like Scor/Lily is more interseting than Scor/Rosedue to Harry/Draco's rival relationship, and the fact that she has two protective older brothers. Anyone got other fics to recommend in the ship?

** I'm reading linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) for the second time since seeing it in last week's thread. It has a lot of depth. Alternating between Severus and Lily POV really works as they gradually build a relationship.

Note that this is a Severus who lived through all of canon and was then sent back to sixth year after dying. So he has a metric ton of regrets, deep self-recrimination, and a caustic personality, but he has learned more patience, and his devotion to Lily permeates everything he does. The author's notes agree that their relationship probably wouldn't have worked the first time around, but with so much more experience, having seen just what his choices could lead to, he is more careful and rational now. Usually. When the Marauders aren't around. And he has brought back knowledge that just might help Dumbledore to win the First and Second Wars at the same time if they play their cards right.

There's also a new chapter for linkffn(The Impostor Complex) with an interesting twist, quite possibly a pivotal moment in the war.

** I'm currently catching up on the latest updates to linkffn(13016242).

Title: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13016242/1/Vacillation][Vacillation]]

Author: fairmaidofkent Rating: M

Thoughts: This is a really intriguing romance set during the First Wizarding War. It is a Lucius/Narcissa and Rodolphus/Bellatrix fic, with Lucissa the primary pairing. I really like how this story starts off with a conflicting argument that isn't fully explained to the reader. After the author sets up the premise, flashbacks are used expertly to explain character motivations and why things are the way they are.

Lucius and Narcissa are both strong characters here. Lucius is a full-fledged Death Eater in this story. Actual Dark magic and torture occurs as part of the war, but it isn't really graphic. The story doesn't shy away from what Death Eaters are involved in. Narcissa is very vivacious and not submissive. She doesn't easily capitulate.

I love how this story shows how both gradually change. I don't want to spoil too much, but neither Narcissa or Lucius are completely in the right. As more and more of the story is revealed, I keep switching whose "side" I am on. There's subtle clues sprinkled throughout hinting at past events that will have to be faced. The romance is written really well. The author is also really good at writing emotional scenes

Bellatrix and Rodolphus are the main secondary characters and work really well as foils to Narcissa and Lucius.

I'd recommend this to people interested in reading a portrayal of slow, well-developed romance with setbacks and conflict, how the First Wizarding War went on, and stuff about pureblood society.

#+end_quote

The story starts off with Lucius and Narcissa having a tense confrontation. They have been married for two years but don't live together. Lucius lives in his London townhouse and Narcissa in an estate in France. In the first chapter, Lucius orchestrates a situation that makes Narcissa agree to come back to London. Lucius sees his relationship with Narcissa as a zero sum game and thinks that if she wins, he loses and vice versa. Both have reasons to be guarded around each other, but they eventually start to be vulnerable and bring down their barriers.

Most scenes are dated, which is important because there are a lot of flashbacks that really explain a lot.

The story delves into what caused them to live apart, Lucius's backstory of how he is the way he is, Narcissa's backstory and the motivation behind her actions, how Lucius being a Death Eater affected their relationship, what happened before they got married, and the actual “romance.” It goes into how their feelings change and why both are reluctant to share how they feel. As the backstory is explained, I've found myself on Narcissa's side but in the current day scenes I've found myself on Lucius's side. At this point in the story both are at fault for certain things but they are justified in their actions.

I particularly liked how the author shows how Lucius's feelings change as he gets to know Narcissa better.

  Coming together is not always an easy feat, but the rest of the time, things fall apart. As Narcissa and Lucius navigate whether or not to trust one another, the Wizarding world begins to bend to the power of a Dark Lord and everything they've ever known starts to unravel.

** "Kali Black and the Prisoner of Azkaban" K+/T linkffn(13454792). I'm five chapters in and the OC daughter, Kali Black, comes off a little Mary-Sue-like right now, but I have hopes it'll improve as the story goes on. What I'm really enjoying are the chapters from adult povs (Remus, Minerva, an OC grandmother of Kali) and their takes on the things happening in the story.

"It's Bloody Better" K+/G linkffn(12677669). I'm four chapters in. It's a bit of a different kind of time-travel. A little bit slow-moving at the start maybe, though, each chapter is bringing up new questions and makes it interesting to continue reading on.

"The Atoners" K/G linkffn(13554921). It's a story that's different from others from I read. I've never seen another fic that brings Lyall Lupin into the aftermath of the werewolf incident and have him help to convince Severus to not spill the beans of Remus's condition to the world.

** I'm currently re-reading linkao3(Of a Linear Circle - Part VI) while waiting to see what gets updated (thank goodness for email subscriptions). I've recommended OaLC quite a bit, but I find it to be a fairly unique story, with great research and background development, believable characters, but most of all some much excellent plotting and planning for war and everything that is so well done and I love it.

Stories that seem to keep updating pretty regularly that I'm enjoying are linkao3(Aparecium) which is a delightful dramione with the hidden child plot-line, linkao3(23243521) which is a time-travel Hermione with fun banter so far, and linkao3(The Jock and the Swot) which is just a fun and amusing AU teenage romance.

#+begin_quote
  A year after her delayed graduation from Hogwarts, established in a promising Ministry career, and beginning to put the past behind her, Hermione Granger's world collapses into a single moment's careless mishap. Uncertain if she is dead, dying, or truly thrown out of her own time, she finds herself revisiting an earlier world. Partly from exhaustion and exasperation with a lifetime of following the rules, partly because she's convinced it's all in her head and none of it will matter anyway, she decides that, this time, things will be different.

** I'm currently reading the Holly at Hogwarts series and on book 5 “from sir, with love”. It's a genfic about an OC daughter of Dudley who attends Hogwarts around the same time as the potter kids. And she's in Hufflepuff, my favourite house overall. There's been some well thought out pseudo timetravel/AU world where Voldemort won and other shenanigans that for the most part have been of an extremely high standard. I'd say almost in the vain of Alexandra Quick (different worlds, good interesting characters around her, nice mysteries) but with more characters from the original potterverse.

This particular book though is quite hard for me to describe. So far after 25 chapters or so I'd say it's the weakest entry in the series. I find the villain of this one particularly uninspired and very irritating to read. I soldiered on but the main thing I'm starting to realise is that the author relies far too much on incompetent adults. Comically evil bullies get away with EVERYTHING (even Umbridge in the last book!) even AFTER describing their plans and getting caught. The imperius curse gets thrown around like fucking candy in one book, but when Harry suggests practicing resistance to the curse Auror Dean Thomas of all people is like “bUt tHaT's _uNfOrGiVaBlE_”. There's also an imbalance of hurt/angst vs the comforting and nice life we can hope kids to experience.

I know it's a common trope in HP for adults to be kind of useless but this one really skirts the line a bit too closely and crosses it more and more often as the kids get older. I've rarely gotten this frustrated with a piece of fanfiction. I'm going to keep going in the hopes that it improves again because the previous books have been so good.

Things I like: most of the world building is brilliantly imagined; Holly as a character most of the time; the depiction of Hufflepuff until this book (no spoilers but nobody is being themselves at the moment and it hurts Hufflepuff the most); Holly's special ability and especially how the author uses it and develops it; the way Dudley and his wife are portrayed is for the most part excellent; I LOVE her brother and if it emerges the author kills him off there's going to be hell to pay; the writer is very good at conveying emotional moments and I've had tears forming in my eyes once or twice (happy and sad); the AU Holly travels to for a bit; the list goes on. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes Dudley-has-a-magical-child stories for sure, but also any post epilogue story. The world has moved on from Voldemort even if not fully, and it's an interesting angle. They luckily also don't fall into the trap of using known names and characters for every function and adult that needs to be around. There are new teachers unrelated to the Pottergang or DA as well and they are quite interesting. I also appreciate that /generally/ teachers listen to the kids when they say something is wrong.

Yeah I could britpick but I think that's unfair. Vernon eats packets of chips and not crisps, they use Tube for a TV, Kingsley is Prime Minister (?!), I keep seeing words and phrases that I don't think make sense in Britain but maybe I don't remember it properly since I don't live there anymore. A little bit annoying are the spelling mistakes. What's weird is that I don't think these mistakes are on the fly As in typos, but rather the type that happens when you click “find and replace all” in word when you want to fix a repeated mistake. Things like writing loose instead of lose, EVERY TIME. Bu my it's so uncommon I don't mind it.

Now, be warned. I think so far this is an eight part series and it's like 1.4 million words total. It has consumed my life for the last couple of days and I guess I'm maybe halfway. But it's worth it so far and I'll report back to change my opinion if it's terrible.

** [[https://www.quotev.com/story/12618005/The-Souless/1][The Souless by 1509Ki]].\\
I found this fic on Quotev after remembering the site actually exists. I was drawn to the story due to the fact that the main character was born in Azkaban and was raised by dementors - basically the synopsis.

I say this is a good read, full of unintentional sass from the main character as well as the unexpected father figure.

What I also appreciate is that there are no ships in this fic - the author has said that she/he won't be doing pairings in the story, but people are free to ship whoever. If this fic were doing pairings, I probably wouldn't be as invested as I am now mostly because I enjoy the already existing friendly, familial relationships going on. I'm soft, /shush./

** A Cadmean Victory linkffn(11446957)

Rated M

I'm on chapter 19 so far but I'm not sure if I'll finish. Harry's kinda a dick and it's just not really gelling for me.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** Title: Queen of Quiet Nothing

Author: ThetaWolfe

Rating: M

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13240103/1/Queen-of-Quiet-Nothing]]

I have never seen this one recommend. Ever. That honestly shocked me. It is a thoroughly fresh idea. That is, I have not seen it's like before.

Rough summary. Fem!Harry transported to an unknown land with Snape (not as you usually know him). Now, the "Harry is transported to a new world" trope, is not a recent one. It has been around, as long as there has been fanfiction. What is, is it's execution.

The situation, where Harry finds herself, is rich in possibilities. I am beyond excited, to see the direction this takes.

Give this one a chance. I promise you will be impressed.
