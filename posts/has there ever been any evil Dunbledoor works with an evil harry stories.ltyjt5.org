any way of writing would be good, but i would love to see it start off as a standard dark harry vs evil manipulative dumbledoor. but when he realizes Harry is going the "right kind of dark" he takes him under his wing of how to appear light and create villians to help that reputation (grindewald and voldemort were the wrong kind of dark as an idea)


** Dumbledore: Now Harry, when the hero comes to confront you the first thing to do is to appear as if you are caught unaware and panicking, if they are coming to you to get into a confrontation then chances are that they somehow managed to scrape enough training in occlumency to resist mental manipulation like the obliviate despite your best efforts -don't hit yourself about it, no matter how much we try, nobody can accurately predict all possible outcomes of any particular situation, acknowledge that something eventually /will/ go wrong and make sure to have contingencies in place- so you must only do the lightest scans to both make sure there isn't an easy path to deal with it anymore and to create a sensation of security.

Then your new adversary is likely to look for allies of his own, people of power and authority who are at odds with you. When it happens put only the barest of fights, it is then that you will be the most thankful for having planted trustworthy agents in key positions while maintaining the appearance of being distrustful of one another but not to the extent that they would be likely to serve your dark wizard adversary. Take for example Madam Amelia Bones, the current head of the DMLE, as far as anyone is concerned she is a powerful auror above reproach who always follows strictly the laws and never takes bribes but blames me for the death of her brother and his wife during the first war.

In actually she hated her abusive brother who always put her down and lorded his position as the favorite son over her. During her time at Hogwarts I saw potential in her and started teaching her advanced magic in secret, then after extracting an oath of loyalty in exchange for my help I discreetly got her a position on the auror department and passed informations about Death Eaters plans I acquired through my spies on the order to her, with this information she not only managed to fabricate a situation that put her brother on Tom's shit list, but also got her worse nay-sayers killed and arranged herself in a fast-track to become head of the department, all the while being supplied with the money I ‘/rescued/' from enemies she killed to the point that any attempt of bribery seemed like a pittance to her eyes.

She is the most logical choice for any wannabe rebel to call upon to assure my incarceration. I will naturally resist arrest and maybe even give my ‘weapon' a spell or two -after shielding discretely my clothing of course- and Amelia will gleefully put me under ‘custody' in my own personal house supplied with all the material goodies and protective measures I could ever wish for without any guard whatsoever. Needless to say no paperwork about this /arrest/ will show up unless our young hero specifically goes looking for them, nor will it show up on the papers, to “/keep things quiet so my supporters can't break me out and the process can go on without turning into a circus/”.

Now is the part that is the most tricky, you will have to somehow be seen doing something while still keeping the subject under the guise that he won, that is the perfect moment to don a disguise and go on some sort of “gathering of priceless and vital information” which you, of course, already was sitting upon and didn't actually need to seek -another advantage of keeping important information a secret from everyone else. The goal here is to be able to point to this moment later on and say “there, I wasn't run out of my office, I just found a tip and went to investigate in secret, this was how I found out about Y which was essential to end our enemy”.

And then you just chill until it comes a time where your prospective adversary has a credible reason to stay away from their friend's prying for a reasonable amount of time and have your mole (Amelia for me) invite them to her house in order to “discuss their next steps”. While it is tempting to try dosing them with a potion to knock them out that is by far the most obvious plot and most people have at least one way of either detecting or outright negating unwanted potions, instead you should put a permanent sticking charm time-delayed on their chair (I will teach you this later) and then have an enchanted lullaby start playing when they are deep in their conversation, the music will not actually affect the mind itself, it will attack the nervous system slowly making the target's body get progressively more tired in such a smooth progression that they will fall asleep before they realize it.

Now that you have your subject under your power again you can finally force-feed them the right mind-addling potions and spells to render their protections null, sleep-deprivation and psychological torture are part of this, I recommend having them consume successive doses of pepper-up potion for around two weeks while keeping them under sensitive-deprivation. Afterwards you will be able to safely break apart their remaining defenses at your leisure -and always be sure to be thorough- opening the path to modify their memories until they are again loyal to you and only you. Also be sure to see who they may have shared their findings with and make the adequate memory adjustments.

And this, Harry, is how you deal with an edgy little shit trying to impose themselves on /your/ game.
