I don't remember much just that Harry was using some really old magics he came across. It was less the structured safe magic of now and more calling on primal forces thing that can easily go sideways stuff.

I remember in the second task he calls up some ancient water spirit snake thing that was eerie af to me.

Iirc he made some super thunderstorm during the first task. Any help would be great thanks!
