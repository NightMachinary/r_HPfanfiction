** I agree with this sentiment. I've always found the 'we've already had this thread' comment to be ridiculous. It's like you're deriding people for wanting to engage in discussion about fanfiction, which is literally the purpose of this subreddit. In every subject that has ever undertaken discussion, someone else has probably talked about the subject you're talking about. That doesn't mean we shouldn't also talk about it. It's absurd.

*** I agree with your sentiment but I have seen threads asking for good Harry/Daphne fics posted within 24 hours of each other, which IMHO is too close. Maybe once a week, or every 5 days or something is more reasonable?

** I see some problems with that approach. For one the mention of old threads is not nessecary a complain. I recently did that in a harry/fleur thread merely as a hint for the op.

Second does these thread rarely lead to anything intresting. Many times the same fics are mentioned over and over again with few variety. The reason for that is of course thar the number of good fics is sadly limited. There are something like what 3 or 4 truely good Harry/Fleur, many okayish and some guilty pleaure ones. This becomes even worse with more specific request. If these request thread would come with an intresting topic to discuss people would be more accepting.

And at last to many of these threads are kind obvious written by someone who should have search beforehand an older one as they clearly are here for the first time.

*** On the other hand such threads also serve as an opportunity. I might read them, and feel like reading a story which I wouldn't have thought of, and therefore not searched for, otherwise.

More importantly, though: Where's the harm? Even if the threads were repetitive, nothing prevents the complainers from simply hiding them with a click, leaving those who don't fret about another Dark Lord Harry thread to post their picks - and read the other suggestions.

**** I don't have problem with these threads, in fact I comment in many of them. For one I wanted to give a counter argument and more important I disagree with the reasoning op is giving. THe argument there is likely something new in every of them dosen't add up with what I mostly see.

** The problem we have is that it's the same 5 fics recommended every time. Marauders fics? Life and Times, one of the 50 generic Harry/Hermione goes back to Marauders era time travel fics (along with either Harry/Bellatrix or Hermione/Sirius), maybe 1 or 2 new ones, so on. Leftist fics? Starfox's works, and that's it. Harry/Ginny? Northumbrian, Floreat, bam, I've done my good deed for the day, boys. Funny fics? Seventh Horcrux, nonjon's works, and, uh....... yeah. See where I'm going? It's all good until you visit this sub frequently, and then you see how much fanfics overlap or get overly repeated, which leads me to two possible conclusions:

1. we, like the rest of reddit, do very little digging ourselves and spout the stuff we see all the time because it's cool to like

2. 99.99999999% of fanfics are fucking atrocious.

Honestly, it's probably both, but still.

*** The second one is the reason the fics repeat so much. I like snily. Yet the fics are almost the same in all the times the question is asked because it's a rare pairing not liked by everyone and If we read the fics most of them suck

** Anything without HarryXGinny and HarryxHermoine is rare gem. It's hard to find materials with other pairings, let alone quality material. There are so few dark, gray, pragmatic protagonist fics. That's why I too look at all request fic threads.

** It's always a good idea to do a quick search first. I do agree that there will be different recommendations depending on who's on. But I get peeved when the same topic is already on the front page or has been done within the last few days. Put a little effort into it

** I agree with you, to some degree.

While sometimes there are new stories, sometimes there aren't, especially with the rarer pairings. It's also a problem of frequenting this sub. For example, when I'm on my computer, I check this sub every half hour, at most. That means I've read every single threat that has been posted here, which leads to the a problem - when there is a re-post that doesn't include new stories, I've seen almost /all/ of those stories. I might not have read /all/ of them, but I still know of them. I can't vouch for those less active than me, however, and whether it's a new thread, topic, request, or the stories within the thread to them.

Simply put, there isn't always new blood in re-posts, especially with rarer pairings. And some of those rarer pairings have already been milked for every story they have.

***** If you're talking about HaS by Sillimaure (I'm sure I messed up the name, but it's something like that), then I have to vehemently disagree. There are few other fics that can compete with this atrociously overblown, horrendously paced, amazingly boring story. You could take out 2/3 of the 700k+ words and not lose a single plot point of any consequence.

****** Definitely agree with you. I feel like that's a common trap authors fall into, taking a lot of words to say a little in an effort to show not tell. Balance and plot progression are important as well. One of the things that really bothered me about the Saving Conner series that is also quite popular around here.
