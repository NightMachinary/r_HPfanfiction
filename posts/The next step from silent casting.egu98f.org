So I had an idea and I'd be super interested to read a fic that features it, the only problem is I don't know if such a fic exists.

What if the next stage from silent casting was to say "Expeliarmus" but actually cast a stupefy for example? This is likely auror grade skill or higher but still...

Love to hear of any fics involving this, even if its not a main plot point! Thanks!


** Learn a good nonlethal knockout spell that leaves people unconscious without visible marks and that also happens to be green, cast it while saying Avada Kedavra, and it's perfect for double agent work.

** Canonically, that's not supposed to be possible - one of the few rules actually given for Rowling's magical system - but I totally agree that it'd be cool fanonically.

I remember a time travel one where Harry was fighting with his brother (that stealing witches thing, I think?) in a Tournament and they used the colour of a non-lethal spell Harry cast to pretend he'd tried to kill his brother. I've seen a few things like that, where one spell is similar enough to another that they've been conflated, but I don't think I've read too many with vocal substitutions either.

*** Thanks! It always seemed like a logical progression to me but I've never been able to find a fic that uses it!

** The logical progression that seems to be everywhere in fanon is

1. Accidental
2. Verbal
3. Nonverbal
4. Point (no wand movements)
5. Wandless

Theoretically, couldn't you do this with Occlumency? Or at least the fanon derivative of it?

​

Don't we have all of these pitched battles in HP, where they are yelling at each other? While already casting.

*** Huh, I put point spells as being easier that verbal spells in my fic
