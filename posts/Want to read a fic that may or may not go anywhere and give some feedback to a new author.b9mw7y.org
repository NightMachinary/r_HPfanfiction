So, as the title says. I posted the first of three chapters that I have written for a story that I've been wanting to write for a while. I'm gonna write it even if nobody reads it or if they say it's trash. But I need someone else to read my shit and give feedback to improve my sick typing skills.

The title is /Lost in Green/ (for now anyways, I'm not happy with it and it's subject to change) It's a story where Harry dips out of the Dursley's and Sirius leaves azkaban early. There's not much more to it right now other than that I will warn of possible long winded magical explanations later.

** I enjoyed it! It's a very intriguing plot that you're setting up and I like Harry's sarcastic thoughts. You also have some really great words that you use that makes your writing come to life like ‘careening'. One thing to watch though is how much you use “was” in your writing.

For example:

“Vernon was already sitting”

Becomes:

“Vernon sat”

Sometimes it works to have the ‘was' version of the sentence, but in general it's kinda telling the reader what the scene looks like instead of describing the actual scene.

Hope this helped!

*** Thanks for the was bit, those kinds of things are hard for me to catch on the re read.

**** No problem! It's definitely hard to notice that sort of thing in your own writing.
