So what I remember is that year one Harry is on the train and some one is like "your last name is black right" and he is just like "ok" and rolls with it. Were even at school people call him harry black. That includes the teachers.

*** I don't know why but now I'm just imagining a super relaxed stoner Harry going in Hufflepuff and secretly growing weed in the greenhouses.
