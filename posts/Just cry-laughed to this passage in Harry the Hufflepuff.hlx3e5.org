"Harry, can I see you for a moment?" asked Professor Lupin as the rest of the students fled the defence classroom after the lesson.

Harry sighed. He really thought he was going to get away with it for a bit longer.

"Yes, sir?" he asked politely, still hoping it was about something different.

"It's about your last assignment, your last three assignments actually," explained Lupin.

Harry tried his puppy-dog eyes.

"Yes, sir?" he said, feigning innocence.

"You can put that look away, young man. Your father was master of it and I am quite immune after many years of exposure-"

"Wait, you knew my father?" asked Harry quickly.

"Well, yes," said Lupin caught by surprise at Harry's sudden change in demeanor.

"Were you his teacher too?" asked Harry excitedly.

"His teacher? Good Merlin no. Just how old do you think I am? No -- don't answer that - I don't think I want to know. I went to school with your father, all seven years. We were actually quite close," said Lupin.

"And my mum? Did you know her too?" asked Harry even more excitedly. "Can you tell me about them? Please? I don't really know anything about them at all."

Hours later, after Harry was long gone, Lupin looked down at the batch of Harry's assignments.

"Son of a -- ," swore Lupin to himself, realising he had been had and Harry had successfully distracted him from reprimanding the boy on his work ethic(or lack thereof), but unable to find a suitable derogatory term to use.

All four of Harry's assignments were identical, aside from the heading and dates, and consisted of a single, neatly written answer:

Kill it with fire.

Harry's four-word answer to the question of how to handle four vastly different creatures was technically correct, but completely violated the spirit and intention of the assignment.

"-a Marauder," finished Lupin in a lighter tone, a smile curling the corners of his mouth and his spirit lifting higher than at almost any point in the previous dozen years. "Son of a Marauder."

  "Now, Milo, I want you to understand that these are just /preliminary/ inquiries. There are a lot of unanswered questions, and we're just going to try and see if they're worth looking into is all. That business about the execution is just a formality," he said in a dry voice. Milo had just started sighing with relief when he continued. "Unless, of course, you /aren't/ human, and are some form of hitherto-undiscovered magical creature, in which case you'll be staked, beheaded, buried upside-down in sanctified concrete for a year and a day, then dug up, salted, shot with thirteen silver bullets, cremated, and Disapparated into the sun. In my experience, that'll kill anything short of a Dementor."

  Imagine that one of the background characters in Naruto's graduating class was actually relegated to Side Character status and therefore got a character arc. Follow Yuuki, an orphan who's just a bit off, as she affects everything by just being herself. Except... something's a little odd about the dreams she gets and maybe herself isn't completely her.A/N: OC / future Sasunaru / World-Building
