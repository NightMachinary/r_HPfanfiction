  I hate it when a writer tries desperately to incorporate every available character from the DC/Marvel universes. Nobody has successfully done it, it gets messy and miserable fast.
#+end_quote

Not really an Avengers problem so much as a problem with most crossovers. A lot of the time the authors really are just saying "how would X story be different if Y character were dumped in the plot?" This almost always ends up being just a repeat of whatever storyline but with Harry Potter in it, which honestly isn't that interesting because Harry himself is not that interesting (more like he is a lightning rod for interesting events).

#+begin_quote
  Next two rants are fanfiction in general. Ok so in the fictional story Harry is 14 and the author keeps mentioning that "the boy was beautiful " and a lot of complete gibberish that he looked pretty or innocent (usually in fics that mentions abuse). Which makes me feel queasy as fuck. I will assume the author has a thing for little abused boys or that they were a young teen who potentially romanticized violence when they wrote the story. In either case its a instant close down of the fic.

  Third factors in with the second and is heavy abuse of Harry. I started reading a new story the other week or so and the first paragraphs was well written but it soon evolved into a extremely detailed torturous, longwinded and impeccably detailed story on child abuse. Vile and graphic and so wrong. 🤮
#+end_quote

There is a lot that can be said, but really its hard for me to feel bad when Rowling did the same thing in canon. People who don't really understand how abuse occurs/works in real life often write caricatures of it in order to make the character(s) more sympathetic and tragic. Its about sympathy, often as a form of wish-fulfillment. "Oh woe is me, he/she is so brave for bearing it all! Lets adore him for his tragedy" (I'm being hyperbolic, but that is the gist of the matter).

I have come across perhaps ~10 HP fics that on the whole realistically portray abuse of children, either in the more neglectful and more indirect way of canon or in the more visceral, brutal, and direct kind that can occur in real life. And I would know.

**** The thing people forget about the books is that Rowling originally designed Harry's situation as a parallel of "Cinderella." Both families are abusive, but they're not /believably abusive/, if you get what I mean. Its hard to take how the Dursleys behave seriously because...well...they're a fairy tale step-family.

Overweight loudmouth stepdad? Check. Snooty, cleaning-obsessed stepmom? Check. Underworked, ugly bullying stepsibling? Check.

Its hard to see that in the same way as real abuse because thats not a real abusive family. Out of context, most of the behaviors are pretentious to abhorent, but collectively and in-context it reads like what it is - an unreal family situation that is hard to treat as such. Thats why there is such a jarring shift in how the Dursleys are portrayed in GoF begins, as well as Rowling beginning to try and set seeds for walking back all the earlier decade of behavior.

** I avoid reading stories about Harry's abuse in general. I remember trying to read one and gave up because it was too much. In general, authors seem to want to make the abuse so terrifying in their stories that I only leave the story with the distinct impression they like the drama. On the other hand, I'm reading a fix it fic where the Dursleys apparently will be punished in some way. And while that's admirable, I don't find it paticularly interesting to read because it makes me think of news reports on child abuse. Now I really think I'd prefer a fic which just doesn't have the Dursleys in the plot at all. I have also noticed I read less and less fics because now I know what I want and so it's hard to find that ideal fic.

** Regarding the second factor, this is how young girls have been written about in all kinds media for ages. Young fic writers who write this kind of thing are getting it from somewhere. So, as inexperienced slash writers who want to portray Harry as an object of romantic interest, particularly male interest, these are the kind of descriptors that come to their mind.

Plus, more fic writers tend to be closer to Harry's age than not, which maybe makes it a bit less problematic? I mean, it's fine that they don't know any better and for the most part I think it's fantastic that fiction writing and publishing has become a way of life for an unprecedented number young people for the first time in history, but the converse is that young people find a lot of problematic ideas attractive and ideas spread like wildfire on the interwebs; and while good ideas stay the same, bad ideas will inevitably get worse.

Just to be clear, I don't think it's OK, and spend inordinate amounts of time looking for fics that are not hinky because I think canon is problematic enough, but I also accept the fact that I'm going have to wade through a lot of shit to get to the good stuff.

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

** The inclusion of every possible character is just something we have to live with in fanfiction. The vast majority of fanfiction authors do not understand that less is more. Literally. Every word or sentence that does not contribute to the plot would be struck from a professional novel. That's why we like them so much. Fanfiction authors on the other hand, do not have that supervision. So they tend to inflate their word count with superficial description and meaningless dialogue.

Your second issue is actually with fanfiction authors themselves. Most of them are female and they like pretty boys. It has been said that authors like to self insert a lot into their main characters. Therefore Harry will be considered pretty, because that's how they would like to be addressed to themselves. It's very basic psychology. Compare this with male authors who like to make their main characters into macho man who are great at fighting. It's the same principle.

The heavy abuse is very easily explained. Remember that once the main's character uniqueness and hardship was exemplified by their dead parents. Then it changed to rape (rape is the new dead parents - tv tropes). In HP fandom it's often horrendous abuse. It shows the main character as a unique individual who had gone through hardships unimaginable to the reader.

  Literally. Every word or sentence that does not contribute to the plot would be struck from a professional novel.

Not really. Just look at A song of Ice and Fire which repeats countless events due to the multi pov style. Jamie's and Brienne's arc is especially bad in that regard. Yet it is still in one of the most successful book series written this millennium.

While I agree that a certain restraint is good, you have to keep in mind that even fluff can add a lot to a fic, be it world building or character development. It might look like another date scene where the relationship between two characters doesn't change, but you still get new information about them and the world.
