** Linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower)

No one does politics like Flamethrower. They are the monarch of having characters say one thing and mean something entirely different. Their fics give me headaches I adore them. Fuck it, I don't know what half the characters mean most of the time it's glorious to read. Eugh!
