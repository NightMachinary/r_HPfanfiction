The 24 year old war hero and head Auror groaned at the phone began to ring and he finally opened him eyes, And then blinking rapidly .the Sight that greeted him Was not the now familiar Sleeping form of his life but the wall of his old bedroom at privet Drive.

Harry Dug his nails into the palm of his handAnd then swore loudly when pain greeted him, This wasn't one of his nightmares, Hermione Always popped up to reprimand him if he hurt himself in one of those. He started an internal monologue Of evermore creative curses As he took in the room and heard the Distinctive high pitched shouting of his Aunt . “ I don't care if your parents are dentists! Don't call here again! If you want to talk to him that badly then bloody come take him!” And then the telltale smashing sound the phone being hung up rather forcefully.

The receiver started to ring again almost immediately, And harry heard His aunt shouting for him. Making him smile, Good old Hermione , Stubborn as a mule with a carrot. He wasn't alone and seemed. And whatever fresh hell was this.
