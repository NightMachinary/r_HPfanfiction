^{So I know I'm probably not the only one but in spirits of keeping meme structure of the phrase...}

Am I the only one who's getting irked at all those /things that are not fanfiction/ on /fanfiction sites/? Translations - sure, fine. Podfics - yeah, okay, if they are properly tagged. Same with the artwork.

But requests? Lists? What the hell. That's not a place for those imho and some of the people who do that can't tag to save their lives, so you can't even filter it out.


** I'm not sure about other fic hosting sites, but on AO3 this is explicitly against [[https://archiveofourown.org/tos_faq#max_inclusiveness][their ToS]]:

#+begin_quote
  Where we provide a specific function (search, bookmarking, challenges) we will ask you to use the specific methods we provide for those activities rather than create separate works. So, for example, a request for recommendations for particular kinds of fanworks would not be an appropriate work. That search should be carried out by searching works and/or bookmarks. A list of recommended works on a particular topic would also not be an appropriate work. Recommendations should be done by using our bookmarking function. A description of a challenge for other creators would also not be an appropriate work. That should be carried out by using our challenge function.

  In addition, as an Archive whose goal is preservation, we want permanent, nonephemeral content. To the extent that your content is designed to be ephemeral, such as liveblogging episode reactions, it should go on a journaling service and not the Archive.
#+end_quote

If you believe a work violates this, you can report it to the Abuse team (there's a handy link at the bottom of the site), who, in my experience, is very good at following up on complaints.

** It's incredibly annoying to see on the FFN app.

I also really hate when someone marks a story as complete so it shows up in my custom search (which is along the lines of complete, 60k+ words, recently updated), but it shows up /every damn week/ because it's actually a collection of stories that they add a new 500 word piece to frequently, bumping the update date back up.

*** I feel you. I don't like it more when the work is marked as complete and you go like "oh, nice" and read with expectations for closure only to find out the last chapter's actually something along the line of "abandoned" or "on hiatus indefinitely". Or not even that, marked as complete and no info nowhere - not in the description, not in the last chapter... Just a normal chapter with a cliffhanger or one that was obviously not meant to be the last one.

**** Whenever I finish reading something I will leave a review about the status of the story so others can read reviews and know if it needs a sequal, is incomplete but already has finished the main plot or marked complete when it isn't. I always read reviews to k ow a little bit more about stories so I leave them to help others

** Depends on the site, for space-battle or sufficient velocity I ain't going to complain as those are forms first and places where people post fanfiction/quests second. Artwork fics really bother me though, I get you there. Requests and Lists though are just petty assholes abusing the lack of real moderation/curation.

** I haven't encountered this yet, but I think this is against ff.net's policy. They don't even allow you to post a chapter that's not a story, let alone an entire entry. That includes author's notes (if the entire chapter is nothing but author's notes), lists, scripts, etc. If you see any, just report them.

*** Yes, the key is "properly tagged". The problem is people don't always seem to know there is a proper tag for this thing they're doing, so they either don't tag or don't use the universally used tag.

There should be a compendium of "tags you might find useful - welcome to fanfiction!" or sth like this. :D

** On most 'Archive' sites, such is against the rules, so just mash that Report button XD

Additionally, if you do not have time to bother with that and you saw an "author" who does that a lot, or even exclusively (note the " "), on FFN there are a few communities of bored busybodies that can take care of the whole lot for you - just shoot them a link to author profile. Hate them, but they can be occasionally useful.

I actually do that almost all the time but then those "works" that are not tagged show up anyway and I'm always apprehensive of excluding words outside tags because they may be in e.g. description and not be an actual list or a podfic, etc.

** Ik. I mean I look at the wordcount because of that. I mean i think it's alright if you put out a prompt so to say but it's sometimes a bit disappointing if you click on a fic and then there is someone telling you "This my headcanon, might write a fic about it here one day..."

I think requests/prompts are alright but it's still kinda disappointing if you expect a fic and then you get a desert of emptiness

** I haven't run into those too much and I only get the updates for 'Bunny Ranchers' for authors I'm subscribed to/following.

I don't mind running into the occasional Essayist as long as their work(s) tie into the fandom.

The works that are really grossing ME out lately are when I do a search for some new reading material (I know, with 1300 bookmarks and 600 subscriptions on AO3 and about that on FFN, why would I need anything *new*! Lol!) using just my regular tags and I keep on getting something called "Potter-Cest" popping up! The tag honestly squicks me. I just wish that these people would go post their stuff on AFFN and quit tagging, in such a way, as it's pushed constantly in my face!

That's *my* pet peeve. ;D

*** I will not exactly recommend to you the solution I use, because, you know - on one's own risk, but I will tell you that I find it very, very useful.

[[https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/by-site/archiveofourown.org?filter_locale=0][Scripts]] ^{and sometimes browser addons, but} *^{that}* ^{is rare.}

In case you're interested - you first need to install an userscript manager, e.g. Tapermonkey is compatible with Chrome, Firefox and its derivatives, Edge, etc. The userscript manager that's best for your browser also depends on the version of your browser.

After the installation of userscript manager (mind you, it's best to install it through the official browser shop imho), scripts can be installed. Many scripts that are meant for customization are often customized /inside/ the script code, so if you decide to give it a go and don't know what to do - please check out the code, there are usually descriptions there what and where to do. Alternatively, check out script description from the page you found it on.

Scripts can be dangerous, especially if they come from some weird, shady sources, but e.g. scripts on GreasyFork have ratings, feedbacks and total installs count so I'd say it's a good measure of whether a script is shady or not. I personally use 16-17 scripts at the moment, out of which most are for AO3, 3 are for FFN and then there are some random ones.

*It's your own risk*, but /I/ find this solution /very/ useful. :P

My rant is rather for those instances that cannot be helped by either active or background filtering. :P
