What the title says. Basically he(harry) has no friends other than one or 2 (preferably not Ron or Hermione, spice it up, yeah?) And he's happy with that.(no yaoi for main characters like harry,hermione, or ron. just not my cup of tea)

  Harry isn't the Boy-Who-Lived, but his parents still died, and Albus Dumbledore, concerned that Death Eaters might seek the boy's death, cast a powerful charm on him to make wizards ignore him before Harry was left with the Dursleys. Except, with the Elder Wand in play, the charm was far too powerful, and made others essentially forget Harry existed when not directly interacting with him. Sorted into Ravenclaw at Hogwarts, Harry lives a contented life with no one either loving or hating him...until the charm breaks on his seventeenth birthday, and he's suddenly plunged directly into the middle of a living world at war.

*** Okay, before you give this story a hard pass because it does have yaoi, let me just say that I read this today not even two hours ago and I loved it. It's on the shorter side and does kind of sweep a lot of details under the rug, but it's great and the yaoi component to it is essentially two segments, one of which can be easily skipped in chapter 7. It's a great story about Harry focusing down on a singular subject and being fucking awesome at it.

​

Anyways, ngl, the only reason I read it was because someone else recommended it in a different thread, and I noticed it was written by Lomonaaeren, who wrote A Brother To Basilisks, which last I read was a pretty cool fanfic and is now finished I believe, as well as The Art of Self-Fashioning, which is an another amazing Ravenclaw Harry fanfic, but it gets a bit dark if I remember correctly.

Also, it's abandoned now I think, but have you checked out Worthy of Magic by Sage Ra? It's pretty dark, and Harry has a lack of friends solely because of his... personality? I feel like that's the wrong word, but it was an interesting story, I have no idea why Sage Ra decided to abandon it.

​

Because I feel the need to recommend it often, check out Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7. It's a fucked up story that I think is amazing. That's all I'm going to describe it with, read the description for more.

** Hmm, Harry is almost always an introvert. There are a lot of fics where Harry is sorted into Ravenclaw for him to make his ultimate bid to power, to end up networking a lot and find friends despite not searching.

But if you‘re looking for the ultimate, adorable and introspective wallflower Harry, search no further:

Linkffn(The Life He Leads)

He is in Gryffindor though. Which helps the story, because his loneliness is greatly exacerbated by avoiding, yet living among people who do socialice and, well, talk to each other.
