** In canon, Divination is bunk. Dumbledore even says he wanted to drop it from the availble courses, but needed something to keep Trelawney at Hogwarts.

As for the other stuff, it's really just the prophecy. Despite the attempt at saying Harry had a choice, Dumbledore knows who Harry is won't change, so Harry is fated to kill or be killed by Voldemort.

*** But arithmancy is apparently legit. And we know computers can make some very accurate predictions, even without magic. Dumbledore was almost certainly close to genius level, and is certainly very smart...plus, we know he took Arithmancy. I could definitely see him using it. It might even be how he knew Ron would benefit from the deluminator.

And also, I disagree with Divination being bunk. It's just that it can't be learned by someone who doesn't have the talent - much like magic is bunk to muggles, and iPhones are bunk to luddites. Dumbledore wanted to drop it because students were using it for an easy O, and there were no decent teachers.

**** There's no instance in canon where Divination let's anyone do anything. That Dumbledore, McGonagall and Hermione place high doubt on it is very good reason to think it's not really anything. Arithmancy isn't Divination though (in HP), it's its own field with similar aims but apparently does work. But it has nothing to do with the Ron and Deluminator. That was figured out just based on him observing Ron's personality and figuring him to be the one to leave the hunt and thus need a way back.

***** I disagree, for example, defeating Voldemort was made easier by the existence of a prophecy. Without it, Dumbledore would probably never have guessed at the existence of Horcruxes, he'd never have been defeated the first time, he'd never fixate on Harry to the point he was able to be killed, because he'd never take Harry's blood, and there would be no blood protection from Lily. You can't blame his belief in it as being the only thing that gave it credence; if it weren't a real thing, how would it be recorded in the DoM? I highly doubt they record every fake one, indicating there is actually something to real prophecies.

Don't forget the centeurs also use it. Just because it's imprecise, and hard to interpret, doesn't mean it's bunk.

Also, it's not just for the future - it can be used for the past and present, too. Hermione is very narrow minded, and doesn't believe anything that can't be learned from books. She got sniffy about it because she was extremely overworked, an emotional teenager, and couldn't cope with the fact she couldn't do it, and hated to admit it...and who doesn't? I actually could see McGonagall being the same way, plus she was influenced by her exasperation with Trelawney, who was actually a fraud. Plus, we've seen in canon that she's prone to mistakes and brushing genuine issues off.

And Dumbledore also put stock in prophecies, not just Voldemort.

Plus, the Pettigrew prophecy was actually helpful - it told them what he was doing, and warned them that the reborn Voldemort would be worse than ever before.

****** A prophecy has nothing to do with the Divination taught in class, come on man. Even the centaur version involves largely vague interpretation about the future of broad changes, not anything specific. It has nothing to do with being closed minded, even Dumbledore said he planned on dropping it from Hogwarts because of its shoddy nature.
