  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

*** He's definitely a member of the group from the start in that fic! Of course Ron's a girl in the fic...

**** True, but it's actually well-written, with interesting snowball effects.

As I recall, "Ronnie" is not particularly afraid of spiders because Fred couldn't bring himself to turn her teddy bear into a spider after she broke his toy.

Because of that, Ronnie talks Harry into seeing Lee Jordan's tarantula.

And that means that Harry and Ronnie weren't there when the trolley witch made her rounds.

So somebody else bought Albus Dumbledore's Chocolate Frog.

Which means Harry and friends don't have their big clue to Flamel's identity.

***** Oh, I didn't mean that as a detriment to the fic. I really like the story (it's one of my inspirations for the story I'm currently writing), I was just warning the OP that even if Ron isn't replaced by Neville in the story, it's not actually Ron as you know him. :)

****** Oh, right. You raise an excellent point--"Ronnie" is most definitely not Ron.
