  "Of course I use Felix Felicis, I was friends with Nicolas Flamel, remember? He taught me how to brew the stuff in my sleep. How do you think I ended up Chief Warlock AND Supreme Mugwump? Staying at the Dursleys, that first-year detention, keeping you in the Triwizard Tournament, those were all Felix's doing to make you brave and strong enough to crush Voldemort. Now, would you like me to obliviate you, or should I share some of my stash of Felix Felicis so we can get a few things done ahead of schedule?"

  "There is a room in the Department of Mysteries that is kept locked at all times. It contains things that are, quite frankly, not suitable for a tour group visiting the D.o.M., unless they wish to visit the D.O.M.S., and the S.U.B.S.. 'Fetish' in that room most certainly does not refer to a magically-imbued object and should probably not be discussed in polite company. They use different 'wands' in that room, they use their robes and wizards hats differently in that room, and the bonds they research are completely different from the ones between you and your friends. It is a 'magical realm' that I strongly recommend you decline to 'dare entering', unless you at minimum bring a safeword and a contraceptive."

** I am now utterly confused because your first idea sounds like a totally reasonable basis for a one-shot, whereas your second idea is cracky smutty nonsense.

*** Right up until he gets infected by the Ring horcrux, and later that year killed by Snape.

Although given that Snape had Voldemort's complete trust after that, right up to being placed as Headmaster of Hogwarts, maybe that went to plan too; would Felix Felicis necessarily place its imbiber's life over accomplishing their goals?

**** Well Dumbledore wasn't all that bothered with the idea of dying, calling it the next great adventure. So it's probable that he would willingly die if it helped against Voldemort

  One-shot. In times of war, desperate measures must often be taken -- "for the greater good", some would say. But all things have side effects, as Minerva McGonagall discovered once all was said and done. No pairings; deliberate reading against authorial intent (as always).
