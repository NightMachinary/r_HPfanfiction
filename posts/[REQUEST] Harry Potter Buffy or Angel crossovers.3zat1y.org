In which Harry Potter goes to the buffyverse or bumps into them or goes to LA. I don't want to read an everyone goes to Hogwarts fic. Preferably complete with little to no Snape or Hermione. And without any weird paedo-pairings.

Cheers my dears.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8796596/1/Fallen][Fallen]] is pretty great imo. It's a bit cracky. Harry ends up in the Buffyverse and everyone thinks he's Satan.

** A well written story but is abandoned before anything much can happen. Still a great read and at 70k words, enough to leave you feeling satisfied.

** I've always been interested in this pairing. The timeline is nice and the worlds match up well. Yet I've never found a good fic.

** all the characters, dialogue, events, etc. felt very genuine, and the two worlds were merged beautifully. Sadly, it appears abandoned, a fact which still tears me up as things were really starting to get interesting. They hadn't even started exploring the Harry/Faith angle, which I was really looking forward to.

In my heart of hearts, I still hold out hope that this one will be updated someday:

** I found one a while back that is Buffy/HP/Addams Family x-over, with Xander and Wednesday as the main characters. Has a very canon!Harry, who is wimpy and unmotivated despite his magical power. Is long, still in progress, but I like it very much. 4.x/5 [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35]]
