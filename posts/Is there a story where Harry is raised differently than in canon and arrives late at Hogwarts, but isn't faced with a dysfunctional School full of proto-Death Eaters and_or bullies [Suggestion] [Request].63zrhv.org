Checking the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/63qf51/lf_fics_where_harry_doesnt_go_to_hogwarts_at_11/]["Harry doesn't go to Hogwarts at 11"]] thread gave me an idea, and I wanted to know if it has been done:

Harry is raised differently - maybe by Sirius and Remus, and as the Boy-Who-Lived, receives special training etc. etc. - and to keep him safe without the blood protection, he doesn't go to Hogwarts until Voldemort is back and, due to his link to the Dark Lord, secrecy won't work well to keep him safe anymore, so he'll be safer at Hogwarts.

So, he arrives at Hogwarts as the mysterious Boy-Who-Lived, with skills to back it up, and meets the Gryffindor Crew who have taken up the slack in his absence, so to speak - Hermione, Ron, Neville (got roped into joining in the first year since back then he was too timid to say no), and Ginny (couldn't be kept away from the group like she couldn't be kept from learning how to fly at home), with associated Ravenclaw Luna (noticed Ginny's issues with the diary, and joined because she wanted friends, and stuck around for the "adventure". Pretty much the craziest of the bunch - although all of them have a touch of Moody's attitude by now) part-time members include the twins, Dean and Seamus, with pretty much every Gryffindor with an axe to grind with blood purists or simply the desire for some excitement helping out when needed.

They have been dealing with trouble for years, ever since Hermione and Ron's duel in the bathroom got interrupted by a troll, which they managed to dispatch similarly to Canon by working together. Unlike canon, though, Malfoy openly voiced his regret that the "mudblood and the blood traitor" hadn't died, and so Ron and Hermione jumped to the conclusion that Draco had let the troll in, and started investigating, leading them to partially unravel the "mystery of the 3rd floor" (and setting them firmly against Malfoy and by extension, House Slytherin). After four years, matters are well in hand - Draco and the other Junior Death Eaters are on the backfoot, despite support from their criminal families, and the smarter members of House Slytherin have distanced themselves from them, fragmenting the house, which actually lessened the rivalry with Gryffindor somewhat.

So, when Harry arrives at Hogwarts, he doesn't have to save poor abused muggleborns, doesn't have to be the first one to stand up to Snape, doesn't have to be the one to teach the blood bigots in Slytherin a lesson, or introduce pranking, or teach students how much better the rest of the world is than Britain. Instead he meets a well-organised group of Gryffidors (and one not so organised Ravenclaw) who could be of great help to him in the coming struggle with Voldemort - provided he can earn their trust and respect. It's not just Ron who's a tad jealous about Harry being so famous - the entire group has, in their view, earned their top spot in Hogwarts informal Hierarchie and popularity, and suddenly there's the Boy-Who-Lived shaking things up just by virtue of arriving. Harry would be a bit of an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FNG_syndrome][FNG]], maybe even a romantic rival.


** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128465][Ginny Duty]] has a similar background story like what you wanted. Harry was raised and trained by Sirius. He showed up at Hogwarts a couple of times (Chamber, Final Battle), but never attended the school. It was mostly Hermione, Ron, and Ginny running things there, and Ginny killed Bellatrix in the Final Battle.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

** Ok I've recommended this way too many times (it fits all the requests!), but it does kinda have this...

linkffn(4062601)

I really can't recommend /The Wise One/ trilogy enough. It is complete, and has a total series word length of around 450k. Harry is "kidnapped" by Sirius when he is seven. Sirius takes him out of the country and they travel around the world. Meanwhile in Britain, Dumbledore thinks Sirius must've killed Harry and raises Neville up to be the chosen one of the prophecy, even though Neville isn't entirely up for it.

The first book takes place mostly outside Britain, though we do get scenes of what's going on at Hogwarts from time to time. Harry and Sirius return to Britain at the end of the first book for Harry's fifth year. Harry in this is fairly competent, proactive and confident.

The series features one of the best Harry/Hermione romances I've read and doesn't bash anyone, though it may seem like /mild/ Ron and Dumbledore bashing for a short while. Everyone is pretty much in character and honestly, I can't find anything to complain about it. I'd actually say it's better than canon in many ways.

*** O.k. Can you please stop with recommending it. That series is very different from what he wants. We get it you enjoy the series and so did i but you can't just suggest it on basically every post via copy and paste. Hell he isn't even harry til near the end of the second part. A lot of what the op wants is non-existent in this story.

**** Oh! Didn't realise you were the OP. We already talked about this, right? But yeah, she does. Apart from that, however, Hogwarts is still chugging along, mostly due to Neville, Hermione, Ron and the Twins' efforts. Even that incident isn't like some huge melodramatic thing. It's handled with appropriate gravity but not like you see in most fics.

***** If rape isn't a huge melodramatic thing in the story, then why have it happen at all? Could have had Hermione have some issues with intimacy if she simply had been seduced and then dumped by Krum.

****** Well, for a long time the audience (and Harry) is led to believe that Krum was drunk and depressed and physically assaulted her. It happened when Harry was not yet a Hogwarts student. It is only much later after Harry asks her that she reveals what happened. It seemed to me that the detail was only added to lend weight to that particular scene.

Actually, I do kind of agree with you that that subplot was largely useless. However, having taken place off screen, it wasn't central to the drama and it wasn't nearly bad enough to put me off reading the story.

******* It's for me. Rape is almost never handled well in a story - either it's glossed over, or it's handled realistically, which generally means that it's so bloody depressing that I don't want to read the story anyway.

It's also telling that rape is added far more often to a female character's backstory than to a male character's.
