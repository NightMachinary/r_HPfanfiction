It's the fic that dethroned HPMOR on fanfiction.net. I didn't like HPMOR because I can't handle a 40 year old's self insert that is supposedly "11 years old". I don't particularly like the 8th year trope where the slytherin students are now okay with hanging around everyone else and vice versa and everyone gets a different slytherin as a romantic partner. I also don't understand the community's fascination with emo Draco. Would this fic change my mind?


** It's just a Draco (or Tom Felton) fangirl's pipe dream IMO. Everyone is OOC, and the story is full of revisionism for Death Eaters, who had just tortured the school for an Year and was trying to commit genocide against Muggleborns.

"Green Girl" could at least be explained as an AU, but this fic followed immediately after DH.

As for dethroning HPMOR, it only happened in number of Reviews, but lagged far behind in number of Favorites and Followings. In fact, I think number of Favorites is far indicative of a story's popularity because Reviews can be negative.

***** Personally, I'd say the fact that someone bothered to follow the story must mean that it was interesting enough that they wanted to be quickly informed when it updated. Shows that they're really interested and can't wait to read more.

Of course, this is biased against shorter and older fics. People won't bother "following" one-shots and old stories were completed when the fandom was smaller and newer readers won't follow them because they're already complete.

****** I follow and favorite everything I like, no matter its length or whether it's been completed or not. It bothers me because this is definitely not organized, but doing it any other way would make some stories fall through the cracks and not finding a story when I'm looking for it nags me to no end.

***** After thinking it over, I'd say that follows are the best metric with which to find up-and-coming stories, or great old unfinished ones. I suppose favorites would be better if you were trying to find something completed.

I'm biased because my story, when sorted by follows, is second in the fandom where I've posted it. (It's a HP crossover) When sorted by other metrics, it isn't. That's my little moment of self-centered-ness playing out.

**** I think "follows" is a lot of the times an indication of very long fics written over long period of time with many chapters, and not necessarily quality. I have seen lots of crappy fics with tons of followers (although other metrics are not that good either in that regard) I believe "favorites" is the best way to sort since then it doesn't exclude shorter stories, completed stories or longer stories that were posted over shorter period of time. I also believe that people are more likely to favorite stories that are actually good.

** Honestly, if you like Dramione, I think it's excellent. It's one of my favourite fics, personally. I think colubrina is an exceptionally talented writer and have enjoyed most of her other work as well, but Rebuilding is just excellent. She manages to deal with the fact that kids who fought in war will have problems, and fleshed out the background characters really nicely.

That said, I also hated HPMOR, couldn't get more than a few chapters in for a number of reasons, so...

**** I mean, that's what I would recommend. This sub seems to lean towards hating Draco, hating Dramione, liking strong powerful Harry... so I can see why people would prefer HPMOR to Rebuilding. But I think it's better to try it yourself and form your own opinions?

***** I don't really care about ships, really if the story is good. About the sub's aversion to Draco, maybe it's because guys are more active on reddit as a whole. As a guy myself, I don't really go to seek out stories with him as a main character but I'm not opposed to them if they're good stories. But, this sub also seems to hate HPMOR too, so I don't know.

One thing I'd like to see is Dramione story written by a guy, preferably straight. Reading stories where the writer is obviously predisposed to the idea of Draco being a classic romantic prospect (not saying all of them are) does not appeal to me and I stumble upon them more often than not and they also have the tendency to bash Ron very unfairly. Reading Dramione from a male-written Draco's perspective could be a good change of pace.

****** I don't think I've ever read Dramione from someone who is openly male. It is definitely something I would love to read though! Honestly, I love Dramione as a pairing, but I'm not particularly fond of Rebuilding or many works by Colubrina to be honest. I find that the characterization tends to lean heavily towards out of character.

******* Have you read colubrina's The Die? Honestly I think it's one of the best Draco's I've read, at least in my interpretation of him. That's kind of the problem I guess is that, like.... obviously they're all out of character it's fanfic? So it's more just, does this character match with your vision. But, if you're interested in giving her work another chance I would highly highly recommend that one. If not, fair point, there's LOTS of other Dramione out there.

******** I think I started that one. It rings a bell... I mean, I understand where you are coming from in regards to fanfiction, however, there's believable fanfiction and then there's a completely different character with the same face. For example, everythursday does a phenomenal Draco, and Bex-chan's Isolation captures Draco extremely well. I prefer authors they don't sugar coat the fact that Draco is in fact, a little shit, unless they give me a very solid, plausible reason for him to act otherwise.

********* It's funny, because I literally couldn't make it past a few chapters of The Fallout and while I found Isolation alright, it certainly isn't one of my top favourites. I think it just really depends on how the author frames it? And I found that fics written / published after DH tend to portray Draco less as a little shit and more as a struggling man, which is imho how we saw the character evolve in the last few books. But again, I think it's a matter of preference.

********** The Fallout definitely takes a few chapters to get into writing style-wise, but they've done a number of other pieces that aren't quite written in the same style. As for Isolation, I read it, and enjoyed it, but it's definitely not my favourite. I just think that her portrayal and characterization of Draco is really well done. But each to their own!

As for the blurb about Draco struggling, I totally get it, and I agree with you. That being said, often times I find that the reasons for how Draco has magically changed into a Prince Charming is floppy and/or weak, or the authors tend to gloss over things in the past or just shuck the blame on to Lucius or whatnot. I mean, unless I'm given a solid background, I can't enjoy a piece where in one chapter Draco meets Hermione for the first time in years and in the next he's falling to his knees in tears to apologize for all the harm he caused her growing up. (Does that make sense?)

Anyways... Bottom line, everyone has a preference. I tend to lean more towards darker, grittier pieces as they feel more realistic, but I definitely have some fluffy guilty pleasures thrown in there! Cheers!

****** Ron bashing in Dramione really puts me off, though I find that it's not actually as common as it seems. It WAS common a few years ago (I got into the ship maybe... 10+ years back? and it was heavy then) but lately I don't see a ton of it. Or maybe I just seek out better written stories?

The thing is... it's hard to say with fanfic whether the author is male or female because a lot never make that clear? I guess for me, I don't really care about the gender of the author at all. (Though, I probably skew towards reading more female writers because I'm more interested in reading romances than, as I said, overpowered / harem Harry fics, which seem to be overwhelmingly written by men...)
