Hogwarts doesn't seem to teach very much of the more advanced wandless or nonverbal magic, so I was wondering if there were any fics that have Harry learning these types of magic? I think it would be cool to have Harry cast spells and no one even knows it's him because they wouldn't expect him to be able to use non-traditional magic. I don't really care about how big of a part it plays, length, or ships.


** In my Potterverse I have a few notions on wandless magic.

•The caster's will comes into play--you have to /really/ want something to happen for it to occur wandlessly, akin to accidental magic in children.

•It's easier to affect things that are part of you or came from you.

•Some things, like making a feather float, are a bit easier because a feather already has an affinity for floating in the air.

•Working with a very stable element, like gold, is difficult without a wand to focus your magic because gold is very stable and likes being exactly how and what it is, thank you very much.

Regarding non-verbal magic, I have Harry teach his higher-grade Defense students to cast non-verbally. This results in some upset parents as his students go a little bit crazy with their newfound freedom to scare family cats, dogs and little siblings.

*** I think you meant wandlessly at the end, not non-verbally (that's already taught in 6th years).

** linkffn(12388283) has a good take on wandless magic: it's just plain harder than casting spells normally, and not usually good for much, but being able to do magic after being disarmed is an /enormous/ tactical advantage.

** I don't see why people care about windless magic so much it's basically a party trick unless you give it some oomf like elemental manipulation or something

** Doesn't exactly fit your request but I believe either linkffn(princess of the blacks) or (can't remember the name) a story where there's a lot of traditional acting at play. I believe characters said merry meet or part of something like that.
