There are tons, and I feel like most of them are terrible. But I could see someone doing something interesting with the idea, and was wondering if any of you guys have a recommendation for me!


** I've honestly never run across a story of this type that wasn't just canon ruined by a bunch of insipid banter. After all, there's a reason why MST3K goes after the likes of Gamera, not Citizen Kane.

While it's probably not what you're after, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/4/Dimension-Hopping-for-Beginners][World 298]] out of nonjon's Dimension Hopping for Beginners is a meta-story that sums up my experience (and perhaps your frustrations) with the genre.

*** That's been mostly my reaction, too. I have read some nonjon, but I don't think I read that one, so I'll take a look. Thanks!

** I've always seen those types of stories as one of those things that gives FanFiction a bad name. Hear me out, I know it can be interesting to see character's reactions to their future laid out in a book or whatever, but the only ones I've ever seen have had the entirety of the book (or books!) typed out in the story- which is illegal! People could read the entire book- or series- without paying for it, or even increasing a library's circulation. If there were only tiny portions of the book that were directly quoted, I suppose that would be alright, but I have only ever read fics where they quote the /entire book/. And that is not okay.

Like I said before, I totally see the allure, and there are a ton of cool things that could be done with the concept. But I haven't come across a single "Reading (insert book name) with (insert people / person's names) that's been original.

*** You make a great point. Several great points, actually. It mainly seems to be an excuse to not come up with your own story. I have never actually seen ones of these stories that was worth my time, which is why I submitted this post.

*** I've read one that has them read the first line of every chapter, react at the end, and then view what could have happened if that situation turned out different. Sadly it got taken down foe being illegal, because it had them read the first sentence....

Sadly a lot of the good ones I read got taken down by Fanfiction.net.
