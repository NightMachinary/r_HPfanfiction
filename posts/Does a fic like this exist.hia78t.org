The first part/beginning of the fic would be an AU version of the Harry Potter timeline where everything goes wrong and Voldy wins. Then some generic time travel stuff happens and sends back whoever to the beginning of the HP events. This new timeline is exactly the same as the original books, but instead of seeing everything through Harry's perspective again, we get to see the character/characters who were sent back manipulating things behind the scenes into the events we are already familiar with.


** This silly little one-shot of mine is close to your request, although the problem isn't Voldemort winning.

  Remus Lupin is an anti-werewolf bigot like his father, but Hermione Granger and her time-turner can fix that.

***** I think I've read this one and I'm pretty sure he changes stuff from the original events. I'm looking for something where someone causes the canon stuff to happen, not change them.

****** And time travel? Time travels change thing, eventually... I usually like time travels where the time traveler is not super powerful and tries to keep things unchanged but stuff happens beyond his control.

Maybe what you're looking for it's not time travel but retelling from a different perspective

******* It looks like you're not understanding the request. In this type of story, the time traveler would try to change something from their timeline, like the time Harry got expelled from Hogwarts in first year for that remembrall incident with Draco. The time traveler would get some wild plan to get Harry put on the quidditch team instead. Maybe it took an imperius curse on McGonagall to do it.
