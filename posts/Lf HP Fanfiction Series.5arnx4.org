Fanfictions written in multiple book format. Not looking for a total rehash. And slash isn't really my cup of tea.

I do want to read something with a different pairing. So please do not recommend a Ginny or Hermione pairing unless you believe it's been done excellently.

Thank you :)


** I think the R series is a harry/tonks like that but I have no idea what they're called or who wrote them.

*** Yeah, they're just titled the same as the books, except with an R word at the end such as linkffn(The Philosopher's Stone Retransmuted by Regulus). There's a bunch of side stories and future stories featuring Harry and Tonk's child, and overall, the whole series is quite bad. They weren't even that good when they first came up (I used to follow the updates). The only thing I like at all about them is how the Philospher's Stone is made. So I can't really recommend them unless you have no standards at all.

Anyways, there's not that many series that actually go the full length, some get abandoned, some just jump the shark immediately. But there are some like linkffn(on the way to greatness by mira mirth) and the obligatory linkffn(harry potter and the boy who lived by the santi). There's also linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle by Inverarity).

-edit- there's also linkffn(Harry Potter and the Slytherin Selection by drizzlewizzle) which some people like but I personally got bored of.

#+begin_quote
  This is the first of a series of books I wrote for my kids set in the Harry Potter setting and occurring at the same time. These stories are meant to interweave seamlessly with the HP books and focus on characters primarily in the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses. The Tamblin books are a tad darker than the HP books, starting at about the level of the 3rd or 4th HP book.

  The third Tamblin story. Family issues. A descent into madness. A shocking crime. I wrote this story with a different style from the Harry Potter formula as an experiment. It begins in medias res, covers about half the school year, and is told through flashbacks.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815956][The Leapling (prologue to the series)]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739][Weasley Girl]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9932798][Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic with Ron's gender (we have Ronnie here) being the point of divergence. Stays very close to canon in terms of characters, settings and initial plot, but manages to spin in interesting and original direction. Ongoing, rare updates.

Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of neither. Matou Shinji, protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focus on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements or both settings with author original ideas. Ongoing, with currently iregular updates.

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand.

*** I've read the visual novel for Fate/Stay night and Matou Shinji was a despicable character. I don't know if the cross-over tries to portray him in better light but its not possible for me to read...

On the other hand, I will check out the Weasley girl series.

**** The Shinji at the start of the fic is eleven years old and his resentment hadn't yet warped him into who he was in the VN. He leaps at the chance to perform any magic in an effort to prove himself, to show that he is worthy despite not having circuits. And so his life derails.

*** Only 4 complete works. Work on the 5th seems to have stalled when I last checked a couple months ago.

However it is awesome. Probably one of the best fics ever.

The author has an unrelated fic which is why you might have gotten 5. It's also great.
