IMO one of the reasons it is so popular is because of the chemistry between emma watson and daniel radcliffe in the movies. Hey I think I figured out why a lot of harmony shippers name hermiones parents emma and dan lol. Also I think another reason is that Emma Watson is really good looking. Anyway I honestly think that books hermione was slightly too bookish and annoying.. like she was always spouting knowledge in peoples faces.. for example the intro during the first train ride. She basically quoted books and told harry and ron how she had already read all her course books. Anyway that is my opinion. Would love to know yours

** What no one seems to have brought up.

They're both lonely outcasts. Harry suddenly is thrust in a new world and is popular, but at heart he is the kid that was abused and shoved under the stairs for years on end.

Meanwhile Hermione grew up isolated due to her smarts (somewhat similar to harry being punished for doing better than Dudly)

It would only be natural for them to gravitate towards each other.

*** Respect your opinion, but must disagree with a lot of this. Full disclosure I am a big Harry/Ginny fan.

#+begin_quote
  Harry x Ginny is not something I can see working out because Ginny is such a boring useless appendage when she is around Harry. On her own, Ginny fucking rocks. When she's around Harry, she's just useless.
#+end_quote

I don't understand where this comes from. If any complaint is warranted, it's that we don't see her with Harry while they are together enough to form any opinion on how she is with him. But nothing in canon suggests she is boring with him or a useless appendage. The one real scene of them together is her making a funny joke. Not boring at all.

Before they get together, Ginny is actually the one who can get through to Harry better than anyone. She also doesn't hide around him (from OOTP on). When he is all pissed off during Christmas, Hermione won't go near him because she is afraid of upsetting him. Ginny says screw that, confronts him, makes him see reason, and gets him out of his funk.

#+begin_quote
  And the whole pining over Harry while she dated other boys really rubs me the wrong way as she never moved on properly from that girly crush she had.
#+end_quote

It's tough to say whether she was still "pining" over him or just still had feelings for him while dating other boys. I mean, she never gave up on him, but it isn't to say she wasn't legitimately trying to move on.

But personally, I just don't think Harry/Hermione is supported by canon. In GoF, Harry specifically notes its not much fun hanging around just Hermione as all they do is study. Hermione also is a bit of a nag and overly motherly towards Harry. Ginny is more supportive of Harry, preferring to take his side and be supportive rather than prove her point and be right, like Hermione is during the HBP book debacle.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione more than holds her ground with Harry. Unlike Ginny, she doesn't change around him.
#+end_quote

Certainly Ginny holds her ground well with Harry in OOTP. Also, once she's gotten over her "hero worship" by OOTP, I can find no evidence that she isn't herself around him. Ginny is probably more natural with Harry than anyone else.

Bottom line is Rowling very clearly showed why Harry and Ginny would work together. They share a sense of humor, have similar interestd, have a shared past with Riddle, and Ginny seems to know when to be there to support Harry and when to call him on his b.s. Can you really say the same for Hermione? Hermione might be right a lot of the time when she went against Harry, but in the context of whether they work as a couple, do any of these moments show that?

For example, when Hermione gets Harry's broom confiscated in PoA, she was probably right to do so. It's something a mother or big sister would do. But does that whole experience show that they are good as a couple? Harry was very upset and wouldn't speak with her for a while. How does that show they would work together?

Look how Ginny handled the HBP book. Harry was feeling really lousy about what he did. Hermione comes in basically rubbing salt in the wound and Ginny backs Harry up. Not just because she likes him, but because he is already feeling bad and alone, and needed support more than anything.

Regardless of whether Harry and Ginny belong together, the text shows quite frequently why Harry and Hermione would not be well-suited for each other.

*** And it's a more natural Lily/James relationship. That's what Rowling wanted to mirror in Harry/Ginny, but just couldn't, because Ginny was the opposite of Lily Evans. Sure, she was relatively powerful when it came to the people in her year, but she wasn't the prodigious muggle-born that Lily was. Sure she could get snappish at Harry, but honestly, she never got away from the "Boy-Who-Lived" stigma.

  Harry and Hermione just have this sort of relationship where they compliment each other, but are also independent of each other even when together.
#+end_quote

It's really about bringing out the best in each other. Of course the HP books center around their protagonist and it's very possible that without Harry Hermione would remain this anti-social know-it-all bookworm who prefers to play it safe from Book 1. Fred or George (possibly the same argument would go for Ron) could have never brought out her 'adventurous' side, because their behaviour is without 'sense' (for lack of a better term). She would break the rules though in order to help Hagrid and smuggle a Dragon out of Hogwarts. I'm not sure this is something she would have realized without Harry and it doesn't rely solely on the whole 'boy-who-lived' angle (see Dragon baby example), it's just the right thing to do and Harry is the kind of person who will always be suckered into that pulling Hermione right along (and she realizes that she enjoys it).

Her positive impact on Harry should be obvious. It's why many who dislike Ron feel like he's holding him back. It's okay to pause and think and knowledge isn't just for school but can have actually useful applications.

** Not a fan of the pairing so that will colour my view.

I put it down to two things: Hermione is the only girl in the books that is approaching fully fleshed out as a character and that puts her in a much better position that Ginny, for example. The other main reason is the films. The pairing is pushed heavily and Ron and Ginny are given less of the limelight that they are in the books.

There are key moments in the books where Hermione shows her lack of empathy for Harry; the broomstick incident in PoA, pulling him out of Mrs Weasley's embrace at the end of GoF and the need to prove herself right over the potions book in HBP. (Edit) which, for me show that she is not the one for Harry.

** I think when they shot the movies they'd already gotten a lot of buzz that Harry and Hermione would be a better match, so they staged a lot of scenes to placate those fans while sticking to the story - Hermione is almost always on Harry's shoulder while Ron is a step away or behind. Most of the scenes supporting the Ron/Hermione pairing seem obligatory. That provides a lot of subliminal encouragement to Harmony shippers (of which I am one).

They had such a real friendship in the books. It was rocky and kind of shitty at times but they always stuck together, no matter how bad it got. And shoving a romance between them just seems to diminish that friendship. You can have a guy-best-friend without falling in love with him.

I hate the assumption that people have that a guy and girl can't just be friends.

But if someone doesn't start a fics with the assumption that Harry and Hermione are destined to be together and actually develops the relationship and gives them some romantic chemistry, I'd be happy to read that fic. I actively avoid Dramione fics (sucessfully, I've never read one), but if you don't announce the pairing (telling me the pairing ahead of time is a pet peeve unless the story is about the pairing) and successfully develop the relationship, I would probably be okay with it.

Or, that if a man and woman can have a strong friendship, it would naturally translate to a strong romantic relationship. When in fact one does not equal the other. The dynamics that make a strong platonic friendship are in many ways not related to what makes a strong romantic relationship.

Harry's friendship with Hermione, in my opinion, shows why they don't work in a relationship.

**** This is a good essay, /however/ this is [[/r/HPfanfiction]] and not [[/r/harrypotter]] :) Besides that I have some small problems:

If you change Hermione's (or Harry's!) personality very slightly, or simply his perception of her, you can make it quite work very well. You could make Harry be less annoyed by her (he doesn't need to like it, he just needs a way to deal with it without negative emotion), or make her a bit more mature in giving advice (For example in OOtP).

But the biggest part is that I don't see R/Hr working any /better/ than H/HR.

- Ron listens less to Hermione's advice
- He is even less studious than Harry
- He's rather rude, and she constantly tells him off, some quotes from PS:

#+begin_quote
  “Whatever House I'm in, I hope she's not in it,” said Ron.

  “And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?”\\
  Ron glared at her as she left.

  “It's no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she's a nightmare, honestly.”
#+end_quote

Even JKR herself says so, by the way:

#+begin_quote
  [R/Hr] was a choice I made for very personal reasons, not for reasons of credibility. [...]

  Oh, maybe she and Ron will be alright with a bit of counseling, you know.
#+end_quote

Wouldn't that work for HHR too? And about the DH she says:

#+begin_quote
  *In some ways Hermione and Harry are a better fit* and I'll tell you something very strange. When I wrote Hallows, I felt this quite strongly when I had Hermione and Harry together in the tent! I hadn't told [Steve] Kloves that and when he wrote the script he felt exactly the same thing at exactly the same point.
#+end_quote

And in OOtP clearly /likes/ (not love) Hermione:

#+begin_quote
  He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again ---\\
  And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for breath ---\\
  “EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
#+end_quote

Hermione is literally half of what powers his patronus. She is a big source of happiness for him. This essay doesn't even give her that much. For example:

#+begin_quote
  Harry's Fun Times are Not Associated With Hermione:
#+end_quote

Harry likes being around Hermione. Her face is combined with happiness, with fun times - else she wouldn't power his patronus, and patroni are definitly associated with genuine happiness in canon.

The thing that I'm trying to say... I don't see H/Hr any less happening than R/Hr, except that Ron finds her attractive, which is a rather arbitrary decision. The changes needed to make H/Hr work would be minimal. His best argument is

#+begin_quote
  Hermione is too rational and not tactful or intuitive enough to deal sensitively with Harry's dark moods.
#+end_quote

You could easily fix that without changing either character too much. Harry isn't defined by his dark moods and Hermione isn't defined by her insensitivity, in fact she has the understanding to be sensitive:

#+begin_quote
  “Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn't mean we all have,” said Hermione nastily [to Ron], picking up her quill again. “She was the one who started it,” said Harry. “I wouldn't've --- she just sort of came at me --- and next thing she's crying all over me --- I didn't know what to do ---”\\
  “Don't blame you, mate,” said Ron, looking alarmed at the very thought.\\
  “You just had to be nice to her,” said Hermione, looking up anxiously. “You were, weren't you?”
#+end_quote

She knows who and what Harry likes, especially later in the series:

#+begin_quote
  “Don't be silly,” said Hermione vaguely, “Harry's liked her for ages, haven't you, Harry?”\\
  He did not answer. Yes, he had liked Cho for ages.
#+end_quote

I have no doubt if she really tried she could work with Harry, she'd only need to change herself slightly - and not for the worse! Is she is capable of doing that? In my opinion: Yes, she is.

Edit: Damn, this got longer than I expected.

***** And without [[/r/HarryPotter]], there would be no [[/r/HPfanfiction]], just saying. ;)

But the thing is, it cannot be "very slight" changes. To get rid of the fundamental problems with the H/Hr ship, there would need to be significant changes to either Harry or Hermione. For example, if Harry had not grown up with the Dursleys, he would not have been so ruggedly individualistic, and would not have had so much disdain at authority. However, given Hermione's authoritarian personality in canon, they don't fit together based on this criterium. Ron, on the other hand, seems to like it.

Though, I do see where you are going with this. Even though I do ship them, I'm not the biggest fan of R/Hr either. But remember that the essay was written about why they wouldn't work together from Harry's perspective, not from Hermione's. I also feel that using scenes from the first book (before both H/Hr and R/Hr have even become friends!) to try and disprove R/Hr is misleading.

The Wonderland interview you are citing, on the other hand, is clearly talking about who is better from Hermione's perspective. That should be logical, given that JKR did the interview with Emma Watson. But note that she is talking about H/Hr in comparison to R/Hr, and not as a stand-alone ship, let alone with H/G. Therefore, in some ways, H/Hr is better than R/Hr. But this doesn't mean they should be together, because Harry is best with Ginny in all ways - and given from what we know from JKR's interviews, she does view H/G in a better light than R/Hr.

I feel like your example of Hermione powering Harry's patronus is flawed, because Ron's face was also present, meaning that this was simply about friendship. Also, there is a difference between being happy with someone as a friend, and you being romantically compatible with them. Harry is very happy with Hermione as a friend (which the author does acknowledge): "Harry loves and admires Hermione because she is smart, brave, talented, quick thinking, sensible, hard working, generous, and loyal." But they just wouldn't work out together as a couple.

She knows who Harry likes at the moment (in OotP), but she is also working behind the scenes to put Ginny and Harry together (which Ginny admits at the end of HBP). So it seems that Hermione does recognize that her and Harry would never work out.

That ended up being pretty long too :P

***** Something else I've noticed about the essay: It kinda expects them to immediately be in love from child age if they are supposed to be together. Sorta like the Ginny adoration that I explicitly hate about their relationship. There's a bunch of H/Hr fics that do this wrong too (in particular fics by Robst). Hermione /is/ annoying, especially in first year. I - as a grown up - think it's adorable, but if she's in your school year you're not going to fall in love with someone who annoys you about your homework all the time (especially at age 11) - and it's not a requirement in order for a relationship to develop later.

In my opinion a relationship between them before 5th year is kinda dumb and I think him going after someone like Cho first is also an important step in Harry's development. Such a trainwreck is the perfect opportunity to reconsider just going after the prettiest girl and wondering what you'd want out of a relationship... especially if your name is Harry Potter.

** Yep, Book Hermione felt like she was more obstacle rather than friend. I still can't get over the third year, and her telling McGonagall about the secret broom to get it striped down. It was a huge betrayal of trust, as it just sort of 'happened' without any warning. Then there was the fourth year, where she spent more time with Ron for no reason. But I always felt that the drama in Harry Potter was unnecessary, Harry should have understood his role by third or fourth year, realising that having friends was only a weakness that he couldn't count on. I would have enjoyed a character arc like that, because having all these moments of drama with Harry and a female protagonist, just shows even more that the author of the story is female, whilst we're supposed to be looking through Harry's eyes. As, Harry makes no mention to any of Hermione's 'developments' and JKR said that Hermione herself was canonically gorgeous (when she was talking about why Emma was perfect, she stated that "She was everything Hermione is, Beautiful, Smart, Clever...") It would be rather odd that a male like Harry wouldn't notice, even if they had a 'brother-sister' type relationship.

What's more important from Hermione's perspective? Being friends with Harry or saving his life? She's pretty ruthless here and it's interesting that this is acceptable to you when it is done by the Protagonist (as a stand-in for yourself possibly?), but not by anyone else.

Calling the whole thing a betrayal is really a stretch. I'm also going to take away a friends car keys if they insist they are sober but appear to be drunk - even if I could be wrong and they might be perfectly fit to drive.

Obviously saving his life is more important, but, she had no evidence that it was in fact cursed. She just assumed so, and acted on her instinct, and was proven wrong, all while causing hostility in their friendship. It's not a question of Harry can do it, why can't Hermione? It's a question of the different stakes. Harry's broom may or may not be cursed, it's unlikely to be capable of killing him as the Firebolt has tons of enchantments to prevent just that, so mid-flight, he may get thrown off, if that, he brakes an arm or maybe a leg. What do you think Lord Voldemort would do to Harry's best-friends? He obviously didn't want to take the chance for Ginny, a girl that he had just gotten in a relationship with a month ago. So let's say yes, his friends didn't want to leave, and he decided to keep them around. Wouldn't it be prudent to learn how to protect them? To prevent a situation like the one with the Snatchers from happening?

Is that in canon or did you just make that up? Anyway, I would expect a *sabotaged* broom wouldn't have those safety enchantments anymore, because that's the whole point. Also who cares about safety enchantments if there's just a triggered Bombarda attached to it or something. Safety enchantments aren't going to do shit if you're just pink mist.

Really? Someone out there is out to kill you and you randomly get a super expensive Broom in the mail. Who the fuck in their right mind would just sit on it and ride it? It is super fucking ovious that it should be checked by the best Wizards they can get before anyone rides it. I don't even understand why that's a point of contention. Ron and Harry are both incredibly stupid.

****** 1) As far as Harry knows, Voldemort isn't even in the country. The possibility of him having enough money to buy Harry one of the most expensive brooms, then having enough power in that wraith like state to break enchantments that were so high quality that they made the broom 10x as expensive as a Nimbus 2000 is extremely low. That's the reason the broom is exponentially more expensive than the Nimbus, did you think it was faster simply because of the wood it was made from?

2) Bombarda is a curse, there is no such thing as a triggered curse. I've yet to see any object curse someone, other than maybe Marvolo's ring and the necklace Draco wanted to give Dumbledore, but Marvolo's ring was alluded to have a ton of enchantments on it, and it was a piece of jewelry (which might be easier to curse, rather than an already enchanted broom).

Curses may or may not exist for that type of thing. We have the people called Curse-Breakers, but so far we haven't figured out the difference between a Dark Enchantment and a Curse that you can somehow place on the object through unknown means. But, like I said, it's highly unlikely that there is anyone in the Harry Potter world that at the time could have stripped the broom of enchantments, placed new bad enchantments on it, and somehow managed a flying charm matching the quality of a Professional Broom creator. We know that Sirius is relatively powerful at this point (Kills 13 Muggles, even though almost every wizard phrases as killing 13 people, so they think that Sirius is a much bigger threat than he is) but, Hermione could have easily done research and found diagnostic charms for those curses herself.

Not that there was anything on it to begin with.

But, he wouldn't have needed to get mad if she just covertly preformed diagnostics on the broom. If she found something (and something with enough magical presence to explode upon Harry sitting on it will definitely be detected) then she tells Harry and he gives it up to them himself.

It's an unnecessary conflict that didn't need to happen if she just had a tad more of her 'Brightest Witch of Her Age' mojo that she has whenever she crams in the library.

If he was an everyman hero, the Sorting Hat wouldn't have wanted to send him to Slytherin. It would have been instant Gryffindor.

Contrast that with, say, Hermione, who was always on the lookout for ways to fix the world, whether the world wants it or not: whether it's making sure that her peers all learn some Charm or other (whether or not they want her help) or freeing House-Elves (whether they want to be or not).

Snape could have cast it silently, if he wanted to. However, Snape was demonstrating the spell, and his demonstration was deemed by everyone --- including other students --- to have been adequate for them to pair off for practice.

Nor do we know that he didn't practice it off-screen --- since he wanted to learn it, he probably did.

On the other hand, recall his struggles with the Summoning Charm, where he was doing as badly as Neville. Other than the really emotion-driven stuff like the Patronus and the Unforgivables, magic does not come to Harry that much more easily than to his peers.

During his OWLs? He had spent the prior 5 years taking Transfiguration, the same as everyone else, with most classes and homework taking place off-screen. So, yes, he had practiced vanishing things a lot.

On the other hand, whenever a new spell or class of magic is introduced and we get to see Hermione's performance at all (i.e., not private lessons like Patronus or Occlumency, and not off-screen), she is invariably the first to master it: Transfiguration, nonverbal casting, Apparition, and there were probably others that I don't remember off the top of my head; and she casually picks up complex spells (Protean Charm, Memory Charm, False Memory Charm, Undetectable Extension Charm, DA Parchment Jinx, etc.) from books and executes them perfectly after no or limited practice like it was nothing.

She was researching Elf enslavement's history, not the subject itself. Saying you did something thoroughly and still not showing any proof just means that she didn't research the reasoning for their enslavement, just that it's happened for a while.

Self-confidence and hubris are two different things, she was too confident in her spell work, and that's why she got hit by Dolohov's curse.

Was referring to him standing up in the middle of class and defending himself to Umbridge. Odd and out of place, as Harry usually does the whole 'silent fury' type deal, but I guess with how much angst was in that book he was going to start casting accidental magic again.

Look, I have no idea what the debate is even about at this point, it's becoming one of those boring canon duels where the two opponents just constantly throw beam/jet spells against the others shield, it's honestly boring and uninteresting.

It's true DADA is a multidisciplinary class, but a lot of what DADA is about is also non-magical athleticism (i.e., hitting what you are aiming at) and general courage and nerve, like being able to face down a Boggart, as well as being able to think on one's feet. Also, I remember Taure making a pretty darned good case that Dark Arts spells (jinxes, hexes, and curses) are a class of magic of their own: despite being superficially similar to Charms, they actually have more in common with Transfiguration, since they are hard to reverse; and countering them all but requires being able to cast them. Point being, being great at DADA requires being decent at general magic, plus a few other traits. Nobody is claiming that Harry isn't a competent wizard, but next coming of Dumbledore, or even Lily, he ain't.

#+begin_quote
  I don't recall Hermione mastering Transfiguration Spells as fast later in the years, nor Charms, she may get somethings right the first time but not everything.
#+end_quote

Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence in this case. Most of the time, Harry isn't paying attention to what Hermione is doing in class.

#+begin_quote
  DA Parchment was kept from the entirety of the DA for a reason.

  She was researching Elf enslavement's history, not the subject itself. Saying you did something thoroughly and still not showing any proof just means that she didn't research the reasoning for their enslavement, just that it's happened for a while.
#+end_quote

You don't now that; but given her character, she is nothing if not thorough.

#+begin_quote
  Self-confidence and hubris are two different things, she was too confident in her spell work, and that's why she got hit by Dolohov's curse.
#+end_quote

Or unlucky. They were kids fighting experienced adults, and --- if you look at that fight scene --- Hermione was the only one targeted with lethal spells. (Perhaps coincidentally, perhaps not, the other kids were either purebloods or Harry, whom Voldemort wanted for himself; funny how that worked out.)

#+begin_quote
  Was referring to him standing up in the middle of class and defending himself to Umbridge. Odd and out of place, as Harry usually does the whole 'silent fury' type deal, but I guess with how much angst was in that book he was going to start casting accidental magic again.
#+end_quote

I see what you mean, though it felt reasonable to me at the time. Harry was angry, and Umbridge went out of her way to provoke him. Also, while Harry isn't eager to speechify, nor is he particularly shy expressing his opinions. Ultimately, Harry is a lot of things, but he isn't subtle. Playing a long game of some sort is not his style. (If you want a recognizable Harry who is, I strongly recommend linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira.mirth).)

#+begin_quote
  Look, I have no idea what the debate is even about at this point, it's becoming one of those boring canon duels where the two opponents just constantly throw beam/jet spells against the others shield, it's honestly boring and uninteresting. Hermione is a good wizard, but most of her strength comes from her understanding and extensive research of theory, Harry's comes from his natural talent when Rowling deems to show it. It's really that simple.
#+end_quote

I will happily remind you: you made a bunch of assertions about how Harry coulda-woulda-shoulda been more like Voldemort in his relationship dynamics and not had friends and had instead gotten Special Training in Special Powerful Light Magic from Dumbledore, which, in my opinion, completely misses the point of the books.

I pointed out (albeit sarcastically) relied on an assumption of Harry having some sort of an undeveloped general uber-talent in magic that Powerful!Harry mavens like yourself really like to believe, as opposed to his canon talents of being an amazingly talented athlete (youngest Seeker in a century, killed a giant basilisk with a sword having never wielded one before), with more courage and nerve than any three other Gryffindors combined, and a significantly above average, but not outstanding, talent for most magic, along with an extraordinary capacity for emotions to fuel his Patronus and an occasional Unforgivable, while arguably crippling his Occlumency against attackers who aren't Voldemort. When challenged, you defended your assumption with a very selective ant tenuous reading of canon, relevant parts of which you barely remembered.

At some point during that, I pointed out that Hermione might have been a better candidate for Special Training, which led you to start denigrating Hermione and me to start defending her, getting us even more side-tracked.

I would recommend a reread of canon books; but if you'd rather just persist in your beliefs, I recommend a swing or two of a dead cat on FF.net to find yet another Powerful!Gray!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore, Useless!Shrew!Hermione, Pathetic!Traitor!Ron, Amortentia!Molly, etc. masterpiece to read.

  Manipulative!Dumbledore
#+end_quote

Is one of the most boring things to read, and it's pointless. I would much rather have a Dumbledore that is there to help Harry out and train him up. Last paragraph is a strawman in its entirety.

#+begin_quote
  So you're saying that most DA members did master it, even if not all of them could perform it at all times? Sounds like we're not really disagreeing.
#+end_quote

No, I'm saying that none of them mastered it as they couldn't do it faced with a Dementor. During the Battle of Hogwarts Shamus and the other two weren't in range of the Dementors, thus using the patronus in safety. Harry is the only one who attended DA that actually mastered it, and he is the teacher.

#+begin_quote
  And Harry doesn't? He constantly complains about all the time he has to spend studying, and all those essays he has to write for Transfiguration and Charms; what are those about if not theory of magic? I think that you are denigrating all the hard work Harry puts into his studies, however reluctantly.
#+end_quote

Essays can be done on topics you don't understand by simply rephrasing the material in a different way. Harry didn't get absolutely perfect scores on his essays (as he never mentioned it) so we are left to assume that he was mediocre or maybe even clueless at theory-related things.

#+begin_quote
  Then why are you making arguments based on a specific action in a specific scene in it?
#+end_quote

Because it was memorable, and it wasn't specific.

#+begin_quote
  Either he or Lockhart had; and Harry hadn't actually cast it in that scene.
#+end_quote

Exactly, Harry hadn't cast the Disarming Charm ever, until the scene with Lockhart in the Chamber's entry way.

#+begin_quote
  Now you're just making excuses. His other magic was unaffected, as far as I can recall.
#+end_quote

I mean, he didn't use it much until the third task. When he was already in the clear and most people didn't care if he put his name in or not.

#+begin_quote

The spell that bound them to not reveal any information about the DA was on the DA parchment.

Well, that's because he does. Pretty much the entire story we've heard about his 'potential', his 'ability', even Hermione has admitted that he is better than her in some aspects of magic. Sure, she can learn transfiguration faster, but Harry is the only one who would use it effectively in a battle (hence why we never see Hermione use it other than to conjure tiny birds to attack Ron).

#+begin_quote
  Very selective
#+end_quote

Sorry if JKR couldn't help but go on the Love>Magical Power train everytime it mattered. If Harry is the type of person to not take things sitting down, as you say. Why didn't he train himself up for Voldemort? Why didn't he ask Dumbledore directly for extra magical training? Especially since after his fourth year, all of Dumbledore's political duties were relieved, thus giving him free-time (that's why we got the Memory training that could have taken one day but instead took several weeks).

  Relationship Dynamics
#+end_quote

Kek, Voldemort relied on people more than canon Harry did. But, as I said, Harry could look for people to support him that aren't two people his own age. We have a large pool of highly trained wizards with life experience to choose from, you wan't a guy that can teach Harry how to transform into an animal? A useful ability that could have probably gotten him and his friends away from danger multiple times? Well Sirius Black is your guy. Want a highly-trained Auror who has more experience with taking out Dark Wizards than Mr. I took out Grindelwald? We've got Alistor Moody, a retired Auror with nothing better to do than throw spells out in the dark of night.

I don't think that's fair to Harry. He spends a lot of time on his homework, and he is plenty bright --- definitely significantly above average in general intelligence. He certainly doesn't understand magical theory as well as Hermione, but he probably understands it better than the average Hogwarts student (especially since Hermione looks over his essays --- or is that fanon?).

#+begin_quote
  Well, that's because he does. Pretty much the entire story we've heard about his 'potential', his 'ability',
#+end_quote

The word "potential" appears in the canon books 8 times, none of them referring to Harry's potential. "Ability" appears a total of 22 times. When it referrs to Harry, it refers to Parselmouth ability (3), his Potions skills due to cheating from Snape's book (2), to love (1), and ability to sense Voldemort through his scar (1).

People are grateful to him and might expect great things from him for being BWL, and people admire his Patronus, which is a significant achievement, but probably not that significant: the reason so few adults can do it is that most adults don't take NEWTs in DADA, where it's taught; and the reason it's taught at the NEWT level is that unless you know Dumbledore's communication trick or expect to coral Dementors, it's completely useless.

#+begin_quote
  even Hermione has admitted that he is better than her in some aspects of magic.
#+end_quote

Seems accurate. Harry is better at practical DADA, flying, and Divination; Hermione at everything else.

#+begin_quote
  Sorry if JKR couldn't help but go on the Love>Magical Power train everytime it mattered.
#+end_quote

That's because it mattered. Magic is not morally neutral. In any case, by "selective", I mean cherry-picking instances of Harry's overachievement --- either real or misremembered --- and ignoring instances where he shows his limitations.

#+begin_quote
  If Harry is the type of person to not take things sitting down, as you say. Why didn't he train himself up for Voldemort? Why didn't he ask Dumbledore directly for extra magical training? Especially since after his fourth year, all of Dumbledore's political duties were relieved, thus giving him free-time (that's why we got the Memory training that could have taken one day but instead took several weeks).
#+end_quote

It's not about the will, it's about the disposition. Harry doesn't plan for the long term like that. That said, I would argue that this behavior was actually rational under the circumstances. In a nutshell, Tom Riddle was the more talented wizard by far, and he had several decades' head start and the more ruthless disposition. There was no way Harry could be "trained up" in four or even seven years to face him in a pitched battle and win. Training in the Power That Voldemort Knows Better Than Anyone would therefore not have been productive, but it would have detracted from things that Harry actually wanted to do: hanging out with Ron, being mothered by Molly, playing Quiddich, dating --- all things that cultivated the Power That Voldemort Knows Not (not to mention all the combat-relevant skills developed in Quiddich).

More generally, Harry finds his existing coursework plenty challenging, so extra training seems superfluous. Like I wrote, training up Hermione to watch Harry's back would probably be more productive, but probably not worth Dumbledore's time either.

#+begin_quote
  Kek, Voldemort relied on people more than canon Harry did.
#+end_quote

Voldemort had numerous minions. Harry had a small number of loyal friends. There's a difference.

#+begin_quote
  But, as I said, Harry could look for people to support him that aren't two people his own age. We have a large pool of highly trained wizards with life experience to choose from,
#+end_quote

Well, most of these people, if they were to spend too much time in Hogwarts, would raise eyebrows. Since most important (to Harry) stuff that's even remotely predictable happens in Hogwarts, adults might not be the most practical support team.

For that matter, I think that you're underestimating just how short-staffed the Order is.

#+begin_quote
  you wan't a guy that can teach Harry how to transform into an animal? A useful ability that could have probably gotten him and his friends away from danger multiple times? Well Sirius Black is your guy.
#+end_quote

Unless all three of them lucked out with small, stealthy, or flight-capable forms, it's not nearly as useful as it sounds. Now that we've learned what that entails, I can see why Harry & Co. didn't go for it. It's tedious, time-consuming, risks permanent deformation, and with Harry's family history and Patronus, he'd probably get a stag, which is only slightly less useless than a kangaroo. (He can run a little faster, but he is a bigger target.)

#+begin_quote
  There was no way Harry could be "trained up" in four or even seven years to face him in a pitched battle and win.
#+end_quote

What do you think training Harry entails? I doubt it would take more than even three years to get him there. How many years do you think Voldemort had to train in his 'Ancient Magic' before the war started. From ages 1-10 he was simply using controlled accidental magic against children, while impressive, accidental magic have never accounted for power. Ages 11-18 he was in Hogwarts, attempting to ground himself in the Dark Magic that was already there. Aside from the Horcrux, we don't know what he studied, but it wasn't anything too big if he thought he needed to continue his education the full seven-years to be a competent wizard. We know that for a good 2-3 years Voldemort was in Knockturn Alley selling and buying artifacts of great historical importance, he may have picked up a couple good spellbooks on certain curses, but no comprehensive Dark Magic training, unless he had an unknown mentor.

It was only when he went under; then we can assume he began his journey into the dark, and he was already twenty-one. Aside from his boasting of pushing magic farther than it's been pushed, we don't see much from him. We see a transfigured serpent made of fire that Dumbledore already made, we see him use the killing curse, conjured a silver portable shield (likely actually made of silver, breaking a rule of magic about transfiguration in the process) and used several other unremarkable spells. His greatest feat in the book was unassisted flying, and that is more of a vulnerability in combat than a strength.

Numerous minions that he knew by name and personally exchanged with. Voldemort definitely had friends, maybe even people he cared about, his search for immortality was just a little stronger, he constantly reminded himself that only he could be immortal, and attachment was pointless, despite already being attached.

#+begin_quote

Last I checked, Duelling was a one on one thing. Harry showed no remote interest in it, even when it was helpful to him, yet he apparently liked sports.

Edit: Concerning the Transfiguration thing. In that context I was saying that if Harry was to put a bit more stock into Transfiguration, instead of seeing it as a hurdle for OWLs, he would have relied on it a bit more in combat. He is shown to learn and utilize magic in a short span of time when needed (The ever-mentioned Patronus Charm, several spells during Tri-Wizard, Multiple Spells before he left Privet Drive for the battle of the seven Potters, Crucio even when he was incapable of certain requirements, could even cast the Killing Curse at Bellatrix at the time if what Voldemort was saying was true). Sadly, he became unconcerned with magic itself despite showing great interest right before getting on the train, to the point where his first magical class (Transfiguration) wasn't even given that much prevalence in his mind.

On a side note, is there a reason why he didn't consider the Sword of Gryffindor for the first task? It's a versatile weapon, shown to be capable of taking out serpentine creatures much like a Dragon, unintentionally impregnates itself with whatever it touches. If Harry stabbed through the roof of the Dragon's mouth, the sword would start spewing out fire. Sounds awesome. I understand he doesn't know about the impregnates thing, but it would still be cool to see him mirror his first actual battle in the second book with the book correlating directly with it in terms of even numbers.

  Forgetting Order of The Phoenix are we?
#+end_quote

The point is that if Seamus doesn't count, then neither does Harry in his third year --- he doesn't cast it in the face of a Dementor until his fifth.

In any case, given experiences of characters who'd been in both situations, what separates being able to cast in ideal circumstances from being able to cast against a Dementor is not degree of magical talent or skill but rather non-magical personality traits like courage, nerve, and a certain kind of stubbornness.

#+begin_quote
  But you later say that he doesn't have the mental strength to think ahead? You should probably choose one, it's getting a bit out of composition.
#+end_quote

Oh, Harry does his week-to-week homework certainly --- with some reluctance and procrastination --- and he also does extra studying when he has an immediate magical need (Dementors -> Patronus, TWT -> DADA). What I don't see him doing is any sort of long-term plan for independent study.

#+begin_quote
  He had yet to try the spell after demonstration.
#+end_quote

And your point? He had seen the spell demonstrated, and that was deemed adequate for everybody present to start practicing, so it's not an unusual feat that he was able to do it after the demonstration.

#+begin_quote
  Page number?
#+end_quote

It's p. 355 in the ePub edition I have.

#+begin_quote
  Out of context. You said that he was capable of casting different spells with no hindrance to magical ability due to his sporadic emotional state, yet it took him much longer to learn the summoning charm because of his emotional state.
#+end_quote

In that case, I don't understand why you brought up the whole Third Task matter. My understanding of your argument is that his difficulties with learning the Summoning Charm were not evidence for his lack of genius but rather explained away by his being discombobulated due to TWT; however, if that were the case, his existing magical abilities would have been affected as well, there might have been outbursts of accidental magic, and other evidence of that, and yet there weren't that I can recall. Am I forgetting anything? Was Harry fumbling other spells at the time?

#+begin_quote
  Is the Patronus not a spirit gurdian that uses its light to repel a Dementor? It's powerful light-based magic, I see nothing wrong with calling it light.

#+end_quote

To the point of facing Voldemort in a pitched battle and winning without some Deux Ex Machina like Brother Wands or Sacrificial Protection? I'm the one who thinks it's not possible. You're the one advocating for it. You tell me.

#+begin_quote
  I doubt it would take more than even three years to get him there. How many years do you think Voldemort had to train in his 'Ancient Magic' before the war started.
#+end_quote

If we go by the Wikia, the fighting started around 1970, so Voldemort was 44. He had made his first horcruxes while still at Hogwarts. Quite a few years, in short.

#+begin_quote
  he may have picked up a couple good spellbooks on certain curses, but no comprehensive Dark Magic training, unless he had an unknown mentor.
#+end_quote

Dark Arts books are available in Hogwarts library. Hocrux books were there too, until Dumbledore removed them. Riddle was also a popular, charismatic student, who lived in a house known for producing Dark Wizards and charmed all his teachers but one besides. For that matter, how much training would he need? Given what happened with Secumstempa, I suspect that Dark Arts are dangerous because they are /too easy/.

#+begin_quote
  We see a transfigured serpent made of fire that Dumbledore already made
#+end_quote

He fought Dumbledore to a standstill. What more do you want?

#+begin_quote
  His greatest feat in the book was unassisted flying, and that is more of a vulnerability in combat than a strength.
#+end_quote

Not necessarily. For all their versatility, wands have crappy ergonomics for aiming and slow rate of fire (even with nonverbal casting, which IIRC weakens the spell), so their effective range is pretty bad. Now, a target in the air requires a direct hit to count, while there are spells that can harm a target on the ground upon a near miss through fire or debris. So, that's a tactical advantage right there.

#+begin_quote
  Numerous minions that he knew by name and personally exchanged with. Voldemort definitely had friends, maybe even people he cared about, his search for immortality was just a little stronger, he constantly reminded himself that only he could be immortal, and attachment was pointless, despite already being attached.
#+end_quote

Tom Riddle had people who considered him a friend and thought they were his friends. However, all evidence points towards him being a classic psychopath, viewing people as tools at best and obstacles at worst. By the time he returned from death, only a handful remained who still remembered him from Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  Sirius, Remus, and James did it in two years, and they were third years (when they started), and hiding from professors the whole entire time. A Harry assisted by a full-grown Sirius would be easily able to get it down in the same span, or maybe less.
#+end_quote

Read the Pottermore stuff on the procedure. The most amazing thing about their feat is not that they pulled it off but that they pulled it off without anybody else noticing.

#+begin_quote
  More evidence points to Phoenix, Griffin, or Lion.
#+end_quote

Fair enough about the Patronus, but a /phoenix/, really? Can animagi even be magical creatures? And, a lion isn't that much more useful than a stag: a bit better CQC attack, but an even bigger target and worse endurance. In fact, while a stag can hide in a forest in England (outside of hunting season), a lion would stand out.

Of the Marauders, Pettigrew got the hands-down most useful form.

All that said, given his love of Quiddich, I think that if not a stag, Harry had a pretty good shot at a bird form, which would have been useful indeed, so maybe he should have tried it.

#+begin_quote
  It was shown that students can have tutoring on the side (Occlumency lessons disguised as Potions). How hard is it to sneak Moody in with Dumbledore's assistance?
#+end_quote

Perhaps it could be done, at the cost of things that made Harry's life worth living. I still don't buy that Harry would benefit from it. His classes are sufficiently challenging for him, as far as I can tell. DADA is an exception, of course, but since extra training is not going to significantly change his odds against Voldemort, I don't see the point of extra tutoring in that.

#+begin_quote
  Last I checked, Duelling was a one on one thing. Harry showed no remote interest in it, even when it was helpful to him, yet he apparently liked sports.
#+end_quote

Harry liked Quiddich; the flying in particular, as well as being admired for something he did on his own merits, rather than something that killed his parents. Giving him Extra Training would detract from that.

#+begin_quote
  Edit: Concerning the Transfiguration thing. In that context I was saying that if Harry was to put a bit more stock into Transfiguration, instead of seeing it as a hurdle for OWLs, he would have relied on it a bit more in combat.
#+end_quote

So it's a hypothetical that we can't resolve either way, so not evidence of anything. What we see in canon suggests that other than some specific spells (Serpensortia), combat Transfiguration is only useful if one has other reasons to master Transfiguration.

#+begin_quote
  He is shown to learn and utilize magic in a short span of time when needed
#+end_quote

Learning the magic of the Patronus took months, as did TWT magic. (Google for a timeline of PoA if you want to verify.) Dark Arts he seems to have some talent for, probably best not developed.

In any case, Harry's advantage is less that he can learn lots of powerful magic quickly and more that he is a highly talented athlete with excellent reflexes, good at keeping his head when under pressure and can generally pick the right spell to use in the situation. I would contend that this is less about magical talents and more about non-magical ones.

However, this sort of talent can only take one so far against a more skilled opponent like Snape, to say nothing of Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Sadly, he became unconcerned with magic itself despite showing great interest right before getting on the train,
#+end_quote

That's not really unusual: what is extraordinary becomes mundane very quickly. For a worldly example, consider how amazing is, say, a smartphone from the point of view of someone from even 30 years ago. Yet, how many people, upon getting one, become preoccupied with learning how to program apps on one, much less learn how one works?

#+begin_quote
  On a side note, is there a reason why he didn't consider the Sword of Gryffindor for the first task?

#+end_quote

It kind of does. On the other hand, with SoG after CoS, there's no middle ground: he'd either kill the dragon with basilisk poison or fail the task. I think it's better that he won without killing the dragon.

#+end_quote

He wasn't using any other magic until the third task, is what I was pointing out. The Summoning Charm was either an inconsistency, or Harry's emotional status messing with his spells, as I assume focus is the most necessary thing to learning a spell. Accidental Magic seems like something that only happens to children, even Harry during POA using it was rather odd for everybody. Personally I think it was a bit of Rowling trying to show us how powerful Harry is, as she seems to use accidental magic like an ace, showing that that's all that's needed to scan for a powerful wizard.

I always thought that Dark Magic was easy to learn, hard to master. Hence why Harry couldn't cut through Draco completely, or why his Crucio came out like a Crucio but didn't last as long. This is further proven when Crabbe used Fiendfyre and didn't know how to stop it.

#+end_quote

It's putting a mandrake leaf in your mouth for a month, then using that leaf for a potion while saying an incantation and drinking it everyday. While the process seems a bit tough, I doubt it's impossible, especially for someone like Harry who when motivated continues to try and try even if he doesn't always get it. While you may deny the fact that he learned the Patronus Charm in relative haste, you can't deny that he didn't continue trying and trying until he got it right.

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote
  Learning the magic of the Patronus took months

The lessons with Lupin were sporadic, and he didn't always have powerful memories for the Patronus itself. He didn't practice it every day of every month, it was more like every two weeks for a single day.

#+begin_quote
  TWT magic
#+end_quote

Tri-Wizard Tournament Magic? I mean, he still learned The Summoning Charm in one night of cramming with Hermione. He learned Point Me! from Hermione simply telling him the incantation. Reducto and all the other spells were likely learned in passing.

#+begin_quote
  So it's a hypothetical that we can't resolve either way, so not evidence of anything. What we see in canon suggests that other than some specific spells (Serpensortia), combat Transfiguration is only useful if one has other reasons to master Transfiguration.
#+end_quote

It'd be easier to see Transfiguration as 6 spells with single incantations followed by the latin name for the thing you're transfiguring the object into/conjuring/animating. Switching would be a matter of a single incantation without any name after it. Untransfiguring would be easy as well. Vanishing was supposed to be hard for Harry, but once again, that could be because of his emotional state during fifth year (Voldemort fucking with him and all). So then Serpensortia was a Hex or Jinx of some kind, if we use my idea of shooting something out being easier than controlling it for Darker Magic, then the situation with Malfoy and the Snake makes perfect sense. Regular Transfiguration is hard, because it requires a lot of effort, patience, imagination, understanding of the subject, and natural born skill. James Potter was supposed to be very good at the subject; from what we see of Teddy Lupin, parents can hand-down their abilities to children, so in turn there is a case to be made for a Transfiguration!Master Harry.

Due to Harry's reactive nature in the books, it was more of a question of who would tell him that Transfiguration is a useful magic? The answer is no one to put it simply. I guess it would have caused unnecessary issues with Hermione (remember how she reacted after Harry increased his skill in potions?) so Rowling just put a stop to them, someone might go thinking that they were the better paring or something, we can't have that.

#+begin_quote
  talented athlete with excellent reflexes
#+end_quote

That's exactly why Duelling would have done well for him, dodging spells would improve your reflexes far better than catching a snitch. And that is exactly why training him would have been vital. If you were to train Hermione, she would be a Voldemort-like Duellist, maybe even a bit worse. She would sit still and allow things to come to her, she would have to use shields instead of dodging, and she would apparate to gain advantage across the battle-field. Hermione would be instantaneously killed by a person like Voldemort, who had perfected that style of Duelling.

#+begin_quote

Harry was beaten by Snape due to his reliance on spoken incantation, and the fact that he was in an emotional rut.

How do you go from the notion that some qualified (i.e., adequate, not necessarily great) wizards /can/ struggle with it (which, given its emotional and moralistic nature, can be for reasons other than skill), to it being an indicator of some great talent?

Nor did you address the point that what differentiates someone who can cast the Patronus under ideal circumstances and someone who can cast it at a dementor is indicative of non-magical personality traits, rather than magical skill. (Recall that dementors drain the very emotions needed to cast a Patronus.)

#+begin_quote

We actually have no idea how much uncontrolled Accidental Magic is typical. What we do know is that it comes out in response to danger and stress first and foremost: there's a reason Neville's uncle hung him out of a window trying to elicit it and it came out when he accidentally dropped him. Harry had a very stressful childhood, so lots of Accidental magic is to be expected.

JKR uses /controlled and conscious/ accidental magic to indicate talent; that Lily with what appears to be fairly low-stress childhood was able to do it is genuinely impressive, and similarly with Tom. Harry never had conscious control.

*Harry:* /[transforms into lion]/ Roar!

*Moderately Competent Opponent:* /STUPEFY!/

*Harry:* /[can't shield and is a big target, so is knocked out]/

#+begin_quote
  The lessons with Lupin were sporadic,... He didn't practice it every day of every month, it was more like every two weeks for a single day.
#+end_quote

I'm pretty certain that Patronus lessons in DA were shorter and much fewer in number, with the students being only a year or two older than Harry was at the time, and at least two managing a corporeal Patronus, with others managing it later.

Even if I'm wrong about it being taught at NEWT level --- which is plausible, since it's nearly useless if you don't expect to have to deal with dementors and don't know Dumbledore's messenger trick --- it's clearly still not as difficult as people make it out to be. For that matter, an interesting headcanon (from linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconcilliation)) is that the Patronus's obscurity is Ministry deliberately keeping the populace helpless against their terror weapon of choice.

#+begin_quote
  Tri-Wizard Tournament Magic? I mean, he still learned The Summoning Charm in one night of cramming with Hermione.
#+end_quote

That was after several classroom lessons, extra essays assigned by Flitwick to him and Neville, extra library research with Hermione, and that's just what I can recall off the top of my head. That one night was a culmination of all his efforts up to that point.

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote
  Reducto and all the other spells were likely learned in passing.
#+end_quote

Not in passing. In lots of practice with Ron and Hermione during lunches leading up to the Third Task. Hermione and Ron probably learned them as well.

#+end_quote

You can make a case for pretty much any ability for any character. That doesn't mean it would be a good case. You can make a better case for TransfigurationMaster!Draco, since he actually performed an advanced-looking Conjuration in his second year, as opposed to arguing from hereditary talent. You can make a case for Powerful!Ron: when others were lifting feathers, he was lifting a troll's club, and with a hand-me-down wand at that; and in his second year, he had a /broken/ wand, and he still passed all his classes, clearly indicating a talent for wandless magic. I've seen a fic that made a case for Powerful!Neville: he was so powerful that he couldn't control his magic, causing mishaps, and, also, his magic interfered with Potions he was brewing.

#+begin_quote
  Due to Harry's reactive nature in the books, it was more of a question of who would tell him that Transfiguration is a useful magic? The answer is no one to put it simply.
#+end_quote

Transfiguration is a useful magic, Harry could see it with his own two eyes, and he studied it along with everyone else, putting in his share of effort --- perhaps more, due to pressure from Hermione --- and earned a good enough grade to take the NEWT class. From what we saw, it came to him more easily than to Ron (though he had a hand-me-down wand at the time) but not as easily as it came to Hermione. Hardly an indication of prodigious talent.

Now, a fic with TransfigurationMistress!Hermione would be interesting --- more canon support for it, and she and McGonagall would have an interesting dynamic.

#+begin_quote
  (remember how she reacted after Harry increased his skill in potions?)
#+end_quote

At least some of that was due to the fact that Harry was cheating from a book of unknown provenance. And, she was right: it was sheer luck that it was Secumstempa that was underdocumented and not one of the potions improvements. Say, had Snape modified an ingredient to speed up brewing but then forgotten to write down that a moderator of some sort is required to keep the potion from exploding (because that step was obvious to him), people could have gotten hurt.

#+begin_quote
  That's exactly why Duelling would have done well for him, dodging spells would improve your reflexes far better than catching a snitch.
#+end_quote

But, would he be able and willing to invest as much time into it? Would it cultivate the same important sentiments, relationships, and allies?

#+begin_quote
  And that is exactly why training him would have been vital.
#+end_quote

From what little we see of how evenly matched skilled adults (e.g., Molly and Bellatrix) duel, the jumpy style of Harry makes more sense for adolescents. Once better shields, nonverbal casting (increasing the rate of fire), and more powerful attack spells become available, duels that don't end in an ambush actually become more about a rapid-fire exchange of spells.

I don't see athleticism giving a meaningful advantage against someone on Voldemort's tier; you'll have to be more specific about what tactics AgileDuelist!Harry might use against Voldemort that Voldemort couldn't easily counter.

#+begin_quote
  If you were to train Hermione, ... would be instantaneously killed by a person like Voldemort, who had perfected that style of Duelling.
#+end_quote

That's probably accurate. To counter an epic-tier wizard like Voldemort, you need either another epic-tier wizard like Dumbledore or epic-tier magic like Sacrificial Protection. None of the Trio have the potential to be epic-tier in their teens, and possibly not ever.

#+begin_quote
  Harry was beaten by Snape due to his reliance on spoken incantation, and the fact that he was in an emotional rut.
#+end_quote

Spoken incantation, lack of Occlumency, and general lack of skill and experience. Harry doesn't do great against Rowle and Dolohov either. In general, Harry does not win many pitched battles against skilled adults. I kind of wish the Seven Potters plan had Harry on a broom. /That/ would have been his moment to shine.

#+begin_quote
  But a day after you get into the magical world fully? Is that how long it takes to get bored of an infinite force that can do whatever you want, provided you have the ability?
#+end_quote

Not bored. Reminded that actually doing it is /schoolwork/ --- a lot of hard and tedious work that often doesn't have an obvious purpose, and when it does, that purpose is months, perhaps years away. All that, just as he's finally made a friend who's fun to hang out with, and learned about all the new toys and confectioneries and games that magic makes possible.

Not /the/ youngest; one of the youngest, technically. And, you yourself argued that it doesn't really count if the dementor can't see you (since you argued that Seamus doesn't count), which means that the one that does count is the start of OotP, when there were only a handful of Dementors to boot. (Personally, I think it counts whether or not there's a dementor nearby, since the magical skill involved in casting the spell is the same; the rest is courage, nerve, distractability, etc.; but that would mean that learning it at 13 as opposed to 16 in DA is no big deal, so it's not indicative of any great magical talent.)

Well, we seem to be debating about whether or not Harry was a talented enough wizard to be able to fight Voldemort (a confirmed prodigy) on even terms while still in his teens, whether his accidental magic indicates that he is very powerful at the start of the story, etc..

With 20-20 hindsight, we know that Snape's Potions instructions were good. Neither Harry nor Hermione had any way of knowing that /at the time she made her argument/. You can't judge a character (or a person) for not taking into account information he or she didn't have and couldn't have obtained without nontrivial risk and expense (i.e., actually brewing the Potions). On the other hand, you /can/ judge a character for recklessness when they make a decision not having considered the limitations of their knowledge --- such as Harry with the HBP book or Hermione with SPEW.

I thought that you meant that Harry's athletic talents could facilitate a combat style that could beat Voldemort while requiring less magical skill than what's needed to match Voldemort spell-for-spell. If you're advocating Dumbledore's style, Harry's not going to be able to manage that in his teens, no matter how hard you train him in Duelling and Transfiguration: it would require him to be a /more/ talented wizard than Voldemort and Dumbledore, since both of them had decades' headstart. And, Dumbledore's style requires a phoenix.

I don't think there's any point speculating what fighting style Hermione might develop if she focused on learning to fight, because none of the Trio could be "trained up" to beat Voldemort in a pitched battle while in their teens in the first place. Training up Hermione to watch Harry's back would be more about protecting him from more ordinary threats, while Prophecy / Sacrificial Protection / Brother Wands / Wandlore stuff facilitated Harry defeating Voldemort himself.

********************** 1) Harry wasn't in his teens at the end of Deathly Hallows, since he was at the age of majority and capable of drinking alcohol, it can be assumed that he is an adult on all counts.

2) Dumbledore's style doesn't require a Phoenix, it's just a lot easier to keep up with the all-out attack, rather than stopping to apparate out of the way of a killing curse. You could easily mimic it with a Phoenix Animagus.

3) The easiest way to become more than those two wizards is by training under one of them. Once again, Dumbledore is the answer. He taught McGonagall how to attain her Animagus, and taught her Transfiguration when he was a Professor.

Had he been in his prime, I believe that he would have overwhelmed Voldemort. Elder Wand or not, it was his old body that acted as an Achilles Heel.

So we have to ask this who could take the place of a younger Dumbledore? To me, all of it points to Harry Potter. Sure Dumbledore could go out and train an Auror Cadet with already all the basic knowledge, since they have the full seven years of Hogwarts under their belt, plus Auror Training. But in the end it comes down to Harry, just Harry he understands that the Prophecy is self-fulfilling, and that attempting to circumvent it by training someone else, would only result in a very dead Harry and a very gone Wizarding World.

Lets look at what Training may entail, since you believe that it is this miraculous sixty year feat. Duelling, Elemental Magic, Transfiguration, DADA, Dark Arts (maybe), Occlumency.

Duelling is easy, it's just forms and learning how to read your opponent, looking for blind sides. A good example of this is the Duel in the Artrium, as that is the only elaborated upon Duel in the book.

Elemental Magic is a hard subject in truth, but I'm sure it's nothing that Harry can't handle. Judging by Harry's later life in Cursed Child, we can assume he has an affinity for fire magic.

Transfiguration is Dumbledore's forte, it isn't even a question that he could help Harry master it.

DADA is Harry's forte, once again, no question.

The Dark Arts themselves are a bit of an odd spot for Dumbledore, maybe he would teach Harry a few general spells? But they would definitely not delve into Necromancy or anything like that, as there simply isn't enough time, although Time-Turner Training wouldn't be impossible.

Dumbledore already confirmed that he could have taught Harry Occlumency in fifth year, and likely helped Harry a lot better, had it not been for his lack of knowledge of Harry's connection with Voldemort. If he spent more time with Harry, we can assume that he would understand the best solution for Voldemort constantly pervading Harry's thoughts.

4) What are the better points you made, now that you brought it up? You can say that you made them but so far I don't see any.

If you're referring to the Snape points: if a potion could explode or some special limiter Snape made specifically for that potion was there, he would have put it in regardless, there is no reasoning for it not to be there. Once again, you use lack of knowledge in supply for knowledge, Snape wrote all of it down as a sixth year, if he didn't learn about special limiters, what makes you think Harry did? They have the same teacher after all (Horace Slughorn). And even in the unlikely chance that he didn't write down some kind of obvious instruction, clearly it was clear enough for Harry, as he got by just fine with Sectumsempra-For Enemies and nothing else.

If you're referring to any of the Hermione points: I believe it was Hitler himself who referred to people that solely relied on Memory for intelligence as being walking dictionaries without true genius (or would you prefer Albert Einstein? "Any fool can know, but it takes a true genius to understand"). Sure she could repeat all of her material, but she couldn't innovate, the Advanced Potion Making book itself was written for people with enough expertise in Potions to be able to innovate in the subject and understand how to subtly edit it. I doubt that it's cheating if you use an Expert's notes, that's just studying, which, as you put, is not cheating.

#+begin_quote

How is that extensively studying a subject though? He was taught the subject, he did homework on it, but to say that he began buying extra-circular books to study with is untrue. Look at how far he delved into defense, he got curses and counter curses, several other unnamed books that he alluded to (how else did he learn several blasting curses, confringo, etc... in the span of two months between Dumbledore's funeral and Chapter 2 of DH?)

He didn't sign up for Transfiguration Today, he didn't read any extra books on the properties of Elemental Transfiguration, it can be assumed that he didn't thoroughly study the subject then.

It was a good-faith question. Your last post included things like suddenly getting basic English words wrong and a gross social misjudgment like expecting that quoting Hitler in defense of a claim would make the claim more persuasive to anyone who isn't a neo-Nazi or close. My reply was an attempt at a non-condescending way to ask you if you were OK or if you wanted a cooldown period, because people can and do get a bit hot under the collar about things like fanfic.
