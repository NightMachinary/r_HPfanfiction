I am looking for good fanfics on a weird pairing known as Sirius/Lily. Its weird and I just want a fic to see what the quality of them are.


** i could see this pairing working out, oddly enough. they could bond over their strained relationship with their respective sibling (petunia and regulus) and respective loved one(s) whom they've effectively "lost" to pure-blood supremacy (severus and the house of black)... and now i want to see it to.

** I read this oneshot the other day, and it was decent enough, but this isn't really a ship I read myself generally. linkffn(Coming Clean)
