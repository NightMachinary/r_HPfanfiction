What I consider to be my weirdest story, it is not complete, and the "rewrite" label is temporary, as I'm not fully rewriting the story, just removing parts I now dislike, and altering others to suit my new vision for the story. The original was not complete, and had forty-seven chapters.

It takes place during Harry's third year, and is my take at the "title stories", without the usual "marriage contract", "harem", "Dumbledore and Weasley bashing", "Draco in Leather Pants", "Harry-worshipping goblins", sort of thing. It does have a long non-hyphenated name, but that is just for historical accuracy, and it is explained in a note at the end of the second chapter. And also quite a bit of "creator provincialism".

Also, as I said before, the plot gets (or will get) weird, and it may not be your kind of story.

Here's the summary:

/"As Harry's third year begins, a great darkness from the distant past emerges, seeking to engulf the feeble light of the present. Now, it stands on Harry's shoulders the survival of the Anemid dynasty and of the remnants of the old Roman Empire as well. (Alternate Universe and Timeline)"/

*** Mainly because I was unhappy with a few things, and also due to "author's block".

The idea behind the rewrite is that while I am removing and adding elements to the story, I'm also seeing if I regain inspiration for new chapters.
