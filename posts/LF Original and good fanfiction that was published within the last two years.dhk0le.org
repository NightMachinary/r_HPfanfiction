:END:
I'm sure many of you will agree with me that, at least on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]], it's hard to find genuinely good Harry Potter fanfiction, especially if you're either not in the mood for romance or you're in the mood for originality. There's just so much trash that you need to dig through that it's near impossible to dig through it all unless you're dedicated. I'm not dedicated. Are there any fics that were published since late 2017 that have original concepts (Or just concepts that haven't been overdone) and are genuinely good. No fics that have a slash pairing central to the story please (It's fine if there's a slash pairing as long as it doesn't involve the MC or the plot), no HermionexMalfoy fics, I'd prefer no harem fics but I understand that might be too much to ask. No Evil!Harry stories.


** Linkao3(In The Black by izzythehutt; Black Mask by izzythehutt) gets recced fairly frequently, and is amazing Black family intrigue, and sketches Sirius Black out fantastically well.

Linkao3(The Thrown Pebble by MissjuliaMiriam; The Nascent Threat by MissjuliaMiriaml) is that rare Slytherin!Harry that deftly avoids all the pitfalls of the genre. It was a surprising find that I cannot stop reccing.

Linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower)

Linkao3(better be gryffindor by petroltogo)

Linkao3(the dogfather by holimichelle)

Linkao3(The Rules of House Elves by ShivaVixen)

Linkao3(Common Sense by Grohiik) - it's MC slash but more like future slash considering it's a canon rehash that's only gone upto the beginning of year three.

Just, if people get over this idea that ao3 is gay porn central, it seems all the better writers are flocking there. The filters are bloody fantastic for cleaning out the detritus. Not saying that the gay porn isn't there but there's more newer good writing than I've seen in most places.

**** tbo, I much prefer a fic to have 100 more unnecessary tags than for it to have /literally 0 useful tags/.

It's a Harry Potter story, it's obviously gonna have Harry Potter characters, what I want to know is what is in the story without actually spoiling it or taking up the summary space. Damn it fanfiction.net

  Kreacher is alone, his mistress is dead, his favorite Master is dead, the other has been locked away, so what's a house elf to do?In one reality, it's wallow in misery and failure.In this one, it's find the young godson of the locked away ungrateful master and try to raise him the house elf version of the pure blood way.It goes better and worse than he planned.

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequenes of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan) is the best Ron-centric fic I've read, with high quality writing, characterisations and multiple plots done very well, and yet, only has about 350 favs.

Highly underrated and awesome fic. I recommend everyone check it out.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** I think the most original concept is in The Boy Who Died by Silirt. I started reading it a month or two after it came out and it's quite possibly the best start to a series I've ever read. It started June 2018, and there's no slash, harems, or pairings that would never happen(I mean it starts in 1991, so no pairings there anyway). I think it's exactly what you're trying to find.
