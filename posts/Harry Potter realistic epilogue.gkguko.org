Given what you know about the characters in the books do you think they'd turn out how they did in the actual epilogue and what Rowling has stated as canon for Harrys gen post epilogue?

If not what do you think would have happened to them?

For example I think its likely Harry would have gotten married and had kids later in life, needing more time to be himself and not the boy who lived in addition to dealing with all the loss and trauma in his childhood. I also think its more likely he might not want a high stakes job with that much responsibility after having so much responsibility for so long.

On the other hand I do see Ron wanting a more high stakes job in the spotlight and perhaps not having kids especially if he's with Hermione who is very career driven with both so busy they may not have a way to balance that with their careers unless one gives up their career to do so which could lead to bitterness. So instead they opt for no kids and instead spoiling the nieces and nephews. Should they have a kid I can see it being maybe only one very late in life and possibly adopted

Other characters i think that have canon epilogues are Luna Neville and all the Weasely kids. So do you think it would be different? And if so how?


** I would have put money on Harry becoming DADA teacher at Hogwarts rather than an Auror. Although I suppose he could always fulfil my headcanon later in life ...

** I thought the Deathly Hallows epilogue was fine, though it seems unpopular with others. I thought the names made sense. Though we, the readers, recognize that Snape was not a good man and that his "love" for Lily was unhealthy and more of an obsession, Harry doesn't. To Harry, Snape was an unbelievably brave man (which he was!) who loved his mother, someone he idolizes because he never got to know her and because she sacrificed herself for him. When it comes to cursed child, something not written by JKR even if she insists she did, I don't like it much. Hermione could never have become minister, there's no way she has electability. Ron dropping out of the Auror force felt weird as well. I couldn't really see him leaving Harry.

*** People talk about how stupid the names were, but I thought they all made a lot of sense too...

Like, for god's sake, Draco named his son Scorpius, and his father's name was Lucius, we see a trail of very old sounding starry names.

Harry is not a very interesting name, and his parent's names Lily and James were also unremarkable. Ginerva, Molly and Arthur, only Ginerva is a bit remarkable in a way that it's older and less common. So his kids being named Albus, Lily, James ect. totally makes sense because those are all unremarkable names and fit with the theme of the character. I can't imagine Harry naming his kids "Aria," "Lissandra" or "Calchas" ect..

Obviously there are other complaints about the ending, but I'm always annoyed with people that are like HARRY WOULDNT NAME HIS KIDS THAT. He totally would. He's never shown any creativity in the books, and neither did his wife.

***** It doesn't matter how "BAD" the names were. The point is, it's very REALISTIC that he would name his kids that.
