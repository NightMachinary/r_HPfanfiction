You really have to think beyond the Dursleys: it's not just about the cupboard and the endless chores and complete lack of affection. As a kid, Harry was forced to go to school wearing terrible, baggy clothes (often shrunken hand-me-downs from Dudley). He was not popular, he had zero friends (I believe befriending him would have caught the ire of Dudley and his gang?), and for the first eleven years of his life, his best recollections are eating crappy chocolate cake at Mrs. Figgs. I mean, that's just...miserable. For years.

Such isolation and discontent can really only breed resentment and a host of other negative qualities.

is there a fic where once harry realize that the he was forced to suffer through the first 11 years of his life in a failed attempt to get a happy carefree childhood(which he didn't) could have easly been avoided and it only served to make him completely ignorant on the culture laws guidelines and unequipped to handle his fame and heritage and inheritance grows resentful or apathetic and become mainly focused on growing powerful financly politically and magicaly so that his autonomy and independence is never taken for the benefit of others.

Basically I want a justifiably more selfish to harry one who wouldn't dive headfirst into suicidal mission whereby all rights he should if not for pure dumb luck who wouldn't accept ron back after repeatedly turning his back on him and who wouldn't give his Triwizard winnings to the twins without a majorty shareholder at least, not to be misconstrued with an edgelord power bank harry at 12 simply a harry who is done giving everything for basically nothing .


** As much as people don't enjoy this one. It matches your request. Might be a little to angsty, i felt it justified. Your mileage will vary.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

** Would be good if there were stories like this that didn't immediately dissolve into angst/bash feasts with completely unrealistic expectations for kids. I think the closest I know is linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt by DisobedienceWriter), but even then he isn't really particularly egotistical.
