Kind of like this it's from home in ffn.net

Charlie laughed heartily and wrapped a jovial arm around her shoulders. "Oh I would pay to have seen that."

"Name your price, I'll send you the memories," Remus' grin was positively wolfish.

Hermione just shook her head in amusement. "Forever a Marauder," she said fondly and petted Teddy's still curly hair when he reached towards her at the sound of their happy laughter. She was happy to see Remus once again smiling, as it had taken a long time for him to heal after Nymphadora's death during the battle.


** It seems that you'd need something that focuses on humour and I don't think I know of something like that. The only fic I know that has everyone, including Lily, surviving the war, is a series by aidan chase. But it has a lot of chapters from Harry's point of view. What I liked about it,though, was that the author made it clear they were a family. It does have some very amusing moments, but there's a lot of angst in the fic covering OOtP year. And it will apparently end up including all canon parings.
