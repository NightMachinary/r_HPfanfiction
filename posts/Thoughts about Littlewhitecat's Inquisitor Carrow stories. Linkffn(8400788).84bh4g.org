Opinions, thoughts, likes, hate. What did you think of the series, and would you change anything?

Thanks,

Warryn.


** I loathe WH40K, but I love this story. Very dark humour, and it thoroughly wrecks canon. The "over the top" characters and plots, and even the darker themes, don't cross the line - for me - into grimdark or grimderp.

*** I've never even played/watched WH40K, and I enjoyed the story greatly. Sure he's OP to the max, but the style of it makes you forget about how he can survive a Direct. Freaking. Stare from a Basilisk, or killing a Nundu with a sword, and his own bare(apart from the armor) hands.

Thanks,

Warryn.

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.
