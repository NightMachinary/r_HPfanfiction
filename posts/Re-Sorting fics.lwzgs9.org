Would love to read some more re-sorting fics. Ideally fairly long and completed.


** Evitative by Vichan on Ao3 is good, it's long and complete.

  AU. The Sorting Hat doesn't just let the Sword go when it falls on Harry's head in the Chamber, but also Sorts him again, this time into Slytherin. Harry is furious and terrified, and the adults aren't helping much. COMPLETE, sequel to come.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

  COMPLETE: Hermione's eighth year at Hogwarts is already going to be difficult in the aftermath of the war, but it is further thrown into upheaval when Headmistress McGonagall orders a re-sorting of all students to promote inter-house unity. But when the Sorting Hat sends Hermione to Ravenclaw with Draco - and without Harry or Ron - how will she cope? [EWE] Prevalent alchemy.

** linkao3(Unexpected Consequences by Siebenschlaefer). Incomplete, but the only one I've got that hasn't been mentioned already that involves an actual resorting by the Hat.

linkffn(Not As Advertised by sasahara17). Complete, but short. Slytherin Harry asks to be resorted.

linkffn(House of Badgers by phoenixgirl26). Harry asks Professor Sprout to accept him as a transfer to Hufflepuff.

And, in [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/index/][Blue Steel by Jeconais]], Harry and several other students don't actually get resorted, but they do renounce their Houses.

  The Ministry letter after the Dementor attack has far greater consequences than everybody could have anticipated and at the start of his fifth year in Hogwarts Harry has to be sorted again. And this time there is no negotiating with the Sorting Hat.
