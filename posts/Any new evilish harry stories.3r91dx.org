** Ok i'll bite, what is the difference between a "new one" and a "recently new one"? I'll just drop linkffn(too young to die) here, not new but on the off chance you haven't encountared it before.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** I'm copypasting from another comment I was writing. The first fic isn't that recent, but the second one is. I linked both becuase they're part of a series.

  This one is... unique. That's the best way I can describe it. On an unrelated note, did you know Harry was the 5th founder of Hogwarts and the inventor of the inferii? Or that Voldemort can squeal like a 14 year old girl who's just seen Beiber? Oh, and this story has the cutest dementors ever.

  The prequel to the one above this. It starts out as your normal everyday Azkaban fic with the oh lordy why me pity party in my cell I have no friends so I guess nobody's invited thing with a side of bashing, but HOLY SHIT does that change.
