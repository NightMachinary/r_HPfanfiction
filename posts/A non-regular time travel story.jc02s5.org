Basically, a time travel story with the twist that JKR's books /are/ the fix-it universe. Who got sent back in time? What happened in the original timeline?

*** As Mrs. Norris watched Voldemort storm into Hogwarts, killing students as they desperately tried to flee, she knew the moment when things went wrong. The death of one squib caretaker had seemed so insignificant to them, so unnoteworthy to the wand-wavers. But only she knew Argus's secret, how he kept all of them safe.

Mrs. Norris used the pandemonium to slip off to the Seventh Floor. After giving a polite nod to Barnabas the Barmy, a cat door appeared. Pushing her way into the Come and Go Room, she walked over to the fourth pile on the left, piled high with assorted human junk. Stepping carefully, Mrs. Norris plucked out what she needed, and headed to the door.

Time-turner held firmly in her jaw, Mrs. Norris exited the room. She was ready to make things right.

** Fudge!

Fudge fought the Death Eaters tooth and nail time and time again. In every time line, he tried a different thing.

It surprised him quite a lot when he realized that by acting completely incompetent (not recognizing Voldemort, not sending Aurors to fight the Death Eaters, etc) and letting Harry do-his-thing, he stopped a bloodbath from happening and saved lots of people.

It disappointed him, but soon he accepted that yes, that was the best case scenario.

Pity he will be remembered as the most useless Minister of Magic in centuries instead of the brilliant time traveling hero he actually is.
