Harry Potter has a reincarnation fic with pretty much every fandom I've see bar this one,so here's the idea. William Owen Herondale is reincarnated as Harry Potter, and the Shadowhunters world and Wizarding World all exist in the same universe. Shift the HP timeline up a bit and we all get the Herongraystairs reunion that we deserve. And Will totally remembers everything. I've seen a series use the idea that when a soul is reincarnated they don't normally remember their previous life, but when the killing curse hit Harry, it broke the seal on those memories and he remembered.

And let's be real on Will, he would not accept the Dursley's treatment for any longer than he absolutely had to, but he also probably wouldn't go searching for anyone from his past the second he could, because again, small child, he can't exactly get to London easily, and with the way the internet was, he couldn't have searched for Magnus easily either. But he would probably realize the best way to make sure the Dursley's treat him well is to be very visible, so he shows off his smarts, which Harry didn't. And you know, even with the advances in technology, he's a very quick learner, and he could have gotten skipped multiple grades just based on his reading skills, and Will would know a lot about math, and a little on science, even if he isn't caught up to date on science just yet.

Plus, since he's not sure that he's a shadowhunter anymore, he wouldn't be sure of his reception even if he did find out that the London Institute was still there, or if he found the entrance to the Silent City.

And watching Will flip everything on its end as Harry would be fun to watch, but the best part would be the eventual Herongraystairs reunion that would happen post TMI.

So I am begging someone to please write this fic. Please.
