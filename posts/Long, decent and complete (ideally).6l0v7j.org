I need some recs for something long and decent. Sad:happy I don't care.

I do like snape so ideally he doesn't die or something and I'm open to all else.


** Well, linkffn(To Shape and Change) is long, decent and complete and features Snape as one of the main characters.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** linkffn(Stages of Hope) isn't excessively long, but really good.

It features an interesting Snape that even wears +red+ burgundy robes. The characters are all well-written.

It has some great action scenes, but focuses mostly on the characters.

** Linkffn(Stronger Than Hope by Alaunatar) is probably the best mentor Snape fic. The characterization of Snape is very nicely done. Linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville; The Best Revenge: Time of the Basilisk by Arsinoe de Blassenville) is an also pretty decent Snape mentor story, though not as good as Stronger than Hope.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
