I just had a thought today where i thought they could be pretty funny. Any good ones?\\
Hopefully not smut, but i mean im not gonna say no to it...


** To clarify, are you simply looking for body swap fics or explicitly a freaky Friday 'you could never understand my life' cross generational body-swap-to-help-mutual-understanding plot

*** Anything with body swapping, hopefully humorous as well.

**** I recall a semi decent 'travel back in time' fic where Harry and Hermione go back in time but end up in each other's bodies. It wasn't finished (or close) though :(. They adopted star wars names for some reason...

I think I have seen a few romance body swaps (usually h/hr, or h/girl). Sadily, no Harry/ron swaps, even though they could have a good tale of two cities thing going

Edit: oooooh yeaaaa and that super creepy one where Hermione dies and Harry can't stand it so he uses a permeant potion to become Hermione, thus dooming the world due to a lack of a chosen one...

** There was one weird fic where James and Lily swapped bodies. If I recall correctly, the smut implications were largely ignored by the author other than a few references.

  Imagine that one person that irritates, infuriates, & insults their way under your skin to the point where each moment with him or her becomes a pop quiz in self-control. Now, imagine that you've woken up in that person's body. For Lily Evans & James Potter, learning to navigate this unfortunate and stressful new reality is truly a walk through hell.

  COMPLETE! One fateful Friday, Snape and James find they've switched bodies. A lot of glaring, a very little teamwork, and some unfortunate discoveries ensue. Severus/Lily, James/Lily.

** Yes, actually, I know of one! It's been quite a while since I read it, but if I remember correctly, it's a Draco and Harry body swap. It was called “Switch,” I'm pretty sure. I don't remember much about it other than that---I honestly can't remember if it was Drarry or just a friendship. I can try and dig up the link, if you're interested?

** Ha! I think I just found the absolutely most perfect place to recommend my fanfic! If you'd like, please check out: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13125917/1/Trading-Places][Trading Places]]

​

When a brazen attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, how high will the cost be to switch them back?

​

It's not quite body switching, but I have people switching! It's not a comedy, but it has some funny moments at any rate!
