This is just a wild concept that popped into my head late at night but what if the Dudleys were successful in preventing Harry from ever going to Hogwarts? Would Voldemort still be after him in a way and how would this change events? Would Harry learn wandless magic by himself and become some kind of self taught prodigy? Would he learn about Hogwarts later and transfer? Or would Neville just defeat Voldemort even though it wasn't him that was originally targeted.

Again this may not make sense but I thought it was a rabbit hole of possibilities


** there's a rather popular fic (that deserves its popularity imo) on ao3 that actually starts under the premise that Harry only learned he's a wizard when he's seventeen.

I can't quite remember why Harry didn't go to Hogwarts, but, well.

It only covers one possible outcome out of probably what could be hundreds (Harry transferring in would be an interesting read if done well - especially considering he'd be older/more mature when sorted which might influence which house he gets) but it was fun to read :)
