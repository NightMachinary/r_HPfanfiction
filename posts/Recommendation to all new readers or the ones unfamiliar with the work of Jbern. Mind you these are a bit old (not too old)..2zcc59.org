Also, can anyone give me a recommendation too that match the Qs that I asked earlier? :)


** Jbern's stuff is definitely a pleasure to read and very enjoyable.

Bungle in the Jungle was probably the first really good fic I ever read and it changed the way I thought about fanfiction pretty radically when I realized that fics could actually be of that quality. Some aspects of it are trite, especially in the opening with the Dumbledore and Weasley bashing being the event that sets off the plot, and some parts of it haven't aged very well, but overall its a great independent Harry fic with good action sequences, a completely original plot and a very Indiana Jones-esque atmosphere mixed with a coming of age story. The second person POV may turn some off, but I personally really liked it and felt it actually added to the story.

The sequel never really lived up to Bungle for me. It seemed to have very poor pacing and rushed into a much larger, more "epic" scale that didn't fit it well.

The Lie I've Lived is amazing, absolutely stellar. There's a few plot decisions I might be able to criticize if I did a fresh re-read but jbern's writing is excellent enough to make it unnoticeable.

** How much did Jim pay you for the infomercial? ;) I like jbern's stories too but my favorite two are ones you haven't mentioned here:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games][Number Games]]

#+begin_quote
  Ron Weasley, an aging quidditch player in the middle of possibly the biggest game of his life, looks back at the places where his life changed for the better and the worse. Book 7 compliant but not epilogue compliant.
#+end_quote

17k words, complete. It's a crossover with Michael Shaara's posthumously published novel /For Love of the Game/. One of the fairest treatments of Ron you'll find in fanfiction.

The other is his (now abandoned) HP/nBSG crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8712160/1/The-Next-Lord-of-Kobol][The Next Lord of Kobol]].

#+begin_quote
  Carried to the far end of the Galaxy by the veil in the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter becomes a veritable stranger in a strange land. But all the obstacles he has faced pale in comparison to the Cylon menace. Starts in the middle of Harry's fifth year and roughly eleven years before the fall of the Twelve Colonies.
#+end_quote

Both are later works of his. (His writing improved substantially toward the end of his fanfiction writing.)

***** Okay, This is one of the best x-overs I ever read for a harry potter ff. And the best part is how the author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/524094/][Shezza]] fused both of the worlds while expanding the Harry potter world beyond what I have seen anyone do.

This was so good, that it made me read the Dresden Files ( a series of novels 15 total and many more to come). I would also highly recommend that series.

Another good thing about this x-over is that the reader never ever needs to read the other series to understand the context of anything. so you can fully enjoy without reading the Dresden Files.

This is a series, 4 in total ( there is the 5th part but its not completed and not essential or important to have the full experience. also the 4th part is a 23k word one shot.)
