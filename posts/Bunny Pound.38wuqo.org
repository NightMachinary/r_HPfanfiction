Does anyone know a good (re:active) bunny pound or have a bunny I could adopt?

I'm a full time mommy looking for something to keep my brain from turning to mush during the day.

Edit: Yes, people. Plot bunnies.


** The daughter of the Lestranges (same Hogwarts year as Harry), was still at home when vindictive aurors came to burn her home down after arresting her parents. They don't check for this (or care), and she is saved by Kreacher who recognizes her distress and Black blood (if not name), though not before she gets a fair amount of burns on her. She is raised by Kreacher, some portraits and a ghost that lives in the hidden library in Grimmauld's place. The wizarding world doesn't find out that she lives until her sorting ceremony.

That one has been in my head for a while but I have 2 other stories that I'm already working on. Would love to see someone work this one out. (I can see some nice dialogue between her and Harry arguing about which side is more cruel, not that she would care much I think)

****** I did not, I think I'd prefer to kill her off a bit sooner, because of the whole isolation theme I was thinking of, but I guess Walburga is asocial enough for that not to ruin it. Plus I had imagined her portrait being one of her main influences, this might actually improve that connection.

It would be 4 years though, since she didn't become an orphan until after Harry did, which was Halloween 1981. Depending on where one sets her birthday, she would have been 5 or 6 when Walburga died.

******* Yeah, I've begun writing, it's a fantastic prompt you've come up with here. The Walburga in my story is rather weak and frail because she's dying in four years so she can't /really/ do much. My Lestrange Jr (Vega is her name) is born in August.

** 1. Fifth year Lily (pre-Snape's Worst Memory) time travels forward to Harry's fifth year.
2. 5yr old Harry runs away from Privet Drive to London, where he bumps into a homeless Remus begging on the streets. Remus gets him into the Leaky Cauldron for the night and contacts Dumbledore, who decides the best thing to do is send Remus to live with the Dursleys to ensure Harry gets treated well.

** Ok two AUs I've always kind if wanted but never had the time to write:

Dumbledore decides to drop all his eggs in one basket, just to be safe. Harry is raised by Augusta Longbottom. How on earth do he and Neville turn out? Melodrama surrounding Neville and Harry debating about who the hell is the chosen one if they're both destroying horcruxes together is optional.

Growing up in the Dursley household makes Harry seek approval by duplicating the behavior he sees praised from Dudley. What results is simply the douchiest little bully Hogwarts has ever seen.

***** Newly bodified Voldemort is chomping at the bit and all, "Let's go get that little bitch, Potter."

And the Death Eaters are like, "Nooo. No, milord, we can't."

Voldemort gets upset that they're raining on his parade and telling him what he can or can't do. He fires off a few Cruciatus curses.

Lucius Malfoy is writhing in the dirt but manages to gasp out a few sentences explaining the situation. The can't just snatch Potter, they have to get the Longbottom brat as well. Witnessing his parents torture as a tot and losing them to insanity has caused him significant emotional trauma. Malfoy explains that Neville is believed to be marked as well, showing an odd amount of emotional insight for a man so self centered.

Voldemort is a bit perturbed to realize he doesn't know which one the prophecy refers to, or if it's even both.

Yeah, that'd be pretty interesting to read about (assuming I wasn't writing it). It would still need to be tweaked because I think the prophecy implies the child is marked by Voldemort himself when it says "the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal." I would consider Neville's trauma to be primarily caused by the Lestranges and Crouch and only secondarily by Voldemort.

***** Fair. So, Harry still goes into Gryffindor with Hermione and Ron.

Dudley, not a complete prick, was also never going to be top of his class. We'll say he goes into Slytherin (because he isn't brave enough to ask for Gryffindor?) and teams up with Draco and Pansy?

He and Harry still never completely got along, but more in a brotherly way. Dudley's parentage would teach Draco to be less elitist. Harry/Ron/Hermione would still assist in some of the heroics because of Harry and Dudley being raised as brothers?

In keeping with cannon plot?

** Not my own idea: J.K Rowling's Harry Potter is really an unusual kid. Many kids brought up in an abusive home(locked in a closet, verbally abused, beaten) do not grow up to be well-adjusted adults, let alone self-sacrificing heros. This is a darker take on Harry's story. This is a Harry who sees his magical abilities as his chance to gain the respect and power his muggle relatives denied him his whole life... A Harry who actively hates Dumbledore and Hagrid for abandoning him to the hell that was #4 Privet Drive. A Harry who embraces Draco's muggle-hating views and chooses Slytherin over Gryffindor... His story comes to parallel Voldemort's even more, save for one difference: Voldemort killed his parents for which Harry wants revenge. Does Harry seek to replace Voldemort as the next Dark Lord, or does he prove to be the anti-hero that returns honor to the infamous Slytherin house.

** Ooh man! A while ago, I was in an OC-making-mood and I made a backstory and things the character would do. I never did get around to making a story though.

Here's one, feel free to change the name or whatever you want.

Azkaban. The fortress inhabited with dementors and prisoners. But what if there was another being. Placed in the fortress to keep others safe? Rowena Ravenclaw liked to invent, she like I do the impossible. So she made it her goal to create a living being with magic. It looked human, it sounded human, it acted... /mostly/ human. Her name is Calypso, the prison was built to house her when she got out of control. Insane people forget her but Sirius Black wasn't insane. Sirius escapes and Calypso hears word that her only friend in the last few hundred years was being hunted by dementors, she mascerade a as one herself and sneaks out to protect him.

Basically, there's a never-aging human-like being living in Azkaban who befriends Sirius and aids him. She would see modern things, even wizarding world modern things and she would be amazed.

I'd love to see this turned into a story.

** Crossover with His Dark Marterials.

In the HP universe, James Potter and Lily Evans are on the run from the Death Eaters with baby Harry. Somehow they end up at the Archway on the Dias. James gets murdered, and Lily jumps through to save baby Harry from Lord Voldemort. Only it's not a pathway to death, but rather a window into a new world. They wind up in Lyra's world with the Daemons. Lily (whose Daemon is a stag) decides that this is a safe spot to hide and raise Harry. Back in the HP world, Voldemort takes over. He then starts expanding his army. Harry grows up in the world with Daemons, but Voldemort starts sending his army through the window to find him. Lots of wiggle room. Maybe there's a Hogwarts in both realms? Maybe Albus Dumbledore only exists in the Deamon world.

I dunno, have fun.
