Don't get me wrong; there are some good fics with those pairing's. I'm just tired of them. I like a darker, more powerful Harry. Without all the harem since Hermoine or Ginny are usually in it. If they're not, then it's fine.

I've read a femslash with fem!harry and Fleur, Luna, and Tonks. But other than those I haven't found anything else. So any recommendations?

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

** Ah, I see you're only interested in the exceptionally rare.

On another note, would you mind posting links to those other femslash fics?

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.
