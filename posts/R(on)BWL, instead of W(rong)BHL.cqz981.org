Ron ends up as the boy who lived after Voldemort attacks the burrow and kills everyone. Ron survives and is sent to love with his Squib cousin at number 7 Privet Drive.

The attack on Godrics Hollow could still happen but perhaps with the Lestrange's doing the deed instead.

*** Not to nitpick, but this seems a little too short for this premise. Is it completed, ongoing or abondend?

** Sent to live with that Squib uncle- the Accountant that nobody ever talks about.

But seriously, I feel like it would be better served with Ginny as the GirlWhoLived, what with being the 7th child and extra magical and all. The power of 7 children vibrates on the right frequency to explode Voldemort's 1/7th soul or something.
