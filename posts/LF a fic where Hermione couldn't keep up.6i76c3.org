I remember reading a fic where in 4th year Hermione started having troubles with practical magic since she was a muggleborn and was very angry about it(obviously). She was jealous that harry was better than her since he was a halfblood.

On the side note, any fic where muggleborns are actually magically inferior to halfbloods and pureblood will be great. Thanks.


** Linkffn(5353809)

Had something about pureblood magic being more tame and specialised while while muggleborn had a "wild?" kind of magic. Also something about rare talents that could only be inherited by a mage blood line like being a methamorphomagus( no idea if it's the right spelling to lazy to check) the ability to become an animagus, prophetic powers...

That's was also a dimension travel fic that had something similar but my memory it to vague to point a specific fic I only remember something about Sirius explaining Harry why muggleborn couldn't somethings that some pureblood could.

Side note more than one Slytherin!Harry (even some Ravenclaw!Harry) and fic about pureblood society have this element in them though I can't think a specific one at the moment, edit: although those one often also have blood purity ideas something that the two before didn't

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

**** Just a warning for you. This fic isn't finished and was abandoned a few years ago.

It's a really good one but if I remember correctly it just stops in the 4th year.

Personally I'd still give it a read though as it is very good.

** shit I'd just want a fic where the characters disprove pureblood superiority with more than just 'Hermione is the best in the class!' and 'Lily stopped Voldemort!' mainly cause those two reasons can be argued against so hard and aren't likely in the slightest to change the mind of someone raised in the Pureblood ideology.

More on the matter at hand though, I'd be interested in a fic like that too, where there is a genuine reason for Muggleborns are considered magically weaker than Purebloods. I think C'est la vie may have done something sorta similar, where Purebloods have a chance at getting magical 'gifts' like Seering, Pareseltongue, or even just a higher leaning towards curses and hexes.

** There is a fic in which the magical superiority is limited to (eventually pureblood) families that were established using complicated rituals with lots of rules and constraints. Each family has a comprehensive code of behavior, describing almost all aspects of the family's daily life. This code is a sort of a contract between the family and magic, and violations are severely punished by magic itself. In return, the family has access to unique magical abilities and protections.

By using this device, the fic presents pureblood traditions and customs as not just something that is done "because it was always done this way", but because to do otherwise means bad things will befall the perpetrator and his/her family.

Oh, and it features the Count of Monte Cristo-like Azkaban!Hermione.

What makes it less interesting to this sub is:

- it's incomplete and abandoned;
- *it's in Russian*;
- to my knowledge, an English translation was never attempted.

For the small minority able to read the language, it can be found [[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=688][here]].

*** Not OP, but it would be a very interesting story if done properly. Imagine if racism was based off cold, hard facts that were easily proven. The ramifications of that would be fascinating to study. Of course, writing such a story without actually coming across as racist would be almost impossible.

***** No, but it sounds interesting.

I have read /Red Rising/, where society is separated into castes that perform different tasks in society. Genetic engineering was used to create these differences in ability, and some castes are lower, or much lower, than others. You might be interested.

*** Basically all of the above. Just wish for something different for a change. The basic thing to justify pureblood supremacy in fics is usually just their lack of respect for wizarding traditions and culture. So I thought it would be an interesting to give the prejudices a more solid ground.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
