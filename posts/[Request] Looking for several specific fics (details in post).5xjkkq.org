  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

** Did he break Malfoy's fingers in the first one? I remember this detail, that Harry's lover was kidnapped and he thought Malfoy knew where she was, so he straight up starts torturing him in the Great Hall attempting to get information. Don't remember the title, though.

  The war is over. Voldemort won. The light's last hope is a desperate ploy, concocted by an insane genius, that probably won't work anyway. Now Harry must find a way to win a war he's already lost once before.
