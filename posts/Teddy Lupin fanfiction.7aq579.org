I need help. Some time ago I read a fanfiction in which Teddy Lupin and Victoire travelled back in time and they were sent back to the marauders' era (they didn't intend to go back so far in time). They used a time turner which James Sirius Potter stole from his father. This story was not finished when i read it, it had about 4 chapters but I can't find it because I can't remember its title. Can anyone help me?

  Teddy Lupin and Victoire Weasley wind up in the Marauder's Era, 1976 with nothing but a textbook on time travel that keeps giving them cryptic messages. Can they change the future or watch as everything stays the same as they get sent back to their own time? Rated M for language.
