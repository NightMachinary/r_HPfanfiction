Dear fellow readers,

​

Please kindly advise me on this one. I have to hold an academic presentation and my topic is, as suggested by the title, the fanfic universe of HP.

What fanfics should I pick and refer to? I have read loads but I hope to receive some advice, please.

I need them to be safe for work aka school, students, teachers, etc. *no slash, hard lemons, etc. gulp.

I was thinking of some Severitus fanfics, they seem safe.

Please suggestions.

Thank you for your time, be safe and take care of yourself and your loved ones.

** Fanlore is a good starting place, it has a overview of the entire Harry Potter fandom as well as a timeline. There's also a whole page devoted to Severitus if that's the direction you wind up going in.

*** I like this approach. Any presentation that calls out specific fics, ships, tropes, etc is going to be hit-or-miss with a general school audience. Maybe a high-level overview of those topics. Like "what is a trope" and how they come and go in popular media including fanfic. A timeline can show how the HP fandom is special due to its longevity and maturing fanbase, without being specific enough to make anyone tune out if they don't like a specific trope/ship/fic.

** What is the point of your presentation? Are you just saying, like, “This thing called fanfic exists” or are you describing different types of it, the history of it, going into topics like how people who lack representation in mainstream media create it in fanfics, or what?

** Harry Potter fanfic is a HUGE and many headed topic, so I would highly recommend that you hit on a specific aspect of the topic.

If I were doing a presentation I would probably go with something along the lines of "Why it (HP fanfiction) is so popular and how has it continued to be popular for so long" but I would second a previous poster's idea of "what is trope" to give a good, small, staring point.

-I second the use of fanlore as a shortcut/ starting point.

--> Fanfiction is NOT a new thing, and it did not start with Harry Potter (Star Trek anyone?) but the widespread use on the internet, forums, blogs, etc. by the same people (age-group) as fans of the original texts catapulted HP fanfic well beyond most previous fandoms.

** this might be a bit much for a schoolwide audience, but if you want to talk about parallels between fics and real world issues that would be interesting. Pureblood vs muggleborn vs Muggle debate (racism, bigotry, etc.). Stories taking on Tom Riddle's childhood and his psychological development, Statute of secrecy breaking leading to the escalation of a Muggle vs wizard technology arms race and eventually an apocalypse. I think some of the stories that go into magical theory are pretty cool (transfiguration and thermodynamics connection).

**** There is a reasonably well-acted audio version freely available. It can be pretty easy to get pretty far into it pretty quickly.

But MoR seems pretty atypical to me? It is famous for what it does, and might be a good example of one thing out of many that can be done with fanfiction. But it is still something rare and not really typical of the fandom, to me.

** There are a lot of resources you can draw from. Unfortunately most of those sources are biased and incomplete. I don't know if there has been a comprehensive study of fanfiction (I know of several studies that dealt with slash fics etc.).

If you want to put real work into it and try to make a real presentation, there are a few ways to do it. The first is to spend several years reading old fics and trying to get a feel of the fandom (obviously not an option). The second is to use a shortcut like fanlore as someone already suggested.

The third, and the one I would recommend, is more controversial. There are Odd Ideas by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot]]. It's a collection of hundred of little/large stories over the scope of 16 years, from 2005 to present. If you want an overview of fanfiction in it's nuances, that's a good place to start. Especially if you want to avoid slash (although why I have no idea, since most... I will stop there to not give you ideas).

**** If you do an overview of the fandom tropes you can mention the slash stuff.

If you call it out, you might mention that this trope seemed to start with Kirk/Spock back in the fanzine days of Star Trek.

I think you would be safe in saying almost any trope will have an example in HP fanfiction - which is pretty amazing. This field is so prolific, so very many fanfics out there to suit almost any taste - I find this such a rich fandom to which I keep coming back.
