Harry is both a Light Lord and a Dark Lord. doing this to create peace and order, while also moving the magical Britain forward.

Light Lord- Create peace, fund orphanages, add funds to aurors, etc

Dark Lord- buy knocturn alley/ turn to a red light district, pull strings behind the scenes,etc

No Slash Harry No Harry/Ginny.


** If you write a fic, I suggest to refrain from using the terms dark lord/light lord. The characterization speaks for itself. In the books, Dumbledore is never called "light lord", and there's no need for such a label, as Dumbledore's actions and characterization are enough.

And "Dark Lord" is a title Voldemort created for himself. He is not a dark lord, he is The Dark Lord. Gellert Grindelwald is always called a dark wizard, never a dark lord.

Let character's actions and characterization speak for themselves instead of slapping a label like "dark lord" or even worse "light lord" on them.

** can we just let the "light lord" trope just die away? There's no such thing as "the light side" in Harry Potter.

** Is he really a Dark Lord if he simply controls/manages the criminal underworld? Like a mob boss? Or maybe you want a story like linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts) ?

Either way your idea needs more background to it. Okay, so Harry reigns over Britain as a puppet master with morals all over the place, helping and hindering society as he sees fit. What else?

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
