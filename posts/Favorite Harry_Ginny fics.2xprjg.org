I just finished the series for the millionth time and looking for H/G fics. One shots, short stories, novel length, whatever.


** Anything by Northumbrian or little0bird on FF.net. They are great writers :)

*** I have read all of their fics! I was totally bummed when I got to the end of little0bird's "Questions and Answers" and realized it hadn't been updated in months.

** Heh, this was once a really controversial pairing, but opinions have mellowed over time. i always liked Ginny though, and have read quite a few of these. Lets see :\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/637123/1/The-Phoenix-and-the-Serpent][The Phoenix and the Serpent]], One of the greatest stories of all time.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]], Great Time-travel story, mostly fast paced and action based, though light on HG\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][Backwards With a Purpose]], A time-travel redo, though slower paced and more focused on HG\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/739771/KevinVoigt][The Death Gate Trilogy]], A really underrated Adventure/Mystery trilogy. Highly reccomended.

** I rarely read stories with a HP/GW pairing. Something about it annoys me. (Mostly prefer stories without a pairing these days.)

Ones that I most recently skipped (i.e. today):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/826742/1/The-Order-of-the-Phoenix]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus]]

*** I just finished reading Hail Odysseus this morning. I really liked the story, except for one scene in the forbidden forest.

I'd also like to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5924318/1/A-Father-Divided][A Father Divided]]

Harry joins Voldemort as his Apprentice, leaving a pregnant Ginny behind. Eleven years later, James 'Weasley' is on a quest to find out who his father is, who the mystical figure of 'Harry Potter is, and dreaming of one day overthrowing Voldemort's Empire
