Draco looked disgusted at the stack of books laid on his library desk, all of them sporting the insufferable smile of Gilderoy Lockhart.

His mood became even darker when he noticed that a Firstie girl was coming straight to him, her ginger hair and Gryffindor colors betraying her name.

"What do you want, Weasley?" he asked curtly.

"I have something to give you back" Ginny replied.

"Your dad dropped this at the bookstore" she continued.

"I've seen Father with this old notebook before" said Draco.

"It's an enchanted diary. If you write something in it, it will reply and it knows everything about Hogwarts and classes" said Ginny while handing the journal to Draco.

"Then you should have sold it and bought Ron a proper wand with the money, before he accidentally blows himself up" sneered Draco.

"My parents told me not to take things that don't belong to me" Ginny answered on an offended tone.

"Morons. All of you. Now go away!" Draco retorted.

Alone again at his desk, Draco leafed through the blank pages of the diary.

He decided to check if the journal can help with his Transfiguration homework. Maybe he finally had something that would give him an edge over that mudblood Granger and he will regain the respect of his father.

Even if it didn't provide answers, the enchanted diary would be more fun than reading about Lockhart's ridiculous adventures.

"What a stupid girl, giving away enchanted things like she is Merlin reborn" Draco muttered to himself.


** Nice. Only complaint:

  "Than you should have sold it and bought Ron a proper wand with the money, before he accidentally blows himself up" sneered Draco.
#+end_quote

It's "then". And also I don't think Draco would refer to Ron in such a respectful manner.

Oh... and... I don't really understand your title. Shouldn't it be "Ginny Weasley is an observant girl"? Or something like that? The main distinction here seems to be that she noticed that Lucius Malfoy dropped the Diary, which of course would make her weary about it. It doesn't really come across that she rejects the diary because of her goodness.

Edit: There's really an interesting idea in here. I keep thinking about how things would play out if Harry had to save Draco in the end.

**** It doesn't really look like suspicion to me. More like, "Just because his dad's a jerk doesn't mean I have to be mean to Draco too."

She also says Lucius dropped the diary, which implies, at least from my interpretation, she thinks it was an accident.

Interesting. I mean, she doesn't really says anything about the diary being evil or bad, she does point out explicitly that it belongs to the Malfoys though. If it weren't for your title I wouldn't even have considered any other explanation than this Ginny being quick on the uptake. But I see where you're coming from with her giving it back because it doesn't belong to her.

***** Context. F&G are more likely to blow someone /else/ up, while Percy, for all his flaws, isn't likely to blow anyone up. Ron, on the other hand... and Ginny and Draco both know this.

** I love this. Ginny was such a cute character before Diarymort fucked her over.

While it's true that it shaped who she became later in life, I enjoy fics where she keeps being an innocent little girl for a while.

*** He did it purposefully (Dobby implied that much and also Malofy didn't reply when Harry gave back the broken diary at the end) but Draco never actually knew what was going on, remember that Harry and Ron asked him while polyjuiced who was the Heir of Slytherin and he had no idea.

** Imagine Lucius Malfoy's reaction when he realizes that his plan almost killed his son instead of some blood traitor girl. And Harry of all people saved him. From his own former master. And imagine how Draco will grow up after his Dark Lord lied to him and tried to kill him to return and Harry saved his life.
