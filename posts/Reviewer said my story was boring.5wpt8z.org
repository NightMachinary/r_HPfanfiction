** So... what? This means two things could've happened. Either they did indeed read all of your story, hoping that it would pick up,a nd it didn't, or they read part of it then just skipped to the end. Either way, why does it matter?

** "read" is a loose term. A lot of the time I will read the first few chapters to try to get engaged in the story, and if that doesn't happen, I'll just skim through to see if there's anything interesting. And sometimes, stories are just inherently boring, and that's the point.

*** Well usually if a review comes under a certain chapter it means the person read up to that point.

** If that was all they said, then it's not very helpful. Perhaps you could ask them to elaborate a bit more and see if you think they might have a point. You'll never please everyone.

  My reward for beating the Demon Emperor and sending him back to hell? Finding myself in an unknown land, hounded by heralds of ice and fire, as well as the idiotic peoples of the lands in this... Westeros. Is it possible to find a way home? I don't know. Eventual Harry/Daenerys. As in way, way later. Stop asking when :P
