To the point where Harry (or Fem Harry) specialises in one extreme over the top spell above all others (Only casting the others for classes. Can't have him actually fail out, not like he has points to assign)

"Harry cast the Patronus Charm!" yelled Hermione as a cloud of Dementors descended upon them. "Darkness Blacker than Black and Darker than Dark. I Beseech thee, Combine with my deep Crimson" Harry began to incant. "HARRY WHAT ARE YOU DOING" Harry just smirks at Hermione before continuing to incant as the Dementors began to draw near.. "The time of awakening cometh. Justice, fallen upon the infallible boundary, appear now as an intangible distortion! Dance, Dance, Dance! I desire for my torrent of power a destructive force: a destructive force without equal! Return all creation to cinders, and come from the abyss! This is the mightiest means of attack known to man, the ultimate attack magic! EXPLOSION!!!"

Just the sheer ridiculous over the top level of Megumin's favourite/only spell in Harry Potter form. Seeing how many situations Harry can solve with Explosion. The Troll? Easy. Quirrel? Easy. The Basilisk? They're spell resistant but I doubt it could tank an Explosion. Dementors? Might be an issue, but you just need more Explosions. The Dragon? It doesn't stand a chance. The 2nd Task might be a problem, but just blow up the maze and sprint to the cup before the other competitors get a chance. Voldemort and the Death Eaters in the Graveyard? might be difficult unless you bait Voldemort's pride. Umbridge? Definitely deserves an explosion. Getting the cup from Gringotts? Just blow up Gringotts.


** Basilisk? Boom

Dementors? Boom

Voldemort? Boom

Hotel? Trivago

***** It can also be blocked by a Gravestone, or even a corpse of one of your enemies. Not nearly cool enough compared to a spell that says "Fuck you, the horse you rode in on, and the entire surrounding area behind you" like Explosion, the Dragon Slave or Starlight Breaker do.

By Flashy I mean Michael Bay with access to anime level Special Effects sort of Flashy, not "Ooh a slightly green light and some noise"

****** Eh but that gravestone goes boom don't it? Avada Kedavra is also readily rapid fire-able. It's basically running around an RPG slinging insta-death spells, and it's flashiness was really toned down in the movies. Again, BFG shot of death.

******* But it's boring and generic, only hits 1 target at a time, you have to mean it, and it's illegal to cast. And it's slow enough that humans can and have dodged it. Unless you can make it AK47 speed, or AOE, then it's too boring to be your one spell solution. The point of the prompt is to go as ridiculously over the top as possible with spells like Nanoha's Starlight Breaker or Megumin's explosion where "Whole army with 1 shot?" isn't a question of whether you can do it, it's someone sighing after you've already done it.

******** Protego blocks an explosion. Avada passes through permanent magical protections (wards to the less refined like me), shields, and enchanted clothing to instantly kill something. An explosion curse that takes 15 seconds to cast and can be blocked by a protego is powerful, but certainly less versatile than an avada. Seriously, remembering and saying all those words would get you hit with so many other spells including other explosion spells like bombarda maxima.

** I don't know. His or her patronus sounds like it would be a bomb.

Which begs the question: When a corporeal patronus that is a bomb explodes, does it hurt people?

Also, Smart Bombs.

*** I don't know, but that does sound like a fantastic idea for a fic in its own right. A Bomb Patronus that can explode and take out targets, and also chases after them and follows them... I'd read a fic about that.

**** Work in a little backstory about how he was with the Dursleys christmas shopping at Harrods when that IRA attack happened in 83. Vernon was one of the casualties, and Harry wasn't old enough to understand what dying means, but understood that the explosion saved him from Uncle Vernon. And now he has an explosion fetish. And a better childhood.

** What's terrifying is that while megumin is limited to one explosion a day (unless someone else gives her more mana), harry potter isn't.

Now, maybe he can't make an explosion as big as hers, but he'll be able to do his personal biggest all day

** That would be Harry with expelliamus. The killing curse, huh? I could simply dodge the spell or make a physical barrier, but let me yeet that spell back. He could be so good with it that he could expel dragons and basilisk into walls, knocking them out. Expel water away. Expel all dementor away. Or expel the souls out of dementors. Expels curses from items, expels wards. The spell shouldn't work like that, but somehow it does. Ron has accepted it, Dumbledore is fascinated and Hermione is still trying to wrap her head around it.

  Harry was feeling pretty good after his third year. True, it hasn't been going perfectly, but nothing ever does. Still, his godfather was free-ish and alive, and both their souls were where they belong. And then he got a visit from his mother's mother. There's no ownership by me involved with this.
