** No Alphard Black but linkffn(Welcome to Hogwarts 1949) sounds like it. Edit: Black is in the story, but several years younger.

  Harry is accidently transported fifty years back in time through a fluke with the mauraders map. Here he runs into and befriends Tom Riddle, hoping to find his only weakness. No Slash.

** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite]])

I think it's this one. Harry comes back to present times after spending a year in 1946 through means unknown, and Riddle and his gang have followed him.

It fits what you describe. I didn't finish it but it seemed quite good.

  Getting stuck in 1942 was bad. Getting put into Slytherin was even worse. Having Tom Riddle practically stalk him? Harry hated his life. Prequel to Fate's Favourite. [ABANDONED.]

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?
