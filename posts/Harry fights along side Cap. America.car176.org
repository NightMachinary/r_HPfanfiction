Looking for a fic where Harry fights along side Captain America and then is recognized years later after the Captain is woken up from the ice.


** Wait, I'm confused. Is this a fic where an immortal Harry fought in the war with Cap, and then Cap recognized him when they bumped into each other again? Your prompt confuses me a bit

*** I guess? I read a fic a while ago where for some reason I can't remember Harry fought along side Cap in ww2 and then ran into Harry after being woken up from the ice so I assume Harry is “immortal”. That's all I remember.

** So linkffn(10301401) mentions something in chapter 2. But that's all I could find via google. Good luck!

*** Nope pretty sure it wasn't slash I don't remember if it had and relationship at all and I'm sure it was more then a 1shot I'm still looking around but pretty sure I'm going to have to read through the fics I find because these summaries tell me nothing lol.

*** No but that's pretty close I'm pretty sure Cap finds Harry through something like just walking down the street but I'm not sure At this point I'm half convinced I've made this up I've looked through all the AvengersXHarry Potter fics I've saved and none are the one I'm thinking of.
