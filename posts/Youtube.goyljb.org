I really want a good youtube channel that does like reviews of fanfics, deep dives into certain topics, and reddit reviews.

If no one does this in the next few years I think this is what my channel is going to become about.


** There's this channel that repeatedly pops up on my YouTube home page that has video titles like this:

- Dumbledore's Plan Explained!

- The Elder Wand Explained!

- Time Turners Explained!

None of these videos /explain/ anything. There's no analysis. They simply summarise a collection of canon scenes. They should really be titled:

- Dumbledore's Plan Paraphrased!

- The Elder Wand Paraphrased!

- Time Turners Paraphrased!

I have now blocked this channel.

Whatever you do, OP, don't be that guy.

*** Dude, come on! SC Brothers are good. They are not original, I'll give you that, but they do good work analyzing canon.
