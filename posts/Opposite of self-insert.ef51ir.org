There are so many fics in which a Harry Potter fan from our world finds themself in that world (where they can pretend to be a seer, prevent all of canon's tragedies, and win the sexiest canon character as a prize.) Are there fics in which a canon character finds themself in our world? So everyone's like, “Dude, awesome Snape costume!” or whatever and he's like WTF?


** None come to mind...well, I think there was that one with a dimension-travelling Harry who at one point ended up in a universe where magic didn't exist and Hogwarts was a ballet club.

Come of it, it might be interesting to read a fic that's a stealth Harry Potter crossover.\\
A group of police detectives investigate a series of crimes and unusual behavior, only to find that somehow, impossibly, their perpetrator is Voldemort, come to life from the Harry Potter books and actually wielding magic. In a world where there's no Statute of Secrecy or other wizards or magical creatures.

And there's also this one that does match your request but isn't HP and isn't a text story.

*** *Last Action Hero*

Last Action Hero is a 1993 American fantasy action comedy film directed and produced by John McTiernan. It is a satire of the action genre and associated clichés, containing several parodies of action films in the form of films within the film. The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Jack Slater, a Los Angeles police detective within the Jack Slater action film franchise, while Austin O'Brien co-stars as Danny Madigan, a boy magically transported into the Slater universe, and Charles Dance as Benedict, a ruthless assassin from the Slater universe who escapes to the real world. Schwarzenegger also served as the film's executive producer and plays himself as the actor portraying Jack Slater.

Apparently that was an actual episode, not just a fanfic.

**** Haha I wonder which came first! I read it so long ago I don't remember the name or anything except for that little detail so I can't check.... But supernatural has a lot of episodes on ff tropes actually lol so I'm not surprised. (I'm also not really caught up....)

** There is one I've read but it was like 6 chapters and discontinued. By a pretty well known fanfic writer. It was an Avengers crossover too I think. Let me see if I can find it ...

Edit: found it. It's steelbadger's A New Man.

** Not exactly what you asked for, but I've once seen a fic where Harry and Voldemort ended up in the Avengers world so I mean there's that. Never read it though and I don't remember the title so this whole comment is useless tbh

** Hmm. I know there's a fic where Harry gets pulled into reality in the MCU. He uses the names of various people he knows as aliases. Takes a couple times for him to discover the books. Pretty sure it died before really getting anywhere though.
