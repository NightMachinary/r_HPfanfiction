Can anyone recommend some good "Sirius meets Harry a few years earlier" fics?

I pretty much only like "So-and-so rescues Harry from Privet Drive" fics when it's in-character for that person as we know them in canon. So Lupin is okay, but Snape isn't.

I'm also just looking for general fics that center around a pre-Hogwarts Harry at the Dursleys.


** I know you said no Severitus, but I'd submit that [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] by Arsinoe de Blassenville is simply an outstanding bit of writing and in-character. McGonagall and Snape help Harry. 200k+ words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
#+end_quote

There's a sequel that's 110k words and also complete.

** You could give these a look.

1) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8423267/1/A-Life-More-Ordinary][A Life More Ordinary]]

- "Two escapees that the ministry would love to catch, kidnapping Harry Potter and hiding away out of sight. That, Moony, is the perfect way for us to raise Prongslet!" Sirius and Remus, running from the wizarding world, kidnap Harry and raise him in a house filled with love. How will this effect the Boy-who-Lived. How will their actions change the wizarding world?

Sirius and Remus raise Harry from age 4+, focuses more on the adults' development than Harry's

2) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2086067/1/Wishcraft][Wishcraft]]

- AU Complete. Sirius is suffering in Azkaban with 4 yr. old Harry, but not for long. Harry needs to go to Hogwarts. What about the Dementors and house elves? What about Remus? Can certain secrets be kept? Can Harry be kept safe?

Odd one, Sirius raises Harry from within Azkaban.

3) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/The-Wise-One-Book-One-Becoming][The Wise One]]

- When Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and 8-year-old Harry Potter disappears, the world is thrown into upheaval. What will Britain and Harry be without each other, and who will face the Dark? You only THINK you've read this before. I guarantee you haven't.

I have not re-read this one in a while so I can't really remember everything. I think they leave England and try to make a new life for themselves but they are always forced to leave it behind and start again. eventually they are drawn back to England to fight in the war.

4) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9080018/1/Disbelief][Disbelief]]

- What would life be like had Sirius been to fetch Wormtail on his way to Halloween at the Potters that night? A tale of how a life spent with his Godfather, and a life spent on the run from the law, affects the boy fated to change the world. Can the Wizarding world trust the boy who spent the last ten years on the run with Britain's most wanted criminal?

You don't hear too much about the pre-hogwarts era so this one may not interest you, focuses more on Harry's first year and his quest to get Sirius' freedom. It is on going and does not end when that task is completed.

*** Just finished reading "The Wise One" trilogy. It was a pretty enjoyable series where the first story is mainly traveling the world, second story is 5th year and third is 6+7th. There were some nice twists from what happened in canon that kept things fresh and interesting both before Harry returns as well as after he arrives.

** A Life More Ordinary by obsidianembrace is very good. Note that it is not the same one one as lazyass123 recommended, they just have the same name. This one starts with a very young Harry, and shows Sirius and Remus gay together and raising Harry. It's very human, with all the characters being appropriately scared and regretful over the past. A very good story in my opinion.

Another Prisoner, Another Professor by Maurauder is also very good. It's a rewrite of the third book, with Sirius as the DADA teacher and Lupin as the escaped prisoner. Is has a different mystery than PoA too, with Lupin trying to prove his innocence through Regulus, not Pettigrew. Note that while timeline wise it diverts before Harry is even born, it doesn't really contradict the first two books. Harry is still raised by the dursleys and all the events of the first two books still happened.

Divergence by ness frost is also very good. It diverges from PoA at the end, with Pettigrew not escaping and Sirius being declared innocent. It showcases how hard it is just to start a family from scratch, and also features manipulations from the ministry that end up being a major road block for their relationship. How he writes fifth year in particular is great, since he deviates from the formula early and thus we end with a very different ministry attempt to silence Harry's cries of Voldemort being back.

Against the World by Balmorhea is also great. Sirius runs away with Harry the after his parents are killed, and he has to raise him on the run from the wizarding world.

Some one shots about Harry and Sirius also. None of these are disgustingly sappy, though some are so called family fics. Some are also incredibly dark.

Sticky situations by sailoranime just some small non-AU moments from the fifth book

Visions and Revisions by Chlorine Trifluoride. Depressing and utterly, utterly beautiful. The writing in this fic is breathtaking. It's a slightly AU fifth year, with all the major events still happening, but Harry and Sirius being sexually involved with each other. Very Dark, and very good. Lots of flashbacks and hallucinations about James and Lily and all that.

All these can be found on fanfiction.net. I would sincerely recommend giving all of these a read.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1625069/1/The-Basement][The Basement]] by Marz1 is old (written in 2003) and has a few warts by today's standards, but is pretty readable nevertheless. Sirius kidnaps Harry prior to the start of his third year. It's a rescue of sorts.

#+begin_quote
  AU third year. I must have a sign on my back that says psycho paths please attack me. I would not put it beyond Dudley to afix such a sign to me, but I doubt he could spell it accurately enough for a psycho to understand.
