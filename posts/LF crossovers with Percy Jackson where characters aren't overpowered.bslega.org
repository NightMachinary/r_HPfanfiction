No godlike Percy that can defeat anyone, pls no romance, or stories where ALL seven of the prophecy go to Hogwarts, basically would like a well written fanfic with as little Mary sues as possible


** Well, considering you've asked for a crossover of PJU and HP, I'm assuming you've read all (or at least one) of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2720956/Engineer4Ever][Engineer4Ever's]] work.

If not, he has 3 series, all are femHarry each with one of the Three Great as her father. I'll link the first of each for you. linkffn(The Ever Twisting Wind; The Unrelenting frozen Seas; Consul of the Underworld)

Each femHarry has completely different personalities, aren't Mary Sue, due to the fact they are flawed as fuck (Rhode is by far the most flawed, but the best imo) and aren't OP. They are stronger than the average wizard (Rhode is way higher though, but not stronger than monsters and the Gods and Minor Gods are OP as fuck) and it has several subplots that are interesting. My biggest issue though, is that the author likes to introduce certain characters from other fandoms, like Pyrrha from RWBY, and I hate multi-xovers.

  Anguished soul tumbling though the wind, continuously searching for a place where its fame is its own. Once more, pushed into a new world, with new challenges, new threats, testing the mettle of her resolve and ability to survive. Fem!Harry.

  The Sea has many moods, many faces. This is mirrored by its children greatly. The icy seas shift and tide against the shore of a difficult path. Watch as a small ripple becomes a mighty typhoon in the world of monsters, gods, and demigods. Fem!Harry. Years One-Three, complete! Thanks for the support guys and gals!

  A child of the Rich One rises. Wielding a smile masking a plotting mind. Carving a righteous but dark path through a world more vast and mysterious than ever imagined. In this game of gods and men, it's her time to shine. Fem!Harry.

** If you want, here's mine that I just started writing again. It does have some romance, but it's kind of in the background, so hopefully it won't turn you off.
