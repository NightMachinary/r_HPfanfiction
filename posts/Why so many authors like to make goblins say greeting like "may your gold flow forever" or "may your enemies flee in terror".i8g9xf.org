It always puzzles me how many writers like to make goblins have this kind of cliché greetings that are too overused (in my opinion).

So, what fic was the first to use them? Why are still used? Aren't these greetings pointless? 😂

***** I can, in hindsight, see a lot of the flaws in Harry Crow, but it's still one of the few written works that have legitimately gotten my heart pounding from the buildup of tension/excitement. Also, I continue to love the way it has everyone's actions /including their mistakes/ flow naturally from the circumstances and their personalities, rather than "character X needs to do action Y in order to produce desired plot event Z, so that's what's going to happen even though it makes no sense for them to be doing so". RobSt did a good job of making Voldemort still an effective threat/antagonist even when he was utterly outmanned and outgunned by leaning hard into the tendency of terrorists to hit soft targets and the difficulty of defending against such attacks; the World Cup attack was seriously brilliant.

Characterization-wise, it's a bit of a mixed bag. Snape's and Draco's heel-face turns are handled excellently, but as pretty much always happens in RobSt's fics both Ron and Dumbledore get bashed into oblivion.

*** Don't you think these greetings are weird? I imagine goblins as greedy creatures that only value gold. Such things as "honor" (I would say) don't exist in the goblin society.

As such, something as a honourable greeting to a wizard (who belongs to a race they have had bloodshed in the past) is... rather strange for me.

And even more weird it is to become like a God has descended whenever Harry greets them like that. As if it was a password to become a Goblin Friend 😂😂

**** Honestly canon doesn't focus much on goblins and what they're like, all we know is griphook betrayed trio because he expected betrayal from them, probably due to past interactions with wizards. So there is a lot of leeway when it comes to how your goblins behave. Helpful goblins broke the mold, thus seen as refreshing initially....but then the trope got overplayed..... So many fics swing the other way, with them potrayed as barely tolerating wizards, ready to fleece them whenever.

******** They may not be human, but maybe after hundreds of years of interaction, they have absorbed some of our terms, and understand some of our customs.

Even cultures that are constantly fighting end up picking things up from each other, and at one point they became the bankers, so maybe after 300 years there was some subtle cultural exchange that would be unnoticeable unless you took a good look at records.

Maybe what they call 'honor' would be understood better as 'prestige'. Maybe prestige for them is extremely tied to possessions, maybe they do have a strict code of conduct that is very different from ours, and maybe doesn't make sense(for us). But for them is completely logical. It reflects their view of the world.

Those greetings, are trying to simulate some of that, they probably take inspiration from Sci-Fi, maybe Star Trek, where some races, like the Klingons for example, do have strange(for earthlings) greetings and phrases among themselves, and their idioms would sound really weird and/or rude for us.

For example, when toasting, they say the equivalent of, "May your blood scream!" and when 'greeting' another(most likely someone unknown/not close) they say "What do you want?" something that would be considered rude is normal for them, because their culture is harsher, a bit laconic and values strength, seeing things like pleasantries and overly formal things as a weakness.

They also have no expression for "Thank You".

So, here, people are just trying to represent these differences with that, some of them are very silly, but others seem to make sense.

**** I think sometimes in fanfictions they take the weird greetings in a different direction. They make goblins like a warrior, honorable race (a bit weird but it kinda explains the hype over goblin made weapons), and the greetings are something that most wizards totally don't bother with. These are usually fanfictions where the entire wizarding world is super duper racist and Harry has left for the muggle world. The greetings don't instantly make you the goblins friends, the goblins just like you (a lot of the time begrudgingly) a bit more than other wizards for bothering to respect their culture. But ya, in most fanfiction the greetings are weird and stupid.

In short it is an excuse for the Friendly!Goblins trope.

** The Goblin Greeting is a trope built on a trope, specifically that of the Greedy Bloodthirsty Goblin.

JK Rowling didn't give us much in the way of Goblin culture and even the characters of the books almost universally look down on them and are prejudiced against them. The Greedy Bloodthirsty Goblin Trope is interesting in that its shared in and out of the universe. That's how a lot of Canon characters view Goblins, and therefore how a lot of authors view them as well.

The problem is that its prejudiced and two dimensional. That's the whole problem with canon characters thinking that way. When authors adopt that two dimensional view of goblins as fact, not an inuniverse prejudice, you end up with flat two dimensional goblins. Not very interesting to read about.

So the second trope is born. An attempt to add dimension to the literal two point ls of characterization the goblins have been given. Make the greed a cultural fixation on gold, make the bloodthirst into a warrior society. Highlight differences between them and humans by giving them ritualistic greetings emphasizing these things. Its better than just playing the Greedy Bloodthirsty Goblin trope straight, and that's why it picked up so much popularity. Even if you are an author writing a fic that hardly focuses on Goblins at all, tossing in a Goblin Greeting is an effortless way to piggyback on the worldbuilding of others. Implying goblin culture and society without actually going into it.

Unfortunately, just using the Greetings trope without backing it up comes across even more two dimensional than the original trope. Which is why we get threads like this one.

Its all a shame too, because canon goblins are far more interesting. Outside of the in universe prejudice, the two words I would choose for Goblins aren't Greedy and Bloodthirsty, its Jealous and Crafty.

Jealous in its actual definition rather than popular use, "fiercely and vigilantly protective of one's possessions". Ownership is like "the thing" to goblins. Their different definition of ownership highlights a super interesting and hardly explored cultural difference between them and humans. Humans think a purchase is forever and the purchased item can be passed down on the death of the purchaser. Goblins think that a purchase is for a lifetime and that on the death of the purchaser, the item default back to the original owner. Two different views, neither of which are wrong persay, but which are a major source of conflict and Goblin "greed" wanting things back that have already been paid for, or wanting to be paid again.

I kind of cheated with Crafty since both meaning are important to canon Goblins, cleverness and intelligence seem to be prized traits while the actual act of creation and crafting is of vital social importance. It directly ties to their concept of ownership and pride in the works of their hands. To the point that every single coin in Gringotts is engraved with a code referring to the goblin that crafted it. Fleshing out goblin society based off of canon would see Craftsmen as the highest rung on the social ladder and thieves as among, if not the literal, worst of criminals.

TLDR: Goblin Greeting are a trope based on the Greedy Bloodthirsty Goblin trope, which is in turn based off of in universe prejudice. Canon goblins are more interesting then that. If you wanted to make a Goblin Greeting based on canon goblins it would read more like "May your vaults be impenetrable and the works of your hands bring you acclaim"

**** Yeah, it really comes down to the fact that fanfiction authors aren't professionals. Skill level varies wildly, as does opinion on canon, fanon, and tropes. Some authors likely can't remember that such greetings aren't canon and put them in for "accuracy", others just think they sound cool and put them in without considering the fact that Harry shouldn't know them immediately.

Then there are those that want to use the Helpful Goblin trope as a means to an end and having Harry be the only wizard respectful enough to use a Goblin Greedy is lazy way to get the Goblins to be Helpful enough to remove his horcrux/give him access to his hidden vaults/perform an inheritance test/reveal the thefts of Dumbledore etc etc. Then once the goblins have served their purpose, they, in with their tropes can be dropped from the story.

** They are trying to simulate cultural differences and how Goblins see the world differently through idioms.

Their equivalent of "Good Luck." may be "May you be wise." because they believe that wisdom brings success, rather than chance.

Or maybe "May your blades be sharp and your strikes true!" because they are more militaristic and believe that combat solves things

Or if you go the riches route "May your gold be ever flowing." because they value that above almost anything else.

Their equivalent of "How have you been?" may be "Are you healthy?" because they don't care that much for feelings(this one is from the Klingons)

We have things like that in real life, it's just that when people translate, they may put the equivalent expression rather than a literal translation.
