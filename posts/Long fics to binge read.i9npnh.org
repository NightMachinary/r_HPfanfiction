I am literally going out of my mind with boredom in quarantine, and I feel like I've exhausted my supply of good fanfiction to read. With that in mind, my request is basically the title. 100k? Great. 200k? Even better. 500k? Amazing. Above that would probably be my version of heaven. Thanks in advance 😊

edit: can confirm, am in heaven. y'all really came through. again, thanks a bunch :)

** What subgenres of fanfic do you like? There are a lot of really, really good long stories. If you tell me what fics you've enjoyed recently, I can probably give you some more specific recommendations. I'm biased towards serious fantasy AUs, so that's where I'd probably be able to help the most.

The ones I'd recommend for anyone are the *Pureblood Pretense* series (1.5 million words) and *The Phoenix and the Serpent* (350,000 words). They're both gripping reads. The latter is incomplete but closes some story threads at its hiatus, including one of the best story arcs in fanfiction.

You could also check out White Squirrel's *Arithmancer* and *Accidental Animagus* series, both of which are over a million words. Arithmancer is complete. These are a bit slower, more soap-opera-esque reads with a pretty wide appeal.

*** Woah, thanks for all of these. I'm a sucker for world building and magical theory, but I'm not picky at all. I can say that our tastes in fanfiction are pretty similar based on what you recced, so I'm going to be reading a lot for the next couple of weeks with these books alone.

**** In case you do run out, I'll leave you with some more that might especially interest you. These are all well-written and on the same tier as the ones I recced above.

*Alexandra Quick,* which someone recommended in the thread, is almost unfairly good. Its worldbuilding of Wizarding America is through framing and restraint, not detailed explanation. The plot is weighty but not blown up, writing is phenomenal. It's not heavy on magical theory, there are differences in the magic but they're largely cultural.

There are some really long, really good, complete next-gen epics out there. The *Stygian Trilogy* by Slide is probably the best of them. It's got adventure, historical context, good romance, great character work, and general excitement.

The other three that come close are the two Albus Potter series by *Vekin87* and *NoahPhantom* and G. Norman Lippert's [[https://www.goodreads.com/ebooks/download/2548866.James_Potter_and_the_Hall_of_Elders_Crossing][James Potter series]]. All four of these are around a million words total. Vekin87's series is very much in the spirit of canon, with a more complicated political plot but not super AU. It starts out rough but improves quickly, definitely worth reading. NoahPhantom's series is much more into the worldbuilding, magical theory, and plot twists; it's crazy and over the top. Lippert's series is very much more a YA affair and is a little lower-stakes than the other two.

** HPMoR is long if nothing else although I find it better to read in spurts than straight up binge

linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom) is huge and has great world building but is sadly abandoned on a massive cliffhanger

linkffn(something wicked this way comes by the mad mad reviewer) is 160k words and complete

linkffn(the many deaths of Harry Potter) is also decent length and a good read

linkffn(strange visitors from another century) is some of the bet writing I've come across in fanfiction, a bit over a quarter million words, and should be completed in the next year or so (I hope- 28 chapters since 2012 and there are only two more left and the author already is speaking about the sequel on tumblr (and is also the only reason I even have a Tumblr account)

linkffn(what's a gungan) is 83k words, and complete as well as being a decent read

linkffn(too many champions) is a fun cracky fic at 83k words and complete

linkffn(the havoc side of the force) is also a nice fun read imo at 200k+ words but it hasn't been updated in about a year, although it only has 24 chapters since 2012 so it may not be abandoned

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

** haven't finished it yet, but I've just started reading a great doc called Linkffn(A Cadmean Victory)

Also Linkffn(The Venom Peddler) is gorgeous

If you want something really cerebral, Linkao3(works/11914698) is fantastic with an adult asexual Regulus Black who comes home to help the war effort and struggles with his own ethics and a lot of Magical theory and stuff. But super tiring for me to read because of mind fog---but it was well worth muddling though!

If you don't mind starting some that are still being written, there is also Linkffn(New Blood) which is Hermione-centric and fantastic

And also Hermione-cenric, Linkao3(11163924) this one is so incredibly atmospheric and really captures something.

Also Hermione centric is Linkffn(Because Why Not)

There are a few different ones, hopefully one of them will give you something to stick your teeth into

  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means.

** my favourite is The planned series. It is co-written by LeighaGreene and inwardtransience.

It is 13 years old Bellatrix Blackthe is accidentally transported 30 years forward into another universe. Starts in third year.

first "book" have 470 K words and contains the third year. Second is a 100K work and contains many things that happened in summer between 3rd and 4th year. 3rd fic has currently 433 words and it has not reached yet the first task. It is long, but not boring. Contains a lot of worldbuilding and mythology/magic lore.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** A good long read that I enjoy is linkao3(536450) at 550k. Has a sequel in progress. It's written by someone formally trained in writing, and it shows. Quality of prose is incredible. Just as a note, the main ‘pairing' doesn't happen in this fic or even the sequel yet, it's tagged for future purposes but the fics been going since 2012 and it hasn't happened so far, so it's pretty much genfic. (Fem!harry/Snape. )

The opening paragraph is what hooked me and pretty much sets the standard of prose and heavy imagery for the whole series:

“Summer lay thick across Hogwarts, the sunlight like butter. Hagrid was reporting a record number of bowtruckle births; Sprout had gone to holiday in Egypt; Minerva was up to her whiskers in preparations for the upcoming term. Dumbledore spent the time being inscrutable and mysterious, but that was so typical of him it was hardly worth remarking.”

I love it. It focuses on genuine friendships between Harriet and others, and also very convincingly follows her growing up, including the psychological development of teenagers, like learning to manage anger, emotions, connecting with others, opening up to others and encouraging others to do the same. No bashing. Nobody is OP. Nobody is OOC. As an aside, I often don't like Lupin/Sirius Black fics because it's over the top but this fic presented it in a really age sensitive and background sort of way that I appreciated. Thoughtful, wholesome, carefully thought out and idk, rich characters written in genuinely convincing ways. I hope you like it. I sure did.

All his stories are linked together, coz, like he says, he's telling one story. The first one I read though, was Strangers at Drakeshaugh and I discovered the rest while waiting for that to update. It's a good thing that the whole thing is complete now.

** I'm actually really surprised that these threads /never/ mention linkffn(Benefits of old laws)

Sane Voldemort adopts Harry and starts doing his revolution legally. Might just be the only 800k+ word fic I've seen that isn't bloated nor full of tropes. Focuses on politics more then outright conflict, but the Death Eaters are still a thing that's actively going on. It also treats Dumbledore really well while still having him as an enemy - looks like bashing at first, but then his reasoning is revealed, and he slowly changes from cliche to a decent old man.

Also has light/dark unity of sorts, which is something I've barely ever seen in fics.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater.

Both are incomplete, but petal in the rain is ongoing and she DOES update, even if she leaves it for feckin ages. We're grateful anyways because both are examples of exceptional writing and storytelling. Every Other Midnight starts off slow and the writing is a little clumsy but it improves in leaps and bounds, trust me. I have mor reccs but you're overflowing anyways haha. Good luck!

** I have no idea if there's something you'd be particularly interested in so:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028]] Very AU. I liked it more than I expected to, but it had the unfortunate side effect of making me hate most founders era fics after.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born]] One of the better time travel fics imo. Harry goes to merlin's time (if I remember correctly) and lives his way to the present. Not very Dumbledore friendly.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16697380]] Tom Riddle to Harry's time. It was pretty interesting (I really liked the way the different characters were written).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344]] Hogwarts starts later. It handles the Dursley's pretty nicely, its more neglect than dramatised full on abuse. Harry's personality in this one was really interesting.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935]] WBWL. Its actually good (Harry, or Adrian in this case isn't some badass person for whom everything works out fine). His twin isn't bashed either. I don't thing anyone is really outright bashed and I especially loved the snakes.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea.

** This is one you could probably figure out by yourself, but consider reading anything of Rorschach's Blot, when it comes to the length requirement check out "Odd ideas". It isn't one fic, but a story file that's >800k linkffn(2565609), and some of the chapters have sequels. If you haven't read his "Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!" yet, I must recommend it. Linkffn(3695087) If you read Make a wish linkffn(2318355), be sure to read all 3 parts followed by Terminal Justice linkffn(11965672) and be sure to use the FFN search engine to search for "Make a Wish" communities, the first page of results has already 3 where the lowest amount of filed stories is 17.

Also a Natsume's book of friends crossover linkffn(7532674) The Backwards with Purpose stories linkffn(4101650) A Bleach crossover trilogy, I remember enjoying it, but I am not sure whether it is complete. linkffn(7197392) The Nightmare Man and companion pieces linkffn(10182397)
