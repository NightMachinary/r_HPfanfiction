Earlier today, someone asked for the website I use for accents (Fleur, Krum, Hagrid, house-elves, etc.). I linked it in that discussion, but here it is again:

Other resources that some fic writer somewhere may enjoy:

The infamous Lexicon for when you need to get a timeline correct:

[[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/calendars-harry-potter-novels/]]

Another of my favorite Lexicon resources, on the layout of The Burrow:

[[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2007/10/18/how-do-we-know-the-layout-of-the-burrow/]]

And Hogwarts floor by floor, of course:

[[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/place/atlas-wizarding-world/atlas-of-hogwarts/hogwarts-castle-floor-floor-introduction/]]

For giving original characters names appropriate to their nationality and year of birth:

[[https://www.name-generator.org.uk/character/]]

[[https://www.behindthename.com/random/]]

Perhaps my all-time favorite post on this sub, about the importance of tea:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/h0aqof/a_note_to_american_fanfic_writers/]]

Tumblr post on the Marauder's likely accents:

Any other writers have pages you find yourselves visiting a lot and want to share?


** Street View on Google Maps for stories where the author actually knows what he is talking about. For example, I believe, most Northumbrian stories can be localised to a meter. He has never replied to my queries about it, but I believe that for example “Dennis” linkao3(3068372) happened mostly at [[https://goo.gl/maps/HdaNn8svTVYvsdiX7]] (although, Northumbrian haven't mentioned the bench there, it could be useful when Lesley's legs begun to be a bit shaking).

I use a lot of maps for my writing as well. I found some interesting facts. For example, if we consider Little Whinging to be in the place of IRL Blackwater or Camberley in Surrey, then it would be just next to The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst? That just begs to be used somehow.

Or if (as Northumbrian claims) Hermione lived in Itchen Worthy near Winchester, which in my mind would lie somewhere in the Itchen Valley, they are just around one hour drive from Little Whinging.

Or that Little Whinging is just thirty kilometres as the crow flies from Box Hill of Jane Austen's “Emma” fame?

*** Yep.

Jim Butcher somewhat famously wrote the majority of the Dresden Files without actually ever spending any significant time in Chicago... because Google Maps is so detailed. He could measure distances and count the number of streetlights etc to make sure he was accurate with what Harry Dresden was dealing with (even the locations and appearances of abandoned buildings).

** The links for the accents and the slang is extremely useful!

Another link I'd recommend is this one: [[https://potterwords.livejournal.com/9493.html]]

It contains a full list of various Harry Potter things like spells, sports teams, and the like, and it also tells you whether or not to capitalize or italicize those things. It's super useful!

** Those food & class essays were truly excellent...

It also took me this long to realise that Snape was not actively setting out to humiliate *the Harry we know* in PS, but his perception of who Harry was based on his known class background. That really makes the scene resonate differently.

** On my birthday in 1977, Remus Lupin transformed into a werewolf. How sad. Not that I was alive in 1977, but still.
