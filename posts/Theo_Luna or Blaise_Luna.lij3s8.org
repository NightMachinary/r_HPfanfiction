Hi! I'm a big reader of Dramione, and in most of my favourites, the side pairing is often Luna with Theo or Blaise and I was wondering whether there were any fics just for those pairings:) I can't seem to find any that have more than 4 chapters!


** Ao3 has over 200 fics for [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=word_count&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=Luna+Lovegood*s*Theodore+Nott][Luna/Theo]] and roughly the same for [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=word_count&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=Luna+Lovegood*s*Blaise+Zabini][Blaise/Luna]]. Sadly there isn't a filter for the main ship, so likely many of the longer ones will probably only have them as side ships, but they are still there.
