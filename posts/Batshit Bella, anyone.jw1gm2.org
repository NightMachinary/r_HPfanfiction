Big number of stories (that I come across) with central-Bellatrix are awfully OOC imo, and thus not to my personal taste. I'm not in a good or redeemed Bella mood.

Any good fic recommendations where she's her playful, sadistic, "unhinged" self? Ty!

** linkao3( we shall all perish if the dark lord comes) is actually just a character study of her but it really is phenomenal and disabused of more than one misconception regarding her mannerisms and shed some light on how her mind works to make her how she is
