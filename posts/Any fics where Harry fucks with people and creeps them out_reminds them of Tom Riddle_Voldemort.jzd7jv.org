Particularly how he does it in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11907443/1/Full-Circle][Full Circle]].

Just to be clear, this isn't me asking for fics /like/ Full Circle (though I certainly won't turn down a good rec), it's just me asking for fics where Harry knowingly creeps out people (Dumbledore or Snape in particular) by knowingly acting like Tom Riddle/Voldemort or by just scaring them or whatever. Like in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11851668/chapters/26757045][Easy Fear]], for example, where he only talks to people in Parseltongue and insults them and stuff while simultaneously scaring them!

Thanks for any recs!

I just started but the entire point of the Fic is for Harry to remind people of Tom Riddle (especially since Tom Riddle is in Harry's head).

The idea is that pretty much Harry will have an alter ego(Tom Riddle) which is better at magic and smarter than him, but it only takes possession of Harry once he's unconscious or about to die

** In linkao3(15068012), Harry is brought to Azkaban with Sirius. Since Harry has the same raspy voice stemming from overuse of parseltongue, Bellatrix teaches him how to do an impression of Voldemort.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

** linkffn(Through the Veil by darienqmk)

Harry and Ron go back in time to an alternate universe where they don't exist, meaning that Harry isn't The Boy Who Lived and Ron doesn't have his family. They integrate themselves as Third Year Hogwarts students and make plans to mess with everyone.

Their first target is Dumbledore. They pretend to be orphans wanting to enroll in Hogwarts and Harry fucks with him by (loosely) repeating what Tom Riddle said to Dumbledore the first time they met.

  Two alcoholic men decide to jump through the Veil. This takes them back to August 1st, 1993. They don't have much to lose, anyway - the only thing left to do is to go around and piss everyone off, true Marauder fashion. So they do exactly that.
