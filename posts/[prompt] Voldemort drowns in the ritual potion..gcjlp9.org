*** However Pettigrew with only one hand and profusely bleeding from the remains of the stump on the other arm did not have the strength to pull Voldemort from the cauldron leaving Harry to watch and listen to Voldemort attempting to scratch his way to the top of the cauldron, screaming from the absolute pain of being boiled alive.
