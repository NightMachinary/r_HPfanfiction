F/F romance. Hermione/Luna.

SUMMARY: Little by little, in her own unusual way, Luna Lovegood begins to romance Hermione Granger.

DISCLAIMER: I own nothing but my love for cancelled television shows.

AUTHOR'S NOTE: This occurs after Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows. Suspend your disbelief, ignore the canon Ron/Hermione destined ending, and hopefully have a good read.

Sweet, quirky and believable. Dreiser also wrote the inspirational source for Aucune Defense Pour Toi, which was the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2cfzjo/august_book_club/][bookclub fic a few months ago]].

**** There are others, of course, but few are complete and fewer include any sort of progression of interest. Usually it's a 'eureka! I'm gay after all!' and much discussion of other peoples' judgments about it becomes the story.

What this isolated little sub-genre really needs is a heartfelt story where Hermione is the pursuer. Perhaps she finds herself driven by a fascination in Luna's hopeful view of the world after suffering from the realities of insurrection and subsequent re-stabilization politics. Anyway, someone less of a smart-ass than me should try to write one.
