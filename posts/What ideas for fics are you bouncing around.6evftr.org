I have a hp/star wars crossover idea I've been bouncing around in my head. Basically Harry is the MOD and de-facto leader of the wizarding world. A cataclysmic event (I haven't decided what yet) forces the remaining magicals to band together and leave Earth. Somewhere along the way Harry and the rest of the magical's become separated and he ends up in the SW universe. He now has to find his way back to his people doing whatever it takes, even if it means joining the empire.


** Magical creatures are the source of magic. There used to be an ancient ur-race of powerful, magical creatures that had to adapt to survive. They split their power into magical creatures and intelligence into humanity. Some humans have the innate ability for their souls to resonate with their counterpart, allowing them to use magic. Due to the extreme longevity (and seclusion - in my version there are loads more creatures than the wizarding world knows of) of these creatures a creature has never died before its wizarding partner.

This leads to occasional shenanigans. Sometimes a post-coq crops up that was actually a wizard remembering tiny fragments of his previous life thanks to an unusually strong bond with his source-creature.

And now for the meat of the idea, the actual story. During the Triwizard Tournament first task, the Horntail sends a blast of fire into the crowd. Hermione snaps a shield into place and the magic of her shield and the dragonflame resonates. Hermione becomes aware of her bond with the dragon - who she can now feel faintly as an extension of herself - when members of an ancient order of wizards who have found their creatures contact her.

Hermione now has to deal with the consequences and dangers of being intimately bound to a powerful magical creature that still very much has its own primal instincts, so she has to hang on to her humanity to avoid being overwhelmed and subsumed by the dragon.

Voldemort, on the other hand, is a wizard who found his creature and killed it in a failed attempt to properly reunite his soul and ascend to the godlike level of the ur-creatures. Instead, he consumed its soul, overpowering it with his own and forever failing to reunite them properly. His magic did get one hell of a boost though. Voldemort went through a period of introspection and struggle after that culminating in him reforming himself as a champion of humanity. He wants humanity to overcome the remnants it holds to these ancient beasts, partly to ensure that no-one ever does succeed where he fails but also to take revenge on the creatures and take out his anger at them. As Hermione starts getting closer and closer to her dragon, he gets more and more interested.

And now the central conflict of the story arises. Hermione, the ever-analytical and level-headed voice of reason must try and retain her humanity while dipping ever further into the dragon's power. The war picks up so she must use her newfound pyrokinetic inclination to keep her and her friends alive. Voldemort meanwhile shatters the Statute and paints the magical creatures as the greatest enemy in the event's wake. Backed by muggle governments and seen as the hero leading the charge, Hermione and friends must struggle to survive and bring him down, which they find difficult as they do not disagree with Voldemort's 'humanity supreme' approach.

I'm not sure how this story ends, as I do not know if I even want Hermione to succeed and bring down Voldemort (as I'm very much a HFY guy myself - therefore painting the pro-humanity guy as the antagonist is extremely interesting for me).

** I have several ideas but the current one that excites me the most would be a Harry Potter AU set at around 1650-1680 ~ when sailing was a huge thing and pirates and the colonial powers were fighting about the new world.

In my AU magic isn't as powerful as it is in Canon. Magic itself can't be cast over distance over the sea and on nearly every ship there is a mage of some sort. The high class kids go to Hogwarts and other schools and get real wands and learn powerful magic whereas the poor people and kids learn it by trade from the old ship mages kinda like a ship boy became a sailor. So they have the same magical power as the highborn class but they lack the finely attuned wands and education. Hell most of them don't even know their proper letters.

Harry Potter is still highclass and gives us an insight into the aristocratic side of things whereas another pov and the bigger protagonist is a poor ship boy on a trading galley who eventually becomes a ship mage on a pirate ship which will be under the employ of the British royal navy eventually.

I know nautical sailing terms and would try to incorporate them into the story line. Depending on where this story leads me to it will hopefully reach the caribics where the antagonist turn out to be voodoo native mages who work together with the spaniards.

I already have the beginnings but I am unsure about the scope. Sometimes I spent a lot of time on the growing up and learning to sail part. Getting caught in a storm, losing the elder ship mage during a skirmish and then having to take on the responsibilities himself.

I don't even have a name for the protagonist though. At first he was a Weasley but apart from the poverty and the looks he didn't have anything in common. I thought about making Harry the protagonist and giving the role of the aristocratic Hogwarts mage to Neville or Malfoy.

Oh yeah and learning magic is a huge part. Magic words are a closely guarded secret by the Hogwartians. Learning on how to nonverbally cast is one of the first things they learn. Which exerts more endurance and concentration.

** Tired of being defeated for millennia by the knights of the cross, Nicodemus hatches a cunning plan. Using an ancient ritual, he will propel the denarians through the Never Never and into a new world. Not content to simply go without a last barb however, Nicodemus gets one final shot in at his hated foes. Tricking Molly Carpenter into taking up a coin and coming with him willingly, he uses her as the vessel to carry the 30 pieces of silver into another world.

In that other world, Hagrid finds a young girl naked and alone in the middle of the forbidden forest, and takes her back to Hogwarts, where she is nursed back to health. The only thing Molly has on her is a blackend silver coin, which Dumbledore confiscates. Her memory is full of holes, but she remembers her family and is convinced that "Harry" will come to save her, and that he is a wizard. Still, despite Dumbledore's efforts no one can locate her family. However, it's obvious that Molly is a young witch, and she will begin classes at Hogwarts in the fall once she has recovered. She is placed with the Bones family, and makes friends. However, she keeps dreaming of a voice, coming from a piece of silver, the same one that

That school year, Harry does indeed arrive at Hogwarts, but so does Lord Voldemort in the body of Quirrel. Going into the woods to hunt for Unicorns, Voldemort finds a new way to build himself a body in the form of the coin bearing Anduriel. However, he does not immediately do so. Instead, he gathers up the coins in the woods, and begins to distribute them amongst the magical world. He finds the one locked in Dumbledore's office, and gives it back to Molly. Now with the Death Eaters reformed as the Knights of the Blackened Denarius, Voldemort launches a full scale assault upon Hogwarts. Dumbledore manages to hold for a while, but Voldemore reveals there are traitors in Dumbledore's ranks: Harry Potter and Molly Carpenter have taken up coins as well. The youths try to reject them, but even so the knights of the Blackened Denarius close in on them.

Just then, a man and woman, bearing shining swords, arrive and give battle to the death eaters. The woman is known as Shadow, the man is Harry Dresden. Shadow and Harry battle fiercely alongside Dumbledore, but even so they are overwhealmed by the Death Eater Denarians. Harry tosses an extra sword to Molly, who takes it up and rejects her Denarian and gives battle. Harry Potter recieces the sword of Godric Gryffindor and also joins in. Together, the four knights and Dumbledore drive off the Denarians, taking many coins from fallen foes. There is peace, for now, but Andariel and Voldemort are still out there.

Together, four knights of the Cross take up their swords and begin the eternal war against evil again.

** I've got a bunch I consider "active" in my google docs.

1) Witcher!Harry. Uses the tried and true (cliche) formula of Harry being raised by someone other than the Dursleys, and then returns to England at some later time. Currently just in the plotting phase

2) Harry/Bellatrix timetravel. Goal would be to just take something like Delenda Est and not ruin it with bullshit. I've got 2 chapters written, but it's kind of in limbo right now

3) about 8 different Harry/Daenerys ideas. Current one I'm tinkering with is Harry being in Qarth when she arrives there. It's pretty bad.

4) Harry Potter/Mass Effect fusion. I've done a lot of planning on this one, and it's actually in the writing phase. It's just a matter of taking time to write (instead of browsing reddit, for example). I plan to do a set of stories, with the first one being a prequel to ME1. Somehow I have to resist the urge to make it Harry/Femshep. (maybe Harry/Tali for lulz)

5) Harry/Worm story. Oneshot with Harry being a part of the Leviathan fight, with enough of an open-ended finish to leave a possibility of a continuation. I'm not one to just write an OP wankfest either, so it should be an interesting oneshot if I ever finish it (it's about halfway done, but I decided to rewrite it from first person rather than third)

6) Pure worm story. Indy!Taylor essentially, with a bit more math and logic behind it, without going OP and without relying on too much filler. This is my current story I've been posting. 4 chapters up with 2 more waiting for me to revise.

*** 1) I'd be interested to see that Witcher one because I could conceivably see Witchers as just being a thing in a magical world.

2) N/A - Don't get the Bellatrix stuff.

3) With all due respect, it sounds pretty bad. How do you plan to handle it? Harry Potter and Co exist in GoT world or actual planeswalker stuff? Either way it leads to a messy situation overall.

4) I mean, if you work the timeline right, maybe utilizing one of the many explanations for an immortal Harry, it could plausibly work that he gets bored of Magical Britain and goes off to explore the universe. Could just HAVE him be M!Shep, though. The backgrounds for the MC would allow that.

5) N/A - Not familiar with Worm

6) N/A - ^

** I plan on eventually getting around to my rewrite of the HP series from a leftist perspective.

the fics would probably be:

1) The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. From his childhood to 1945. Probably no point continuing it past there, due to...

2) The Man Behind the Monster. A Riddle fic detailing his years at Hogwarts, up to about the start of the First Wizarding War.

3) The Pack. Marauders fic that alternates PoVs between the four Marauders and Lily. Up to the prologue of Philosopher's Stone.

4) The Better Half - Ginny-centric fic. Essentially my catalyst for the actual rewrite part - some minor details messed around with, such at H/G being a thing by the start of HBP, Neville kills Bellatrix and Ginny gets Nagini. This would also focus a bit on Hermione, mainly, her social justice activism, which leads into...

5) Dictatorship of the Muggleborn. Imagine something similar to The Sum of Their Parts' premise, except canon-compliant. Kind of. Well, keeping the pairings and epilogue correct, but otherwise the slow process of turning magical Britain into a Marxist utopia.

9) The Cursed Child. Rewriting this hunk of junk to make sense within the context of the Harry Potter world. Delphini isn't Voldemort's offspring, she's a mentally ill child of Bellatrix and Rudolphus. Instead of a half-baked Time Turner plot, she seeks to resurrect her father's image with a recreated Resurrection Stone. Of course, it doesn't work out.

Names aren't remotely final, and it's likely I'll never get around to these. Just ideas floating around.

** I have far too many ideas. Excluding sequels, just the HP fics I have made folders for in my google docs:

1) A RWBY cross --- fem!Slytherin!Harry is accidentally punted through the Veil of Death during the battle in fifth year, ends up being roped into a manipulative!Ozpin's complicated nonsense.

2) A fic where Voldemort actually died for real on Halloween 1981, but an increasingly desperate and increasingly senile Dumbledore believes he's still around. The Girl-Who-Lived and her friends/family are not at all pleased with bullshit.

3) Sirius doesn't get arrested for no reason like an idiot, and raises the Girl-Who-Lived. She eventually ends up in Slytherin, but isn't an evil bitch (which is weirdly rare for some reason). Would go through the end of the second war, which would go very differently.

4) A far more rational diary!Riddle successfully resurrects himself during second year, and teams up with a (reluctant) Slytherin!Hermione to overthrow magical Britain.

5) A Star Wars cross --- mages reveal themselves to the world incidentally while repelling an attack by the Yuuzhan Vong (concurrent with first blood war). Earth joining the galactic community following the war /entirely/ fucks up events over the following decades.

6) A fem!dark!Harry goes back in time. She'd intended to prevent her parents' deaths, but the ritual dropped her in too late. Instead, she swipes Harry --- yes, Harry, time travel is weird --- from the Dursleys' doorstep, and proceeds to not even bother adhering to the original timeline, because she simply has no fucks to give. She has no fucks to give about most things, actually.

7) Lily didn't fully die, her soul bound to the Girl-Who-Lived long after her physical death. And she is /not/ pleased with Dumbledore's plots involving her daughter.

8) The Girl-Who-Lived is the daughter of Lily and Nemesis Adresteia. Inspired by a Percy Jackson crossover I read, but not itself a crossover with anything but classical mythology.

9) Due to shenanigans, Lily survives Halloween 1981. Witnessing the political aftermath of the war, she quickly decides the government of magical Britain must be destroyed.

10) My headcanon idea of how the first blood war went, starting from Orion Black's first day at Hogwarts (1939), following Riddle's development into a Dark Lord, through the shadow war between the Death Eaters and the Circle of Agastya, all the way to Voldemort's fall in '81.

11) An Inheritance cross, where I use a psudo-reincarnated Girl-Who-Lived as my vehicle to mercilessly mock Paolini's writing. But then, I use most of my fanfic to do that to JKR anyway, so no different, really.

Yeah, I have far too many ideas, too many to ever get to all of them. I know this.

** I had a couple that I posted recently - you can see here ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6dznx0/have_multiple_ideas_for_my_second_fic_could_use/]]) for more, but I also was tossing about a potenital few others as well:

- A /Logan/ style fanfic where an elderly Harry and Dumbledore, two of few remaining survivors in the Wizarding War, end up taking one last job, protecting a young girl (who's either a clone of Harry or a female Harry from another dimension) who could potentially stop Voldemort for good.
- A Crossover with Wonder Woman where instead of World War 1, Diana's first experience with humanity comes with the wizarding world and she teams up with Harry to stop Voldemort, who she believes is Ares, the God of War.

I think I'll leave it there for now.

** I've had quite a few running around in my head for a while... Most of them have at least part of a first chapter done but they're in limbo as with most of my ideas...

Most of them revolve about Lily being the daughter of Athena and Thor (From the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Specifically that version of Thor)) and somehow learning about Harry just before his eleventh birthday. There's even one where she found out during his second year after Minerva arrived at the Tower with a letter for his sister.

There's also one where Harry's the son of Poseidon, with Lily being the same as the above... And married to Buffy Summers.

By then, he knows of other types of magic and it makes him curious about the different worlds and how everything revolves around magic.

** Quick tangent: last time a similar topic came up ("What story ideas do you have that you probably won't ever write" or something like that), I posted about an MCU crossover that would've started with Harry deciding to travel the world some time after defeating Voldemort and ending up in NY during the events of The Avengers. A few days later I found linkffn(12307781) which fits that premise exactly and was about 10 chapters in when I found it.

** I have a few...

One - The story follows an eight-year-old vampire that is moved to Hogwarts when his home is destroyed. He can raise legions of undead troops with a simple thought, but he doesn't. He brings back his mother because he misses her and she just walks around the school with him.

Two - Tom Riddle had a brother. Merope survived and the two boys grew up in the Gaunt Shack. In the year that Tom goes to his first-year, his brother is abused and fears magic. Basically, Tom's entire rampage against Muggles is because they hurt his brother.

Three - Much like the one above, but James has a brother called some variation of 'Harry', but prefers Harry. The events are unknown so far, but it's why James calls his son 'Harry', after his brother (So you can already guess what happens).

Four - I made a post about this ages ago! I, however, finally started to write it. Salazar Slytherin's only son is woken up in 1993 when Tom, Ginny, and Harry are in the Chamber.

** I got a few ideas knocking around that are super-vague:

- 1 - Crossover with /The Order: 1886./ Through some kind of shenanigans Harry ends up stuck in their dimension/timeline/whatever, and bumps into the Knights when they're chasing a group of Half-Breeds across a London neighbourhood. They observe his magic (as he tries to help out) and think - as their organisation descends from the time of King Arthur, that he might be related in some way (through blood or otherwise) to Merlin, a figure rooted almost entirely in myth and legend, with only tenuous and obscure evidence to support his very existence. The Knights request that he come with them, although Gallahad - who's a member of Perceval's party - is perfectly prepared to use force.

He eventually - having nothing better to do - agrees to go with the Knights to Westminster and answer a few questions, but when it becomes clear that he has absolutely /no/ idea about anything that's going on in the world, let alone explain where's actually from or how his power works (Harry isn't prepared to answer anything in much detail when it comes to magic) the Lord Chancellor has no outward interest in him staying - ulterior motives and a longer-term plan aren't out of the equation here. Despite this, he voices no objections when Sir Perceval requests that Harry stay with the Knights for a time, if he wished to.

Harry agrees, meets and, through Perceval's rebelliousness, tags along with most of the characters of the main game - particularly Perceval, Gallahad, Isabeau, Lafayette and Tesla as they hunt Half-Breeds throughout the end of 1885 and into 1886.

For the overall plot progression, aside from Harry's pseudo-induction into the Order and the conflict between the other characters surrounding Perceval's wilful inclusion of him into the Order's operations despite his secrecy, I was thinking something along the lines of an action/conspiracy-thriller akin to the main game, where nothing is as it seems and enemies lurk in the most unlikely and hidden of places. Despite starting out as something of interest to Harry, who in the rest of his free time is looking for a way back home, he grows steadily more invested in the Order's mission, and follows an increasingly disturbing series of events (perhaps even across the world rather than just London), and tries to unravel the web of misinformation, link the clues, and expose the truth and the men (or monsters!) behind it. Will likely not be written for a long time.

- 2 - A historical story set during the /First and Second English Civil Wars/ between /King Charles I/ and /Parliament/ (1642-46 and 1648-49). It would likely centre on some original magical characters, and - like a thread that went round a few months ago here - turn the struggle between Parliament and Crown twofold, with witches and wizards fighting on both sides alongside the muggles. The whys and wherefores for the magicals are things I haven't really thought about yet, but I was thinking that it - being in the time before the Statute of Secrecy - would revolve around the role of the magical world in English society, and the effects of the wars would set off a chain of events leading to the eventual retreat of magicals from the muggle world.

There'd be plenty of court politics on both sides, conspiracies between toadies, generals and officials alike, appearances of famous historical characters, big battles, /hopefully/ some depictions of the English language in speech (at least the way that it was formed in sentences and such) that fit the period for immersion purposes - but not too much as to make like Shakespeare or otherwise incomprehensible to the average person.

For the wizards as much as the muggles, it would be a fight for the future of their way of life, and I'd want it to reflect as much in its character arcs and narrative weight. Will likely also (despite being a history student at university and studying the shit out of this period) never be written.

** 1) Harry has the cannon upbringing up to a certain year (currently I am unsure which year would be best to introduce change).

2) The fic starts with Hermione confronting Harry with a wizarding lineage book.

3) A family tree in this book links harry with a half brother/sister/both that he does not know about.

4) Harry confronts Dumbledore about this. Dumbledore has hidden the existence of these relative from Harry because he believes (correctly) that a reloationship with them could be dangerous and or turn harry 'dark'.

5) Harry, obviously, ignores Dumbledore and storm out of his office. He then attempts to find out more and see if he can get into contact with his siblings.

6) Wishing to at least attempt to control the situation, Dumbledore agrees to arange a meeting for Harry during a Holiday (winter or Summer).

I am still considering where to go from here.

Notes on the sibling(s):

1) They are Harry's half brothers/sisters through his mother who had a fight with James before they went into hiding, etc, etc. They could be younger or older than Harry, I am not sure what would work best.

2) They are not human. I am working off the idea of the morrgians from Circular Reasoning. My idea is that they would be the descendants of 'dark veela'. I'll just bullet point this to make it simpler:

- At some point, someone curses the veela.

- This causes a male veela to be born very rarely. As in one in ten thousand births.

- These male children are considered abominations, because there should not be make veela and they are a twisted image of the veela (more later on).

- Eventually, one mother is unwilling to kill her child and helps him to escape.

- He survives and has children with a human(wizard or muggle). These children are pure (not half) 'Dark Veela' (I really need a better name). The children could be male and female. This magical species will not, in my thinking, be limited as the veela are.

- Time passes, numbers grow over the course of a few hundred years, they establish cities with the capital locatied in the Ural mountains.

These beings are considered dark creatures and are hated by he veela and many others. However, because their numbers have grown to a certain point, they cannot simply be hunted down and the ministries of the world have been forced to recognise them as a powerful 'nation'.

Details on these 'dark veela':

- They are beautiful and have an 'allure', just like the veela. However, for those who can see past this beauty and resist the allure, the cruelty and malice of these beings becomes evident. Think of things like cruel eyes, wicked laughs, etc.

- Whereas the veela may use their abilities to draw in lovers just for procreating, happiness, etc, the 'dark veela' draw their prey in with their looks and allure and then, before or after sex, eat them alive. (Starting to see the twisted image thing yet?).

- These creatures shoudl probably have some sort of alternate form like the veela have but I have yet to come up with a none cliche one involving bat like wings and horns.

And that is about as far as I have got with this one. If anyone likes this idea, please write it yourself and send me a link because I will probably never do it and even if I did, it would come out poorly.

** I have a How to Train your Dragon crossover idea stuck in my head currently; it occurred to me that one could describe Harry as the child of lightning and death given his background history, and then my brain went places. Still working out finer details so it doesn't just end up a giant cliche-fest, but I like where it could potentially go.

** 1)

The idea suddenly came to me after rewatching 1st season of 'Legend of Korra', where 2 guys were blood mages.

Lily saved Harry via strong blood magic, they say. What if Avada Kedavra released some limits of his magic?

Sinse his childhood Harry can control his (and later not only his) blood to do things. Heal himself, always keep calm (later - severely harm anyone, even kill). In my head he is obsessed with keeping-calm thing because he likes the rhytm of his heartbeat and as a child he's afraid that his blood pressure will never be the same. When he's 7-8 years old he managed to harm Vernon protecting himself, so the Dursleys don't actually pay attention to him anymore. Still no having friends, Harry is obsessed with knowledge and ways to expand his blood abilities.

In Hogwarts he is sorted into Ravenclaw and that's where the story starts. He won't manage to make friends (he doesn't care about it anymore, he has the biggest library he has ever seen so he's happy) or he won't ever realize that some people will consider him as a friend. Because of his keeping-calm obsession he manages to learn Occlumency really fast (it helps that Snape doesn't hate him at all) and without revealing his blood magic. In future he will be able to heal Dumbledore's arm via his abilities. When Albus tells him that he must die from Voldemort's hand, my Harry doesn't mind it. He really doesn't care about living as he has no strong interest in it and he has nobody to stay for (shall I kill Sirius somehow? Maybe even in 3rd year?). When he tells it Dumbledore, old man cries and Harry doesn't understand why. I'm not sure about happy ending.

I'm trying to write it now. Idk if I succeed in it.

2)

PostHogwarts. When Harry died, Lord Death appeared and suggested to let him go back for his duty to defeat Voldemort. For price. Harry will start working for Him as a Reaper. He tells about advantages and disadvantages of it. Harry will be able to live forever, immediately ressurrect after dying (through Avada, flame, quartering or any way) in mint condition and not age after chosen time. Harry accepts it to defeat Voldemort.

Some years passed. Harry looks really different. He wears all wight, his hair is grey and only his eyes are Avada Kedavra's green. His work for Death is sometimes similar to usual office job. Counting deaths in his region (he is promoted to Head Reaper of England), making reports to Death while sitting with other Head Reapers at the table in some little special world, sometimes even taking souls personally when he feels like. It is declared that Lord Death will soon retire and go to eternal sleep. One of the Head Reapers must take place of Death through his competiton and the main task is duels. During the main plot Harry has also to fight for Death's place. I have in mind that being in mortal danger one of main characters uses the special portkey right to Harry (he said to use it only in motal danger) and appears behind his back in usual Death's gatherings and then has to stay even during a spectacular battle and that character is really shocked and awed with Harry's powers and his job.

Harry usually is really (even annoyingly) calm. It is because of his sealed insane power.

I have a few plots around that idea. In one he and his close friend Severus are appearing in front of Dumbledore and Snape in very similar parallel universe in Summer of 1996 and are to help with Voldemort's defeat. When Harry comes across Trelawny, he calls to Kassandra. It's revealed to others (2 Snapes and Dumbledore in that moment) that she is sleeping in her descendants and worked for Lord Fate in the past. Harry needs one of her old prophecies. Kassandra asks him a few questions after that and by accident reveals to others that Harry barely managed to restrain himself from killing Dumbledore at seeing him. She says, 'Why do you even help them? Some people gave their lives for that victory of yours. But you made the biggest sacrifice. You sacrificed your humanity. Not able to die, to see your relatives and friends in better world, not able to understand or feel most of people's feelings anymore... Doomed to eternal existence, not life... How did you manage not to kill him? To kill the one who led you to that path? To kill Albus Dumbledore? You even healed him...'. In this plot Severus is the one to control his seal. When his power is unsealed, he is really insane killing-machine. In the end Harry becomes Lord Death and Severus stays with him as Master of Death. I'm not sure if it's snarry or they're just really close friends.

In second one Harry after Malfoy's, some people's (like Stan Shunpike) and Snape's trials immediately runs away from England because even the new Ministry is not happy with him saving Death eaters. He demands Draco Malfoy to make for him new documents and then settles in Germany. Becoming the Reaper affected him severely. Some years passed. He works for Lord Death and sometimes makes artifacts on order. In England some powerful and unknown criminal appears. Draco and Snape work in Department of Mysteries. Suddenly in the hall the air the line appears. Unspeakables discover it was 1st line of the lost Kassandra's prophecy, somehow mentioning the wanted criminal. Somehow Draco and Severus are drawn into the hunt for him. Draco decides to consult his 'familiar hermit' because 'only heroes of the prophecies can trully understand them'. It will be an understatement to say that Severus is surprised to see really different Potter. Harry (a bit reluctantly) joins them on the hunt. In meantime the powerful and insane prisoner escapes from Hell (not just some dead mortal but ex-Reaper or something like that). Obviously, prisoner and criminal are the same man. Lord Death shall retire, the Competition starts. It is a detective, adventure and action story. This plot somehow is inspired by final scene of battle in 'Noblesse: The Beginning of Destruction'.

Why do I write this REALLY BIG post? Because I don't want to write anything, I want to read it, lol. Does someone have links for similar fanfics? I've read 'On a Pale Horse', 'Be the Death of me', [[https://ficbook.net/readfic/2929881][one pretty similar in some ways russian snarry fic]] and some others, if anything. But I really can't find something long and interesting with blood magic. I will also be quite happy if someone decides to take my ideas - just give me your link.
