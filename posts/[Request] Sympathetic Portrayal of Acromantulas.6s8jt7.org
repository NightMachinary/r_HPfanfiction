Do you know of any stories that agree with Hagrid and feature nice, redeemable Acromantulas? If not his spawn, then at least Aragog himself must be a "good", non-beastly character whom the story doesn't treat differently from someone like Dobby or Firenze.

** [[/r/spiderswearinghats]] and [[/r/spiderbro]] both have the nicest spiders on the internet. But anywhere else, especially /this/ fandom? You'll only see creatures for which there is only one option: burn it with fire.

In the meantime, enjoy a video of a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYFQQB9vqPw][Peacock Spider Christmas.]]

** ~shrugs~

I don't know if I've heard of any, sorry. I vaguely recall one where the Acromantulas were social enough to talk to Harry even they were trying to kill him (and he was more successfully slaughtering them). No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim, I think.

It's not completely out of the question to have friendly giant spiders, really. If they practised farming giant insects or snakes (which might make Parseltongue Harry sad), they wouldn't necessarily need to go out hunting in the forest.

And, they could probably use their silk/webbing in high quality textiles, building entire villages, trading or donating it to others in exchange for goodies...yes, I can imagine friendly Acromantulas.

Still imagining stuff, but maybe there could be a split in the Acromantula community (like the werewolf community has its bad guys led by Greyback); some who want to treat other races as friends, some who want to treat them as lunch.

*** You hit very close to my ideas! Too bad no story used this so far. Personally, I'm of a mind that Aragog was the leader of the "peaceful" side and Mosag was a more savage, evil spider who was a terrible influence over her children.

** I see where you want to go with this, but this is a car-sized carnivorous spider. By definition they do not play nice with other hot-blooded animals.

*** We humans are large carnivorous animals too, but the bulk of us learnt to exercise restraint and do not eat /sentient/ animals.

**** If the forest is large enough and the acromantula colony can support itself solely by hunting deer or something, then I can understand that. But there were well over a few hundred giant spiders in that colony. If they're all carnivorous, that's a lot of meat that goes toward keeping them fed, more than the Forbidden Forest in either the book or the movies appear to host. It makes sense to me that they would naturally eat anything that makes itself available.

** White Knight, Grey Queen by Jeconais features Harry allying with Aragog for the final confrontation. He and Aragog share a mutual respect that borders on friendship after their negotiations. Of course, it probably helps that [[/spoiler][Harry ensures their cooperation by giving them permission to eat the dead Death Eaters after the battle, whether they're actually dead or not.]]
