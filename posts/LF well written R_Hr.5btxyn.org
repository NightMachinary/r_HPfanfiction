I would like to first say I am NOT a fan of this pairing at all. They remind me way to much of my mom and dad and growing up in that hell hole /cough/ I mean house hold, doesn't help.

When Rowling said that Hermione and Ron might need marriage counseling, that's an understatement. I'm sorry but Hugo and Rose (stupid epilogue, stupid names, good grief) would grow up with some severe damage living in that environment.

I've managed to avoid this pairing but I also feel like I'm losing out on some great fanfics. Which is why I need well written stories from them. Some fanfics that will convince me to dive head first into this pairing.

Also, I don't want them together at the beginning, that wouldnt help me

First off, wrong. Second off, Hugo and Rose have the only decent names in the epilogue.

  Hermione tries to talk herself out of liking a particular idiot boy the way teenage girls have been doing since time immemorial: she makes a For & Against List. All the reasons we love Ron Weasley in handy list form!

**** Hugo came from Victor Hugo, Hermione's favorite author. She couldn't name him Victor though.

If Hermione named her son Hugo Victor, we can expect her daughter's full name to be Rose Lavender.

The names of Harry's children weren't that bad, James Sirius and Lily Luna made perfect sense. All controversy literally came from Severus. Well, my head canon says that Snape bailed out Ginny from multiple tight spots in Year 7, in hindsight, and Ginny never had a chance to thank Snape for that. She would feel indebted to him and fully agree with Harry to name one of their sons Severus.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord.
