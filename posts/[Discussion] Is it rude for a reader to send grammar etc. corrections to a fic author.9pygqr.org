Sometimes I see spelling errors, grammatical errors, or plot consistency errors in a fic I really love, and I wish that I could give feedback to the author to help them fix it.

Fic authors: if someone sent you a message with those kinds of corrections for your fic would you feel that the person was being presumptuous or would you be glad for the feedback? Are there certain forms of correspondence that you would be ok with as opposed to others? For example, if reviews/comments on your work are the only method of feedback available to the reader, would you prefer not to receive corrections in such a public form?


** That depends. If someone sends me a review with one little typo and nothing else, it annoys me. If you give feedback first and then add "I noticed you keep mixing set/sat" then I am grateful and will try to improve

*** It also depends on the author.

If it's a couple small things tacked on to the end of a comment, that would probably be fine for most people. But if it's a bunch of stuff or anything that would need major reworking, check to see if the author asks for constructive criticism in any of the author's notes.

If they don't, maybe just say you really like the fic and offer to beta. That way they can just turn you down if they're not interested.

Some people don't want to put in more work than they already are into something they're doing just for fun, in which case pointing out faults is just discouraging.

It is like playing video games and not going for no damage runs and 100% trophies and stuff! :) I think it's just fine for people to just casually write and not really care about grammar or super sensible or detailed plot stuff too much. As long as it is enjoyable!

*** I suppose that sending a small review with a single typo would be like nitpicking. What if they wrote something more comprehensive saying why they loved your fic and suggesting many comprehensive corrections to previous chapters?

**** If it's comprehensive and just part of the critique, I'd be totally fine with it

**** As an author, I wouldn't really mind corections, unless it is a few typos, as everyone has already suggested - I know we should spell check before posting and proofread, but sometimes a word or two might get missed and I would count that as nitpicking. But if I am making an error that is leading someone to get confused about the story or hindering their reading, I would definitely like to know and improve. One of my readers recently suggested a few cases, which were not errors but descriptions I could expand upon to make the reading more enjoyable and I was very glad they did it. What helped was also that they were very specific about their points and also polite.

** 100%, like if I'm writing something and I misspell something or my dyslexia absolutely kills me in a paragraph, sure tell me and give me the chapter and were cool. But then you have those fics where you're pretty sure the author hasn't had an enligh language course since 5th grade, and all of the comments are about how they can barely read the first paragraph without a linguist to determine what word that was even supposed to be in the paragraph...I feel like theres a time and place and if you notice something that not alot of people would even take the time to comment on then sure send off the message.

** As an author, I'm open to them and keep a list of things to fix for when I do a major edit of the work. As a reader I try to give feedback before pointing out issues, but sometimes when things confuse me (like some one referring to Filch as a professor when they had actually meant Flitwick) I just ask why they did that. Depending on how the author responds (i.e. if they're rude or insulting about it) I may decide that the fic is not worth reading. You publish work to get feedback and not all that feedback is going to be positive, so either ignore negative reviews or respond to them in a polite manner.

** I depends entirely on how it's said. I welcome every single CONSTRUCTIVE criticism, but if they're an asshole about it they get told exactly where to stick it.

** I'm fine with it in general, as long as you aren't being rude about it. A "hey, you've got a few mistakes in this paragraph" or "you keep mixing up there/their" or "didn't you say X happened before? Now you're saying Y happened" don't phase me, they're actually helpful.

But if it's just "Wow, how cliche!" or "Your spelling sucks" then why bother? Not specific enough to give me anything to go on.

** If someone sends a spelling/grammar/technical correction, or points out a basic continuity mistake thing like 'Neville was female in chapter one, and she was sorted into Hufflepuff in chapter four, but in this chapter is back to being a male Gryffindor?' I'll thank them and make the correction. I have so many different AUs in progress at once that I make these kind of which-story-who-what type of mistake frequently, and since I run without a beta typos can slip through.

In fact, I'd almost rather a 'Just so you know, you spelled Voldemort as Voldemtro' than 'pls update soon'; to me a correction shows much more engagement and care. I'm immensely grateful that they were paying that much attention, and willing to take the time to point it out to me so I could make my story better.

If it's something more basic, like 'your Harry is boring and weak, completely OOC, and lacks any meaningful drive in this story' well. . . that's not as easy to correct. I still deeply appreciate it, and I'll take it into account moving forward, but I write fanfiction loose and casually, and hardcore deep edits are something I just don't have time for.

Either way, I don't care if it's public or not. I have nothing to hide. Plot problems and typos happen, and given the choice between everyone seeing the correction or me not being informed, I'd take public every time.
