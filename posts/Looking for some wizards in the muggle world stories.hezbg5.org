Not "muggle weapons beat wizards" mugglewank, just something where wizards learn everyday things about muggles and are like "hey, that's actually quite clever". Like Exile by bennybear.


** Yes please! I just inhaled exile yesterday and I'm looking for something similar.

** Half the stuff wizards use were "inspired" by Muggles (camera, wireless, Express, Knight Bus, gramophone, etc)

** Um, The Man Who Lived might qualify. It's also centered on Draco living in the muggle world... but it's less of a 'muggles are quite clever' than it is a 'huh, we're pretty much the same'. Slash, but the romance is secondary to... everything else, really. I'd honestly consider it gen even with the pairing. linkao3(9167785)

*** There's one like this too, but where Hermione helps Draco acclimate to the muggle world after he gets sentenced. He has to live there for X amount of time. I skimmed the first chapter of this one and I didn't recognize it so I didn't think it was the one I remember. Does mine ring a bell?

  Draco breaks a cup, and one thing leads to another. A story of redemption, tattoos, dreams, mistakes, green eyes, long conversations, and copious amounts of coffee. Set in New York twelve years after the war.
