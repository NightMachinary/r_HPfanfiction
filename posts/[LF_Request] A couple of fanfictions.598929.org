1: Looking for a fanfic where the animation charm is featured prominently. 2: Looking for a fanfic where harry potter either purchases or goes to camp half-blood. (70k or more words please) Thanks for any help fellow redditors.


** The animation charm is underrated. I mean really, can't you just animate their robes to strangle them? Take that Voldemort!

**** Indeed.

And by the way, it's "Camp Half-Blood", not Half Blood Camp.
