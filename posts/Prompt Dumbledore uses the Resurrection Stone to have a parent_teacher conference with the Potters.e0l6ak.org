They might know more about prophecy and how it really works, and in that case whether running away was ever really an option.

Was Lily's attempt known to be useless to her? We don't exactly know what caused Harry to survive, it could be that Lily was aware of or even had set in motion beforehand the sacrificial magic that enabled him to throw off the killing curse.

And just because Lily died for Harry, does that mean she would tell him to run away and save himself, or does it mean she would understand his willingness to die to protect those he loved, just like she did? Especially if, again, she knew he wouldn't /really/ die.

It does if Harry doesn't know this. The act of killing yourself is more than the end result of being dead (or not). What kind of asshole parent encourages their kid to kill themselves? One that's not actually your parent, that's what.

#+end_quote

It's explained, and shown, by Harry in book seven that sacrificing yourself to protect others does in fact cause the others to be protected from that specific danger. Voldemort was fucking neutered by Harry when Harry sacrificed himself to protect his friends. Lily may have done something to increase potency, maybe Voldemort breaking his thrice-promise to save Lily helped. Maybe Dumbledore increased the potency of the anti-Voldemort protection. It doesn't matter. What we do know is that Harry had an anti-Voldemort shield at least until Voldemort took his blood, if not to his 17th birthday /because/ Lily died to protect Harry from Voldemort.

#+end_quote

And this is where we disagree. If my kid ever considers suicide, regardless of the surrounding reasons, I am going to fucking try to convince them otherwise. The mental trauma after a situation like that can't possibly be understated. Sure, Harry has [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor][plot armor]] and the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSpirit][mental fortitude of a god]], but in-story Lily does not know this. She doesn't know that Harry won't be traumatized forever because of this.

This is why I don't consider the shades in the forest to be actual dead brought back. They did not act like parents watching their kid die, they acted like an artifact of death taking the easiest way to convince the user to die.

That's exactly my point. If she had any inkling that this would be possible, she didn't throw herself in front of Voldemort "uselessly". She did it with purpose.

How can you know whether or not she knows? She's not a ghost, stuck in this world. She's in the afterlife. She might know everything there is to know, she might see the paths of a thousand futures. She might reckon that if Harry let all his friends and every. single. person. he knew besides the Dursleys die at the hand of Voldemort because he hid and refused to face him, he'd hang himself the next freaking night. I think that mental blow would be a lot worse than what ended up happening. And she might know that it's simply useless for Harry to run, as "neither can live while the other survives".
