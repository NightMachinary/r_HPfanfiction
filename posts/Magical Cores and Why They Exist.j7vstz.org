** I dont like magical cores because it makes magic look like a substance. Magic in Harry Potter is more like risky wishmaking where the wish has its own ideas in my opinion.

Ah yes, the well known phenomenon of someone playing the piano but having to stop because their piano core is empty, or having to stop doing their mathematics homework because their maths core is running low.

I don't reject magical cores because it makes Harry too strong; I reject them because it makes wizards too weak.

That and because it directly contradicts canon, where we see wizards casting magic for hours on end without any hint of magical exhaustion, and where we see numerous high level magical fights in which no magical exhaustion is ever mentioned.

*** Have you ever played piano? It is exhausting. And I am terrible at it, so this may be a personal issue, but math is very tiring for me.

Infinite magic makes wizards nigh-invulnerable. It is why most games and stories that have wizards put in boundaries like "MP", or exacting a toll on the caster (a la Raistlin in Dragonlance).

It makes HP boring, which is the biggest cardinal sin of all, not to mention it makes zero sense why anyone would fear /anything/ except Unforgivables.

"Oh no! There's 20 bad guys here!"

"Don't worry, I know how to silently cast reducto/don't need wand movements"

/spams explosion spells every second for the next 9 hours/

"Feel like going for a jog? All this standing still and steamrolling bad guys left me full of energy."

I understand why JKR did it. She had a raging boner for making sure everyone knew love and friendship were stronger than violence (if only someone had told the Syrians that!). But she wrote a story about a war, then provided a superpower with zero limitations to every combatant.

Infinite casting is so ridiculously OP that you're right - even the most absurd magical core fanfic, the ones where Dumbledore prostrates himself before H/Hr in awe of their power (real "It's over 9000!!" type stuff) are far more interesting.

I'm not saying magical cores are the best solution. I don't really like the idea of quantifying an arcane force like magic. But it is for damn sure more realistic than "Lord Voldemort! We attacked Hogsmeade 4 days ago, but everyone is still shielding! What should we do?"

The point is that in every other area of human endeavour, we are happy to attribute the differences between individuals to the myriad characteristics, both learned and innate, which make them who they are as individuals.

I am simply proposing that the approach to magic is the same as the approach to every other human skill: people don't have some kind of talent fuel they use up when they perform that skill. Resorting to such an idea is not at all necessary to explain how it is that different people do things to different degrees of competence, and indeed is a very odd way to explain differences in competence.

Inexhaustible magic makes wizards nigh-invulnerable /against Muggles/. Which is what they should be and how they are depicted in canon.

Inexhaustible magic does not make wizards invulnerable to other wizards, because those other wizards have access to the same inexhaustible force. The scales are balanced.

Moreover, there are still power differences between wizards - having the same /quantity/ does not mean you have the same /quality/. The fact that Neville can cast Shield Charms all day does nothing to help him when a single one of Voldemort's curses will smash through that Shield Charm. But the fact that Voldemort can cast powerful curses all day does nothing to help him when his opponents are behind a Fidelius Charm.

Magical warfare in a system where both sides have inexhaustible magic of varying strengths is all about picking the correct strategy and exploiting your enemy's weakness, rather than magical core approach of comparing your magical dicks and seeing whose is bigger.

***** Some Spells require emotions to cast

So I imagine the limit on some spells is how long you can last till your just emotionally worn out

** Rowling's magic system is so soft it's not even a system. It's a borderline arbitrary toolkit. If it were a system, you could infer the existence of other parts of it based on what you have (think Avatar - if you know that water, fire, and earth bending exist, you can guess that air bending exists), but you can't infer the existence of a saw (blood magic) if all you've got are hammers (charms) and screwdrivers (transfiguration). And that's not a criticism - it's one of the things I think really make HP fanfiction so popular, the magic 'system' is a loose foundation that you can build basically whatever you want on top of and with a bit of bending it'll probably work.

Personally, I prefer the 'Magic is like any skill' approach. Talent and synergistic skill varies, meaning people do start at different points, but with enough work and dedication and development of synergistic qualities anyone can reach any point. Synergistic being other skills that improve the magical one - so, a person with a skill for dance might find themselves to be more skilled at dodging. Learning magic is a blend of learning to play Tennis and learning to understand Theoretical Physics. Dumbledore started off Talented, but he worked hard and took opportunities to grow and learn and develop qualities that helped him understand magic better and that's how he got to his current point.

If you were going to take a magical core approach though, I'd prefer a channelling-limitation rather than a battery-limitation. People may have limitations, but they're more in the line of tolerances than a specific pool of energy to draw from. Like Taure said, we don't have Piano or Homework batteries. We can still keep playing piano or doing homework for as long as we like, we'll just find that it has a detrimental effect on our mental or physical health.

You could take a spell level/channelling path - ie. Voldemort and Dumbledore's 'powerful magical core' manifests in their ability to cast higher difficulty spells and higher power spells, because that they can channel more magical oomph than your regular wizard and they got there by trying hard in school with theory stuff and practicing hard to actually cast things. So, a bigger core means individual spells can be more powerful or that you can cast the more power-intensive spells, but it doesn't limit the amount of spells you can cast.

Or you could take a 'magic is toxic' path - perhaps channelling too much or too strong a magic will kill you or damage you somehow. You can still keep casting as long as you like, but it'll add up if you do it too often 'til you get some version of Magical Organ Damage or whatever. That could be interesting.

Basically, if they made cores something more than magical batteries, they'd be more interesting and popular with people. Magical batteries, especially batteries you're just 'born with' and can't really do much about, are quite overdone and there's not much left to explore of the idea, no matter how logical and true to life they may or may not be.

** I personally believe magical cores are a hoax propagated by the Ministry and the Daily Prophet to make people feel better about themselves,if people who grew up to be legendary wizards have an inborn advantage it would make the average person feel better. Sure there are cases where people learn certain areas faster but it could be related to affinity. As noodlehammer told "think of a wizards magic as a pool of water.Abroad scope of knowledge will give the pool a larger surface area,a great depth of knowledge will make the pool deep and a strong willpower will increase the water's quality." Furthermore my belief is that emotional states affect magic,for instance sociopaths would struggle at first when performing magic but would do precision spells better than others, defensive spells are bolstered by hope and fear, healing spells by compassion, and sacrificial magic like Lily Potter's are bolstered by true love(self-sacrifice), offensive spells are bolstered by anger,and all spells are strengthened by will and want.

** I think the magical cores are there to symbolise bone marrow or the bone itself inside a finger since wands are supposed to be symbolic for the ultimate tool, human finger.
