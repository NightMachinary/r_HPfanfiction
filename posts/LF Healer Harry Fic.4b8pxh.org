Im looking for a really specific one, though im open to recommendations. I read it a long time ago but I remember a few details such as it involves a healing class, and Daphne Greengrass whose parents apparently met in the same healing program. Harry is in the program and im fairly sure the pairing ends up being Harry/Daphne. I cant find this fic anymore and i cant remember the name.


** I think it's linkffn(5163465). Harry and Daphne go through some kind of healer program but I can't be arsed to do a full re-read to see if it's the one you're looking for.
