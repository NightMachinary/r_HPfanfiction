Hi! I'm planning to write a Next Gen fanfic that won't quite follow Cursed Child, and I wanted to have a Minister that can actually do their job. (In case you haven't finished DH or read CC, then some spoilers are coming up.) I know Kingsley Shacklebolt becomes temporary, then later on, the permanent Minister for Magic, but he also gets replaced in CC by Hermione.

Now, I know these two would have done a very good job as one, but I'm planning to have Hermione as more of a Unspeakable-esque character focusing on research on integrating Muggle technology into the Wizarding community and/or acting like an Ambassador to the Muggle government, media, etc.

I'm thinking of having Percy as the Minister, because even if he was a bit of a jerk, he was a great and responsible government official (Even if cauldron thickness doesn't seem much of a big deal, he still does a report on that and stuff because it would prevent a few accidents with regards to potion making.) How do you think he would act as one? Or do you have suggestions as to which characters would also do great as the Minister? Thank you :)


** Percy's a good choice, Susan's a bit of an unknown but she would work all the same.

Other than Percy (or Susan) I think it would be weirdly interesting to have a story with Neville as Minister. He led the DA alongside Ginny and Luna quite competently after all. Although I do think a future headmaster position/professor suits him significantly more.

*** That would be interesting. But I agree that a professor and then later on a headmaster would suit Neville more than a Ministry career. A Minister Neville would be cool though. Thank you :)

** Possibly Susan Bones. She is smart, she would have the backing of prominent families because of her aunt, and she is a pure blood for those families who still believe in that shit.

*** Plus she would work well with both Harry and Hermione, if Harry is still head of the DMLE in your story.

** I have seen stories were /Arthur/ Weasley becomes the Minister, and it actually works really well. He'd be all over Hermione's project, of course, so good for a supportive Minister; Percy would presumably be a bit more obstrusive, though he's definitely fit for the ministerial chair too.

*** Yeah I have too, although it's also been stated that he's [Arthur] satisfied where he is. And he gets to go more to the Muggle world too, if he stays as Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts office. I think he'd like that. Arthur Weasley as Minister is a good idea though...

Man, this made it harder to come to a decision, but it's definitely worth it and helpful. Thank you :)

** Mentioning that /thing/ that most certainly is *not* canon is a bad start!

*** I didn't get it instantly, but then realized what it was. Personally, I do like The-Thing-That-We-Shall-Not-Name, I just don't think it would fit in canon because of the rules JK set during PoA. But I did mention it because Hermione would fit as a Minister, just not that early... Genuinely sorry if you didn't like that...

*** True.. But he doesn't seem to be interested in any Ministry work (since his character wasn't really shown much :/)... hmm... that would be interesting though... Thank you for the suggestion :)

** Late to this party, but if you have Hermione remain in the Ministry, she'd work in the judiciary branch, not the executive, so keep that in mind. Another option for her is to be a teacher for Muggle Studies. She's a crusader, remember, not someone who would be a puppet, and that's what the position of Minister would make her.

As for /who/ would be Minister, I think Percy is a good option (at least, I used him for my story and got no complaints). Another one would be someone from the DA, probably someone who was in Hufflepuff. If you still want it to be someone who was Muggleborn, Justin Finch-Fletchley would be ideal. He's gullible, as seen in CoS, but also (applying traits of Hufflepuff) hard-working, loyal, and just.

Also, be wary of sticking too close to CC. Lot of hate out there for it.

*** Sound advice. Yep, Hermione would definitely make a great Muggle Studies teacher.

No, I won't follow CC. I want to try and make a continuation to the HP books that I developed from scratch (well, kind of), composed of my ideas, and inspired by a few things, people, and other stories I've seen.

All in all, thank you :)

** Eh, mixing magic and technology isn't much of an Unspeakable thing (Arthur Weasley was doing it, heh). What you describe just sounds like work done in academia, which would fit Hermione. She could work in the DMLE, but honestly I think Harry and Hermione in particular (even in canon) would have been too averse to joining the Ministry after all it did to screw them over.

Percy is probably a good fit for minister; he's who I'm going with as well in a crossover I'm writing.

*** I couldn't think of what to call her and Unspeakables were the closest thing I could think of when it comes to researchers, hehe. Yeah, she could, and would. make a good Minister and an official in the DMLE. I just think that it would take longer and she would prefer to work for it instead of having it handed to her. Personally, yeah, research and Muggle-Wizard relations stuff just fits Hermione for me.

And yeah, even if it was Kingsley heading and cleansing the Ministry, I think there would have some distrust left against it after all that's happened. Harry, Ron, and Neville only probably accepted Auror work because they still had take care of Voldemort's remaining cronies. Ron and Neville then left, as we know, but I think Harry, after all the 'Boy-Who-Lived' and 'The Chosen One' shenanigans, kind of felt like it's become his duty to control and stop Dark Wizards and stayed as an Auror and Head of DMLE.

Yep, Percy earns it for me. And would make a good Minister. Susan Bones is also a good choice though, as Pottermum said. So I'm not quite sure. Thanks though :)
