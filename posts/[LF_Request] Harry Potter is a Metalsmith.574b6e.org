Harry Potter works with metals to forge or create creations. Bonus points if it involves runes. 60k or more words. Thanks.


** [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/index/]] It's pretty good. Harry makes armor and other things. Set during 4th year.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/718139][Hephaestus]] is one of my all-time favorites. It's slash, but it focuses a lot on his unique career and how he learns to live with himself after a terrible injury. This author takes character development to a whole new level; they all grow as people throughout the story.

EDIT: it's only 40k, but it's still a great read so I'm going to leave it lol

*** This is what I was going to recommend, too. I enjoy the descriptions of Harry doing his work, the weaving of the metals with magic to make intricate patterns with protective spells forged in. The pieces (to protect wizard houses from Muggle notice) contain "sigils" rather than runes, but in any case it's a great story that seems to fit the request.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.
