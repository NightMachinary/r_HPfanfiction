For example: If Sirius didn't die, maybe Dumbledore never would have put on the ring, and make his arm black and die.

Maybe Malfoy (Junior) would have accepted Dumbledore's help earlier. Or Narcissa Malfoy would have asked Dumbledore for help, etc

Basically it ends up changing so many unexpected things, that the MC doesn't know everything anymore/it's not as effective.

Maybe (whoever it is) that ends up in the past ends up helping people like Severus Snape, Regulus Black, etc.

Or just anything random.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/old or new/completed or not/etc

It can be ANYONE who goes to the past. Can be Harry, Hermione, Ron, Neville, Luna, Draco, Severus, or WHOEVER else

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/etc Does NOT have to focus on pairings


** I found this one good for that because it has multiple tips back linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20097676/chapters/47605426]])

  For Sirius, going through the Veil opens up doors. Pretty much literally.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
