In the mood for this kind of story, but I haven't read one before. Basically, James still dies but Lily somehow survives after imbuing Harry with the sacrificial protection to defeat Voldemort.

Just some standards:

-Preferably no new relationships for Lily. Not for "purity" reasons, just that the idea of her getting with someone like Snape makes me feel queasy, and I have a feeling a lot of these stories go that route. Just want it simple in this aspect.

-If Harry's later romance is covered at all, no harems nor H/G. Maybe no romance at all, but others I don't typically mind.

-Decent emphasis on her struggles in single parenthood (I recall how tough it was for my mom after my folks divorced, ain't easy raising 4 kids).

-Don't suggest ones where Harry is a dick or OOC in some other way. I always liked that Dumbledore voiced the belief that Harry's fundamental character most resembles Lily's.

-No bashing, or if it's otherwise good, at least ones where it's minor and forgettable.

Hope that's not too much. Fingers crossed that there's at least a few of these worth reading.

P.S. Yes I hate Snape, he got what he deserved in canon.

Edit: "Any good". I hate fat thumbs.


** I've got one that checks off all those things except the "no h/g". If you still want it let me know.

**** That is the one I'm thinking of but there is another I just remembered where Sirius takes Lily and co to America but it's unfinished and probably abandoned. Linkffn(the ilvermorny champion)

When Ilvermorny arrives at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore is shocked to see the long-thought-dead Harry and Lily Potter appear, as well as the missing Sirius Black and Remus Lupin.

** Hmm. The only other fic where only Lily survives that I can think of is linkffn(Anything's Possible)

Admittedly, I have not made it all the way through, but the short is that Lily survived somehow and shows up after HBP at the Dursleys house during the summer. Harry spends the rest of his time trying to figure out whats going on.

  Harry knows now what he has to do. He's the only one who can. Everyone helps him out with the fulfilment of the prophecy, but he receives help from last person he would have ever expected, a relative long thought dead. AU DH

**** Sorry must have missed that part.

Its weird, but the majority of fics I can think of with a single parent surviving are with James. I guess most people don't want to explain how Harry survived Voldemort without Lily's sacrifice.

** Linkffn(Puzzle) is amazing but only Lily survives, with a vague memory of her family. She slowly peices together her life while trying to take down a victorious Voldemort. It's sort of Lily/Snape but also a deconstruction of the pairing
