Like if the Goblet contract had an anti-cheating clause built in, or Hagrid didn't get around to his date with Madame Maxime, or Charlie and the rest were just a little more discreet about managing the dragons...

Does anyone know any fics where the four Champions don't have any idea what the First Task is at all? And only learn that there's dragons involved when Bagman hands out the figurines?


** Must be a oneshot, since they'll all die in the first task.

*** I think transfiguring things as a distraction should be entirely feasible for a talented 7th year student.

Also, this is fanfiction. There's no reason why students can't be more capable than in canon.

**** Indeed. Plus, we're told how horrible and deadly the tournament is, but the tasks as presented seem pretty unremarkable. Stories where the tasks are actually really, really deadly are a cool alternative to that, though I can't think of any where the rules are really adhered to and no one has an opportunity to prep.

In terms of the best rethink of the tournament I've ever seen, it would be the (very AU) linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School by Kwan Li) but that doesn't have the element of surprise in it. (Indeed, in that story, the tournament is a team effort, and that's the least of the changes.)

***** I think princess of the blacks has a lot of the champions cheating then the tournament officials taking steps to prevent it in later tasks. Also it seemed to me most of the challenges were more about magical skill/thinking than just DANGER DANGER.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11689576/1/Raptor][Raptor]], Harry manages to not be one of the champions, meaning that there are only three in the Triwizard.

However, since the year 1 egg was a Raptor Egg from the Jurassic Park rather than a Dragon Egg and the raptor formed a Familiar Bond with Harry as soon as it hatched, years one and two played out rather differently.

By Year 3, Harry, through hard work and the Familiar Bond, manages to become an Animagus with the form of a Velociraptor and as such, after exposing Crouch Jr, is asked to help stop any of the Champions from finding out about the dragons.

By the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11689576/15/Raptor][first task]], all three are still in the dark.

**** I've met people in America who think that everyone in England has had tea with the Queen at some point.

People can have microscopically-detailed knowledge of things that interest them and microscopic knowledge of things that don't.

Hermione was noted not to care about Dinosaurs since they're dead, so she simply didn't think about them. At least until she was presented with evidence that dino's weren't dead...

I've heard of people who claim Narwhals don't exist since they're underwater unicorns and unicorns don't exist. It isn't all that far removed from reality... although in Raptor, it is somewhat played for laughs.
