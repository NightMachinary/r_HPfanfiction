I recently discovered [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdoPCztTOW7BJUPk2h5ttXA/playlists][Call Me Kevin's Harry Potter playthroughs]] and remembered that these things existed, and that I even played most of them(Chamber of Secrets to Order of the Phoenix, all on PS2). Like the title suggest, are there any Gamefics based on these real games? I imagine Harry would go insane from all the BEANS!


** Every time Harry uses flippendo it gets louder and longer
