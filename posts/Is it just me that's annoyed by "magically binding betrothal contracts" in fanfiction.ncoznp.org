I don't get the whole magically binding betrothal thing. It doesn't make sense because if I remember correctly, wasn't Andromeda black arranged to marry someone and refused? granted i can accept marriages being arranged then the families trying to force the two together but I don't think that someone else can actually sign a magical contract for someone. Also just because I know people will bring it up I think that the reason the goblet was binding was either because the signature was taken from harry's homework or more likely the goblet doesn't actually create a "contract" rather it creates some kind of connection between itself and the champions to ensure their participation.

That's not an uncommon idea in fanon, but it has no basis in canon.

I don't think there's anything in canon that prevents magically binding marriage contracts from from existing. And most of the time, those fics also add in Lordships and family magic and the like, which also don't exist in canon, but their existence does make the marriage contracts make more sense too, I think.

But you're free to not like whatever you want.

** I feel that it tends to fall into the catagory of 'accept it as the premise'. The author want to explore the idea of Harry being forced to be romantically invovled with a girl he doesn't know and the developement of their relationship, and so he can't be allowed to just walk away from it. Similar to how most WBWL stories often require the Potters to act really weirdly in the set-up. I tend to view it that as long as everything else is internally consistent, I can mostly ignore a contrived AU divergence point and just get on with the story.

** The problem with many of those "Binding Marriage Contracts" stories is that the authors don't think it through.

First, if such contracts are a thing, why would Harry be surprised by it? Why didn't anyone tell him? Sirius should have done that, at the very least, being his godfather (and should have known about any outstanding from James and Lily). Hermione should have heard about it, and raised hell about such a fucked-up "tradition". Muggleborns would be told about that as a matter of course. Witches and wizards would talk about it in the dorms. It's pretty much impossible for Harry to miss such an important thing.

Second, if such contracts existed, why the fuck would James and Lily make one for Harry? Neither of them married through such a contract, why would they inflict this abomination on their child? And if the contract was made by an ancestor of his, then why the fuck didn't it bind any of his ancestors? Why would James be able to marry for love, and Harry would have a contract?

Most stories utterly fail at that because the author only thinks of one thing: pairing off Harry and his OC.

*** I've seen a few fics that handle the concept well (in my opinion), to address your points in order:

No one mentioned it to Harry (or Hermione) because the contracts are seen as internal family matters, those involved in them are pushed towards each other/socialized with each other from a young age, so to Harry/Hermione it is just seen as people getting together during Hogwarts. Any dating contacted people do prior to getting with their partner is seen as them just experimenting/having fun. It wasn't brought up by Sirius either because he wasn't there (contract came up before he escaped), he wasn't aware of it, or it was something so ingrained in his culture as a child he didn't even consider Harry could not know about them.

The fics I've liked that used contracts had:

James getting drink with a friend and signing it while black out drunk with Lilly being pissed when she found out.

J/L signing it with a friend after they found out about the prophecy as a way to ensure Harry would have at least one set of people there to help him

Old contract created by a previous generation that the conditions to have only been met by Harry/the other party (male of one line, female of the other, all previous generations had same so contract didn't activate. Which for two or three generations isn't unbelievable)

Someone in a position of authority /cough/ Dumbledore /cough/ signing it as Harry's guardian for whatever purpose (I've seen this with both good and bad Dumbledore fics), I've seen this go both ways, with it working or not working as appropriate to the story (not working because he is either not actually Harry's guardian, or because only the head of House can sign and while he is guardian, he is not head of House)

I feel like I'm forgetting some, but that's just a few that have at least been internally consistent stories.

Leaving aside that this is a plot with an IQ of a terrible sitcom, the obvious consequence of that would be James and his friend realising their folly the next day, undoing it, and never speaking about it again.

#+begin_quote
  J/L signing it with a friend after they found out about the prophecy as a way to ensure Harry would have at least one set of people there to help him
#+end_quote

Fair, but obviously there is a clause in that that if Harry thinks the contract would not be needed in the future, they can just cancel it.

#+begin_quote
  Old contract created by a previous generation that the conditions to have only been met by Harry/the other party
#+end_quote

Makes no sense because there is exactly zero gain for anyone to sign such a thing. You can't bind families together is there is no one to bind them together -- which is why such a thing never existed IRL.

#+begin_quote
  Someone in a position of authority /cough/ Dumbledore /cough/ signing it as Harry's guardian for whatever purpose
#+end_quote

Is a terrible plot, and if you're then make it so literally no one and nothing can cancel it, you're screaming PLOT DEVICE so hard the story lost any sense of being sensible before it started.

 

TL;DR: You know something is seriously bad if I agree with Starfox.

***** I fully admit that for quite a few of them it is painfully shoehorned in, with the drunk one, the reasoning they didn't undo it was that as they were both very drunk they wrote it in blatant terms with no out, then signed with blood quills. (Yes l know that just makes it more forced, and sitcom-ey, but it didn't stop me from enjoying the read, as that was all background justification, not itself a major arc)

In the one where J/L set it up, he ended up growing up with them and the two did like each other so it was more of a formality.

The idea on the previous generation one being, sole member of the family, so it guarantees a spouse and the chance of the family surviving.

The Dumbledore ones I've seen (and liked) it was attempted as a way for him to gain control through marrying Harry off to the Weasley's but failed at some stage, usually through being invalid.

I won't even try to claim any of the premises are perfect, but I find that they can still be enjoyable stories as long as they are internally consistent. True, suspension of criticism is largely necessary, otherwise I'll lose the ability to read most fanfictions without just picking them apart.

****** I dunno, fair I guess?

For me, this is just a bridge too far. I'm happy to tolerate everyone being Lords and Slytherins being politicians as soon as they can walk and the entire rest of it, but the FF Betrothal Contract is just something that is so thoroughly illogical I can't get past it.

In the end, it's as Starfox said, their authors don't think, or at least not further than "this gets me X and Y together". And ultimately, it's unnecessary too: Since in all of those stories that I encountered, they like each other anyway after five minutes, you could have used literally any other plot device to get them together, down to a random meeting in a hallway.

****** Oh, they were used on different scales. It needn't be royalty. In Renaissance Italy, they were the noble families in the city states, which is perhaps the best equivalent to HP. And their purpose was one of alliance, mostly, and at its core, a business transaction, akin to setting up a new company. As such, if both sides added value to it, you can think of it in terms of a business merger, and the benefits would be very similar to what they are for businesses today.

Beyond that, however, is also different values and ideas of what marriage and family was. So it's not simply to be reduced to benefits; rather, for instance, as opposed to our notion that marriages generate families, back then, families generated marriages. The family was the nuclear unit of people living together, and marriage was the way to include someone from the outside into this unit. Without understanding this focus on family, it makes less sense than it should.

All of which is to say that if one wanted, there'd be a lot of interesting historical references to model it after. Of course, I have never encountered /any/ Marriage Contract story that went into this kind of detail; and furthermore, as is patently obvious from the business merger analogon, the unspecified contract set at some unknown date in future is ridiculous because, as you say, there is nothing to gain, because nothing is happening. You marry off children that you have. Not children that you don't have.

Which, as I said, makes intuitive sense to me: The point in this entire exercise, and the thing that binds families together, is not the contract. It's the marriage.

**** See, I don't agree with the first point. If something is so crucial to society as marriage contract according to the trope, then people would know about it. People would gossip about this or that contract. Worry about being forced to marry an asshole. Novels and plays would be written about contract shenanigans. No, there's no fucking way Harry and Hermione wouldn't hear about this - Ron would tell them sooner or later when talking about girls, at the very least. And Sirius would inform Harry as well - or mention them en passant when talking about his family.

James being drunk and signing Harry away to be married against his will? And Lily wouldn't have the contract dissolved? Or Divroce him? I fear you don't seem to understand just how fucked-up and vile that contract is. Same for "Harry would have a set of people with them". That's utterly stupid. If people won't help him without a contract, what would stop them from seeing him killed so their daughter can inherit the money?

With regards to the "oh, certain conditions have to be met" idea: Bullshit. Utter bullshit. You don't make a contract with such shit in it. You make a contract so you can make a deal as you can control it. There's no reason at all to make an open contract for such a thing - it serves nothing.

And why would Dumbledore do that? Again: Forcefully marrying someone is amongst the vilest things you can do. Only an utterly eveil Dumbledore would do that - and he had a lot of other ways to torture Harry in that case.

Not to mention he might mention some in his family and how they turned out but Sirius strikes me as more the sort of person to ignore a problem like that hoping it will go away on it's own. Sort of like some people do with bills.

There's also the fact that I can also see Harry not thinking that one would apply to him, Sirius' family are all insane so do things that others wouldn't and it was all over a decade so surely no one would do that now.

Basically to me it comes across as the difference of being aware they exist and knowing that they apply to him. That's more in presentation though, if he's aware it's a thing and just doesn't think he has one it would make more sense. Then again Harry is not particularly observant at times, so it might just not be something he considered.

As for Sirius losing his mind a decade in Azkaban would do that to you I think. Dumbledore might check but he's also very busy, i can imagine him thinking i'll wait until he's older to talk to him about it when he can understand it as opposed to at 11. Then getting offed before he can mention it. In that case i'd like to think he's prepared someone to tell Harry but if they're dead too it might make that difficult.

A good subversion fic would be Hermione finding this out, researching, asking Harry/Ron if anything like this could apply to them, discover that, yes, one or two Contracts do exist, and then have them easily voided before they become valid in some way.

And the person they were supposed to be engaged to either never finds out or is under the impression it's still valid, has a reaction to it (happy, sad, grateful, angry, et cetera), but ultimately moves on because they have no choice but to.

I feel like for a contract to be magically binding, the participants must sign it with full knowledge of it and what it entails, otherwise it won't take effect. Sort of like with the Unbreakable Vow they had to clearly state what they were agreeing to, like a real life "I have read and accept these terms and conditions.

Indeed. And if you research it, you will find that A) "unbreakable" betrothal contracts don't exist -- you can break it, and suffer the consequences (there are a few quite famous instances e.g. the feud between Buondelmonte and the Amidei in Renaissance Italy), and obviously it can be cancelled if both parties are in agreement about that, and B) no one ever made contracts about offspring that didn't at least theoretically exist (say, as babies); which (the "dormant contract") is another one of those weird FF ideas.

And the reason for both is obvious: Betrothal agreements like those are a political tool, used to bind families together and wield influence. But that doesn't work if there are no parties to fulfill it at least in a reasonably near and certain future, and certainly no parties would trap themselves in agreements that couldn't be undone at least by mutual consent, that's the opposite of smart politics.

Kinda like how you see rich girls or guys be "expected" to find someone in their social circles or financial weight-classes by their parents (which actually has a basis in American social circles, sadly enough).

Andromeda, however, fell in love with a muggleborn, which would've been like a mix between a white/black girl or guy from a racist family falling in love with someone who's not their ethnicity (which their family would be against) and a rich guy/girl falling for someone who's working class/middle-class in income/background than someone who's also rich.

There weren't any betrothal contracts or any of that rot: She just spat in their views and expectations by hitching her wagon with Ted, and it had her basically disowned as a result.

Anyway, betrothal contracts are a terrible trope, but I do admit I find them a guilty pleasure on occasion: I just recognize they're unhealthy, like smoking or eating fast-food.

Some people live on that stuff, though.

The exception (and aforementioned guilty pleasures) would be it were a subversion of some type.

E.g: They both hate each other and work together to try to get out of it, and they succeed, instead of "falling in love over the course of it" and all that rot.

They marry but it's a paper marriage, and they go off and have their own romantic partners and the like, much to the horror/confusion of people that know them.

They do fall in love, but their friends (including the Hogwarts staff and Dumbledore, which in itself would be a subversion as he typically pushes for/supports Contracts in such bad fics) try to free him or them both from the Contract. They succeed, but instead of being grateful, Harry and his former beau are horrified because they actually were fine with it/wanted to do it, and now a consequence is that one or both of them have to marry someone else/someone worse.

...It'd be pretty dark and sad if Harry and his beau are freed from the Contract, but only because its "target" was changed -- Harry now has to marry one of his friends, like Hermione, Ginny, or even Luna, who agreed to be the (in their eyes) sacrifice to keep him relatively free/make the best of it (sacrificing their futures, too)... only for him to end up resenting them anyway because they unintentionally fucked up.

The bitterness from that in the long run would be extreme: Harry and his former beau have an affair, and his wife (which made the sacrifice, e.g. Hermione) either has to do the same or is bitter that she made the choice for ultimately nothing (she can't have a wedding to someone she loves, et cetera, which is a big deal to a lot of women).

  Harry finds out he has a betrothal contract with Daphne Greengrass. Somehow, the situation feels familiar. Well, except for the surprise at the end. Oneshot, very meta. Rated M to be safe.

** I don't think it fits at all with Canon. But if the story is good then I honestly don't mind much. Reading a fic at the moment where Harry was pranked hard upon visiting the goblins that he had a marriage contract.
