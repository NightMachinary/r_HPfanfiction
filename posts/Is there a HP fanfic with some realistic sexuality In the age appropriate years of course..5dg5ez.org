Let me elaborate, Harry Potter fanfic seems to be either completely platonic. Or its Literotica. No middle ground.

I like the more political scheming fanfics, but all of them are missing the key elements from real life. And that's who's publicly sleeping with who? And even more powerful who's secretly sleeping with who?

Is there a middle ground?

Edit: I already think I haven't asked the question right. Not interested in a fanfic that is all about who's bonking who, that would be Literotica, just includes it.

Edit2: This has become a real world discussion I didn't intent, oh well go crazy.


** The issue with this is: What's the appropriate age range?

A considerable number of people I know including myself had sex at 15 which is likely going to be below the age of consent in most countries, including England.

Furthermore, fic-wise, there's no mention of the age of consent in the Wizarding World and considering you like political fics it's likely to include purebloods with familial connections.

Are the traditional and stuffy purebloods against sex before majority? Are they super liberal due to the lack of influence of religion? Do parents promote freedom of choice in a school that has less than adequate staff in a big-ass castle?

A few fics that you might like although afaik none of them are massively political.

*** And fifteen is far from the lower bound of realistic. The first couple in my year at school to have sex did so when we were in year 9 (age 13-14), and people were definitely getting to third base in year 8 (age 12-13). And this was a relatively sheltered school.

It constantly surprises me to see how quickly adults forget shit like this and apparently rewrite their memories to create a fantastical ideal of teen innocence. The number of negative reviews on the basis of lack of realism I got for Alexandra Potter when the characters merely /gossiped/ about blowjobs at age 12 was hilarious.

  [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/10/book-review-house-of-god/][...]] I distinctly remember one night a long time ago, coming home from high school. I had noticed that all of the adults around me said high school was some of the best years of their lives and I would miss it when I was gone, and yet high school seemed objectively terrible. I wondered if there might be some bias or bizarre shift in memory that happened sometime in people's twenties and gave them a localized amnesia or insanity. So I very distinctly recall telling myself “My current assessment is that high school is terrible, and if you ever find yourself remembering that high school was lovely, please be aware that your memories have been hijacked by some malevolent force.”

  And God help me, but /every single part of my brain is telling me that high school was lovely/. I fondly remember all the friends I made, the crazy teachers I had to put up with, the science competitions I won, the lunches spent in the library reading whatever random stuff I could get my hands on. It seems like it was a blast. It's hard for me to even trust that one memory as anything more than imagination or the product of a single bad day. But although high-school-me had a lot of issues, he generally had a decent head on his shoulders, and if he says my memories have been hijacked, then I grudgingly believe him.

**** Yeah, pretty much that. I went to a mixed school and I too had a girl in my class who was already pregnant at about the same age or perhaps even a bit younger than that (depends on when her birthday was, and I didn't really associate with her). Heck, I'm a bit weird in that I'd only started seriously dating when I was 17, and even /that/ is both teen years and also not legally of age where I am (though not below the age of consent ... but I was 14, which definitely was below that, when I puppy-eyed a boy to do stuff, so yeah).

PS. One day and this thread will turn into a confession corner. It's going to be silly if that happens.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** This thread is going to be interesting, if I may say so myself.

I'm unsure of how I should get my point across, so I'm just going to free write it and wince as I read over it. There's very few fics that highlight masturbation, either. Now, I understand that no one wants to reading about a thirteen-year-old boy rubbing one out, and I agree with you, but I can assure you it's mentioned by other people. Sharing a dorm room with other boys is going to add some fuel for gossip material.

“Did you hear <name> last night? Not as quiet as he thinks he is.” Or even, “I swear that <name> thinks the showers are his bed with what he does in them every morning.”

It's such a small thing and highly irrelevant to most stories, but it adds a sense of realism into the story. Another thing is the classic locker-room talk. I know the changing rooms are unisex, but I can assure you that won't stop some boys from discussing certain girls.

Going back to my first point, most males start masturbating at the age of 10 -- 11, but nothing happens besides what we call a dry orgasm. I dunno, though, many of you will disagree with me because I'm weird! :'D

As for age ranges... I first masturbated at ten. I don't care as long as it's consented both ways.
