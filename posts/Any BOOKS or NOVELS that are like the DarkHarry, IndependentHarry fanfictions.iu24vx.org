I'm not sure if I'm meant to post this here or not.. but please....

Does anyone know good books out there that have the concepts of Dark!Independent!Slytherin!Cunning!Harry? Or things books that I'll like if I enjoy those tropes? I need it!

Basically, school started. We're not allowed phones= no fanfiction (even though they're piling up in my digital library). And then the teachers ask the awkward question, what books have you reading... you guys need to read more...it'll prepare you for your exams...

And me in the solitude of my head screams, 'I read! I read a lot! A lot of fanfiction! They have better things than published books for me! Seriously, why are the good guys always so light and pure! I need slash... I need shades of grey... Questionable morals...' But I can't really say that out loud, can I?

And then I'm dying in school, because I have nothing to read and my hands and eyes are twitching for the phone I know is only a few millimetres away in my bag!

So anyone have good book recommendations? Pleaaaseeeeeee..... I can't stand those books with the hero saving the day anymore!

HELP!

** I was going to suggest the webnovels "Worm" and "A Practical Guide to Evil" but that doesn't solve your problem. The light novels for Overlord are very good if you're okay with the style.

**** Light novels refers to novels translated from Japanese. Overlord is about world domination and features a protagonist who ends up pretty evil. It has a pretty popular anime based on it and the magic system is based on gaming. It may not be your style, but it gets pretty dark.

Apologies if my explanation was unnecessary.

** The Coldfire Trilogy by C.S. Friedman:

Black Sun Rising (1991)

When True Night Falls (1993)

Crown of Shadows (1995)

Fantasy (very slightly sci-fi) series with magic! Dark wizards! Warrior priests! Good guys who aren't always so light and pure! Lots of questionable morals and corruption of ideals! Plus, really cool cover art: [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40358-the-coldfire-trilogy]]

The magic system involves manipulating "Fae", which can be used to do what you want, but can also appear like a Boggart, taking on the shape of your worst fear.

No slash, not even any queerbaiting as far as I remember, sorry.

** The Godsgrave Trilogy by Jay Kristoff. Super dark and violent. My favorite part was probably the blood mage that teleports assassins by using a huge pond of blood.

Rhys from the A Court of Thrones and Roses trilogy fits the bill but that's got a lot more romance than most of the suggestions here. He sided with the villain in the first book to protect his country.

*** I'm alright with romance, only the main relationship has to be either m/m of f/f. The minor characters can be M/F. But that sound very interesting.

** I liked Vampire Junction by S. P. Somtow: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_Junction]] It is about a 12yo rock star who is actually an immortal vampire. It gets pretty dark in places.

There's also a whole genre of so-called "noir" fiction, that your teacher might even think is legitimate literature. Jim Thompson was prominent in this genre; e.g., look at the article [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killer_Inside_Me]] . I haven't read that particular one but have read some other stuff by him. It is intense and creepy enough that it would have to be rated M or higher. I don't know your age but I figure you can use your own judgment. Just be aware, especially if you are prone to heebie-jeebies.

*** I've only just turned fifteen, but I've been reading M rated stories for around two years now. I've always been told I am more mature than people my age... so the darker, grimier books do nothing but excite me. Is that weird?

** linkfp(2961893), Mother of Learning by nobody103, is an excellent novel available online which has plenty of shades of grey and questionable morals. It doesn't solve the "I need physical books to read" problem, though.

Would your school, perchance, permit you to read a kindle? The kindle paperwhite (not the kindle fire, which is a normal tablet) only serves as an e-reader and doesn't support mobile apps and such, so you could probably convince them pretty easily to permit it if they don't already. You can download .mobi files--the primary kindle file format--of fanfics directly from Ao3 and email them to your kindle to read. Fanfiction.net doesn't have a direct download feature, but there are websites such as [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/]] and [[https://ficsave.xyz/]] which create a .mobi file of the fic and email it directly to your kindle for you.
