They both go back in time to before the Potter parents are killed. Harry is a baby.

They expose Peter as a spy and almost accidentally expose Snape as well.

When the two of them are alone, McGonagall casts some kind of spell so that she can more easily understand Harry's nigh-incoherent attempts at speech.

  ABANDONED! When all hope seems lost and everybody is dead, Harry transports his soul into the body of his one year old self. This time he's going to try and set things right.

*** Close. There's a note on the last chapter of that, mentioning a rewrite. Linkffn(2894304).

I think that's gotta be the one.
