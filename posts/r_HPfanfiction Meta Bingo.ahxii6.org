[[https://i.imgur.com/NJAAGUq.jpg][*Here it is.*]] Enjoy!

As inspired by [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]]'s [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ahof3b/after_the_bathroom_fight_hermione_accepts_that/eegor74/][earlier post]]. And [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/aa4lfd/meta_in_the_spirit_of_all_of_these_bingo_posts/][this thread]] with another version of a subreddit [[https://i.imgur.com/1VSfeAj.png][meta bingo card]].

I made the HP fanfiction [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9anrm7/ultimate_hp_fanfiction_clich%C3%A9_bingo/][trope bingo]] card a while back too.


** Fem!Harry is raised by flawless badass Hermione. They bring the war criminal Death Eaters to justice in accordance with the Geneva convention. Harry/Daphne/Tonks/Fleur pairing. No slash. Crossover with The Very Hungry Caterpillar.

**** "It's for the Greater Good," Dumbledore murmured, dim moonlight shining upon him as a cool breeze trickled in through the open window he stared out of.

Fawkes whistled argumentatively as he readjusted his wings, feathers flaring.

"Just because he killed those fourteen people doesn't mean he's past redemption," the wizened man retorted, moustache bristling. "Accidents /can/ happen you know."

Tilting his head, Fawkes hooted once.

"Well, yes, there is... /circumstantial/ evidence towards that point."

Once more, the Phoenix whistled, rolling his eyes.

Dumbledore huffed. "Don't give me that tone Fawkes. You know that everything I do, I do for the betterment of our world."

Fawkes threw his head back and groaned, the sound more like that of choking.

"How dare you speak of my mother that way!"

He hooted again.

"Yes, I can concede that maybe, just /maybe,/ he could be a bit too far gone to be brought back to the light." Dumbledore pinched the bridge of his nose as Fawkes chattered in annoyance, letting out a slow, resigned breath.

"Really?" he whispered, looking to his friend in horror. "He... he admitted that /in court?/ Were those the exact words he used?"

Another hoot.

"Good god." Dumbledore drew his hand over his face, eyes closed in consternation as Fawkes looked on with smug confidence. "I have so much work to do to make sure that man can be saved."

Screeching angrily, the Phoenix flew out the window, disappearing in a flash of light.

"Come back Fawkes! I never said you would have to help me!"

***** You have zero things to go on to make that assumptions, though it's a rather popular one.

As far as I know, no one ever commits suicide because they get bored of living. They do it because they're in some sort of pain.

When you imagine immortality, you're probably not thinking of an ever-changing world, and you with everlasting youth. But with those factors involved, there really wouldn't be any reason to ever get tired of living, any less than you would now.

All of that being said, of course you should always have the option. But assumming you'll need it out of boredom is neither here nor there.

To put it more simply, there is simply no way you'll live a good life, reach year 3462 and say, Oh, yeah, that's it for me, I'mma die now lol ('cause I'm just so edgy, why would I live so long pff)

No one has ever lived for 10000 years, either. Perhaps if a human being lived that long they'd get bored and commit suicide.

You'd always want the option, man. If you're going into uncharted territory (immortality) don't just assume you can handle it.

*** Lel.

That thread was started by a guy who likes to quote the Geneva and Hague conventions in a lot of threads, usually as part of his reasoning as to why Death Eaters cannot be redeemed, no matter what.

Taure took a shot at his tendency to do this, commenting, "Dude, you didn't even include the Geneva convention here." And I said that if someone were to make a meme bingo of this subreddit, the Geneva convention would have a square reserved, thanks to that guy's...err enthusiasm in quoting them in random threads.
