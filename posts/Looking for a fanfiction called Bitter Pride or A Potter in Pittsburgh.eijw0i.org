I'm looking for some Harry Potter/Queer as Folk fanfiction that I remember reading but can't find anywhere. Any help would be appreciated!


** Not a slash fan, but I still went looking to help out. This fic was written by branwen777 nearly a decade ago, but they have since retired and all their works taken off FFN. There are a few mentions here and there, the latest being from 2012.

The only thing even close to story content was in a forum called Quoth the Raven. It seems to have a [[https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/yaoislashfans/bitter-pride-harry-potter-queer-as-folk-crossover--t3825934.html][partial transcript]].
