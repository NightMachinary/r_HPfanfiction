I love Harry dropped into another world fics, even if he is ooc in them. I think it's because his canon personality makes him a good 'traveler'.

1. He has a lot of potential - well-coordinated, curious, stubborn, largely kind-hearted, above-average power, knows the importance of family/friends, and knows what it's like to be the underdog.
2. He can fit in - He learned from a young age that fading into the background could save him a lot of trouble. Even after going to Hogwarts, he still preferred to avoid being a public figure. Unlike other MC's (ex Naruto) he doesn't display attention-seeking bahaviour.
3. He is passive - canon Harry is not an aggressive personality. He has his own opinions but is not the type to shove them down other people's throats for no reason. He needed to tell the world about V's return mostly as a safety precaution, but he doesn't have Hermione's drive to change the world to reflect his ideals.
4. Humble leadership style - Harry is a leader because he is capable, not because he is naturally bossy. He is a good teacher (implies good communication skills and ability to judge other people's abilities) and is willing to delegate to others who have specialized knowledge/skills. He doesn't micromanage but instead trusts his team.\\

Have I missed anything? Do you disagree?

***** I think it's a bit of a copout answer, when it's asked about Harry specifically. But yes, it's certainly true that the combination of the Harry Potter universe being one of the most popular ones, with a very flexible/not super defined magical system, and Harry being the default character from the series makes him popular.

** Another bonus is that his power levels can easily be adapted to fit the scene. You can't crossover end of series Naruto anywhere. He's too powerfull and would easily fix all problems in the weaker universes.

Book Harry could easily appear in a lot of the weaker universes, which could be further played with by dropping a 3rd year or 5th year Harry in a story. And can be given a Master of Death powerup for the stronger ones. Which ranges everywhere from just a power up to actual Master of Death.

***** Or lower the the ambient magic so that it takes a ridiculous amount of time to "recharge" or reduce the effectiveness.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] had it so that you had to be born and live on a planet /with magic/ in order to be a wizard and cast magic. There were so many wizards everywhere, but were little more than squibs because they didn't get the "spark" or whatever and grow it in a magical environment.

Once that period is done though, you can do magic wherever and recharge it yourself or whatever.

** Can you recommend some good fics in which Harry is dropped in another world.

Another thing is while not as well versed in spells as Hermione (Hermione was shown casting 5 more spells than Harry) he has an impressive arsenal at 71. His arsenal is combat focused. This combined with his ability to think under high stress situations, ability to keep going no matter the pain and being quick with his wand allows him to get out of a lot of sticky situations. His arsenal has spells that allow him to hide and stay hidden (the protections he casts while on the run) He also is able to make do with less. He can function even if he is low on food or his shelter is less than ideal due to his upbringing.

** I don't think he's a particularly great crossover character, really. He's just a convenient one.

Why? Because he's a very popular character (obviously), uses magic (an easy excuse for a crossover or unique powers in the crossover), can have easy ways of powering him up (making Master of Death an actual thing, giving him new magic abilities, etc), and he's a bit of a blank slate in the other universe, along with just being a good guy. (most of what define Harry and makes him unique is in relation, specifically, to the British Wizarding World. Elsewhere, he's not a particularly unique character - unlike, say, Hermione or Luna, who'd have pretty unique personalities).

None of that, IMO, makes him a particularly good one - where good means that it's likely to make a good story. Rather, it makes him an easy one to slot in. Really he's more like a self-insert in those types of stories - an SI with magic.

Crossovers in general are a bit hard to make happen, though. I've only read a handful that were good - and the one involving Harry had a /very/ different Harry than canon. Basically, the more unique/strongly characterized the crossover character, the more interesting, and canon Harry doesn't really fill that amazingly.

(Though, I don't mind the 'Harry Potter magic exists within a wider magical world' type of crossover with Harry as the MC, where it merges together two magical universes)

**** Fair enough - though, by 'colorful', I guess I mostly meant a strong characterization that's independent of the universe they're in. Let me rephrase that one in the post.

(I'd consider Hermione to be a much stronger crossover character than Harry, for instance, because her defining character traits are still more unique/defining in other universes)

** I'm with [[/u/matgopack]] on this one. Harry works as a crossover character because he has no real strongly held values or beliefs or motivation of his own beyond being a fairly generic adolescent male hero archetype. That means that you can conveniently import the setting without being burdened by having to keep him "in character".

Like the others have pointed out, if you stuck Hermione into an unfamiliar setting, she'd very quickly develop an idea of how she wants to turn said setting upside down and then proceed to do it, or at least attempt to.

** because Harry just takes shit as it comes, he found out his godfather had escaped prison adter teelve years to kill a man that was his best friends rat and was now offering fir Harry to stay with him. Most people like Hermione would have heaps of questions but Harry just rolls with it.

It's his ability to just ho with it that makes him great to be dumped in any situation be it time travel or conpletely different universes

** Maybe its just me, but I love to see who Harry becomes when he's free of expectations. In canon he is shaped by being the BWL and everything related to it, he want to be normal because its denied to him, he embraces sports and mischief because that's what James was know for, and fights dark wizards because he knows he is being targeted.

We know Harry has talent, and we know he has the power to change the world (magic), but we don't instantly know how he'd react to any given situation. The answer would vary greatly depending on when and why Harry is in a crossover.

** I actually think he's a really bad crossover character since you either have to kill off his friends and family, or change his personality until he doesn't try to get back to said friends and family as soon as possible. It generally makes no sense that he'd happily join a new world instead of mourning his losses.

*** Reincarnation or rebirth wouldn't. Also, a lot of them utilize his second death (where he talks to Dumbledore) to have him choose to start over or receive a warning that his time is limited due to magic blah blah reason.

**** Or it could be just an accident. Harry is no master of SpaceTime magic. He could very well search for a way to get home, find that there is nothing in the universe that can send him home and decide to move on. Or make bonds while searching for a way to get home that he doesn't want to give up for the small chance that he lands in the right universe.

** I don't know why, but it is something I have observed.

It's funny you mention Naruto though, as Naruto (Pre-shipuden), Harry, and Xander (Kinda rare nowdays) are my primary characters for reading crossovers. Something about them works for it, way better then for example Sam or Dean from Supernatural, or any character from game of thrones.

Interestingly, some works have characters that are great travelers, but are not interesting as destinations. Other works have no good traveler characters, but make good destinations.

I would have no interest in reading about Rob Stark's adventures in Naruto land, but throwing Harry Potter or Naruto in Westeros? I'll read that.

Sam and Dean at Hogwarts? Bleh, lame. Harry Potter in the supernatural universe on the other hand sounds interesting.

** If done right, he is probably one of the best characters for crossovers. As you say, he's a pretty well-rounded character that's reasonably flexible. Book Harry works for most low-key fandoms, while MoD Harry is good for anime fandoms or fandoms with crazy power-leveling.

But personally? Hermione Granger is top tier crossover material. She's so fucking capable and smart! Half-Blood Prince/Deathly Hallows Hermione is a powerhouse of creativity; you could dump her in most fandoms and she'd be able to flourish. Plus, she's the type to "assess then act" most of the time instead of "leap before you look," which the latter is very Harry. I've read a number of fics where writers really take advantage of Hermione's intelligence and studiousness to delve into lore and world-building mechanics (especially where HP magic overlaps with other facets of the fandom you're crossing it with).

Yet I guess you could argue Hermione is kind of an "easy way" out of really trying? Because she is REALLY smart. Though, personally, not everyone really understands how to write smart young adults. So really, I think Hermione is top tier crossover material as long as the writer knows how to properly write bookish geniuses.

** I think it's mostly because harry is fairly self-contained. He doesn't require a lot of support structure or technology to do harry things, just a single stick (or less, depending on how deep the wandless magic rabbit hole goes).

Plus Harry is a character who is present at pretty much all stages of life and skill level, meaning you can pretty much just puck him out whenever and he can still be canon up to the point of divergence, making it an easy insert.
