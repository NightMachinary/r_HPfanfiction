*** That isn't a half-bad idea. I can't remember the name of the story, but there's one where Vernon gives Harry a gun and tells him to start killing freaks after he is ostracised in OOTP. The story wasn't very good, if I recall, but the idea was.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

**** You are clearly unused to fanfic logic. Garry is clearly a combination of Harry and Ginny.

And in following those grand traditions, if "Hinny" refers to them as a couple, then "Garry" must refer to when they are magically merged together into the same person.

*** I guess it would be kind of like being a Christian with homophobic beliefs and then finding out you have a gay child. If the parents are decent, they still love the child and make some exceptions, even if they don't strictly talk about it etc.

My childhood friend's little sister came out as trans recently and the family is super Stereotypical Christian (we knew each other through church) and while they're not thrilled, they're accommodating for the change in their own way. God is testing them, I think they said.
