Are there any Slytherin Harry/Gryffindor Ginny fics out there?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345), is a fun curb stomp fic with lots of bashing, sex, and violence.

**** I definitely recommend that one, even as someone who doesn't like Hinny as a pairing and generally stays away from fanfics featuring the couple.

My Slytherin Harry is really good.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

**** What am I thinking? I don't know how The Changeling want the first thing to come to mind. This one I know I like. It's much more a Ginny sorry than a Harry one, but it's still brilliant.
