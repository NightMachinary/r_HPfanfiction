I really think the song "Believer by Imagine Dragons" fits very well

What other ideas do you have?

** I'm not a fan of throwing modern pop culture into Harry Potter, so I'd go with something that wouldn't change the time period, personally.

Maybe, Don't Stop Believing by Journey? Ron doing an over the top Steve Perry impersonation could be funny.
