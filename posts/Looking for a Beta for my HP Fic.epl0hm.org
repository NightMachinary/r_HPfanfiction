Hi all, I'm looking for a beta for a daughter of the Lestranges (OC) x Fred Weasley fic set in Goblet of Fire and continuing beyond. I have an outline, just need help with editing and personal opinion - for some reason I'm having trouble finding the voice for this one. Thanks!


** Me, looking at the title: Ew, that's gross.

Me, a second later: Oh god, looking up A/B/O ruined me. Someone please obliviate me.

** I'm thinking we should have a LF Betas sticky, as the wiki list is so out of date I can't even yell at posters for not using it.

Also looking for betas, 45k words in (non linear) dimensional travel fic where Harry is sent back to redo it all with twists. Round one looks like it will substantially depart from canon by book 3.

*** do you still need a beta? I'm interested in becoming one. I have a lot of time on my hands right now. I'm American but I watched a lot of british TV in High school so I know a bit of british slang. I also have a strong grasp of the english language being that it's my first and only language and I got an A- in my into english class in college lol.
