Just looking for good stories with charlie weasley


** Do you like a Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger pairing? If so, here's my list:\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12243730/1/Nocturnal][Nocturnal]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12858961/1/The-Sparrow-Suite][The Sparrow Suite]] by Red Garden Gnome\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3993848/1/Games-are-afoot][Games are Afoot]] by grumpy grizzly\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4341127/1/2-weeks-in-Romania][2 Weeks in Romania]] by Burning-Candlelight\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4329627/1/Letters][Letters]] by Skippy-the-Rabbit\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417149/1/A-Pleasurable-Kind-of-Torture][A Pleasurable Kind of Torture]] by Allotropism\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12789201/1/Last-Christmas][Last Christmas]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12209775/1/Let-it-Burn][Let it Burn]] by KittenShift17\\

Also, here's two of mine:\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11394918/1/And-Gryffindor-Roars][And Gryffindor Roars]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12915227/1/The-Freedom-Land-of-the-Seventies][The Freedom Land of the Seventies]] by WizardWriting

In my opinion, The Sparrow Suite is the best written and was last updated in March of this year. Nocturnal is also really good and imaginative and is the longest Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger romance story I've come across (not that that means anything). Games are Afoot is also good but feels extremely rushed at the end (in the last chapter (there's only one line of dialogue and it's not said by either Charlie or Hermione, and the chapter itself is several paragraphs). The rest of the story is really good though. 2 Weeks in Romania and Letters are good for what they are but not well-written. However, they're fun to read if you have nothing to do on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

Last Christmas, Let it Burn, Another Bloody Birthday, and The Freedom Land of the Seventies are all filled with a lot of smut. All are well-written (sorry for my shameless advertising of my own story). A Pleasurable Kind of Torture is a one-shot but is very well done; it's the second-best written story I've included behind The Sparrow Suite. Finally, And Gryffindor Roars was my first story I'd written on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] and don't think it's put together all that well. But if you want to check it out, feel free.

Also, A Pleasurable Kind of Torture, The Freedom Land of the Seventies , and Last Christmas are all one-shots. Letters is unfinished (most likely abandoned). The Sparrow Suite and Let it Burn are both still in-progress. And the rest are all completed (though again, I use that loosely with Games are Afoot).

** Charlie's not the MC in this, but he does feature prominently. An oldie, but a goodie.

  In the days following the Department of Mysteries there is no respite for Harry, Ginny learns she is not the plain outsider she thinks she is. Grief and fear lead to late night connections for Ron and Hermione. Sixth year pre HBP AU.This is the story I wrote and posted way back in 2005. I'm posting it here by request since the other sites it was posted on are down. It is incomplete, but I do have a 50th chapter that has been sitting on a flash drive for a decade. My plan is to tweak it so that there is some closure and have the whole story transferred here by Labor Day.

  They were given a chance... an opportunity to escape the clutches of the Fates. A single gambit by he Old Gods forever changes the game as the newest members of the wolfpack tear through the Seven Kingdoms to create the home they always wanted. The Game of Thrones would never be the same. Eventual crossovers with other franchises. (AU, Stark Centric, powerful North)

  The war has ended and the side of good have won, but at what cost. The wizarding population is dwindling and something must be done about it before it is too late. In an effort to correct the situation, a repopulation law has been enacted. Everyone must comply, including a certain free spirited Romanian dragon handler who wants nothing to do with it.
