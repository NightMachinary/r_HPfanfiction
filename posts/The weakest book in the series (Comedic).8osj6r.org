The recent thread about things people didn't like in the books seemed to show that most people here dislike the 6th/7th books more than anything else. Some people stated they were tropey or terrible or any number of things. However, I think people are looking at the earlier books through rose-tinted glasses. The 2nd book is easily the weakest book, both from a writing standpoint and a logical standpoint. I'm not saying they don't have problems (particularly Deathly Hallows), but I think this needs to be put in context.

Ergo, I have posted my part-comedic summary of what actually happens in the 2nd book which are hard to reconcile from said post. And I hope that, even if you disagree with my opinion, you at least get a kick out of it. I know I did.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: the Redux

- The Ministry thinks he did magic when it was a house elf (the trace changes from book-to-book).
- Ron, Fred and George don't ask ANY questions regarding the bars on Harry's window, the lack of food, his stuff being locked up, his OWL being locked up, or his obvious near starvation.
- Harry and Ron are of course the LAST people to go through the barrier, otherwise that would not work to stop them. Apparently Dobby knows his shit.
- They fly a car across Britain, smash into a tree, get seen by muggles, but they only lose some house points and get a couple of detentions (thats like a slap on the wrist for Harry).
- ALL of the basilisk victims survive to be petrified, in increasingly ridiculous circumstances.
- Five or six petrifications occur before the Ministry does anything.
- Somehow a thirteen year old girl is the only one smart enough to figure out a mystery that has been unsolved for fifty years, in a school that includes the "greatest sorcerer in the world" and ghosts who KNEW SALAZAR SLYTHERIN (see the Grey Lady and the Bloody Baron).
- The Weasley car inexplicably becomes sentient, and decides to take up being a superhero.
- The acromantulas don't just eat them, Aragog answers all their questions first.
- Lockhart was a fraud all along. And literally everyone seems to have been aware of it. Geez, I would hate to see who the runners-up were...
- What would have happened if Lockhart was really talented with Avada Kedavara? Well I can dream.
- They dive into the Chamber of Secrets (imagine Salazar Slytherin riding down his own person slip-and-slide), knowing their is a basilisk down there, and don't, say, conjure a rooster or at least grab some sunglasses?
- Harry drops his wand at all, thats not even getting into the fact that he knows there is a basilisk chilling out nearby.
- For some reason Diarymort is intangible to being touched or tackled (good effort Harry) but he can still pick up Harry's wand? What the hell is going on?
- The King and Queen of the Deus Ex Machina arrive: please welcome Fawkes and the Sorting Hat!!
- Fawkes came because Harry showed true loyalty to Dumbledore. I guess he sits on the headmasters desk all day, watching a loyalty meter all day in case someone needs his help.
- His tears can cure cancer, he can lift many times his own weight, he once pecked out the eyes of a basilisk. He is the most interesting bird in the world. Fawkes: "I don't always bond as a familiar, but when I do, I prefer it if they are flaming."
- Rowena Ravenclaw: Godric, I think you need to reconsider letting the sorting hat summon your sword. Godric Gryffindor: Why would I do that, we need brave warriors in times of trouble. Rowena Ravenclaw: But what happens if one of the kids summons the sword while they are being sorted as a first year? Godric Gryffindor:................
- You know Fawkes, I got to say, its pretty stupid of you to do all that other stuff and not just apparate them to Dumbledore's office. Unless of course you get off on people yanking on your tail feathers. I mean its cool, whatever you are into.
- Literally no reprecussions for anyone. Dumbledore, Hagrid, McGonagall (two years in a row where the same students were wandering around in life or death situations?).
- Lucius Malfoy came to Dumbledore's office. Why? Why not? Oh thats right, we needed to make it obvious for the children in the audience who the culprit was. Oh, and you brought Dobby for...no reason. Great.
- Ginny never receives any form of counseling for what amounts to mind rape and immense psychological trauma. Geez, I sort of get Weasley basing now.
- Hagrid got blamed for the Chamber twice, and was punished both times, and yet he still decided to stay and work at Hogwarts.
- And once again, Harry is sent back to the Dursley's, despite the Weasleys being well aware of the less than hospitable conditions.

I hope someone reads this. I work hard to make this stuff funny yet still relevant.


** You know, I am actually not sure if Fawkes being able to take people with him when he apparates is book canon. He does this in the OoTP film, but in the books Dumbledore runs out of his office and I can't think of any scene in the books where Fawkes apparates Dumbledore or someone else with him. So, I'm curious. Am I forgetting something or is this just widely accepted film canon?

Other than that I quite agree with most of your points, but you can of course create such a list to all the books and I'm not sure if Chamber of Secrets in particular does worse in the case of plot holes than the other books.

[[/u/advieser][u/advieser]]: During OOTP, dumbledore knocks out the ministry for morons brigade, then takes the time to warn Harry to study Occlumency (and Voldemort does his pseudo-possession thing). Then it says "Dumbledore grabbed Fawkes tailfeather(s) and they disappeared in a burst of fire." Now, Fawkes repeatedly demonstrates the ability to apparate or whatever he does, but he only ever transports Dumbledore. So it may be canon that phoenixs' can only take their bonded partner with them. But their is no proof of that, and house elves seem to have little problem with multiple people (though apparently there is a limit to the number).

Nope, because /bonds are not canon/. Fawkes isn't a "familiar", a name and concept which appears nowhere in canon, he's just something between a friend and a pet, no different than Harry and Hedwig, Ron and Scabbers, or Aunt Marge and her infernal bulldog. You could speak of a bond between Dumbledore and Fawkes, but it was just a close relationship, not anything magical. Pet Phoenixes are rare, besides, but we know one Quidditch team had a tamed Phoenix as a /mascot/ --- what, was the Phoenix "bonded" to the abstract concept of a team? To all the team-members at once? Don't be daft now.

The fact that cats and owls may be sold or gifted could potentially be unique to those species; it's implied that Fawkes chose Dumbledore, and was not simply bought at an exotic pet shop.

*** what makes you think that Fawkes can apparate? It could also be the case that Dumbledore just clutch Fawkes and then disapparates, pulling Fawkes with him. The Question would be, why would he do that, if the Bird can fly on its own? Possibly because Dumbledore would need him after he arrived at his destination and dont have time to wait...or because he doesnt want the Ministry to lock the Bird away (i admit, this sounds ridiculous, since Fawkes vanished in Dumbles office, after Harry had his Vision about attacking Arthur)

**** One, Fawkes is noted several times for appearing and disappearing in a burst of flame. OOTP and CoS clearly show this. Two, Dumbledore didn't perform apparation, it says he disappears in a burst of flame. There is none of spinning that is common to wizard appartition. Three, they are in Hogwarts, which you cannot apparate from (the movies let him apparate to make the whole thing go more quickly, but that is not canon). Fourth, Fawkes is able to move himself wherever he needs in Hogwarts. This is almost certainly why only one other phoenix was tamed during canon: they are essentially incapable of being trapped unless you kill them, which they will eventually grow again and leave regardless so it renders the point moot.

#+end_quote

Ron and Harry are close enough friends that I think he already told them the Dursleys were terrible people. While playing it off as no big deal, of course, but he /would/ have mentioned it. As for Fred and George, what the Dursleys did then doesn't look notably worse than the sort of stuff they're usually dealing with from Filch or Snape, albeit at home rather than at school.

#+begin_quote
  ALL of the basilisk victims survive to be petrified, in increasingly ridiculous circumstances.
#+end_quote

I cannot believe people still get this wrong. Diarymort was Petrifying rather than killing on /purpose/. The previous time an instance of Tom Riddle had gotten the Basilisk out, he'd also started with Petrifications, and when he'd moved on to a murder, Hogwarts had immediately been put on lockdown and nearly been closed down for good --- which he very much doesn't want to happen. So Diarymort was /very/ careful to only let the Basilisk open her eyes in situations where it would only Petrify. With some skillful blood-writing-on-the-wall and such, this was enough to seed panic, but not enough, he hoped, to jeopardize Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  Somehow a thirteen year old girl is the only one smart enough to figure out a mystery that has been unsolved for fifty years, in a school that includes the "greatest sorcerer in the world" and ghosts who KNEW SALAZAR SLYTHERIN (see the Grey Lady and the Bloody Baron).
#+end_quote

I think the fresh perspective may actually have /helped/ there. The people who knew Salazar Slytherin in life likely knew him as his more mellow, pre-banishment self, and refused to believe in the "Chamber of Secret" myth, chalking it up to slander --- at least until the Chamber was actually opened in the 20th century.

And besides, the Basilisk is such an obvious plot element to us by now that we overlook quite how unlikely it was in-universe. Basilisks are, #A, the magical equivalent of a nuclear weapon, #B, long-extinct, and #C, not famously known for causing Petrification, but rather instant death. Assuming Slytherin's Monster is a Basilisk based on some Petrifications is akin to assuming a bunch of mysterious comas are the work of a mosasaurus someone secret brought back from the dead with genetic engineering five hundred years ago.

While this /is/ funny, two things: first, the Sorting Hat is sentient, and may control whether or not he lets the sword out. Second, as seen in the movies at least, the sword clearly comes out /hilt first/, and it's a rather blunt hilt at that, so someone wearing the Hat would probably be fine.

*** Hagrid had his wand smashed and was blamed for killing someone. I never said Dumbledore blamed him, but he was punished for the crime both times (its kind of weird that all they did was take away magic from him and ban him from being a student the first time).

The Dursley stuff is mostly just there because it strikes me as odd that no one says anything about it. Not that they have to DO anything, but nobody asks any questions or that sort of thing.

About the Sorting Hat, I know that would not happen, I just realized that this could be a thing, and magic can be unpredictable. Imagine a first year puts on the hat, sits for a minute or two, then pulls out the sword of gryffindor front of the entire school. McGonagall is just staring with wide-eyes. Then the hat shouts SLYTHERIN. Gold

I know there is no mentioned treatment for Ginny. It just seems odd that nothing like how she is ever gets mentioned at all, though that may be Harry's shear obliviousness.

As for ghosts, I am not sure the ghosts in canon can actually touch things like in other depictions of them (the movie ghost for instance). Unless their is an example, I suspect that is fanon. Also, why is it that Moaning Mytrle, who can float through walls and does, never crosses the tunnel to the Chamber? Unless she only got there very recently of course.

With Aragog, I meant why did ARAGOG bother to answer the questions, when he knew he was going to eat them? He isn't a supervillain or the like, he's a predator with children to feed. Seems odd, unless he thought they might escape and kill the basilisk, but what are the odds of that?

My point about the Ministry is that they know this happened before and someone died then.

Is it correct to say a species that needs to be bred by wizards (or even muggles really) goes extinct if no one makes a new one? I'm not really sure.

As for the petrification, it seems...odd that someone would be able to control it to such a degree that they only saw the basilisk in a reflection. The only way that seems feasible so perfectly is if he was able to imperius the victims first, which wouldn't explain the ghost. And there is no way he could know what would happen if a ghost saw the basilisk, UNLESS there was an example that happening back in '43, which I honestly cannot say one way or the other.

As for the Weasley Ford Anglia, I don't really have any problem with it (other than it arriving when and where it was needed exactly when it did), though I wonder why it saved the two kids who drove it into a tree frankly. Also, I had this idea that the Ford Anglia was actually a secret transformer, and during 2nd year it was hanging out in the woods fighting trolls and werewolves and Fluffy. That would be a GREAT story.

But seriously, part of this just for comedy in the first place, so don't take it as anything important.

He's a very polite sort of monster. No, really. See, the thing with Aragog is, he's kind of sad his children don't listen to him about the whole "eating humans is actually kinda mean" thing. He's long ago stopped trying to convince them, because /he/ doesn't want to get eaten by his Children, but he'd rather not have Hagrid's friends die if he could avoid it, and in the meantime tries to be as pleasant and polite to them as possible to make up for his inability to save them.

***** Yeah i get all these things. I know the Ministry is incompetent and that what ghosts can and cannot do isn't always clear. Its magic, I understand. The point of this post was mainly to draw attention to the fact that, despite all the problems the other books have (and there are plenty), I think that CoS easily is the weakest book. So I tried to make my post a straight deadpan of events in the book. I've done the same thing with other genres (the star wars movies for example), and the comedy of it makes people think more about these things. Plus, I love writing this kind of sarcasm, I don't get to do it enough in my daily life (technical field).

Also, on Hagrid. I meant that, he has now been blamed twice for the same thing, and the only way they can is because he lives there. If he had left, to say, go work with dragons or anything else that he does seem to enjoy, he would not be blamed for it in the future. And I know he was loyal to Dumbledore. But so were other people, and they didn't all work in at Hogwarts. Realistically the more in depth answer is probably that Hagrid, being a half-giant, rarely ever feels threatened by anything. So he has trouble recognizing that something is a dangerous or a bad idea (of which there is plenty of examples). So he wouldn't make the connection that something like this could be blamed on him again in the future. Its not out the question either, look at what Umbridge tried to pull (if she had had anything on him besides teaching ineptitude and loyalty to Dumbledore, she would have put him under arrest as a criminal instead immediately and not waited months).

*** The thing about CoS is that, since a lot of the story is contrived and filled with convenience, it best showcases what the HP series actually is. Strip away the magic and the other harry potter stuff, what are you left with? A pretty good mystery story. Thus you see what the seven books are at their core: a set of 19th century style British boarding school mystery novels.

- What is the three-headed dog guarding?
- What is the chamber of secrets/who is the heir of slytherin?
- Who is Sirius Black/why does he want to kill Harry?
- Who put Harry's name in the Goblet of Fire and why?
- What is the "weapon" Voldemort is after in the Ministry/what is the room he keeps dreaming about?
- Who is the half-blood prince/what is a horcrux?
- What are the Deathly Hallows and who is the Master of Death?

The plot more or less revovles around these mysteries. All the other stuff in the books ends up getting mentioned only when it has some relvance to these mysteries (Harry gets injured by the rogue bludger, which lets him get to talk too Dobby again and see Colin be brought in as petrified).

  Ron, Fred and George don't ask ANY questions regarding the bars on Harry's window, the lack of food, his stuff being locked up, his OWL being locked up, or his obvious near starvation.

To be honest, that does sort of explain itself, really, and they knew that Harry was in trouble already.

  Somehow a thirteen year old girl is the only one smart enough to figure out a mystery that has been unsolved for fifty years, in a school that includes the "greatest sorcerer in the world" and ghosts who KNEW SALAZAR SLYTHERIN (see the Grey Lady and the Bloody Baron).

This thirteen year old girl has a friend who's a parselmouth. The previous parselmouths tended to be people whose friends didn't mind the number of muggleborns being trimmed down a bit.

  They dive into the Chamber of Secrets (imagine Salazar Slytherin riding down his own person slip-and-slide), knowing their is a basilisk down there, and don't, say, conjure a rooster or at least grab some sunglasses?

Would sunglasses even work, besides making them able to see even less down there in the dark? And they were barely able to vanish rats in fifth year...

  Ginny never receives any form of counseling for what amounts to mind rape and immense psychological trauma. Geez, I sort of get Weasley basing now.

She might have got that. People have a tendency of not telling their friends that their sisters are seeing a psychotherapist.

I honestly mean its weird that no one ever says anything. I think Rowling just didn't think the implications through or just didn't want to have it talked about. She seems to have realized by the 4th book that the Dursleys were to fairy tale esque to be believable, even in a fantasy book.

True enough, but it fails to point out the fact that in practically all the cases no one appears to have any bodily injury. Someone must know that Myrtle is the girl in the bathroom (actually, ghosts are really sort of unclear, even whether they are allowed into the school or they simply cannot be stopped is not clear). One could postulate the Killing Curse, but only Myrtle died so that is out. BUT, the three petrified students in '43 would have seen yellow eyes in a reflection just like Myrtle saw them for real. And thats the last thing they would know before they woke up. There are no other known creatures in HP (perhaps a gorgon, but that is not canon so take it with a grain of salt) with the ability to injure curse/injure someone with their eyes, except possibly a Wampus Cat (sort of legilimency user). Thats not even counting that their is a myth of a monster, Slytherin was a known parselmouth, and people died instantly.

To me, the only explanation was that people just really did not want to think about it, and Hermione was both intelligent enough and with a strong enough motivation (blood-purity nonsense) to work for it.

It MIGHT have been one of the flying things in the final battle, but its only speculated. Here is a great idea though: the Ford Anglia is secretly a Transformer, and while the school year is going on its in the forest fighting werewolves and trolls and Fluffy. I would love to see that kind of a crossover! There are several Autobots like Trip-Up and Stakeout who are Fords, so it could work.

I know that. Its kind of amazing that they have been able to get a new teacher every year since 1953 when Voldemort got rejected and threw a tantrum. But that was kind of pointing out the sheer lunacy of this setup. Also, I really wanted to setup that next joke about Lockhart...

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

No sunglasses probably wouldn't keep you from dying, BUT they might keep you from being killed and just get petrified (though they could probably use blindfolds or hats or something like that). But it was more about pointing out the idea that Harry and Ron take literally NO precautions at all. They have no idea if its even safe to go down the slide that way, let alone anything else.

#+begin_quote

I will concede on that. They certainly don't make a big deal about any of Harry's obvious tics. I have always speculated that perhaps only people who have a certain brain condition can use magic, like a sort of minor disorder (not quite to the level of Aspergers, but close). This makes them open to the more unquantifiable parts of magic, but it means that only a few of them have any serious rational thinking capabilities (Dumbledore, Snape, Hermione) and they can dominate most others.

Still, I hope you enjoyed the jokes. And that I made my point about CoS. its probably my least favorite part of any fic going through the canon beats. Most require that it happens so that they can discover the Horcruxes, but its the most flawed story in my opinion. I honestly suspect that Rowling did not intend the Diary to be a Horcrux originally, and that it was more of a stand alone story, but she needed to come up with something for Harry to do in the 7th book and explain the scar. Remember, up until 4th year all it does is hurt when Voldemort is nearby. By then Rowling probably had an idea about the soul-splitting immortality.

** CoS is my least favorite. They spend so long doing things that amount to nothing, and then Hermione comes through with her book page.

But the thing that has bothered me ever since I first read it is the SCORCH MARKS!! The trio are investigating the scene of, I think, Mrs. Norris's petrification. They note the spiders and puddle of water from Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, and someone says "Scorch marks! Here and here!" This is never explained. They figure out every other piece of evidence except the scorch marks. When trying to look this up I found that in some myths basilisks have great or laser vision. But why wouldn't the basilisk use it to try to kill Harry ? And if initially it wasn't supposed to kill anyone, why did it use that power to make the marks in the first place? I'm sure some of this stuff can be intuited, but it always felt to me like a detail that was forgotten and never followed up. Such a tiny detail really got under my skin for some reason.

*** I was postulating earlier about this in the comments but I will give you some thoughts:

It was pointed out to me that the petrifications were done on purpose, rather than killing the students. This is an extremely difficult thing for Tom Riddle to actually pull off (people are unpredictable after all, cats even more so). Thats not even including the question about how he knew about the ghost, while Riddle was intelligent, ghosts seem to be something of a mystery even to the wizards/witches in the magical world.

The only other possibility I could derive (aside from Riddle being unbelievably lucky and intelligent, which he is to some degree at least) was that perhaps he entrapped the victims with the Imperius Curse, then put them in a position to be petrified (had Hermione get the mirror, got Justin to look through Sir Nicholas, etc.). Its possible that earlier on, the diary had less control of Ginny, so capturing Mrs. Norris was more difficult. Additionally, Mrs. Norris seems to be more able to detect students and living things than say a human (greater sense of hearing and smell) so sneaking up on her might be more difficult as well. So maybe a scuffle broke out so Ginnymort could trap the cat, then petrify it. Fire would certainly scare it, and if she screwed up and killed Mrs. Norris, no one would necessarily assosciate that with the Heir of Slytherin thing in the forties. The students openly disdain the cat, it wouldn't be that shocking if they tried to kill her or a prank went wrong.

Prince of Slytherin did something similar, in that the reason the cat was attacked first was that it could detect invisible people, and thus it had to be removed before the real plan could begin.

** Chamber of Secrets was my first HP book and I still find it to be today the most enjoyable of the series. There is suspense, humor, it's definitely a great and memorable story. But I agree with you, it makes no sense if we 're seeing it with logical glasses on. However, should you reflect on the other books, you would see they do not fare better. First book has an immortality stone taken away from its rightful owner to be "protected " by horrendous things, clearly unable to stop a competent wizard but perfectly able to harm students...But luckily Voldemort is beaten by 3 first years. 3rd book is nonsense from start to finish. 4th book has Dumbledore not recognizing a Death Eater impersonating an old friend of his, Voldie coming up with the most far fetched plan ever to come back, and Unforgivable curses that are either overpowered (impero) or underpowered (av kedavra kill ppl one by one, but Pettigrew in 3rd book ravaged an entire street in a sec). Veritaserum is only used when too late. I can't write any more on my phone but I could go on about the last 3 books...which were not good imo. 6th was not too bad though.

*** I must say though, looking back, what I find the most ridiculous is that nobody was able to figure out Salazar Slytherin's secret. For heaven's sake, talk to Myrtle. The idea that Hagrid was seriously deemed Slytherin's heir (but no one cared to tell prof. Binns or kill the acromentula in the frickin forest) is extremely funny.
