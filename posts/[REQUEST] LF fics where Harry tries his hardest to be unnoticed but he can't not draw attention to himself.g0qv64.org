So basically Harry hiding his abilities etc etc and trying not to draw too much attention to himself but with all the shit he gets into he finds himself getting noticed by all the wrong people.

Preferably Time/Dimension travel or where its not known that he's the BWL etc etc or AU.

I've always been interested in this sort of dynamic but I'm reading Linkao3(Train To Nowhere) and now my intrigue is further piqued lol

**** Its definitely worth a read - I liked it.

I particularly liked the way Bella was written.

In fact most of the extended Potter and Black familes are great.

I hope you like it!

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
