Looking for any Harry centric, Batman/Harry Potter crossovers(or any superhero crossover). No Slash


** My two favorites are very different:

"To master the Dark": Very dark. Harry's adopted by Selina (and sort of Bruce), but has a very dark past.

"Amy Potter is Batgirl". Very, very fluffy and over the top - it's a crossover with the 60s TV series.

There's also "The Godfather" - abandoned, sadly, and suffers a bit from a manipulative Dumbledore.

  Trained by Bane himself, Harry rises from a boy hiding in a cupboard to an immortal legend. A tale of justice and revenge, idealism and murder, life and death.. Crossover with DC Universe - starts just after The Dark Knight Trilogy, before first year at Hogwarts. Involves Magical Britain and Gotham. AU.

  Amy "don't call me Amaryllis" Potter never went to Hogwarts, but the Goblet of Fire makes her a compelled competitor in the Triwizard Tournament. Will three years of tutelage by the Dynamic Duo see her through the treacherous tasks? Will being Batgirl help her beat the villainous Voldemort?

** Warm Shadows is a DC crossover that has passable writing and it is still setting up the plot. Linkffn(Warm Shadows).

Trigger Warning

Also Bats is overrated! Would love a Constantine and HP crossover. The snark and sarcasm would be beautiful. Lol

  At the age of twenty-seven Harry Potter had a good thing going for him with the DEO, decent pay, odd hours, a good chance for advancement; What else could a Slytherin ask for?... Maybe a few days that didn't force him into questioning his sanity.

*** Got to agree with the Constantine crossover, the magics of the 2 universes could be extremely interesting and a possibly older more experienced Harry could certainly hold his own with John.

**** You could say that Constantine's magic is old school magic, the chanting and obscure rituals, and wand magic is more recent. John is THE con-man. You could insert him in an auror, merc, and ministry story. Especially when there is a string of unexplained deaths connected with an artifact.

** Well, I've nursing an idea about our beloved little shit in Hogwarts for awhile, but I simply cannot find a conflict that would be able to contain Damian Wayne. I mean... You either debuff him A LOT, or risk him roflstomping Voldemort at the end of the first year. And that's even without magic or calling in the Batfamily or LoA.

Same thing for Bruce, actually, if he's involved in any way. Dick could work, but he's too closely tied to Bruce. Tim and Babs are actually better detectives than Bats himself, which means Riddle is cooked in around a week after they learn about horcruxes. Pre-Hood Jason could be fun, though, I'll start thinking about that one...

  Harry comes back to Privet Drive after another tiring year of school, but there is another unexpected guest there. It turns out Vernon Dursley has a nephew as well, and 19 year old Dick Grayson seems to be nothing like the Dursleys that Harry has grown to hate. Maybe this Summer will be a little bit better with some company.

  Joker never understood why his brother took destiny and prophesy so serious (or anything for that matter. He really needed to smile more). The future wasn't set in stone after all. Besides, wasn't it much more fun to corrupt the child, shape him to their image of insanity and chaos, instead of killing him? He certainly thought so. Insane!Harry, Dark!Harry, Adult content later on.
