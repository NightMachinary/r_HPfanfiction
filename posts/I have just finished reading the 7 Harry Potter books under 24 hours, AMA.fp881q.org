*** I definitely forgot just how much space both Hagrid and Peeves get in canon.

Hagrid especially surprised me, as in fanfiction (at least in my experience) he gets sidelined a lot, but I would wager that he is easily the most present, most talked with adult, at least in the first four books.

And Peeves is just eveeerywhere, I am now even more baffled by his exclusion from the movies. Peeves is always doing something, throwing stuff, singing catchy tunes - I reckon he gets more exposure than Dumbledore until book 6.

I also somehow managed to forget just how awesome Mr. Weasley is. Honestly, what a guy.

As to the change in opinion - I honestly started quite liking Rita Skeeter. She is just... good at what she does, she likes to do it, she doesn't mind the hate... I would classify her as a Chad.

See, this is what makes Rowling Rowling and not some fanfic author - a lot of people predicted that Snape had been in love with Lily, but no one predicted that in the middle of Voldemort taking over the world Rita will publish a trashy biography of Dumbledore.

This is probably a bit common but I've never not loved Rita as a character. She just fits the role of a gossip mongerer very well; definitely one of the characters that makes the series stand out for me.

Like 1% of people can read 1000 wpm or above.

So its incredibly possible to read a million words in a day. I read at around 660 words per minute.

Depending on the reading material the speed can go from 800 (dense textbook) to 1100 (childrens or YA book). All of this is with pretty much full comprehension, although at 1100+ I start to lose comprehension.

I'm pretty sure it's a savant skill, I'm autistic. I've always naturally speedread since learning how to read when I was 3. I process the words /sentences differently.

***** You may already know this, but many people on the Autism Spectrum are hyperlexic, which means they learn to read almost completely by memorizing words on sight, rather than sounding words out by phonics. I wonder if that also makes them a quicker reader as adults. In my experience it makes them voracious readers as children.

******* There's nothing wrong with it especially as long as your comprehension keeps up with your decoding. I just have to explain it to parents who are surprised when their kid's comprehension level doesn't match their decoding level. (Probably not your problem) :-). Personally I learned to read this way because I taught myself to read before Kindergarten and just ignored the lessons on phonics. I didn't realize what phonics was until I had to learn to teach it in college, but it solved the mystery of why my spelling was horrible.

******** I learnt phonics as an adults and I am convinced it has slowed down my reading, although probably increased my spelling/reading accuracy (I am/was terrible for swapping the middles of words out). I think a fear of getting things wrong/forgetting any detail has also impacted on it (and, ironically, on my memory for reading).

I'm partially deaf as well as autistic (but didn't get hearing aids until after I could read), so I simply never managed to learn phonics until I needed to in order to teach children.

With Harry Potter though at one time I could read the first two books in under an hour total because I had literally read them hundreds of times and I wasn't so much as reading them as I was seeing words and remembering the next.

*** Definitely most disturbing was the approach to love potions.

Not only are they sold to the general public, not classified as dark magic or anything or even a restricted substance, not only is Amortentia taught in Potions, but most importantly there is just no social stigma around them. Nobody really cares that Romilda chucks love potions around, being drugged is apparently ok in this society. The Imperius is unforgivable, but love potions are fiiiiine.

Also, in CoS on Valentine's day, Lockhart mentions that Flitwick is really handy with 'intoxicating' (not sure about the precise translation) spells. Basically Rohypnol from a wand.

***** I just re-read this scene to get a sense of it all, and I think it's definitely possible that Lockhart, who thinks it's totally fine to erase people's memories and take credit for their work, is also totally fine with Flitwick's Entrancing Enchantments, but I don't think there's enough to show that Flitwick himself necessarily shares this view. For example, he could know about them for purely academic or even counter-charm purposes, but not use or condone their use. Or he could be embarrassed at Lockhart's "compliment", or anywhere in between. Either way, I don't think this scene says much about Flitwick except that he knows a lot about the subject he teachers.

*** I am finishing with OotP, and you know what is treated surprisingly lightly? Whipping students! Filch makes comments throughout the books about chaining students, whipping them and such. Like, WTF? When the twins set the swamp on Umbridge and then leave Hogwarts, we see Filch giddy that she had signed a form to allow the whipping of the twins. I am truly disturbed by this...

**** Agreed! Some years ago, I discovered that corporal punishment wasn't publicly banned in schools until 1986 in Britain. This blew my mind. It was still allowed in private schools until the late 90s and until the early 2000s in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

OOTP was set in 95-96. JK has said that Hogwarts is NOT a private school and that tuition is free, but the letter of acceptance and boarding aspects of the school are generally private school practices. By that logic, it wouldn't have been long since they were allowed to implement whipping as a punishment in public schools. However, we know that Dumbledore never allowed “the old punishments” which were far more torturous. I would imagine he felt similarly about whipping, the most widely accepted form of corporal punishment, which is why Filch and Umbridge would be excited about getting the Approval for Whipping form.

****** Went to school in Texas. It was still widely used in every school near me, including my own. They were called "swats" which was done with a wooden paddle with holes. I had to get them for being tardy too many times in place of going to detention for 2 or 3 weeks after school. You had to have a witness in the room while they were done to you. I suppose it was to ensure that you weren't getting the shit kicked out of you. So, I had the sweetest and kindest older lady counselor looking right into my eyes while I got about 10 swats.

I couldn't put my ass directly on the chair afterwards for a few days, but I remember it feeling worth it at the time to be able to hang out with my friends before I had to go to work after school instead of sitting in detention for weeks.

***** Way back when, someone did a comparison of Harry's yeargroup to the 1991 census. It's basically perfectly representative of the UK in 1991 in terms of ethnic and geographic diversity. Even Padma and Parvati, as twins, fitted in a weird way, because to be perfectly representative there should have been more than one (but less than two) British Asian (in the UK sense, not the American sense, before anyone gets confused) students. Higher proportions of non-white students would have implied that magic was not evenly distributed through the population, and right now you'd have people complaining about exoticism and JK Rowling implying that POCs have magical powers or are closer to nature. What Hogwarts looks like is like random children were chosen from across Britain, with every child equally likely to be picked.

Americans just assumed it was artificially homogeneous because it didn't reflect the demographics of America.

****** Interesting that someone looked this up; I've had almost exactly the same discussion with rl friends regarding this and that often criticisms ask for a greater representation of US-demographics than those of the UK at that time, and to a lesser extent now.

That's without taking into account that wizarding families are often from rural areas.

Of course, it should mean that the demographic in Albus Severus' year looks different to that of Harry's.

*** I forgot about most of the random stuff Lockhart spouts, as well as how he had Harry play the roles of characters from his books, that was fun to be reminded of.

​

My favourite book is probably HBP - not much for the teenage drama, but I really enjoy getting to know Voldemort through memories, how they always have a different perspective. Seeing that for Hitler would be awesome.

​

My least favourite - at least from my current point of view of someone who knows the books quite well - is the first book. Not much happens throughout the whole book, it mostly focuses on worldbuilding which is unnecessary once one knows the world and overall... It's of course great when you're 8, but it really is more of an introduction.
