I read a fic a 3-4 years ago that was unfortunately unfinished and had like only 8 chapters but I found the idea interesting. How would the GOT characters react to his magic the effects he would have on their wars. Would prefer if it was completed.


** Unfortunately, there isn't much available with this crossover that isn't either trash or abandoned trash. Wizard of Harrenhal (already linked) is pretty much the only thing worth reading imo.

  Elia Martell expected to die in King's Landing, but through some force found herself in the home of a war-weary Harry Potter. She just wants to return to Westeros; wants to see her family, wants the sandy dunes of Dorne and the peace of the Water Gardens. Aegon and Rhaenys are all she has, and for their sake she might have to reclaim a throne that nearly cost them everything.Harry Potter had died in his war and returned to a Wizarding World hell-bent on remaining in the throes of war-time politics. He was tired of Magical Britain, tired of fighting a useless war, but he has a son to care for and no force on earth would stop him from doing so.Raising three kids is hard, raising two of them to eventually rule a kingdom even harder, especially when you're trying to find a way to Westeros.

  His will is the blade in which the coming tide shall fall upon. His duty, the armor that gives him purpose and strength to fight on. His blood the unbreakable shield against the coming darkness. His soul, the last bastion, forged in the furnaces of war. So beware enemies of the North, for the Alpha Wolf has arrived, the North never forgets, and Winter is inevitable.(AU)(TempHiatus)

  Harry always knew that his luck might not be the best. But to be sent to another world so Death could have more entertainment from his life? He might as well use this chance for new life and live it by his rules. It is my work from another site. Someone recommended posting it here, so there you go.Warning: English is my 2nd Language and while I try to keep my work at the highest level I can, I will make errors. Sorry.

  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.
