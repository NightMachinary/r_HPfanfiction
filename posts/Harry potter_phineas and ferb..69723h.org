I wish to prompt someone into doing a short or full length hp/p&f crossover.

The only thing i wish from any possible stories is that P&F have to rock it. With their skills stopping most of the HP problems wouldn't be too difficult they can teleport by phone, travel through time and mess around with it, fly with anti-gravity, beak suit and many others. Heck the teleport could in theory take you to where all of the horcrux are ala 'take me to the closet horcrux'.

Oh and preferably phinabella.

A fun question and possible story idea. How would phineas and/or ferb complete the tri-wizard tasks.

Edit: just remembered they also made a magic carpet and nano-bots, and i reckon with a decent amount of imagination (which phineas has a LOT of) they could do just about anything with them.


** It would be fairly easy to arrange. Basically have Phineas and Ferb decide to build a better version of the device in the movie. They end up in the alternate dimension where Harry Potter is real. Decide they need to help them out and trick the trio out with awesome gadgets!

*** Yeah, but sadly most P&F/HP crossovers are either too short on not quite good, not bad, but not good either.

Hence my prompt idea. If i can get talented writers writing complete crossovers of the aforementioned it might produce a whole new interesting genre. Plus toon force vs. magic is always fun to watch.
