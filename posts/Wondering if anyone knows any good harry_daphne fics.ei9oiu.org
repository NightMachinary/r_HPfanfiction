I really like the pairing, and havent been able to fins anything new


** From the top of my head I would say linkffn(Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent) and linkffn(Ice Cream by Andrius). While the latter is a one-shot fluff piece, the former is a great insight in how the protection of Harry from Lily may have worked.

** Three Black Birds by Exited-Insomniac is quite good. WBWL story where Harry and Daphne are two years older and best friends. Draco also has an OC older brother.

** Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven is a fun series on AO3. The Harry/Daphne doesn't happen until the last story (taken place in 4th year) but the series is one of my favorites. It is a Lord Potter story, with a ravenclaw Harry, good Slytherins, and an emphasis on pureblood culture. I'm not very good at giving discriptions without giving too much away so here is the first story in the series' summery on AO3:

"When a more studious Harry Potter enters Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming"

**** I thought it would be as well, but I found it to be a pretty interesting take on Lord Potter.
