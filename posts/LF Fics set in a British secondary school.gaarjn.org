High school AUs really piss me off cus they can be quite saturated and Americanish. I'd love a fic fully of Britishisms, going to some shitty secondary school, having to deal with GCSEs or A-levels, like the inbetweeners but with Harry Potter characters. I don't know, I'm picky, but any suggestions would be great


** The muggle AU [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who lived"]] might suit you. Completed, covers all seven years, canon pairings.

** I second this! I recall reading a fic where Harry attended Stonewall High (but it wasn't a muggle au) but I don't remember what it was called. RemindMe!

#+begin_quote
  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

** If it's still set in Scotland, it ought to be in a Scottish school - with Standards/Highers/Advanced Highers.

I'd read either though; I also have a deep aversion to American-style secondary schools.
