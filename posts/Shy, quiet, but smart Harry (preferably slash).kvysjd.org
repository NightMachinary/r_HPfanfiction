Not going lie, I like dark/gray slash Harry fics. As well as smart Slytherin Harry who not taking people's bullshit, but I was wondering are there any where he starts Hogwarts and while smart and independent he stays mostly to himself. No standing up for bullied students, studying alone, no being snarky to Snape (or whoever), no forming his own little circle or followers...at least not at first.

I feel like as a abused and bullied kid who was taught to shut up, not ask question and be invisible, Harry would still do that at school. At least until he started to unlearn those habits.

Slash preferred but gen is fine.

Would like but doesn't have to have:

- Bad manipulative Dumbledore/Weasley (doesn't have to be all)
- Slytherin/Ravenclaw friends for Harry
- Harry talking to snakes. I feel like this is something more people need to add. lol
- Harry sort into another house
- Harry/Draco friendship/relationship


** If you like Forget-Me-Not by Lomonaaeren as linked before me, this one by the same author has a much darker Harry in Slytherin, but similarly Harry/Theo relationship: linkao3(15432591)

linkao3(18394907)

This one isn't slash, but is a shy, quiet Harry in Slytherin: linkao3(4913998)

  Harry has some weird words on his left wrist. That must be one of those strange things that Aunt Petunia hates so much. But it's okay! He likes them.Then, it all turns even weirder. Hogwarts, magic, a Headmaster and a Dark Lord await Harry - he would prefer if they all just left him alone, thank you very much.But when has it ever mattered what Harry wants?

  AU. Harry was born with a power the Dark Lord knows not: the magic to see into shadows, to walk the shadows, and to send the shadows everywhere. This changes his life rather dramatically.

  Harry isn't the Boy-Who-Lived, but his parents still died, and Albus Dumbledore, concerned that Death Eaters might seek the boy's death, cast a powerful charm on him to make wizards ignore him before Harry was left with the Dursleys. Except, with the Elder Wand in play, the charm was far too powerful, and made others essentially forget Harry existed when not directly interacting with him. Sorted into Ravenclaw at Hogwarts, Harry lives a contented life with no one either loving or hating him...until the charm breaks on his seventeenth birthday, and he's suddenly plunged directly into the middle of a living world at war.
