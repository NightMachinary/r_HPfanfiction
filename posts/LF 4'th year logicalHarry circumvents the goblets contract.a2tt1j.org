To be clear, im looking for fics abiut Harrys 4'th year, where Harry gets out of competing. Anything from Harry realising you cant bind someone against their will, to refusing to compete and barty jr getting punished by the goblet instead.

Any fic 4'th year where Harrys name comes out, but he gets out of competing by beeing smart :)


** I read a story once where he circumvented the contract by not circumventing the contract. He just did nothing.

Barty was the one who lost his magic because he's the one who put the name into the cup and was the one magically bound by that action.

** If you're willing to go in on both some crack and some Ron bashing, then linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion) might be right up your alley.

Harry finds a way to name a champion for him, and let's Ron have his wish of being the Fourth Champion. Beware, lots of Ron bashing. It's HHr, and there's also quite a bit of, er, well. Easiest way to say it is just to say it. Fart jokes and dick jokes. The thing is pure crack. But Harry does finagle his way out of the tournament, then laugh all the way through the rest of the story as Ron royally messes up again and again.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

  just my take on the seemingly eternal debate about whether or not 'Harry' was Harry's actusl first name. And how it might impact the TriWizard Tournament. This isn't plainchant, so there's Harmony to be had.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

  Harry sees only one option when his name comes out of the cup; run from it. But the Ministry says he entered a contract and laws cross borders. Only one option exists; to go somewhere the Ministry's and the International Confederation's laws can't take hold of him.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
