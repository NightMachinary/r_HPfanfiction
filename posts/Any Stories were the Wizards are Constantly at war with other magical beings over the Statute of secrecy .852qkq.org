A story were other Magical races aren't happy about the Statute of secrecy that the Wizards forced on them and so the International Confederation of Wizards is constantly at War with the other magical Races which is why they don't step in to deal with Voldemort, because he is not trying to expose the magical world he is just not important enough.

It could even give a reason for why Dumbledore and the adults doesn't deal with Voldemort, they are to busy with the ongoing war that that International Confederation of Wizards has going with the other Magical races(but if Voldemort were to ever try to show the magical world to the Muggles The ICW would squash him like a bug)

Were Wizards and Witches are Between a Rock and A hard place With the Muggle world on one side and the United alliance of Magical Beings on the other.


** There's a hint of that in the Fantastic Beasts movie; can't recall if it's policy or widely-held opinion that magical beasts need to be killed off because they represent a threat to secrecy, but it's there.
