** linkffn(Blurring reality) What about dancing in general? He doesn't do hip hop in this fic, but it definitely captures the spirit of dancing well. It's really well written too and very unique. Completely not what you think it will be, it's more of a psychological thriller set in a dance school with supernatural elements, and also some amazing dance scenes.

  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.
