... namely, the Hellsing Organization. At Her Majesty's behest, Sir Integra sends in the best field agent she has to deal with the threat of Voldemort and his Death Eaters - said agent, being, of course, Alucard.

The feast finally winding down, Dumbledore stood up and was making his speech. "And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death-‚Äù

A long and drawn out squeal fills the air. The doors to the Great Hall slowly open, revealing Alucard pushing each side open with but a finger. "My bad, I'll get right on that." Then he stalks up to the head table, grabs Snape by the nose and drags him back to the door to rub his hair on the hinges. His good deed finished, he decided to return his tool back to its resting place. On his way back, a strangled "eep!" could be heard as he passed by a blonde first year at the Slytherin tables.

Alucard stops and turns, ignoring the whimper from Snape due to his neck disagreeing with bending that way and looks at said first year. "Hmmmmm... I remember you from one of those parties... You're related to Hellsing aren't you? We'll just have to make sure you don't develop the hereditary stick in the ass."

Figure we can throw in Greengrass as a main character, but not a romance target. The Hellsings could be the Squib line of the Greengrasses.

Tonks would make a good Police Girl.

Also, Nazi Wizards.

Greyback can co-star as the Nazi Werewolf.

*** The one thing you can shamelessly steal is the Fear Turkey. When Dumbledore won't let Harry or Alucard join his secret club, Alucard will make the Order of the Fear Turkey.
