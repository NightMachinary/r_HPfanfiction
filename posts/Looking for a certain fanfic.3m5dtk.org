Hey guys I'm looking for a story I read a few years ago but never finished. It was a marriage law fix between Ginny/Draco, Hermione/Charlie, Ron/Luna and weirdly enough Padma/ Remus. It was unique in that Remus is in a coma for most of the story and Hermione comes up with a potion to create "cauldron babies" so that Padma could still have a baby with Remus even though he is in a coma. The fic starts out with all 4 girls living together in a flat and was still in progress when I first read it, but I think it was eventually finished. I would love to see how it ended so if anyone knows the title to this story or where to find it it would be greatly appreciated.

*** I don't know about you, but when I read a description like that I'm intrigued. It makes me want to read the story just to find out what the hell the author was thinking. Of course, that attitude has gotten me into some pretty peculiar stories.

*** I'm intrigued by the pairings, I'm now curious as to why Remus was in a coma. Does this law requires procreation? Were the 'cauldron babies' created with consent obtained prior to him being incapacitated? Why these particular pairings?

I'd read it. Might not /like/ it when I'm done, but it's gotten my attention.

*** It sounds a little different I'll admit, but it really is a well written story. I believe I found it under the Ginny/Draco category and got sucked into the other stories in it. Either way it looks like it got deleted, so unfortunately you won't be able to read it to find out.
