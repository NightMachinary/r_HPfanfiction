#+begin_quote
  An unexpected Killing Curse puts an end to Dumbledore's carefully crafted plans and the Battle of Hogwarts ends horribly. Voldemort's victory is absolute and Harry has nowhere left to go. He manages to escape his inevitable fate with some help, but the repercussions of his actions will be felt for years in the --- past? Time Travel. Dark Beginnings. The world is not black and white.
