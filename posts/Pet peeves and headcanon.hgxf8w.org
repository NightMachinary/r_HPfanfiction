Every one have seen countless of headcanons in Harry Potter fan fictions over the years. So many themes and ideas are overused by now.

Write about what you find annoying about those repetitive headcanons, what instead you still find interesting (and if you have your own twist on it) or simply if you have new and original headcanons you have never seen done before


** Ideas that are only half completed, and are underdeveloped and/or unreasonable/unsuitable considering the nature of the wizarding world (too modern, using muggle culture that's incompatible with the wizarding culture etc.)

** There are a lot of headcanons that I dislike, but they all trace back to one specific headcanon:

Grey, neutral(tm) Ice Queen Daphne Greengrass. Like she only exists in name in canon, there are so many ways of possibly writing her, yet she's always this rude, I-Am-Better-Then-You quirky(tm) character who tells Harry that the Weasleys are stealing from her.

Like this is a hatred that even I admit is out of control. Whenever the name is mentioned in a fanfic, I need to take a break from reading.

** Luna sees magical auras. People can just be crazy, that's okay. I'd like to actually see a story about Luna getting treatment.

Magic is all intent and can be done wandlessly. Luna on drugs would be a god if magic was just intent.

Light magic.

Magic being compatible with muggle models of energy.

Muggle wank.

** Overused:

1. The Weasleys are paid to befriend/control Harry. (If so, why are they still poor?)
2. Luna is a seer. (I prefer her oddness to have no real magical explanation.)
3. Goblins are super respectful and helpful to the protagonist. (Nope nope nope - they have no reason to be anything but resentful to wizards. Far too much bloodshed and oppression between the species to make them want to be friends.)
4. Goblins can easily trace human bloodlines. (Why? Why is this a skill they would have ever thought of developing?)
5. Harry is the heir to a bunch of ancient houses as well as 3 of the 4 founders. (First... why is Hufflepuff always left out of his inheritances? He's much more of a Puff than a Claw. Second, why not leave it at Potter-Black? Or Peverell-Black (Peverell was absorbed into Potter, so it should be one or the other.) If you need a founder inheritance story, wouldn't it be more interesting to just pick one, rather than 3?)

New headcanons:

1. Numerous parents (Slytherin and otherwise) bribed their kids to befriend Harry Potter in year one. He had a hard time figuring out who really wanted to be his friend and who was doing it for the extra allowance. Harry found out when Neville sheepishly confessed that his Gran had told him he should befriend Harry "But you probably won't be able to, will you? You're not very much like your father."
2. Luna's dad was killed at the same time as her mum, and she ends up in foster care with Harry, Tom Riddle, Neville, or any other HP orphan, or adopted by any interesting family.
3. Goblins have been plundering the vaults of wizards for centuries, preparing for their next rebellion. The moment Voldemort is defeated, they attack a weakened Wix Britain.
4. You don't go to goblins to trace your bloodlines, you go to the house elves. Even if your family doesn't have elves of their own, you are almost certainly related to a family that does.
5. Harry traces his bloodline and he isn't the heir to all those houses. He isn't even the heir to House Potter! Sure, he looks just like James, but it turns out that James was conceived on the wrong side of the sheets.

Now, I want to read a fic where goblins do that, rebel thinking that they actually stole something important and then get their ass kicked because everyone kept the real artifacts in their homes (and because apparently wands are really powerful)

** That wolfstar is accepted as practically Canon by some people, because honestly I think even Sirius/Snape is more likely

Redemptions, I think it would be way more interesting to have a dark character stay that way but they just have to go with it b/c they both hate Voldemort

I also hate when the twist is to have harry straight up using guns or something, because it's boring and also I don't think it would be much of a stretch to say accidental magic would instinctively prevent one from injuries like that, much like Neville bouncing when he got dropped out a window. Mostly because they never seen seem to show Herry&co magically modifying them, but just using them as they are.
