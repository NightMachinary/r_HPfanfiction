Honestly i cant be the only one who finds Remus and Sirius calling Harry their pup or cub hella cringe can i? And its /soo overused./ It really puts me off from a lot of fanfictions


** For baby Harry, I think it's fine

** I don't know why I started seeing this in fics recently, but I'm inclined to agree.

Lupin would want to keep his werewolfness a secret as much as possible, so it's unlikely he'd ever say "pup" or "cub" in reference to a human child, especially someone as important to him as Harry. He doesn't want to be rejected. And he just doesn't embrace that side of himself at all. A werewolf more comfortable with what they are might say it, but not Lupin.

Sirius just doesn't seem as into the animal names after Azkaban. In AUs where he never gets sent to Azkaban, maybe, but definitely not post-Azkaban Sirius.

And "Prongslet" is.... what? That'd require Harry knowing who Prongs is, and it seems to me a good portion of book 3 was spent keeping Harry in the dark about the Marauders so that he wouldn't go chasing after notorious mass murderer Sirius Black.

*** That said, I think I could see a situation where Harry ends up with the nickname Bucky, although I'm more inclined to think that'd be a nickname the Slytherins give him because of the broom control problems Harry has in books 1 and 3. (Neither instance was his fault, but the Slytherins wouldn't care.)

Sirius hears about the nickname and grins, then Lupin elbows Sirius in the ribs and says "No."

If you want to call Teddy Lupin "Cub" then that's fine.

**** I see where you're trying to lead and I'm not going to dignify that pathetic trick with a response. No, I'll give you this to consider: Wolfstar is cringe because it was a friendship, a good friendship, like many relationships in HP, and turning it into just another tawdry romance is a cheapening of that friendship. POA and OOTP is as much a redemption of that bond after the Marauders' tragedy as anything else.

FF is overrun by people who seem unable to think in terms of any kind of relationship other than romantic. This eager, even rabid overemphasis leads me to wonder if most FF writers can even understand what it means to have a deep and meaningful non-sexual friendship between peers. Because it doesn't seem like they can, the way they assume that a certain level of relationship can only mean romantic proclivity.

****** From your own first source: "Baby wolves are called pups."

I suppose that "cub" is used incorrectly in the UK, and since JKR was British that slipped in, but it's not the right usage of the word. Even by the source you chose.

#+begin_quote
  hought i would say, baby wolves are called cubs not pups. The terms are interchangeable, so both “wolf cub” and “wolf pup” are correct. In some areas they say pups and in other areas they say cubs - in the UK, people usually use “cub”, while in the US “pup” is more common.
#+end_quote

Ooh, fascinating.

Ah, you're probably thinking... "but the rest of it says..." No, the rest of it does not say:

#+begin_quote
  Baby wolves are called pups
#+end_quote

It says "baby wolves /are/ called pups" (emphasis mine). It does not contradict itself. It does not say "actually, these are called pups and not cubs" (or equivalent). It says "baby wolves are called pups" (verbatim). You imagine the contradiction and thus ignore where it says, very clearly:

#+begin_quote
  The terms are interchangeable, so both “wolf cub” and “wolf pup” are correct
#+end_quote

Which goes back to my original point...

#+begin_quote
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Cubs_(Baden-Powell_Scouts%27_Association)]]
#+end_quote

Why does this exist? Why do you ignore it?

And let's go all the way back, actually, to what you said originally:

#+begin_quote
  But not any kind of canine
#+end_quote

[[https://www.lexico.com/definition/cub][Ah, this is also wrong again. Meet fox cubs:]]

#+begin_quote
  ‘Over the summer, which is December to February in the southern hemisphere, the fox cubs become independent and establish their own territories.'
#+end_quote

So, let's return to:

#+begin_quote
  I suppose that "cub" is used incorrectly in the UK,
#+end_quote

There is a word for what you are when you say stuff like that... and it's "prescriptivist". What you're doing here probably also has a term: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercorrection][hypercorrection.]] In particular, you rely on the "rule" that canines don't have cubs. This rule is entirely in your head, I'm afraid.

Dude. You quoted the QUESTION. Not the ANSWER. Did you miss the part where it says, "Anonymous asked" right before the stuff you quote as evidence? The question was posed in a way that presupposed the (incorrect) answer, and the answer ON THAT PAGE, that YOU chose as evidence, denied that. Using that as your fact-check is frankly ludicrous. That's like looking up a question framed as "Do people really need kidneys? I mean, people start with two, but they're just fine with one, so they really don't need them" with the answer being, "No, you really need at least one kidney to live", and then saying, "See, it says you don't really need kidneys!" Using the question as your evidence when the answer denies what was asked is... honestly, are you a troll or an idiot, because I can't think of any other option at this point. We're done here.
