:END:
Okay I know this is such a long shot since Quizzilla was obviously shut down. But I remember reading my very first ever fanfic on there. It was a Harry Potter “quiz” but you basically just read through it like a self insert story. The boys you could choose were Harry, Draco, Fred, George, and I think Ron. You would pick who you wanted at the beginning and then just read through the quiz. If it helps I remember the author always adding links to specific outfits to help you visualize the story better.

This was the first fanfic/story that ever got my heart racing and gave me those little butterflies. I know it was very PG. My sister was the one who originally found it and we would gush over whichever boy we were “with” at the time. Idk if it can be found but any help would be so welcome.
