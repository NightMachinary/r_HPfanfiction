I'm feeling a bit masochistic today, and I want to indulge my love for terrible fanfic. Nothing OC-centered please, so nothing about Harry's long lost sister Shadowsparkle Riverstar or whatever. Despite my love for badfics I do have standards so no pottercest please. But the more stupidly OP Harry is the better. Those fics make me giggle. Thank you!

*** Yeah but then I'd have to wade through the over 750k fics, avoid the diamonds in the rough, the ones with unadvertised pottercest, pick out and discard any about "Bloodrose Malfoy", try to figure out if it's crack or not, work out what's bashing and what's not and THEN find the ones with grammar I can lower myself to stomaching.

I mean Christ, if I wanted to put that much work in, I'd write my own fic.
