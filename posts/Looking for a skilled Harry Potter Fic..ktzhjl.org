I'm looking for a fic where Harry is an adult who is skilled at something. This means he can be a ward master, a rune master, a potions master, a carpenter (I read a beautiful Drarry fic where Harry goes into another universe where he learns woodworking), or any other skilled job and is highly sought out for it. I would prefer if he is an adult but I can be flexible on that. I would like if there are more recs not focusing on dueling..... By the way I have already read RuneMaster, the arithmancer(I really like Harry centric fics so didn't really care for this), the spellcrafter and Silk Roads. Oh and the one in which Harry is MR. Black. Also LOVE MOD!Harry fics


** - linkffn(0-800-Rent-A-Hero) - Harry grows into a badass divinations professor
- linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel) - Harry is a retired member of an elite combat division from the Department of Mysteries
- linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) - Harry is a cunning politician and a master of grand combat

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** I'm reading Harry potter and the problem of potions by wyste right now. It isn't quite what you asked for, as harry is a child/teenager, but it shows a nice perspective on "what if harry liked potions".

Also I am very interested in the fic you mentioned with carpenting, do you have a link or name?

*** Yeah, it's called Turn by Saras_Girl in Ao3. It's set after the canon epilogue and is a gorgeous fic. Harry married and with three kids hears about the Malfoy divorce and then goes into an alternate universe where he is happily married to Draco and makes gorgeous furniture. Except this Harry is not gay(or so he thinks, wink wink) and knows nothing about making furniture. There is sexuality crisis but doesn't really go into the angst territory. Ginny and the Weasley Family is awesome and this whole fic just won't let you stop reading it. Which is why I adore artsy Harry fics. Of which there seems to be none.....

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Kgfinkel/profile][Kgfinkel on AO3]] has a few.

From art to cooking to I think wand making.

Edit: Just read your section again and you speak about adult Harry. All the fics of Kgfinkel are not adult Harry.

*** I just checked out their stories and it's strange....I don't mind bashing usually, but the story is not really Harry centric, it's more like Harry has this hobby in which he is amazing at, the Dursley's are great, supportive parents, and Dumbledore is the evil, conniving 'Light Lord', who is using Harry and his money. Harry and his cooking is a very small portion of the actual story and it was more about fixing the Magical world and making Hogwarts great....not exactly what I was looking for though. But thank you so much because I do love reading fics in which Harry has other careers.
