James looked at the caldron in which he had worked for the better part of a year and smiled triumphant. Yes Lily was by far the best in potions, but he himself wasn't bad at it and had the money to get the ingredients and in this case any advantage is needed.

It all started about a year ago. Dumbledore called him and Lily and told them about the prophecy and let them know that Voldemort would come after them to kill Harry.

All of them thus started to find ways to protect themselves and, more important, Harry. Albus unearthed an ancient and almost completely unknown spell to protect their house. Truth be told, he, Flitwik and Lily basically recreated the spell with the very little information they had. All the better, this way Voldemort won't be able to find cases where the protection was made null and repeat the method.

Neither James nor Lily found this quite satisfactory by itself, yes there home is protected, but if Voldemort manages to enter them they can kiss their life and their son's goodbye. So they started trying to find other ways of protecting their son.

Lily started researching ancient sacrificial magic. James would love to say that he was perfectly comfortable with using it, but the truth is that he isn't. Yes, he would sacrifice his life on a blink if it means Harry gets to live, but he was since his childhood told to keep himself away from this kind of magic. And to be fair, even if he was comfortable with it he wouldn't be of much help, he couldn't even offer much in books, one of his ancestors that saw himself as a Light Lord decided to burn all the works the family owned in what he called ‘filthy and nasty black magic' so the Potters didn't have much on sacrificial magic anymore.

James himself tough wasn't ready to do nothing to protect his son, so he decided to apply what he was good at to give him the best advantage he can.

So James took all his texts in transfiguration and bulked down to study.

In the beginning he didn't have much hope, yes he was very good at transfiguration but Dumbledore was better, and if not even he managed to find something that could be used what chances did James have? Even them James persisted and looked through all he could get his hands on with a fervor never before seen and he actually managed to find something.

It was an old and quite frankly outdated form of transfiguration used before the creation of wands, it didn't have any usefulness in battle and what could be done with a wand was quite frankly much more fluid. But it could do something that transfiguration masters deliberately didn't try, it could fuse permanently two different objects in one that would forever have propriety's of both. This was a frankly undesirable outcome because of how it tended to be unpredictable and cause no end of troubles, but James decided to do this either way.

So he spent a whole year brewing this particular potion and learning how to fuse two different things and today all of his work would be rewarded.

He carefully painted the circle in the ground to simbolize the isolation of the elements used in the magic so he wouldn't have to worry about a fly interfering in the pseudo-ritual. Than he painted in dragon blood and a little of Harry's own blood seven concentric triangles and put quartz crystals in every corner, to simbolize power and stability and finally he put Harry and the potion at different corners of the ritual.

The potion he spent so much time brewing was nothing other than Felix Felicis, most known as liquid luck. He put his magic in the outer triangle and started the process.

It almost drained him of all his magic to try transfiguration in to magical things with a method created long before the idea of energy conservation, but in the end he managed to merge Harry with the potion, giving him a lifetime of luck.


** What would you call it? The Obelix Gambit? Pot of Luck?

It's definitely an interesting concept. I suspect it would be easiest to pull off as a crack fic or, once Harry's life is Voldemort free, perhaps the law of unintended consequences would make it ripe for angst? (I mean, based on what we see in HBP the potion is very much a "not what you want, but what you need" type deal.)

*** Actually by what we see at the sixth book I would say that the potion simultaneously affect the world so things will fall in their place (Harry managing to get out of the castle without being spotted and finding the doors open) and affect the user so that they will take the best course to what they want to happen (Harry disregarding the plan and information they were working under before taking the potion and going visit Hagrid)

Also it seems to only do what the user wants, otherwise Harry would have found some short-cut to kill Voldemort or at least Racenclaw's Diadem instead of only Slughorn's memory. And this is assuming that Voldemort does have some protection that prevents Harry's luck from just outright causing a serie of accidents and getting him killed.

Tough this brings up the question if he and Dumbledore could have gotten the whole Horcrux hunt over in a day or even a week using the potion, I kind of remember that there was some kind of protection against the potion on the cave and Gringotts probably would also have this same protection bait the locket was out of the cave, Hogwarts obviously don't have this protection and the diary and the ring were already destroyed the only ones that they would have to try and find would be the cup, Nagini was with Voldemort all the time so could be killed with him, the same for Harry.

#+end_quote

Yes, this is precisely what I mean.

Look at what happens to Harry. He grows up in precisely the right environment, meets precisely the right people in the right order (imagine if he met someone with more subtlety than Draco in Madam Malkin's) and so forth. It all boils down to someone who would believably walk into the Forbidden Forest with no intention of walking back out. And, for that reason, Harry survives.

But is this the best course?

One of the things that really annoys me about Manipulative!Dumbledore fics is the way they deal with Horcrux!Harry. Invariably they find some alternative method to remove the horcrux (most of which are actually every bit as risky, if not more so than the canon solution) and then use Dumbledore's failure to pursue /that/ option to criticise Dumbledore's plan.

The important point here is that whatever I think of how the fanfic authors use their solutions, I do think they're often plausible sounding. And they're frequently tied up with plots that are worse for Harry. Most of his positive relationships with adult characters are destroyed, he's often got to do worse things, he's pushed into strange circumstances etc. etc. I think some of them are even in the "you've got to kill people in a war" vein of reasoning.

Conclusion? Canon's course is the best course to achieve James' intended action "Harry survives". And it's why I think you could make a fairly angsty fic from this prompt.

But... to answer your point about the Horcruxes?

When Harry listens to Felix in HBP, I think we see two limiting factors to its viability. Firstly, on the theme above, we see that Harry doesn't really see things play out as he intends. It uses knowledge Harry doesn't possess and contrives to ensure Harry is in the right places at the right times. It's hard to get a sense of "need" versus "want" since Harry's objectives are so specific. Basically the only incidental thing that I remember happening is brushing against Ginny and thereby causing her breakup with Dean. And /obviously/ Harry wants this to happen but Ginny is also part of Rowling's canon course, so by the reasoning above its also something Harry needs to happen. I think that's more than sufficient evidence that "liquid luck" isn't reliable. I also think it's evidence for "what you need, not what you want" but that's a stricter burden to meet.

Secondly, Lucky!Harry's actions are completely ineffable to his friends. There is simply no way that anyone could work with someone else while dosed up. There's also no particular way to ensure that one's actions are consistent with one's friends' wishes. Look at Slughorn's exploitation of Aragog's corpse. That sort of thing could play out very differently.

I seem to also remember Hermione's saying something like "it just exploits things you weren't consciously acting on". Harry knew there was something going on with Aragog. Harry knew Slughorn was greedy and liked his mum. He just couldn't see how these things could all fit together. If Aragog died the following week, say, this interpretation might imply that the events of that night would've played out to the effect of making Slughorn and Hagrid friends. That way Harry and Slughorn both get invited to the funeral and Harry would have the opportunity but necessarily the instinct to exploit it as Lucky!Harry did in the book.

If Hermione really did say that, then it's obviously a very strict limit on the capacity of the potion. But I think even from just the first two points, no amount of luck could speed up the Horcrux hunt... except, presumably, in the sense Harry might have tried to open the Locket earlier.

And then there's the whole addictive thing that's in some fanfics. I think that comes from something Rowling said? This is another quite strong limiting factor.

I think any two of those arguments make "Felix's help" either unwelcome or insufficiently game changing.

***** You do have a good point in the whole cannon was the best course of action and so the potion wouldn't have changed much. But what I'm really interested are the possible changes inside cannon structure, like, Harry wants to know who is Nicholas Flamel and stumbles in a book talking about him, or just immediately remembers the card if we are going by the limit Hermione establishes. Or him reading the exact answers of Snape's quiz just before class.

“Secondly, Lucky!Harry's actions are completely ineffable to his friends.” Yeah, that's true, but to be fair it could be used to just make the story even more interesting, like explore different characters reaction to a Harry that seems to behave like he's permanently under the potion, the Dursley's for example, how would they react to someone who seems to be able to see the future? How about other Hogwarts students? Would they believe that Harry is a seer, or would they treat him like Luna? And how would the other characters behavior affect Harry? And for that matter, how would Harry himself perceive his behavior in context with other people?

The whole addictive and poisonous thought become a moot point. Harry didn't drink endless doses of the potion over his whole life, he merged with it. But this brings up the question of if other characters would become lucky by consuming his blood for example. This could have as a possible effect turning Voldemort in someone as luck as him if he used the ritual at book 4.

I think the effects were said to be permanent, so it wouldn't even have to be done with any special means of making it permanent. Would be interesting seeing the Dursley's trying to raise a baby Harry that could quite easily and carelessly rip their arms out. Not sure if it would change much in his Hogwarts years or in the war though, physical violence is not much used later-on.

Now I'm thinking of this Harry finding a Superman comics and believing he is a kryptonian.

Perhaps the government wishes to get British Representatives on the Justice League and thus "Leonus" is Born.

**** This is true. However, we're also talking about the kid that thought buying a golden cauldron would be neat, so we can infer that Harry has no idea how much things cost. Not only is the potion a volatile and dangerous time dump, but we can also infer that at least two of the ingredients could be relatively expensive due to source material: ashwinder eggs (which burst into flames) and occamy eggshells (which are precious metals). Those would most likely need a specialize buyer that a Master Potioneer would use. There's at least some reason that this potion's recipe is only listed and never attempted as a class.

** /Filthy muggle-lover./ thought the most evil dark lord in history, The Dark Lord Voldemort, to himself. He had just executed another detractor and thorn in his side, an insignificant wallfly named Potter, and was currently gliding up the stairs of the very modest, homely home.

(the dissonance of the two atmospheres would have given anyone a stroke, but (un)luckily, the Dark Lord himself was immune to such trivialities, having sacrificed his sense of atmosphere for the ability to wandlessly set fire to things quite a while ago. There was a reason Bellatrix was in charge of the Lair decorations.)

He slid into the room beyond the flimsy wooden door after reducing it to ash, and found the target of his hatred inside a small crib. Before that crib, there was an obstacle. He would have blasted her into the afterlife already, had he not promised her to Severus. (Un)luckily for him, he had not yet executed the dark ritual planned for that evening, one which would sacrifice his sense of loyalty to one's subjects for another piece of power. And so he gave the foolish girl a choice, and she choose. And she died.

With little fanfare and zero remorse, the Dark Lord pointed his wand at the infant, drew the dreaded rune in the air, and hissed the darkest curse in history with as much hatred as he could. There was a loud rushing noise, and... nothing? The baby hiccuped. It lived!

/Weird,/ thought Voldemort to himself, and demonstrating an extraordinary lack of sense, did not attempt to find out why the unblockable curse was blocked. Sacrificing one's sense of logic in the case of choosing clothes for the ability to imperius ghosts tends to have that effect. All logic is linked, and he had sacrificed quite a few bits of it. He was not the most rational man.

And so, he cast again. And again. And again.

After a while, he began noticing a small pile of dead flies and mosquitoes on the floor directly in front of his wand, and stopped casting.

/Well, it's not as though I don't know any other lethal curses./

And so he prepared to cast something different. A piercing curse, to be precise. It would fire a lance of force that pierced stuff, pretty straightforward.

But then, he fumbled while casting, and the curse hit the crib again. So he cast again. And he fumbled once more.

His anger was rising now.

He began casting darker and darker and more and more gruesome curses, but they were all averted by the most ridiculous series of coincidences he had ever witnessed. Spells interacted with magical currents in the air and became harmless. Random insects, dustmotes and sawdust from the ceiling blocked his curses. The crib was pushed by his own foot, making him miss.

After a while, he gave up and pulled out the vial of basilisk venom he carried with him.

But even that did not work. He had to be very careful, and the vial almost slipped from his fingers three or four times as he lowered it. He did NOT want it to splash him.

So he dripped a drop of the venom above the boy, only for him to sneeze suddenly.

The Dark Lord fell back and clawed at his crimson eye, because the drop had landed in it. Demonstrating the ability he had gained for sacrificing the blood connection to his father, he gripped the slowly melting eyeball with his claw-like hand and tore it our of his head, before bellowing in rage.

Now one-eyed and slightly blinded, the dark wizard gripped the vial in both hands, ripped off the dropper, and poured all its contents over the crib.

But nothing happened. The venom hit and corroded through an empty sheet, because the boy had stood up and was laughing at him.

Laughing!

He hated the child. The boy was as annoying a target as his parents. If magic or venom did not work, he'd have to do it muggle style. What did muggles do with their kids again? suffocate them with a pillow, at least that's what he'd seen at the orphanage from time to time.

However, there were no pillows. Anywhere.

"Well, guess this will be a little more bloody."

Then he demonstrated the gift he'd gained when sacrificing his love for cats, and his fingernails grew into grotesque claws, which he stabbed into the boy.

Or at least, tried to.

Because you see, just because James had pulled his plan, did not mean Lily had not pulled her plan.

There is a quirk in magical rituals, which states that power in must equal power out. A human life has a great amount of power, enough to overcome the certain death of the killing curse, but once that was done, it was gone. One life for one life. Lily was not just life, she was magic as well, and that magic is what guided the enchantment in an alternate Harry's first year, when it burned the mortal shell of the dark one's wraith.

However, Voldemort had not used the Killing Curse, whose structure was derived from the Veil at the heart of the Department of Mysteries. No, he had used his body.

And if a mere sliver of magic could burn that body to ash, an entire life and magic could do so, so much more.

Voldemort burned that day, in more ways than one. The sacrificial energy worked like fiendfyre upon first his magic, then his life, and finally his soul. He was scorched from the outside in, and the energy followed every tether, every hidden corridor and connection. All the marked Death Eaters lost their arm that day. The Dark Mark combusted, and when they figured out how to dispel the magical fire, few were left with anything but a scorched bone. A small connection also burned that day, mostly unnoticed. A Tiara's gem melted. A ring slowly became shinier. A golden cup exploded into a thousand shards, instantly killing the woman tasked with watching over it. A diary smoldered and leaked ink.

The Dark Lord was gone.

** I'm suddenly reminded of linkffn(Little Guy by Clell65619) where this happened to Snape, and turned him into a muscular bronzed Adonis who had every woman who saw him throwing themselves at him, couldn't walk around Hogsmeade without constantly tripping over bags of money, and couldn't enjoy making potions anymore because no matter how many mistakes he made, they'd always turn out fine, so there was no challenge. He very quickly had a breakdown from being so damned lucky.

  What if Lilly was a little more prepared to escape if Voldemort came calling. She knew that the Floo and Portkeys could be disabled, what if she had found a back door? Just a silly little story of a somewhat different Harry

** There was a fic some still some time ago (before the author deleted it I guess) where the premise was that Draco needed an heir to get his fortune ASAP and Pansy wasn't going to work out for some reason. So he ends up making a pregnancy potion and somehow hitches up with Harry, then tries to hide the pregnancy from him. Incidentally, Harry fell into a cauldron of Felix Felicis when he was a baby so he's pretty lucky, but it's not the main point of the story. Unfortunately I can't remember the name, it was hilarious. And now it's deleted, can't reread it even though I want to for the third time in 10+ years.
