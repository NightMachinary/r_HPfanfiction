** I tried hard. I really did.

I just couldn't slog through it. I couldn't find the central narrative. Like most next gen fics, there was too much time spent on introducing the the next generation and not enough time formulating an interesting plot. I got through 7 chapters and just found myself bored.

The quality of the writing is fine, but without a strong hook, it's hard to get involved in this fic.

** Okay, so I was skeptical of this at first. It seemed a bit heavy handed in the beginning, like most next gen fics can be, but as the story developed I really got sucked in. The turning point for me was when they actually arrived at Hogwarts. I thought the characters were very realistic, and personally, I love reading believable older children. 11/12 year olds really bring back the nostalgia of reading Harry Potter all over again.

I love the idea of Teddy being a Hufflepuff like his mom, especially now that it is confirmed in canon and am happy with the inter-house tropes, the First Year Table, and how it was used. The author was great at creating believable and engaging characters.

From a story telling perspective, the plot really draws you in. Small details like Ella's background or Teddy hiding the fact that he is an orphan really engaged me well, I am still looking forward to reading the sequel and later chapters!

The only thing I take issue with is I don't believe, from the backstory we have been given, that Teddy would be as reluctant to go to adults for help. I understood why young Harry was like that, adults had only failed him all his life. But the plot device of Teddy (at least in my perspective) from the books is that he had an opportunity to grow up with adults who loved and respected him. Hopefully the author delves more into that. I do love the parallels drawn between Teddy and Professor Longbottom though!

The sequel looks promising, the premise is technically an old one but with a fresh new take so I am excited to keep reading.

Great pic mods!

*** Yea I don't understand how he's not trusting of adults more. I don't see him not sharing things right away with Harry. Also I think Harry should've had a stronger reaction to Teddy's beat down.

** It's hard not to compare this to the benchmark for teddy lupin first year fics which is a hogwarts houses divided. That being said there are some cool characters in here and also I love how close he gets to Neville. I don't like that in these fics Harry isnt as involved in Teddy's life as I would like him to be. Harry didn't have parents growing up so I would think he would be a lot closer to teddy. Overall good fic.

** I'm in chapter 11 and it's kinda boring...nothing much happens and the OC's are uninteresting or cliched, especially Ella.

For the next read, after Indigo Autumn, I propose Latet Anguis in Herba by Slide.
