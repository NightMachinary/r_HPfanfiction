** The Last Enemy: Howling Nights by CH_Darling on AO3 is the first part of four Marauders Era fics. This one is set in their fifth year. Idk how to link it but it should be easy to find on the internet. The second part, 6th year, is coming out soon, but the first book is done.

  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.

  Aunt Petunia gasped her pain out against Holly's clammy neck even as she turned, her head lolling, to glare hatefully at Bellatrix. “You will not take her. My sister---““---is dead, little muggle,” said Bellatrix. “As will you if you do not give us Potter.”Holly's heart constricted for the space of half a heartbeat. Aunt Petunia did not want her. She'd gotten Uncle Vernon killed. She'd brought the war to their doorstep. She'd---“Over my dead body, you stupid witch!” Aunt Petunia gasped, her arms convulsively twitching around Holly's shoulders, her nails digging into her skin. “You've killed my sister, my husband... I---I won't let you kill my niece too!”Bellatrix laughed loudly, a loud maniacal cackle that seemed to fill Holly's world with fire and brimstone. “On your head be it. Avada Kedavra!”

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right?
