Looking for fics where Ron's (or any Weasleys, really) heritage comes into play. I don't (necessarily) mean that Ron is a Ginger Malfoy, but for all that the Weasley's are labeled Blood Traitors and Muggle Lovers, and the like, they're still an old (possibly Ancient and/or Noble...at one time, anyway) Pureblood family (along with the Prewitt's, far as I can tell), and though they allegedly don't act like it or observe....traditions publicly, I still find it hard to believe they'd disregard them completely.\\
Off the top of my head, there's Runaway Wizard linkffn(Runaway Wizard) that I just finished, and a bit in The Red Knight linkffn(The Red Knight) as well. Doesn't even need to be Ron/Weasley-Centric. Thanks!
