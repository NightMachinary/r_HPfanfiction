Looks for a story I read awhile ago where Harry meets the founders in like a special bag or something and they turn out to be exile higher beings or something and after some shit in his home world they transport him and a bunch of house elves to the avengers universe and he takes a job as a UN translator but eventually starts to sell potions and other magic stuff that his elves are making in a like magic bag or something.

Any help would be great not sure if I'm combining two different story's or what but I think that's just about right.

Edit: I'm reading it, and it seems like a hilarious shitfest of stupid tropes already in chapter 1.

Edit 2: I'm almost a hundred percent sure this is the fic OP was looking for.

Google search turned this up.

*** Oh yeah that's it it's a total mess of just Harry winning at everything but it was on my mind and I couldn't think of the name. Thanks!

  Portraits of the Founders help Harry using a ritual to send him on a one way trip to a different reality. However the Creator had other somewhere else in mind so he was sent to a different Earth. Super Harry. Rich Harry. No Slash. H/Multi.(Indefinite Hiatus - If you want to adopt or use this story, please feel free to do so.)

A very good, ongoing crossover - Post war Harry joins the avengers. It's mostly based on the cinematic universe, but brings in some elements of the books (Squirrel Girl and She-hulk, for example) and shows (Agents of Shield, Daredevil). Highly recommended.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.
