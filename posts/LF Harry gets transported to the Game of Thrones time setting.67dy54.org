I would prefer fem!Harry but I'm not choosy.

Preferably Harry as a wizard and a more behind the scenes character i.e. a maester

I don't want him reborn into a character but transported.

Thanks!

** There's not that many crossovers, and fewer that are readable. Only takes a minute or two to look through them all yourself.

** The Difference One Man Can Make is sadly the best of the bunch. It's readable if you're looking for this sort of thing, but isn't actually good.
