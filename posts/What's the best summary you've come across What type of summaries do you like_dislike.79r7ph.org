I'm looking for what people like in a summary more so than what they dislike, but hey, go for either one.


** A summary should be informative - screw this pretentious shit that tries to sounds "deep" and tells you literally nothing about the fic content. On the other hand, it needs to be catchy and attention-grabbing. Hard to balance that, especially in a limited number of words.

*** I've put off reading Emperor because of that. linkffn(5904185) It tells me nothing of what the story is going to be about, and with the length, I wasn't inclined to start it until I actually saw a decent summary of it here

**** That's much more descriptive than the stuff I've meant. You can say from this description and Harry being the main character that it will be about Harry reaching for power and changing the world.

Look at linkffn(The Lesser Sadness by Newcomb). What the hell is this supposed to say about the fic?

** I'm terrible at writing summaries. I just kind of want to wave my hands and go, "There's this guy and stuff happens!" but that's just not the way to do things. Sometimes I find summaries that use a snippet of dialog pique my interest, but a lot of times those just go on way too long and the summary ends up being like half a page. If you have a memorable quote or maybe a sort of cliffhanger-ish quote, that can be cool.

** Please don't tell me things I already know. Tell me what makes your story different. And when I say tell me, I literally mean tell me. Don't use hypotheticals (what if? who is? what would? etc) to suggest a premise, and don't use a checklist of cliches. Use 3rd person simple past or simple present tenses (unless it's a self-insert, then 1st person is alright).

  Shining examples of literary genius abound as Harry & friends do some stuff, and some other stuff, and some other stuff, and then some stuff happens, and some people do some stuff. And then Snape cuts his head off with a chainsaw, everybody is Luna, Oliver Wood plays Slayer out his mouth, and some other stuff... whatever.

** Well... Probably my very favorite summary is from Wastelands of Time.

#+begin_quote
  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
#+end_quote

Quirky non sequitur intro, introduction of main character, allusion to upcoming plot point, and the gimmick that makes it worth reading. A+ summary in my book. His book. I didn't write the book, it's his - you know what I mean.

As for what I dislike, you know how amateur writers will always end use a lot of question marks? At the end of every sentence? With an upward inflection? So it always sounds uncertain? With a yes or no question that is beyond easy to guess? Can someone shoot me please?

** Dislike: Anything along the lines of "I suck at summaries" "why don't you just read it already" Just mentioning overused tropes without any details. So it is a Gamer!Harry fic, what makes your's different? So you are doing a redo-fic, why not give me a tidbit of where your story is going?

Edit: Also, if you are doing a divergence fic, do more than the point of divergence in the summary. I mean, it is important, but "What would happen if Harry did this differently? Read and find out" is not good. Tease what is going to happen, not the divergence point that you read in the first paragraph. I love divergence fics, but this just...

Like: Communicating the mood of the fic (Drama? Humor?) If I can see a connection between your summary and the first few paragraphs of your first chapter.
