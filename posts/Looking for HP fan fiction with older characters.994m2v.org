I finished reading The Politician's Wife, and I really enjoyed the mature take on the characters. They were all in their forties, had families, and were dealing with adult problems (jobs, family, the effects of the war). It was refreshingly different from all the stories focused on teenagers.

Does anyone have any recommendations for aged up Harry Potter fics? Or maybe a story that focuses on the adult characters during the Wizarding War? Especially if they feature McGonagall, she's awesome.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]] focuses on Harry, Ron, and Hermione in their sixties fighting back against a new pure-blood movement. There's a good amount of family stuff, since the next-gen kids have kids of their own by this point.

*** The author also wrote a oneshot which has the best potrayel I have seen of an older Hermione.

The story itself does the adults well, they feel very experienced.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12758673/1/Inside-the-Lines][12758673)]] is a post DH story about Andromeda Tonks. I haven't had a chance to read it all yet but it certainly seems better than the average fanfiction. It looks as if a number of the author's fics are about adult characters.
