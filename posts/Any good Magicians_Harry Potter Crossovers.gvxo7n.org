Been looking for one as I think the worlds meah decently well together but haven't really had any luck finding any.


** I really really wish there were, but I haven't seen any. The Magicians fandom doesn't seem to have a ton of fanfic, from what I can tell.

*** That sucks. The two mesh really well together tbh.

**** I think it would be tough to reconcile the magic system, but that's never stopped anyone doing crossovers before, lol.
