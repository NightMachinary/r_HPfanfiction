** got to thepetulantpoetess.com or ashwinder.sycophanthex.com. TPP is one of the best HP archives around, and Ashwinder is a dedicated archive for SSHG.

Also, on livejournal there are numerous communities for SSHG including the AMAZING sshg_exchange, which is currently posting this year's gifts, but there are also like 6 years worth of exchange fics (and art) there.

As for fics? Care of Magical Creatures, Cloak of Courage, Second Life, The Silvering Divide, Spinster are just some of the favorites epics I have. Outstanding authors are miamadwyn, lariope, subversa, tonksinger ariadne ferporcel. Just be aware that some of those are NSFW.

EDIT: WELCOME TO THE COMM!!!

**** Princess of Gryffindor too. Somewhere in my comment history is a list of about 15 recommended stories on the aforementioned websites. I will try to pull it up once I get from my phone to computer. Oh, and if you need a soul ripping cry-fest read /Heart with No Companion/.

** Snanger is possibly the worst ship name I've ever had the misfortune of reading. I rue the day someone decided to merge names together in the name of shipping. It was a terrible idea.

But as for suggestions:

[[http://www.obscurusbooks.org/html/Hayseed/Thursdays/index.html][Getting the Hang of Thursdays]], by Hayseed (No rating provided; I think it was about a PG-13, though it's been a few years since I read it so could be a little more, but definitely not NC-17)

#+begin_quote
  A good day goes bad and then gets far worse than Severus could ever have imagined. Again and again and again.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/hayseed/OP.html][Ordinary People]], by Hayseed ([[http://www.obscurusbooks.org/html/Hayseed/OrdinaryPeople/index.html][Alternate Link]]) (PG-13)

#+begin_quote
  How do ordinary people cope with their extraordinary circumstances? A SS/HG romance that strives for realism.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2230284/1/][Unfinished Business]], by Ramos (M)

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger dies in a potions accident during her final year at Hogwarts. She's not thrilled when she comes back as a ghost, and really not happy at the idea of spending eternity haunting Severus Snape's classroom.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.witchfics.org/fr/index.html][The Fire and the Rose]], by MetroVampire & Rhosymedre (NC-17)

#+begin_quote
  A Snape/Hermione body-swap fic.

  #+begin_quote
    /Sorry that's all there is to give. It's been about eight years since I read it and it was only the once, but I recently came across it again and remembered really enjoying it so set it aside to read later, but I don't remember enough to give a more detailed summary and the author's don't provide much of one either unfortunately.)/

**** Better than Snanger, but I despise ship names in general. I will always just use initials or full names.

** I like dressagegrrrls stories. They're all ssxhg. Very lemoney though, but she pre warns you of the scenes and they're not needed for the story lines. Currently re reading a murder of crows by hogwarts91. I really love that story. It gets stressful at times but I feel it's very true to character for SS. Really suspense filled.

Enjoy your new ship!

** I came up with this list of stories that I liked. These are all on Petulant Poetess in the category of "Potions Under Duress". They can probably be found in other places too, I just like PP.

A Change is Going to Come - Also called "Vanity" in a couple places, a time travel fic that is pretty good if you are ok with time travel fanfic logic.

Being Hermione Granger - I just remember liking it, not too much more about the plot though. Standard romance I think...

Care of Magical Creatures - Romance adventure, Marriage Law Challenge. I really like MLC and this one didn't disappoint.

Flight of the Prince - I know I liked it, I think it's an adventure romance, but I don't remember plot details.

For Hogwarts: A Regency Gamble - This one was adorable. It reads like a Jane Austen novel. How to raise money for Hogwarts in the aftermath of the war? Have a historical theme week at the castle. Totally AU, but adorable.

Hilltop Cottage - Very cute romance.

Improbable Felicity - Another cute romance.

Phantom of Hogwarts - Hogwarts makes a production of "The Phantom of the Opera". Fabulous story. I also think it is the longest SSHG story in the fandom.

Phoenix Song and Phoenix Tears - Gradual romance, shows the behind the scenes of HBP and DH from Hermione's viewpoint.

Raven - The name sounds awful, but it's a good story! Gradual romance and had a few plot points that you don't see everywhere.

Sage - 30 years later and compliant with the epilogue while also coming across as plausible!

Southern Magic- Neat plot ideas. Totally AU. The story itself is maybe a "B", but it's different and is a nice contrast to traditional stories.

Spinster - Eventually a romance, good traditional plot. Some very funny scenarios.

The Godfather - Achingly beautiful. Just read it if you haven't already.

The Love You Take - Lovely romance.
