** I've just read through that conversation. You [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9w4gvy/the_black_prince_was_just_updated_with_a_final/e9j3ivo/][got called a bellend once]]. You, on the other end, [[https://snew.github.io/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9w4gvy/the_black_prince_was_just_updated_with_a_final/e9ib1tf/][insulted a fanfiction writer]], [[https://snew.github.io/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9w4gvy/the_black_prince_was_just_updated_with_a_final/e9l8j97/][the /mother/ of another user]], and were just an awful person to everyone in that thread. Yes, mod abuse is a real thing, but in this case I side with the mods, and I wouldn't be surprised if you got banned.
