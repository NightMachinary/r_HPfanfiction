Basically the title.

I have been reading Harry Potter fanfiction for a long time, maybe about 8-9 years. But never have come across this name. Imagine my surprise when I saw the name and thinking why an OC being tagged.

*** Leanne isn't that rare, she's Katie's friend in canon and appears occasionally when a fic focuses on her.

Leanne gets 19 direct mentions in the books, all in book 6, and all relating to katie bell's incident with the cursed necklace (she's the friend that was with her at that moment)

The others are not book canon.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.
