Does anyone know a good fanfiction where Harry has a special magical power which he tries to keep secret?


** linkffn(barefoot) it's not a complete secret but only those like 3 or 4 people close to him know

*** Great fic, can't wait for the next update and am really hoping is not scantiness but 3 months isn't the longest a fic had gone before revival. I think I would take sometime else picking up the story or do a whole new fic with the same premise

  AU. Harry was born with a power the Dark Lord knows not: the magic to see into shadows, to walk the shadows, and to send the shadows everywhere. This changes his life rather dramatically.
