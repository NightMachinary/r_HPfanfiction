I have never come across any fics, where the future/present that the MC (and co.) are trying to avert involves muggleborns ruling over everything, while purebloods (and some half-bloods) are treated worse than dirt and forced into the equivalent of marriage laws. Are there any good fics that have purebloods serving muggleborn families or purebloods having house-elfs for superiors?


** The biggest issue you'd face with anything like this is you'd have to create something worth saving. A reason other than pure bigotry for there to be some reason for the reader to care about the MC. Maybe, just maybe you could have the muggleborns getting drunk on the power they got through the sympathy they'd get after Voldemort, still, even if they abused that power you'd struggle to not get flamed for in anyway supporting the purebloods. You'd have to create a compelling AU in which there is something truly magical about the magical world which has to be preserved and the muggleborns are endangering that. From what we see in the books there is little to nothing redeeming about the wizarding world. Being quirky isn't enough to outweigh the flaws it has. At this point its an ambitious AU and I suspect you'd still get flamed by people associating anything magical culture wise with Voldemort. You'd have to make it very clear that Voldemort was an evil nutcase who hated muggleborns and in no way shared the views of your MC.

*** Or you could write an AU that completely repudiates the canon world.

But getting something like that right is super hard, and all such attempts so far have ended up being abandoned according to my experience.

You could also write a new Muggleborn Dark Lord rising after Voldemort. That person might have suffered greatly under Voldemort's reign of terror and was determined to destroy the existing magical establishment. His/her strategy was to build a powerful presence in the Muggle world through the use of memory charms, hire away disgruntled Muggleborns and Squibs from the magical world, and eventually use the Muggle government/military to destroy the magical establishment.

I don't think such a fic has ever been written.

** There was one fic I read where Hermiones secretary was part of a group for muggle born sympathizers who were killing off pure bloods and death eaters but I don't remember what it was called. It really wasnt well written, which was sad because the idea was really cool.

** I would say that is likely because in canon purebloods (in general) have more power than muggleborns. It would take a large shift in power (or a massive AU) for them to be even capable of oppressing them, much less doing so.

I've never read a fic that has this, much less has it well done and would certainly be interested in this premise. The issue is that this would either require an extremely creative AU or a lot of weird stuff happening after the BoH.

*** Well, there's "Marriage Law Revolution", where the Muggleborn take over and oppress/purge the purebloods as a reaction to a Marriage Law in October Revolution style.

**** I mean that's not really believable though, and is barely readable. A marriage law like that being enacted is already a stretch and it just gets more ridiculous from there. I'd hardly use that as an example of a "good" fic.

** The reason you don't see that, Is because the past two generations have been raised to believe that anything that is traditional or conservative is somehow inherently evil.

Any fan fiction that is written that posits the idea that traditional wizarding values have some sort of validity or purpose tend to be heavily criticized and poorly reviewed.
