** linkffn(Conspiracy) is one of my favorite fics. There's minor Dumbledore/Weasley bashing (& some pretty major Ginny bashing) though, if you're not into that. BUT it definitely is a fic that doesn't put marriage contracts in a positive light.

*** I don't mind a little bashing as long as it doesn't devolve into comic book villainy. What I do mind is Snape being portrayed in an overly positive light.

I just don't quite comprehend how so many people can excuse his behavior simply because he might have been bullied in school. But I don't really want to get into an in depth discussion over Snape, i've had far too many of those and they always end with both sides unwilling to change their minds.

Does he play a big role or is the focus on Harry and Ginny?

***** I never quite understood the idea of a Ginny/Harry "marriage contract" story unless it was related to a life debt or something. I mean, that's the original pairing and Ginny was literally written in by JK to be a match for Harry. Not to say some wont like it or it cant be well done... It just surprises me someone would write one.

**** Snape is in for barely any time at all. The first time I read it, I didn't look at the pairing so I didn't even realize it was technically a Snarry fic until basiclaly the last paragraph. The focus is on Harry/Ginny.

  After Voldemort's defeat, and in order to keep control of Harry Dumbledore enacts a marriage contract between Harry and Ginny. Bound by Pureblood Traditions, Harry can only use that to his advantage. Not a Harry/Ginny fic. Pre Slash.
