I remember a Fic were canon Harry was summoned by a Dumbledore from another dimension. The travel almost killed him and left him with maaaany scars. I think the Harry of that universe was female. Thanks in advance!


** Are you thinking of 0800 Rent a Hero?

*** This story is abandoned and ends on a cliffhanger btw, as a warning. I really enjoyed it but wish I had picked a point to stop reading.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
