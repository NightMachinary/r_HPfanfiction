What is the appeal of fem!Harry? What makes you like it? What makes it appealing in comparison to reading stories about canon, male Harry? Or, any other version of Harry?

I read my first fem!Harry story today and... I honestly don't understand its purpose.

The story I read was, for the most part, well-written. There were a few spelling errors that were mostly typos; it hit my preferred tropes and had an interesting plot, even if it went nowhere and at least 3 of the 15 chapters were notes, pictures, or "letters" that added nothing to the overall narrative (I won't link the story, as I don't want it to be a bash against the author. It was a perfectly fine story, well-liked with a significant number of kudos and comments on it on AO3).

But Harry was not "Harry" (or a Harriet, or a flower-name, if you want to go with those - this person completely altered their name in both the original timeline and then the alt timeline). This version swore like a sailor, knew runes, and was creating ward schemes and runic arrays. Yes, it was an AU but it was /such/ an AU that it might as well have been an OC instead of "Harry."

So... someone please explain?

EDIT: Thanks for the fantastic comments, everyone! They were inspired and detailed and I'm looking forward to going through the recs to broaden my thoughts on fem!Harry. 😊


** Let's be real: compared to all the other characters in the books, Harry is pretty boring. This makes sense for our point of view character, since it means it's easier for us to project ourselves into his shoes and experience the world around him for ourselves, but it's hard for a lot of fanfic writers to grab onto. What most fanfic writers do instead is just rewrite Harry's personality so he's the star instead of the world; Harry is methodical and rational, or Harry is super independent, or Harry is a Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw or Slytherin, blah blah blah.

Fem!Harry is an extension of this. The author is just rewriting Harry into someone that they feel is more interesting or makes their story more interesting.

** I don't have any particular attachment to fem!Harry over normal Harry, but frankly, Harry varies so wildly between fanfics that he almost always boils down to an OC in nearly every fanfic I read.

*** I gotta agree with you though to be fair in my experience a different version of a canon character even if they are essentially a oc is usually more likely to get attention over an actual oc.

As for why Harry as opposed to say Hermione or Ginny or fem Ron well Harry does have a personality but hes more of a blank slate compared to the supporting cast therefore easier to project onto. That being said Hermione also does become ooc pretty often in fics and projected on in much the same way so its not just Harry.

In addition to the blank slateness alot of the plot already revolves around Harry so it can seem easier to make Harry into essentially an oc than to find a natural way to make a compelling oc with a good role.

** Honestly a lot of things, but it's a good way to do a character study for Severus Snape, hating a mini- James was easy, doing the same for a mini- Lily would be torture for him. Aside it change harry's interactions with the others. Best friend with hermione from the start or do she hates her?(as they are sharing a dorm), before the Troll incident(obviously). Ginny's shenanigans can be but aside, Draco actions can looks like a love-hate relationship. To summarize it changes the canon interactions without needing to go AU or making characters OOC.

Of course writing an AU is not detrimental, we have a lot of Harry being far different that his original personality in fanfiction, I don't see the problem where fem!harry could have a different personality too. Not liking how a harry or a harriet is acting in one fanfiction comes from more your likes and dislikes honesty and it's another debate.

** If you're sticking to het relationships and keeping every other character as canon, it opens up a whole new pool of potential ships and interactions.

Harry(et) will mix with the (generally under-detailed) female characters of the House due to the dynamic of shared dormitories, allowing new characters and relationship dynamics to be explored.

Harry(et) may have a different relationship with the Dursleys, Voldemort, and her teachers (particularly Snape, especially if she resembles her mother).

Lastly, some people just prefer a female protagonist. No doubt there's other reasons, but these were the first few that occurred to me. It's a fairly small change to make with a lot of potential to take the story in a different direction from canon, while not necessarily having to actively change any other aspects of it.

** I don't go out looking for fem!Harry specifically, but I do tend to like fem!Harry stories better than male!Harry stories on average. I'm not sure why, maybe because characterizations of Harry that I find particularly annoying (pathetic crybaby Harry, edgelord indie!Harry, super-suave ladies-man Harry) aren't common in fem!Harry stories. Or maybe I've just been lucky and missed most of the bad fem!Harry stories. My favorites: linkffn(12713828; 7613196; 9911469; 9486886; 13135713)

** Currently, I've been reading mostly fem!Harry stories. I guess the reason is because I want to see how drastically the plot can change from just changing Harry. If the story's plot is similar to canon, I drop it immediately.

Previously, I almost only read highly OOC Harry's anyways, so it's not that different. I don't really feel connected with canon!Harry so I find it rather difficult to be engaged with the story. Not to say I identify with OOC!Harry either, but at least those stories have other draws.

Also, fem!Harry stories tend to be crossover with MoD!Harry or time travel fics more often than other types of stories. I'm particularly interested in these right now, so that's another bonus.

**** TL;DR I should probably read original works but I read AU HP fanfics instead because it's such a great source of above average stories that have magic.

I've read fanfics (mostly HP) for what, eight years now? I think I read around 2 million words a month. As such, I've gone through tonnes of phases. When I started, I refused to read anything apart from post-war absolutely canon-compliant fics. But since then, I've branched out. It gets rather boring when you read the same premise for a whole year. I don't particularly like slash that focuses on romance, so that limits what I read a bit.

Nowadays, I'm just appreciating how creative authors can be. Perhaps I should read original works instead, but it takes so much effort to find good books! It's hard to keep up with my reading pace. I love magic & fantasy, so instead of wasting time searching for good original works, I just read HP fanfics. Also, it's free. That's rather important too. This is reflected in my current fic requirement: it needs to have magic, anything else goes.

For example, I've attached a fun little fic I've found. Recent history is different, ancient history is different, magic is different, even the language is different! There, Harry and Voldemort doesn't even exist, and everyone except maybe Neville is very OOC. I loved it, because the world-building and magic was pretty awesome, and that's basically all I care about.

** I think it has potential to change the story and Harry as a character. Girls are treated a lot differently than boys. It's something most men don't realize.

Would Dudley get away with hunting down a skinny little girl? Would she still wear hand me downs? Would Ron sit with a little girl on the train (don't kids usually befriend their own genders? I'm child free so idk)? Would she connect to other characters like Parvati or one of the Quidditch girls? How much crueler would the Hogwarts rumor mill be? Would Draco still be an asshole?

** Well, for starters, I guess female writers can relate more to a female MC? I don't think there's anything wrong with that, since being able to relate to the MC leads to a more enjoyable experience in reading. I'm sure the fandom has a lot of female writers and as such, some of them would like to write a female!Harry story.

Another aspect could be the exploration of possibities regarding said situation. What if Harry was a girl? What could change? That itself is a pretty valid argument to write a story, since pretty much every fanfic can be reduced to "the exploration of possibilites within the canon story."

And lastly, it could better fit the narrative of storytelling. Maybe your plot revolves around aspects and themes which are best fitted for a female MC, and therefore, it would be easier and more enjoyable to read a story in which the MC is a girl.

For example, I have an unfinished story where pre-Hogwarts fem!Harry goes back in time and ends up in being found by her grandparents(James' parents). I thought it would be better if Harry was a girl since the father-daughter bond is sometimes seem as stronger than father-son, and James would be more accepting of her as a result, also, James's mother would finally complete the pair(son and daughter) and would be more protective of her.

That said, I don't particulary search for fem!Harry stories, so I can't say much.

** This is a question likely to drive full speed into a ton of controversy, as it concerns matters of gender which it's almost impossible to discuss without upsetting /somebody/, but since the question was asked...

Speaking only for myself, as someone writing a fem!Harry fic, ultimately it comes down to the nature of the characteristics I wanted to explore in my protagonist.

Canon Harry exhibits many characteristics of what you might call the "male ideal":

- He is magically strong and particularly talented at combat.

- He is emotionally stoic and displays dependable resilience regardless of the situation.

- He is wilful and stubborn and not influenced by the opinions of those around him.

- He expresses himself bluntly.

- He displays bias to action and rarely doubts himself.

- He is accomplished at sports.

- He is practically minded and does not care about appearances.

- He maintains a small social circle of close friends.

These are all fine characteristics for an action hero, but mostly they are not characteristics which I find interesting in real life. The "jock" type is not the kind of person I seek to surround myself with, nor are they characteristics I aspire to in myself.

I am much more drawn towards the characteristics which form part of what you might call the "female ideal". These are characteristics I envy women for being permitted to express, which men are generally unable to do so, either because of society's expectations or because the male body simply has a different aesthetic to the female body.

Elegance, beauty, sophistication, carefree joy, cleverness, caution, emotional intelligence, the social butterfly, the diligent student - these are the characteristics I wanted my protagonist to have.

I was interested in showing how you do not need to be masculine to be a hero; that traditional femininity does not bar someone from being an important and powerful individual.

Now, you may be thinking: that's all well and good, but why not just depict a feminine man? Isn't going with a female protagonist to possess traditional feminine characteristics just portraying traditional, harmful gender stereotypes?

To which I respond: yes, absolutely, it is.

But I'm doing it anyway.

Rightly or wrongly, feminine men do not occupy the same head space as women in the minds of (most) readers, nor do they in my own mind. A man with "feminine" characteristics communicates a fundamentally different impression than a woman does. A woman in a dress is viewed as elegant; a man in a dress is viewed as comedic.

I realise this statement may be distressing to some people who read this comment, but it is not intended to be argumentative or hurtful. Rather it is simply intended as a statement of the reality of how people conceptualise these matters.

Personally, as stated above, there are many feminine traits which I envy. I envy summer dresses (and the variety of fashion more generally). I envy the elegance of the female ballet dancer. I envy the way academic achievement among girls is encouraged whereas among boys, trying in class is considered uncool. I envy the freedom to express emotions considered unseemly in men. Giggling and dancing for joy are not masculine.

(Of course there are also many aspects of being a woman I do not envy).

In normal life, I do not dwell on these traits I wish I could possess/express but can't. There is no point in doing so, from my perspective - life is not a video game; at no point am I going to have the opportunity to start a new game as a woman. It is far more productive to simply make peace with who you are and make the best of it, I think. Other people may feel differently and I make no judgement as to that.

But anyway, this got rather more personal than I had planned - but suffice it to say that writing a female protagonist with these traits is my way of expressing those things which I cannot in normal life.

*** I'd like to add to this that changing a fundamental thing about your character also communicates change to the reader. If you write about a male!Harry with the same background, you communicate "this is the same character."

If you write about fem!Harry, people know she's going to be different. Other stories signify the difference of their OC in other ways, for example by calling him Hadrian.

In general, if you tell a story, you kind of enter an agreement with the reader. You promise them a kind of story, and they expect that you won't go behind their back and tell a different story. And if you were to simply make Harry feminine, that would break the character. People would call him a sissy that's out-of-character. But if you call her Victoria, Iris, or Harriet, you're free to invent your own character, and make her exactly as feminine as you want

*** while I do agree with alot of what you are saying I will disagree with alot of the qualities you are calling feminine. Elegance sophistication cleverness social butterfly diligent student emotional intelligence are not inherently feminine qualities. And while not the Jock stereotype far from depictions of masculinity that are uncommon or ones I haven't seen exhibited by Harry in fics especially alot Slytherin Harry or Lord Potter /Power fantasy Harry type fic.

Stereotypically feminine qualities would be like nuturing, gentleness, understanding, cooperative as opposed to competitive, humility , sensitivity and even a level of passiveness. Because of the structure of stories like this they lend themselves to working better if the protagonist regardless of gender has a few more typically masculine qualities. Courage, Independence, assertiveness, self assured, action oriented, confident, competitive etc.

To have a protagonist that has more stereotypically feminine qualities that are relevant to the story and important in overcoming obstacles would require changing the structure of the story to a degree. Of course that being said the binary is obsolete men can be understanding and cooperartive women can be goal oriented and courageous. And they can accomplish this without anyone thinking they have strongly deviated from the norm for their gender. In fact when asked to describe ideal qualities in a man or woman you'd likely have a mixture of masculine and feminine traits describing both.

That being said with the exception of anger/frustration it is not considered masculine to be very emotionally expressive. This is a rather new trend and more common in the west especially in America but America has alot of cultural influence in the world. But this new constraining view of masculinity is being fought back against there are more and more celebrated views of masculinity now that allow men to be more expressive. I cant express how important that is.

Humans have the capacity to feel and express a huge variety of emotions for a reason. They are necessary it should be ovbious the kind of harm that comes when anger and frustration becomes the only emotions you can openly express.

But to be clear this idea of emotionally limiting masculinity is not set in stone and is while not gone yet is fading. This depiction of masculinity isn't really that traditional either. If you want to find other versions that shows men being more expressive there's media today that does that. There's media from the past that does that too. And I can understand the appeal of easily creating a woman character that can be freely expressive while challenging nothing.

But this is fantasy and fiction. You can create the same world for a man. Its likely more work to imagine as its different from the world you are used to imagining. But it makes sense wizarding world would have different standards. I think that can be freeing creating a world like that and a male character like that. And personally I love seeing new things in hp fic since so much can be repetitive and samey even if I like the tropes. Depicting new things and struggles in narratives always resonate more I think than the ideal type of person going through another powerfantasy even though thats cathartic in its own way.

But having a fantasy world that lets men have all the emotional and expressive freedom that women have now would be a more fun one to explore at least for me.

*** Thank you for this! I really appreciate your candid answer. I've been reading Judith Butler recently (completely unrelated and for a publication on Fate/Stay Night I need to finish revising), and your thoughts on female performance pretty much goes into this and your reasons for writing a fem!Harry story.

I guess my question then is why Harry as opposed to any of the other females in the books you could use as the protagonist instead?

**** I have become so accustomed to viewing Harry as my personal avatar in the HP world that I find it very difficult to identify with any other character as a protagonist. Strangely, the only other character I find myself able to project onto is Voldemort, perhaps because he is Harry's equal and opposite.

Anyway, even when everything about the character is changed, through some quirk of literary psychology I will immediately imprint onto a character if the author communicates to me that they are in some sense a "version" of Harry.

The most extreme version of this is the Game of Thrones crossover The Black Prince, where Harry has a different name, appearance, parentage, upbringing, world view, abilities, and lives entirely in a different world to that of Harry Potter. Nonetheless, the author communicates that this character is Harry Potter reincarnated, and thus I see them as my representative in that story.

To me, Harry Potter is no longer a character; he (or as the case may be, she) is the soul of protagonism.

So when it came to writing my own, honestly it wasn't even a consideration that I might choose someone else. Plus on top of that you have the fact that Harry's background with Voldemort opens the door to lots of plot opportunities.

I don't write myself, but I'm just never interested in those characters as protagonists. I like Harry's background, his place in the story, that kind of thing. I'd rather read a fem!Harry than a Hermione, even if that Hermione is made into an orphan with a prophecy about her. And at that point, that's just more work than simply making Harry a girl.

** Harry Potter in canon had many unexplored facets of his personality because, imo, Rowling got a bit lazy at the end. So anything is really possible with the character given the push in the right direction, which is why these are AU. It should also be noted that if Harry is a girl, this changes A LOT.

While some might not want to admit it, gender roles and sexism will come into play. Growing up in the 80s and going to secondary in the 90s will have an affect. Female-Harry will get treated ways that Harry wouldn't. She'll be around certain people more than others based on where she has to sleep at night. She'll have different expectations placed upon her head because she has a va-jay-jay. The way certain characters interact with her, if they stay true to canon completely in that regard, will look like flirting to heterosexual people. Gender will technically change the entire world's reaction to the character.

I will write whatever I want to write and if the plot feels that a female version of Harry will suit it better, then that is what I do. Gender of characters in general or in ships really doesn't matter to me. Gender is not the be all end all of fanfic and isn't what I care about. I typically want to read something that interests me, with the characters I like in it.

I do know that I started fics with genderbending because I wasn't sure I could write men's POVs, and then I realized that what I thought a man's POV would be was all toxic BS that SHOULDN'T be perpetuated(despite how society continues perpetuating it), and decided to write what I want. The character is a person. A person is a person and if I don't want to write stereotypical sexist garbage into their character, then I don't have to and they'll be fine. I write whatever I think the plot needs(or if I'm taking up a specific prompt) and that is that.

One of my fav writers has explicitly explained that she writes ONLY genderbent fics because she is a woman and understands the plights of women on a deep and personal level and feels that she can get across that type of character more successfully and with more depth. She can read slash and has no problem with it, it's just she always ends up making Harry Potter a girl because that is her comfort zone I suppose.

As for readers, some might feel more comfortable reading from a woman's perspective in general. IDK what to tell you.

** Even if fem Harry is unrecognizable from canon Harry, it can still be interesting to write about a girl being in Harry's position, whatever name or personality she has. It might be interesting to examine the changes in Harry's story that can happen as a result of the gender change.

I've read a few really well done fem Harry fics, so I wouldn't judge all of them based on one that you read and didn't like. Just like any other trope, the majority of fem Harry fics won't be great, just as the majority of fanfic in general isn't that great. You just have to find the right ones.

** Here's my take:

1. Some authors find it easier, for one reason or another, to get into the mindset of female characters - they write fem!Harry because it's easier, or just more compelling, for them to write.
2. It's a quick way to introduce some /major/ changes - fem!Harry's changes in personality might lead to different friends, possibly different behaviour from the Dursleys, a less-evil Snape since he doesn't see James's snowclone, et cetera.
3. I have seen a few fics where fem!Harry is basically just an excuse to not admit to writing a slash-relationship - the author wants to ship Harry/MaleCharacter but doesn't want to be stigmatized as a slashfic-author, so they just turn Harry female.

First, people may just want to see a girl as the hero of the story, much like stories where Hermione is the one who saves the day.

Second, where many characters associate him so strongly with his father, some people want to explore how they would treat him if he were instead the spitting image of Lily.

And of course, some people have a more prurient interest.

** The thing about gender switches in FanFiction is that if done well it can act as a sort of social commentary on how different socialisation processes for boys and girls affect the person they become and how they are treated. Though I've never actually read a good Fem! Harry fic, I think it's cool how such stories have the opportunity to tell u so much more about the Wizarding World and it's approach to gender by making the main character female. It allows us to play with family dynamics and friendships, and by doing that, you're right, we are kind of creating an OC, but in reality, in every AU fic (I just realised how stupid it was to put reality before fanfiction), in which Harry's circumstances growing up are different, he ends up different.

However, I acknowledge that most of the time, Fem!Harry stories miss this opportunity; either "Harriet" is a Mary Sue, or she is exactly like Harry, just female. If you want a more indepth analysis, check out this linkffn(Hermione Granger's Guide To Gender Flip Fanfiction) . It's a super meta fic, but it explains gender flips VERY well, as well as being super entertaining. The same author also wrote Weasley Girl, in which Ron is a girl, one of my favourite stories ever...

  Hermione gives a lecture on "gender flip fanfiction"; i.e. fanfiction depicting an AU where one or more characters has been born the opposite sex. Of course, when the ones attending the lecture are Harry and Ron... or should that perhaps be "Holly" and "Ronnie"?... it might get a little difficult to stay on track. A very meta story.

Fair point.

As to Supernatural and embracing the ridiculousness since S8? It comes and goes. At the moment God/Chuck's trying to murder everyone but it wasn't that long ago that the main arc was about the British Men of Letters and their plan for a systematic hunting operation.

** In terms of personality, canon!Harry can be pretty boring, which is why many stories will have him feel OOC somewhat. But his /situation/ is unique. He is many things:

- horcrux\\
- orphan\\
- chosen one\\
- leader\\
- symbol of hope\\
- Lily and James's first child\\
- good at DADA\\
- owner of The invisibility cloak\\
- Master of Death (possibly)\\
- green-eyed\\
- Ron and Hermione's friends\\
- good at Quidditch\\
- Sirius Black's godson\\
- a Gryffindor\\
- a boy\\
- a person whose name is Harry Potter\\
- etc.\\

You can change some of those things and still have him be the character "Harry Potter", but there's a point where he becomes unrecognizable, and that point is different for every reader. For some, as long as his name is still Harry, anything else goes (but change his name to, say, Hadrian, and they won't even touch it). For me, I get iffy whenever he's not James and Lily's son, no matter how well-written and in character he is.

So some people will think it's cool to make him a girl, or a Slytherin, or Snape's son, etc. Gender is just one of many aspects of Harry Potter.

Edit: some formatting. But also, forgot to say, my favorite fem!Harry is Harriet from The Pureblood Pretense, whose genderbend has a very clear purpose in the story, as it is a fusion with Alanna the Lioness (a book where Alanna, wanting to be a knight, pretends to be a boy), as Harriet trades places with her /male/ cousin, which causes lots of shenanigans and complications :)

** There are many ways of doing some version of a female Harry, and to me the purpose for it makes or breaks the whole story.

I find that fem!Harry where the OC is exactly the same in personality and circumstances tends to be for straightwashing Drarry, or other m/m pairings now turned f/m (not always, but I have found this to be the case quite often). I tend to not enjoy these, as they usually either straight wash, or are just copies of the books but not written as well.

Then, there is the Fem!Harry for the purpose of changing his personality, and by changing the gender, there is major juxtaposition between Canon Harry and this OC "fem!Harry". This sets up for clear development of new personality traits not found in Canon Harry - maybe she is sorted in Slytherin, or she is more like lily which could set up a Severus Snape redemption.

I'm not sure if it counts as fem!Harry, but another set up is the "Harry-has-a-sister" set up. These can be really interesting as a literary device- like the Fem!Harry for changing his personality, you can juxtapose Canon Harry with an OC Harry, but in this case both characters are there. This has major potential for Mary Sue characters (as does everything), but if done well can provide a new perspective to the HP fandom. Three of my favorite fanfictions are of this concept.

Maybe I'm just a sucker for Snape redemption and a Slytherin redemption, and I like a female Harry who is essentially an OC template with a premade backstory, but I think fem!Harry can be a really interesting story developing device.

** I think it's a sort of thought everyone has. To see how much Harry is him and how much he is a product of his surroundings. Would he still do all the things he did if he were a girl and/ or had a different upbringing? I'd say that's the whole idea behind fem harry.

** You're asking two different questions there.

First, for a female version of Harry, it ought to be pretty simple to think about - some people want to explore how the story might have changed with a female Harry, or relate to that better, or want to see themselves in it, etc. Just because the canon Harry is a boy doesn't mean a girl version is bad, from a fanfic perspective.

Your second question is about actual major changes - and that's completely separate to a gender change of the character. I mean, there are tons of fics where a male Harry gets made into an OC in exactly the same way as you're describing. The reason there is that canon Harry isn't exactly that interesting in and of himself - he's a great 'everday man' type character, but he tends to be more taken along by the story. Giving him (or her) different power sets, interests, or the like can interest some people. Even just a slight personality change - and exploring how that would change things - can be interesting.

** Badass female characters are more interesting due to the novelty factor. If you have some dude doing "fights, explosions and women", that is pretty common and has been done to death. But if you have a woman who does "fights, explosions and women", you have something which is not very common. And while new is not always better, it is certainly intriguing.

Of course, that assumes that FemHarry is still into girls, but to me the point of FemHarry is not "new shipping lanes", but rather a small change and watching that play out. If FemHarry is just a female stereotype, I am out.

Hell, I prefer accidental gender changes where Harry is still a guy in a woman's body because that is pretty hilarious in the few fics which had that trope.

** I don't like femHarry fics, but I always thought it was either: the writer doesn't like slash and they want to ship Harry with a male character; or, a self insert story with the author (or OC) in Harry's role and they want to keep their gender; or, the writer just prefers to write female over male characters.

I have never read one though... and never will, the appeal is lost to me.

I would probably read a complete gender bend story - where all (or most) characters have reversed genders. that could be fun. I like gender bender fanart.

*** So my main project is original fiction, but I very occasionally do write HP stuff still. I mostly write female characters. My current project has a female protagonist, I usually play a female character in games where it's possible, etc etc. I just like female characters more because I have to consciously think about how I write them and how they're percieved, whereas a male character always inevitably falls into the "benevolent, but marty stu - strongman hero" archetype.

** I can't speak for fem!Harry but I can tell you why I read Weasley Girl, which is fem!Ron... because the author was interested in making one particular, if substantial, change and seeing what might plausibly happen because of that change. If someone wrote (actually, someone probably already has written) a fem!Harry based on that principle... I /might/ read it but I suspect I wouldn't. However, I can definitely see people being attracted to this kind of idea.

** I personally find it pointless, unless there is a (well written) good reason, such as being trans.

Sometimes I think people want to make an OC who interacts with all the usual suspects, whilst knowing many scroll past an OC tag.

I've seen a few cases of authors feeling there's not enough female characters in fiction and why couldn't a female do what Harry does. I've also seen a few where they make Harry extremely attractive and then pair him up with men without having to deal with homosexuality. (I have a low opinion of this, as a lesbian who manages to read het and male/male without losing my marbles. If that's not your thing, why not stick to existing characters? Any way, aside from the general insult of ew gays, it's not my business what people prefer to read.)
