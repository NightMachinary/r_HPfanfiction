Preferably it would be a bunch of attempts to kill Harry by small groups and not just a mobbing or the government trying to arrest and execute him.


** "So you see, Harry my boy, I really have ensured that you have a normal and ordinary childhood, would you say that it is normal to be subject to assassination attempts on a hourly basis ? And from such a diverse range of people ?"

- Dumbledore, just before dodging a small painting thrown by an enraged eleven year old.

** I think Snape would be more likely to blab about it than Dumbledore, especially before 4th year. Assuming that Dumbledore never made him take an oath not to reveal the secret, I can totally see him letting the secret out to hurt Harry.

*** If Snape was the one to let the big secret slip (even more so on porpoise) I can see it being the last straw for Dumbledore that pushes him in stoping to treat Snape as an actual human being with emotions and a life to instead start treating him as a resource to be exploited with no regard for his own wellbeing while taking away any freedom he have (so a more-or-less realistic way of making the transition from cannon!Dumbledore into fandom's rare Manipulative(/but competent/)!Dumbledore version, though this wouldn't be directed at Harry).

*** Was the violence against Naruto anywhere near that bad in that series' canon? I have only watched a few episodes (mostly because I don't speak Japanese and find dubbed animes to be irritating), and the most I can determine is that he was ostracized by the villagers.

**** Not really. In the anime (and manga) we mostly only see references to how he managed to overcome being disregarded and disliked by the village plus some small flashbacks. As far as we can see confirmed the worst of his treatment was when a shop-seller pushed him out (yeah, there was an unique case that turned deadly, but that wasn't really outright murderous, just some kids playing a cruel prank without really understanding that sending someone to a place where there is mortal danger is bad).

Of course, the mental effects of being basically ostracized for the majority of the people you live with on regular basis from birth to teenagedoom would be very substantial (though I personally think it would be in the opposite direction -namely, that it would lead to a normalization and potentially imitation of such a behavior without any of the angst we normally see) it really wasn't as bad as mobs openly hunting him down with pitchforks and torches.
