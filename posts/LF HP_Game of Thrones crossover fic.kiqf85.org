:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember it being MOD!Harry in a tomb somewhere and Jon goes to where the tomb was to awaken him (something about his blood?? I completely forgot) and for Harry to help with the war. I also vaguely remember Harry being entombed for hundreds of years.

Recently rereading all of my HP/xovers and I remembered this. Though it wasnt in my bookmarks. Thx for the help!

** For the Love of Magic

eventually had a sequel that was a crossover. I never really got into it, but I was never into GoT before that, and honestly that was kinda a hard fic to get through from what I remember.

  It only takes a single disharmonious element to throw off the entire composition. Fifty years before Robert Baratheon was to ascend the Iron Throne, Westeros receives one hell of a bad musician. Harry never did care about any player other than himself.

  Third in series, read prequels or be confused. Harry had spent his whole life wishing for magic to be more abundant, and that was precisely what he got. He wasn't even particularly upset about the many serious dangers inherent in such a thing, for what was life without challenge? The irony of ending up in Azeroth after all the references was a bit on the nose, though.
