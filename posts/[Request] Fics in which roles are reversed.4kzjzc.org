Hey there,

Like the title says, I'm looking for fics in which the characters' roles are reversed or mixed up. Not any characters though. I'm looking for a story with a Dark Lord Potter and a young Tom Riddle, marked as the Dark Lord's equal, prophesied to vanquish him. As always, fics over 150-200k words or recently and frequently updated stories would be absolutely amazing. And please, no slash.

Many thanks in advance!


** linkffn(Warrior's Heir by Osireia)

Unfortunately abandoned, but it has a very similar plot to what you mentioned and is 164k words.

  DEAD. Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord? No slash.
