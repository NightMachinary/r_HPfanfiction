Of course, I know exactly why they are so common in fanon, a combination of lazy writers who can't find a way for their ship to happen organically, and people just applying regency-era tropes to the HP setting without thinking it all the way through.

But it really doesn't make sense. In the muggle world, you can see how marrying for political benefit becomes normalised, because “love” doesn't have any effect on the world outside of our minds.

But in a quasi-post-scarcity society, in which love is proven to have powerful magical effects, up to and including defying some of the most powerful spells known, surely the idea of marrying for anything /but/ love would become a cultural oddity.


** So I'll admit it's been a while since I've read the actual books, but I don't think love magic is as prevalent as you imply. The only place I remember it being is a closed off poorly understood little known room in the department of mysteries. There are times when dumbledore preaches on the power of love but those really boil down to love being the motivation behind actions not love being a quantifiable power in and of itself. Marriage contracts on the other hand are not so far fetched. The binding by the goblet of fire and penalties tied into breaking the ‘contract'/signup sheet for the da suggest that magically binding contracts is within the realm of possibilities. If a society is capable of supporting a pure blood movement then it is likely that elder generations would not balk at using contracts to make sure their children marry the right sort. There will also always be individuals who value money/power/whatever more than their offspring and that would lend itself to contracted marriages as well.

** Here's the thing - we know almost /nothing/ about the way that the WW's government and power structures work.

We /do/ know that purebloods control much of the wealth, and that much of the wealth is just inherited (eg, Harry's vault). We also know that at least one of those pureblood families (the Blacks) style themselves as nobility, and that another (the Malfoys) act as de-facto nobility. We /also/ know that the WW broke off around the time of the Statute of Secrecy, in the 17th century. We additionally have no indication that the Wizengamot is elected - and its name is clearly inspired by a council of nobles from anglo-saxon England.

The British WW is shown to be quite behind the times in a lot of ways - stigmatizing non-humans, virulent anti-muggle/muggleborn sentiment and the like does not paint a particularly progressive picture for the setting.

That all combines to make an aristocratic/noble background for the WW possible - or plausible. In such a background, arranged marriages would probably be quite commonplace among the richer families.

In addition, there's no indication that the WW behaves like a post-scarcity society in canon, and there are clearly rich and poor families, so it's not like differences in affluence aren't a thing. There's also a big political movement /literally/ named after blood purity, and what's the most natural way to continue to ensure a pure bloodline? Arranged marriages with 'acceptable' partners.

Like, it's not the /only/ interpretation of how the WW is setup - but you're being far too dismissive of it, and it definitely fits within the (admittedly rather vague) setting, IMO.

*** At the same time cannon WW culture gives women much more power. It's not considered odd to have powerful women. Minister Bagnold, McGonagall, Bellatrix, Amelia Bones.

Wands and magic level the playing field greatly. It's hard to imagine women let themselves be sold to others in arranged marriages. Of course there is some level of cultural buy-in where they wouldn't object because that's just how it's done, and you will see this more in the pureblood circles but that doesn't rule out arranged marriages being normalised.

** I don't know that I agree. How it's characterized in the book is that love is the power that Voldemort “knows not.”

If it we're commonly known that love had such an immense power, then it would be likely that someone would have told him about it at some point? Even if he himself was incapable of love, if his followers knew that love could protect someone from death, I'm pretty sure they would have mentioned it.

So maybe arraigned marriages would make less sense after his defeat, once the power of Lily's sacrifice and love was made known, but not before.

Also arraigned marriages make sense (at least to me) in pureblood circles that are focused on maintaining their purity. Parent a wouldn't want to risk that their children made a “bad match”

** Looking at the last 1600's and early 1700's you can definitely see that arranged marriages still exist in the real world. Which is where the point of divergence is for the two. So yes I can believe that marriage contracts would exist.

Next. How exactly is the Wizarding world a post scarcity society? The Wizarding world might be capable of approaching it but it seems like they are not interested in it. The Weasleys are the only example of that, 1 gold and some silver and bronze is what Arthur makes every year. But they still needs to buy secondhand equipment.

The only financial difficulties they actually seem to have come with supplying their kids for school, which peaked at books 2 and 3 with five kids at once.

** From what I know of HP lore, love isn't really a huge branch of magic. It can empower magic, but not much more. And even then, spells and rituals based on love seem few and far between. Lily was able to save Harry through love, but not much is known other than that, not the way she did it or the spellwork required. The general populace definately doesn't think love could be why Harry survived, and they don't even speak of magic powerered by love, so chances are love isn't well known as a source of power within the wizarding world. Any knowledge on powerful magic involving love much have been largely forgotten.

Hypothetically, it would be like trying to get the entire world to change to solar energy with the added bonus that no one knows what solar power is, and there's no known science that can back it up. Something so abstract and largely unknown isn't reliable or well researched, making it difficult to use.

Then there's the matter of wealth, and aristocracy, blood purity, and politics. All these things will definately lead to arranged marriages.

In fanfic it is often used as simply a device for romance. But the device isn't the actual issue, poor writing is.

** There's different degrees of 'arranged marriages'. The fanon arranged marriages where witches are sold off as property makes no sense--there's no canon indication of such a massive inequality between the sexes, and it doesn't seem plausible in a world where everyone has magic and women are just as strong as men.

But there's also arranged marriages where there's social pressure from the family to marry a certain person, but no actual legal obligation, which seems consistent with canon pureblood culture.

A professional chooses your matches, and you meet three times with the intention of determining if a marriage would be likely. Not traditional hit and miss western style love matches for sure, but a far cry from bride auctions or infant bethrothals.

*** IMO Voldies soul was already unstable and fractured. But the bigger thing is (IMO) that hitting Lily was done unintentional on Voldies part. He told Lily to step aside (bc he had promised Snape to spare her) and cast the killing curse at Harry. Lily then stepped into the killing curse meant for Harry.

He definitely wanted to kill James, so maybe it counts less? Although, thinking it over, maybe James dying contributed to the situation?

I agree though with you that there must have been other incidents. This is a plot point in "The Most Powerful Magic" by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/cjr2/pseuds/cjr2][cjr2]] .

** Even if arranged marriages were common, Harry being the victim of one makes no sense - his father married a muggleborn; if the Potters practised arranged marriages, that wouldn't have happened, and if James didn't follow the practice, he wouldn't have subjected Harry to it even if Lily hadn't vetoed it. It's really not plausible to see Harry in an arranged marriage.

And the "Oh, it's a centuries-old contract" doesn't work either. Who made such a stupid contract? You don't make alliances by marrying hypothetical offspring "sometime in the future, whenever that happens" - you make alliances by marriage by marrying off existing people. (Not to mention that if such an alliance were to happen, why did it skip every Potter until Harry? How did James and his father escape the contract? Did the supposed ally only have boys for centuries?)

And even if such a contract were around - who would enforce it? Harry's the last Potter, he can cancel it. Who would attempt to enforce such a contract? Against the Boy Who lived?

Arranged marriages can very well happen - they still happen these days, through social pressure - but they don't really work to get Harry together with someone else.

*** There are some ways to make it work with Harry, IMO. If putting it into somewhat commonplace for pureblood society, which I think is reasonable enough, an author can come up with a reasonable-ish way to make it happen.

Eg, one approach that I've seen was that marriage contracts had been decreasing in severity/how strict they were over the centuries - but that Harry's dad got drunk with his friend - the father of the girl the author wanted to set up with Harry - and ended up with both signing a very strict contract, and being shocked/horrified when they sobered up - but only too late.

Another approach could be a less serious one - where the contract works a little more like a betrothal contract, and could be broken without too much effort. Such a contract could have been used to secure an ally in the first war, or perhaps tap into some sort of magic. Eg - perhaps [insert family] had some sort of ancient enchantment they'd put in place affording protection to their heir - and by extension, whoever they're betrothed to. A friend of James/Lily could have offered that up as an additional layer of protection to Harry, with the understanding that it could be cancelled - and either it becomes forgotten later after their death, or it required them to cancel it, etc.

The centuries old contract thing obviously doesn't work - but I don't think it's impossible, or all that hard, to find a plausible-ish reason for Harry to be put into one during his parent's time. It just requires a bit of effort ;)

And no - just because it can be broken doesn't render it pointless as a plot device. The point of the marriage contract is in setting Harry up with someone he'd otherwise never be with - and in theory at least, realizing how good a match they actually are. A break-able contract can still easily be used like that - having Harry look at her like a potential match instead of some random faceless background character who he'd never look at.

You're right on the normal teenager front, but it can depend on the politics taken. Typically I see the push from that more for having it be Harry + a slytherin, which - to many people - wouldn't happen without something like that.

Love was the power Voldemort didn't know/understand, and Harry was saved from ever being possessed by Voldemort becaue he could feel love, and Harry saved everyone at the end of the battle of Hogwarts because he repeated the love sacrifice his mother did, so I think it's absolutely fair to say it's a huge power in magical society, even if some wizards and witches look down upon it.
