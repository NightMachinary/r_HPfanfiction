It happens at the end of the OotP, after the battle of DoM, when Harry and Malfoy meet and Harry says he's sorry about his dad. Malfoy has no idea what he's talking about and then Snape comes out and tells Harry to go away and not say another word. I know Harry had something to do with it, I'm pretty sure it was one of those independant Harry fics. Does anyone know what could it be?
