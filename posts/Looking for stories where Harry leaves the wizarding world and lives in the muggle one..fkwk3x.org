Thanks for your help.


** The main one in my mind is Betrayed by kateydidnt. It's Harry x OFC but primarily revolves around Harry's relationship with his daughter and his feelings towards the wizarding world

Harry still uses magic but is the prime minister here. Lot of interactions with the wizarding world and using magic but he does technically live in the muggle one.

  This is the sequel to Harry's Had Enough. You don't have to read that first, but it might be better if you do. Harry in a position on power, he's a bit unscrupulous in this one. Dumbledore, Ministry and Death Eater bashing. Also a bit of Ron bashing and general wizard society bashing. H/Hr. Now Complete!
