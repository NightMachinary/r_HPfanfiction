Does anyone have any stories handy where someone points out, forcefully or otherwise, that the stereotypical Dumbledore-ism of always forgiving all sins in perpetuity is insanity and incredibly unhealthy for the wizarding world at large?


** Plenty of stories like that. Unfortunately, they are all fanon-laden, onanistic trash, as far as I know.

For /Dumbledore/, killing isn't necessary, because he can defeat virtually any opponent nonlethally. Therefore, for him, killing is inherently gratuitous, and may even put a stain on his soul. His life experiences have also shown him that once he starts doing what's easy, he might not be able to stop.

That he insists that others do as he does is fanon. Heck, in DH, we have Remus lambasting Harry for not being lethal enough.

*** Dumbledore says killing maims everyone's soul, not just his. That's the basis in HP for creating a Horcrux, and why Snape was even more hesitant to agree to kill Dumbledore in DH. Pretty clearly doesn't think people should use lethal force.

**** Slughorn explains in a flashback that a soul is split "By an act of evil -- the supreme act of evil. By committing murder. Killing rips the soul apart." (HBP, Ch. 23) Although he uses both "killing" and "murder", my reading is that, while the act of killing is the trigger, the soul is torn because of the evil of the act.

It's not evil (and not murder) if it's in self defence or similar, especially if there are no less-lethal options. Dumbledore almost always has less-lethal options, so it's almost always evil when he kills someone. Someone less powerful would not be held to such a high moral standard. Now, Dumbledore probably didn't approve of gratuitous bloodshed by anyone, but if he had any sort of doctrinal opposition to lethal force, it wasn't at all reflected in how The Order fought.

Snape, in particular, was being asked to kill someone in cold blood. People disagree about whether or not euthanasia is murder even IRL, but the important thing there is that Dumbledore actually /wasn't/ against killing in that situation, which contradicts the OP's premise.

*** This. Dumbledore could kill without even moving a muscle I bet, but why give someone the sweet release of death when you could imprison them in the prison they built for over 50 years? Imagine 50 years of being in a 1940s era prison. I'm surprised Grindelwald hadn't killed himself before TMR got to him.

*** That doesn't really fit the request since this Dumbledore didn't need to have it pointed out that killing enemies is sometimes necessary.

(I generally write my Dumbledore as hating killing, but preferring to shoulder that burden himself rather than having others do so. And with the mindset that he'd rather kill the guilty than risk the innocent.)

**** They only escaped prison because the government had missed /the guards belonged there too/. An Order of the Phoenix-run wizarding prison that /would/ hold the Death Eaters is entirely feasible (see: Nurmengard), Fudge just seems to have a blindspot when it comes to the Dementors' loyalty, or, rather, lack thereof. The principles are sound.
