I killed off what was a major character, but was not expecting the backlash. The death was foreshadowed quite heavily and was realistic in how it happened. Is this backlash justified and expected, and shall I carry on with my plan or do I change it?

People are asking for the story. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12627805/1/The-Bat-and-The-Phoenix][The story]] , with the death happening in the most recent chapter.


** Oh, never change it. You have a story: you tell it how you wish. MOST readers will jeep reading and be GLAD that there are real stakes at play here.

Some readers are very very young, and don't pick up multiple layers of meaning; some readers never did very well at school, and might struggle with foreshadowing and the like; other readers are straight-up idiots, want to be contrary, and would happily read a fanfic where everything is apple pie and ice cream all the way through.

A well-executed character death is a great thing - don't feel bad for killing characters off. Once your story is finished, people may appreciate ut more.

[Spoilers EVERYTHING]

The death of a major character has to be done in a good way.

Losing against the arch nemesis and not getting away is a good way.

Getting betrayed by someone you treated misserably all your life is a good way.

Slipping on the staircase is a bad way, it reeks of drama for dramas sake.

It's a scale, your hermoine vs troll fight is in my oppinion a bit more on the stair case side of the scale.

** No, the backlash is not really justified. The problem is that fact that fan fiction is often written as wish fulfillment where people the reader likes don't die. When a popular character does die in a good story it often causes a negative emotional reaction. And since it is a story they get angry at the author and attack them any way they can.

Any reader who feel entitled to a certain ending or a certain story direction should just write their own story and stop bothering you.

Besides, maybe you loose some readers now, but might be appreciated by far more readers for this in the future. The backlash now doesn't mean the story is going to be liked any less in the long run. In cases like this I can easily see the opposite happening.

** You should definitely carry on the way you originally intended. If I learned anything from watching Glee it was that pandering to fans /never/ ends well.

That said, do you have a content warning that there is going to be a major character death? You said it was heavily foreshadowed but sometimes readers don't pick up on the clues. I know that (especially these days) I'm not looking to read a story with a major character death (this goes double for a character who didn't die in canon). I would never write a bad review because of it, but I wouldn't be inclined to read the story.

** Do not change the story but maybe put a warning at the start of the story that there will be major character death. Because some people (myself included) do not want to read a story where the main character, love interest or parental figure kicks the bucket halfway in. Foreshadowing in nice and good but you can miss it quite easily on the first readthrough. I mean by now most people know about the Red Wedding but are still caught off-guard when they get to that part.

For another perspective, ask yourself if you gain more from killing off the character than keeping her in. I've found the outcome doesn't need to be positive, so much as leave your readers satisfied.

If the death achieved something, even if just for shock value, great. If you left people thinking, 'well, that was pointless,' you can expect a backlash. Take heart that at least it means your readers are emotionally invested, even if you can't read them as well as you'd like.

1) I chose to read the fic specifically for that character i.e. wanted to see them explore the situation presented, so with them gone, my interest goes too.

2) The killing off of the character gives me insight into the way the author sees the characters/story as a whole that makes me feel it isn't going to be for me.

3) The killing off was stupid and nonsensical and makes the story less interesting/boxes it in for later chapters.

**** There are three large pitfalls with this. Two of them are objective problems and two are contextual problems.

- You're invoking the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge][Stuffed in the Fridge]] trope unless you handle it exceptionally well. Even if you /do/ handle it exceptionally well, your readers have experienced dozens of bad examples before reading your fic, and that means it's hard for you to make it work.
- HP canon is skewed male. DCU canon is skewed male. Unless you put in a lot of effort, you're killing off one of the only female characters you have available.
- Hermione is a widely loved character.

My personal rules for killing off major characters are:

- Their death should emphasize their agency, not their helplessness.
- Their death should reflect their character.
- They should get a Crowning Moment of glory / awesome / what have you in it.
- They should not have been the only character in a minority group that was significantly present in the story. (There's a trope about lesbians on TV shows -- they never last more than a season before they're killed off. Brooklyn 99 had to explicitly warn viewers in advance that their new queer couple wouldn't be killed.)

** Writing fanfiction doesn't provide you monetary gain or involves pressures of professional editing and publishing. Therefore, there is precisely zero reason for you to write anything except that which you like, or change your story to satisfy anonymous people online.

If you feel that someone's review gives you valuable insights related to the quality of your writing, characterization etc., then by all means take those to heart. I haven't read it, so I don't have any opinions on those. But you don't owe your readers, who can easily jump to another story, anything. Just as your readers don't owe you allegiance or have to go easy in their assessment.

Admittedly, I'm not an author, so I don't know firsthand what it's like to have your story read and judged by the multitude, but at the end of the day you are (I assume) an anonymous online writer and have the freedom to write just about anything imaginable. It would be a waste to succumb to crowd pleasing.

** No! Don't change it because people got angry at it!That's why most Tv shows luck excitement these days. My personal opinion is, write about what you feel people will come along eventually❤

** Keep in mind, for every 1 person flipping out, there are likely tons more reading it who are not. Major character death tends to cause this so its perfectly normal. People connect with or love a certain character and if they die... well... they get upset. Imagine the backlash after some of the character deaths in the HP books, Sirius especially. Guaranteed JK got some hate mail although by that point it was probably screened out via her publisher so she never actually saw it lol.

Keep writing, it will pass.

** If it's a major character people will likely love that character/be one of their favorite characters or just because of the way you wrote your character.

Just continue your story, don't worry about the backlash. It's their fault for either not catching the foreshadowing or taking it so seriously.

But that's just my advice.

** Personally I think that you are writing a great story and you shouldn't change any of it. Hermione's death is perfectly fine and is a fresh breath of air. I haven't seen nearly enough fics like this one. Really enjoying it so far.

** Ignore them. Honestly the worst thing you could do is to give in to their hissy fits and let them have their own way. Stick to your guns on this one, you wrote the death in for a reason.

Though I do agree with some other people here; you should update your summary to mention 'major character death'.
