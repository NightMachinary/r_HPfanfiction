Anyone here knows of fanfics that are set in the Hogwarts Mystery time? Maybe they have Jacob's Sibling, Penny? Merula? Only References of events or the characters work too!


** “Treacle Jam and the Slytherins who Defeated Lord Voldemort” by JamRolyPoly linkffn(13677940) and its sequel?

  Harry Potter's been away from the wizarding world for nearly ten years. So now that he's back, he's ready to get out there and learn to the best of his abilities. Mysterious bank-package? Not interested. All that matters is getting settled into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and perhaps leave the Dursleys for good as well.
