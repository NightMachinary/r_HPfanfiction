Edit: *but it was Grindelwald he (Harry) defeated as a baby*

Additionally Tom Riddle served as the Headmaster of Hogwarts and tried to be a mentor figure to Harry. Dumbledore was Minister of Magic, iirc.

Thanks in advance! :)

edit2: Another thing I remember was that during the Triwizard Tournament, Harry was in a relationship with a female OC who was from Beauxbatons.

*** It is awesome! It's Phoenix Corrupted by iamneverwhere. [[/u/bgottfried91][u/bgottfried91]] linked it for us. Phoenix Corrupted is a fairly long work, incomplete, but the last chapter comes at the end of a major arc. It does a fairly good job at twisting your expectations. When I first came across it I spent pretty much my entire weekend reading it...and I'll probably spend a good portion of my free time this weekend doing the same thing again, lol.

#+begin_quote
  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.
