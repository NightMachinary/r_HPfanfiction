** I was excited to have found a new site for HP fic, but there doesn't seem to be a single slash fic on the entire site. I didn't see a rule against it, am I missing something? Or is it really 100% Mary Sue fic, like it appears to be?

*** There are slash fics. It's just huge, so you'll have to figure out which authors are the good ones, and then maybe browse through their favorites as well. I know a lot authors post exclusively on there, so it might be worth looking for new fics, but it's definitely not a very slash-searchable site (and less of a slash-writing population compared to say, specific-ship ljs).

*** There are /tons/ of slash fics on HPFF, but they can be tricky to find. Your best bet is to use the search form at the bottom of the [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/storytype.php][find a story]] section. Just select your first and second characters (probably whatever two characters you ship) and the genre you want, and it will bring up a selection of stories containing both of those characters. Although you'll also turn up a bunch of stories you're not looking for, it will narrow the results.

Unfortunately, HPFF is tragically difficult to search for same sex pairings. They are, however, here. Maybe we should compile pairing lists for this subreddit, to make these sorts of things easier to find!

**** That's the search method I was using. I didn't find anything last time, although in trying again, I spotted a couple by the third page of results. By then, I'd gone through so many cringe-worthy OC summaries, however, that I was quite turned off fanfiction for a bit.

I think making a thread in this subreddit for each pairing is a good idea.

***** That would be sweet. What pairing would you consider to be your "expertise"? Mine is /definitely/ Dramione. I don't care what anyone says; I'll always be a "leather librarian" at heart.

****** I am constantly torn between Harry/Draco and Harry/Severus. H/D is what I've read the most of, because it's everywhere. HP/SS is rarer, because a lot of people are rather disturbed by it, but I like the dynamic.

I don't read het very often, but I don't mind Dramione.

******* Dramione is my biggest ship (a.k.a. my "I could read and write this all day" ship), but I do like other stuff (including some slash). When I get around to reading it, I always enjoy a good Sirius/Remus fic.

I've never run into any Harry/Severus, but I imagine the dynamic would be fascinating between them. If that's what you're looking for, I know why you're not finding it on HPFF; they have really strict rules about [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/getinfo.php?page=siterules#Disallowed_Ships][professor/student romances]]. Any Harry/Snape slash fiction on HPFF would have to take place after Harry is no longer under Snape's tutelage, which is canonically impossible. Of course, there's always AU!

Although I have found a pretty limited number of actual stories for Runa (Ron/Luna), I've always really thought that they would make a better couple than the canon Romione. Ron is always entertained by her and she asks about him constantly in conversations with Harry. Plus, I just don't think Ron is really bright enough for Hermione, but that's a different story.

******* Might I rec a friend's [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308522][drarry fic]]? It's Harry caught between a dreamworld and reality. She's done writing it and in the process of posting it all.

******* I know that one of my favorite Remus/Sirius writers also writes HP/SS. I've never read her HP/SS fics because that pairing seems too weird to me, but I'll bet they're very well written.

[[http://minx.destinysgarden.net/LF_index.html][Here are some of them.]]

[[http://minx.destinysgarden.net/story_index.html][There's more on her masterlist here.]]

Site's clearly old, but it all works. Oh, and the fics are wonderfully smutty, but if that's not your thing, then maybe you shouldn't read them.

******* I stumbled across this list of [[http://www.amanuensis1.com/ficrecs.html][slash fics]] and while I haven't read any of them, I figured you might want to peruse it. Lots of Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, plenty of Lucius thrown in, and best of all the fics have descriptions so you can choose easier.
