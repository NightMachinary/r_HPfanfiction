I've noticed that the majority of Tom Riddle time travel/era fics have the plot start on his fifth or seventh year. I don't think I can realistically enjoy them, seeing as, in my opinion, he becomes irredeemable in around fifth year. What's your opinion? Is he, at all, redeemable? If so, at what point is he not?


** "Redeemable" is a very relative term. My understanding is that Tom Riddle was by nature psychopathic; no amounts of nurturing parenting, at any point in his life, could have gotten him to be a caring Hufflepuff. But of course, not every clinical psychopath becomes a mass-murderer.

The most realistic point at which his course could have been reset is of course his first encounter with Dumbledore. Had Dumbledore been less antagonistic to Riddle, and instead seemed more like a friend, it may have begun to disspell this idea of Riddle's that utterly crushing everyone who seems like they might at some point threaten you is the road to happiness.

Stick an unfeeling monster in a situation where they get a chocolate if they help an orphan kitten, but not if they kick the orphan kitten, and it won't matter that they don't get warm fuzzies from helping orphans, 'cause they want the chocolate. Repeat this enough at an early enough age and Voldemort could conceivably have gotten into the "habit" of being a decent person, to a point where even if he had no visceral repulsion for it, murder and evil wouldn't have been things he was interested in.

*** Here's an article/interview with a psychopathic scientist who himself studies psychopaths, but grew up to be functional and nonviolent.

He says that it was because he was raised in a loving environment and kept busy with sports; his parents told him that if he ever had time to himself, he'd start getting dark.

Hogwarts, I think, was precisely the /wrong/ environment for Tom. Nevermind the orphanage, the fact that Hogwarts encourages competition and antagonism between students due to the house system and doesn't appear to give many other outlets for aggression besides Quidditch means that Tom had pent up energy and "valid targets" that he could lash out at without much fear of reprisal. With no constructive outlets - and no encouragement to make his own - Tom took the absolute worst path he could have gone down.

Dumbledore didn't help either. Not when they first met, and not when he rejected Tom's attempts to become the DADA teacher. One made him an enemy in Tom's eyes, and the other told the highly aggressive/competitive boy that he'd "lost" to someone else.

I also didn't bring up the orphanage, or the fact that he lived in London /during WWII./ The kid /literally/ survived the London Blitz /only/ because he was starting his 3rd year of Hogwarts at the time and wasn't actually in the city. Hogwarts was just giving him the means without an outlet; it was the orphanage and the bombing of London that pushed him from "potentially productive member of society" to the mass murderer we know today.

While Clementine Productions or yourself may have an opinion that it doesn't, his videos do nothing to disprove decades of research, evidence and peer reviewed journals that such phenomena exists. While Scientology may use opinions to support their "science", it is not accepted as a form of evidence to further or disprove the existence of a phenomena within the wider scientific community.*

He merely displays a screenshot of a definition from god knows where and forms an opinion about it to use towards his argument.

For future reference, psychopathy is a disorder, not an illness and isn't really in the scope of his videos. The words disorder and illness are not interchangeable.

Psychopathy as per [[https://www-sciencedirect-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/science/referenceworks/9780080970875][International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences (Second Edition)]] is defined as "[[https://www-sciencedirect-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/topics/social-sciences/psychopathy][Psychopathy]] is a [[https://www-sciencedirect-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/topics/social-sciences/developmental-disorder][developmental disorder]] associated with increased risk of instrumental and reactive aggression and with chronic and violent [[https://www-sciencedirect-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/topics/social-sciences/maladjustment][antisocial behavior]] in both youth and adults.

While [[https://www-sciencedirect-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/topics/social-sciences/treatment][treatment]] recommendations are currently sparse, recent work has shown that previous assessments of treatment amenability in this population may have been overly pessimistic."

And if you look up clinical psychopathy, you get pages full of peer reviewed articles such as this one [[https://doi-org.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/10.1016/j.paid.2010.08.024]] examining the effect of rewards and punishment upon inhibition control.

****** Do you not think I'm also not tired of people spreading false information as some sort of fact?

*"I refuse to believe people are predestined to be evil."*The bad news is that developmental disorders exist. Psychopathy is one of them, just like more well known but milder ones like Autism (ASD) or ADHD/ADD. You can address the symptoms to improve their quality of life, but with current treatments the effects of disorder will always be there.

It's important to note that psychopathy is not just a state of mind like a conversion disorder, but there are often biological differences in the shape and size of areas in a psychopath's brain compared to a control. "By using the PCL-R (or the abbreviated PCL-SV) as a screening tool, it was possible to find that psychopaths have reduced gray matter in their frontal lobes ( Muller et al., 2008;Raine, Lencz, Birhle, LaCasse, & Colletti, 2000;Yang et al., 2010 ), increased striatal volume ( Glenn, Raine, Yaralian, & Yang, 2010 ), abnormal asymmetry in the hippocampus ( Laakso et al., 2001;Raine et al., 2004 ), a larger corpus callosum ( Raine et al., 2003 ), a lack of structural integrity in the uncinate fasciculus, ( Craig et al., 2009 ), abnormal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) ( Kiehl et al., 2001 ), and deformations within the amygdala ( Yang, Raine, Colletti, & Toga, 2009 ). There are two points to note here; first, the PCL-R works extremely well as the differences in neurology reflect the results of the test (at least in an academic setting). Second, all of these neurological studies have added an immense amount of knowledge to what it means biologically to be a psychopath."

*"Can you explain the difference between a sociopath and psychopath then?"*\\
I'm not sure if there is a consistent distinction between the two, some use them interchangeably, some offer distinctions but these vary between authors. Both can be diagnosed with either PCL-R or ASPD (in DSM-5), both can also be developmental or acquired (through a traumatic brain injury).

An example of the later would be Jack Pemmet, "Psychopathy versus sociopathy: Why the distinction has become crucial" published in the journal /Aggression and Violent Behavior, 2013-09-01, Volume 18, Issue 5, Pages 458-461,/ offer the distinction that "Psychopathy, which is the condition Hare successfully captured with the PCL-R, means the individual will have no empathy or sense of morality among a number of other traits ( Hare, 1991 ). Sociopathy, on the other hand, is indicative of having a sense of morality and a well-developed conscience, but the sense of right and wrong is not that of the parent culture. As this difference is reflected in the brain, the distinction again shows its use."

I'm not sure if he is correct, sociopathy vs psychopathy get a lot of attention as psychopathy is quite rare compared to other developmental conditions.

** I won't say Tom Riddle is redeemable per say, rather, he can be turned to a different path.

Tom Riddle loves to be acknowledged, praised, feared, to be in the centre of attention. His name, his reputation is just as important to him as anything.

He hates to be forgotten.

How to use this?

It's really rather simple. Instead of Dumbledore visiting Tom at the orphanage, let it be Slughorn instead.

It would be all the catalyst needed. For one, Tom would not fear death, thus removing the need for horcruxes. Another, his skills and powers would be treated with reverence and adoration. He will always be in the centre of attention.

That's enough to at least steer him away from becoming Wizarding Hitler.

To stop him from being a bad person though, that's another case entirely.

Also, leaving wizarding children to muggle orphanages to be abused will not raise good members of society in the first place.

******** It's one thing that murder is /worse/ than rape, mutilation & theft. I agree with you there. Where I disagree is the idea that it makes the murderer necessarily beyond redemption. Personally, I don't think the possibility redemption has much to do with the actual nature of the crimes committed beforehand; it's much more about the intentions & feelings behind the crime and whether the person grows past these. Grindelwald committed quite a lot of murders, but his intentions were a misguided attempt at doing good, so I think he's far from beyond redemption; there are no doubt many unrepentant rapists much less likely to ever turn their lives around than Grindelwald.

Also, all this is my moral stance in the real world. In the /Harry Potter/ universe though, I feel like the fact that death isn't actually oblivion but just a forced one-way trip to Heaven makes murder much, much less horrible than it is in real life, and we shouldn't forget that. It's still a pretty nasty thing to do to someone (life is great and you're wasting the person's one chance at experiencing it before they go off on their Next Great Adventure with no chance at a replay). But it's not the same as "erase you from existence".

***** Because each horcrux is a murder. Each time a wizard murders in cold blood or whatever, their souls is fractures or damaged. It might heal, I'm not sure. But when this happens, to create the horcrux you then put one of those fractures into an object to create the horcrux. So after that first horcrux most would consider it irredeemable. Also add in the fact even one wasn't enough to the point he made so many he went totally insane and filled with paranoia. The fact he messes with his soul isn't really the problem, it's the fact that to actually do that to your soul requires you to murder is why any mutilation of the soul is frowned upon.

Murderers in general aren't /irredeemable/, because with the correct set of actions, some of them can turn into better people (especially in cases where there was a somewhat "sensible" motive, such as revenge or whatever -- would you consider a Sirius who successfully killed Peter irredeemable?).

I'm not quite sure that's true; certainly Voldemort by Book 7 had flushed out whatever capacity for empathy he ever possessed, which is why Harry giving him some back from his mother's Love Protection is important and stuff. But I feel like this would be a gradual process with every Horcrux, and the maker of only /one/ Horcrux would be colder than before, but still not completely unfeeling. Mirroring the physical corruption, which is also gradual (at one Horcrux the difference is hard to tell to the naked eye, by seven you're a noseless snakeman with red eyes.

Also, as I said in my response to OP, "define redeemable". A psychopath (in the 'clinical' sense of someone who fundamentally doesn't feel love, empathy or compassion) can still be a decent person; just because they don't get warm fuzzies from helping people, doesn't mean they'll necessarily get a kick out of murder and conquest. A Psychopath-Voldemort could theoretically be /Clockwork Orange/d out of liking murder, and fall back to magical scholarship or snake-breeding or something as his go-to hobby, never again harming anyone.

** It takes a lot to make some truly irredeemable IMO. Voldemort's point of no return is the creation of his first horcrux.

Plenty of Death Eaters clearly retain their wits -- for example, Lucius, but not Bellatrix. As long as they do, it's never truly impossible for them to be redeemed IMO if they receive the right sort of attention. Whether it's deserved or not is another matter.

Irredeemable implies that they deserve /eternal/ punishment because of their actions. /Almost nobody/ deserves this.

EDIT: To clarify, I was giving Lucius as an example of a Death Eater that never went insane. That doesn't mean I consider him redeemed after all canon events add up. It makes him /redeemable/, not redeemed. Just saying.

Joking aside, I agree with the utilitarian point of view. There is no definable point (like flipping a switch) at which a human being becomes 'irredeemable'. Given the right resources and circumstances anyone can be programmed (rehabilitated?) to be a beneficial member of society. Thus, purely punitive justice is senseless. Of course the problem is that society usually lacks the resources and near-omniscient understanding of causality needed to rehabilitate the worst offenders.

** In terms of "points where, for want of a nail, TMR probably wouldn't have gone [evil] Dark Lord"

1) [Probably] having had even one real friend in the orphanage. However, if they were harmed by either muggles or wizards, especially if he lost them because they weren't magical, he would probably just be just as extreme, but with the opposite position (e.g. aiming for genociding purebloods or even all magicals).

2) Dumbledore's initial interactions with him.

3) Slughorn not being so dumb/oblivious/lazy/not-so-considering-of-the-consequences (depending on how one reads his character)

4) Horcruxes, if only because the Horcrux-induced insanity kind if locks one into a very specific path.

In terms of "committed an act so evil that he could not redeem himself from it, no matter what" - I don't think he ever did, actually. I believe that to be irredeemable, one must have caused so much death and suffering that even if all of one's victims miraculously came back to life, one would still be universally reviled forever (the worst perpetrators of genocide come to mind).

Thus, while he did cause and perform various crimes against humanity, they live in a universe that canon evidence suggests has an afterlife - so murder, while bad, isn't /that/ bad, because it's an inconvenience, not erasing a being from existence. Thus, we are already really in the extreme case where he only caused pain and anguish, but not being-erasure, and even then, he wasn't very good at it.

*** at number one: the question is, if riddle is genuinely able to have friends. would be cool though to have a revenge driven „muggleborn“ hellbent on destryoying purebloods.

Why wouldn't he? You could write him as a genuine sociopath or psychopath, incapable of the kind of deep bond shared by the Trio. But even such people are quite capable of growing fond of someone's company, in a more detached, "that doesn't in any way mean I'll put myself in harm's way to save you" kind of way.

***** I know that a lot of fanfiction is au but for me tom whos is not a genocidal guerillero is much easier to believe in compared to a person capable of having equal friends. Sure he might have minions but he wouldnt care very much about their loss.

** For me it's when he kills Myrtle. Not only does that make him a murderer, he's also dehumanized enough at that point to create a Horcrux.

** are you looking for an excuse to read/write Harry/Voldie slash? Voldie killed the boy's parents. There is no redeemable bad boy shit going on with the lich wannabe. He is pushing seventy by the time Harry is old enough to date anybody. Harry/voldie slash fans should go die.
