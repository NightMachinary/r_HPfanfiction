Are there any fics where Harry decides that actually he /does/ want to side with voldermort and when voldermort offers him a place as his trusted lieutenant it turns out not to be a trick but a genuine offer?

** Lens of sanity's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7446028/1/Choose_the_rest_is_in_the_details][choose]] fic. Only three chapters, but they're the funnest bits of Death Eater Potter you will ever read.
