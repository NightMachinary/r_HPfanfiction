《Preferably Would Occur AFTER 4th year, maybe even after the War》

As a result of some classic cliché wizardry, Fleur Delacour finds herself */gladly/* bonded to Harry James Potter.

She's overjoyed, buzzing with excitement for the long, loving life they'll have together.

But she understands that such a thing dropped on a person can be daunting (humans didn't get it as well as Veela do, poor things) thus she decides to get to know him.

He's clearly interested, though massively reserved, throughout their friendship (read courtship on Fleur's part) and though he sometimes can't help but give as good as he gets, he does try to avoid flirting and sneak away from anything physical or intimate.

Until she grows impatient and drops the bombshell...

And he refuses to hang out with her.

Avoided in the corridors, ignored when she speaks, as if their months of getting to know one another not only never happened, but as if they were mortal enemies. Leaving her both baffled, heartbroken and apoplectic in her rage.

She can't fathom why this /"leetle boy"/ is rejecting her.

Only through constant prodding, pleading and invasions of Harry's personal space and privacy does she finally get blown up on by a furious Harry and let in on a secret only those closest to Harry know.

He HAD a soulmate, before he met her.

And they died because of him...

/ALTERNATIVELY:/ A fic where Fleur spends most of her time trying to befriend Harry Potter before eventually revealing they are meant to be. Having massive difficulty getting him to open up and constantly frustrated that he's making things so difficult.
