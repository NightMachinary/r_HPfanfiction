** Fem!Harry. But I know that out there, there is a very creative writer ready to write a decent story with a original heroine other than a canon Harry with boobs and ridiculous hair. No these 'veil' things, gender-changing potions, or time travel and no annoying dating while the greatest dark wizard wants to kill her. The baby is a girl and she makes history as a witch, daughter of Lily and James. (and she has Lily beauty I'm sick of James intoxicating everything).

*** How. Dare. You?

More seriously, I can't totally understand why some people dislike Haphne. This ship was pretty much only created to show the Slytherin (and the Purebloods in general) under another light than "they are all evil bigots", so if you are not interested in the House in general, it doesn't have much to give you.

And even for the people who want to read more about Slytherin, it can be a bit . . . bland. I really love Daphne (or rather her potential as a love interest), but I'm ignoring 90% of her last updated stories because it's always the same they stories with "Grey family", "Ice-Queen", "Lordship" and "Pureblood culture".

**** If I read that "we are neutrals" line one more time, I'm gonna bash my head in. Someone as fanatical about "doing the right thing" as Harry was wouldn't touch a family who puts financial interest above people's lives with a ten foot wand.

** Most or all fics that bash on Ron (or Weasleys), it feels like lot of fanfics take the movie Ron and bash on him whilst completely ignoring how he is in the books.

** "Shenanigans occur but Harry is clueless to them personally, he's just lucky and that's kinda it?" styles of story, like Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot? I hate that type of humor.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6765496/chapters/15463549][Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach]]

The story is about the Wizarding World accidentally getting exposed and following that, the muggle and wizarding world trying to integrate and combine.

This premise is absolutly for me, but sadly, the strory just drifts slowly along with not too much happing and the worst that can happen to a story happend for me: it was boring.

** Back to the Beginning and Origins by burnable... It's funny, because lately I've been all about space stuff in Harry Potter (any suggestions?), but there's something about the writing style here, I can just barely force my way through it.

** Any sort or Draco redeeming fics

I'm not trying to crap on all of them, because I'm sure there are some good ones written out there, but for the most part I just can't enjoy it. I'm not a huge fan of his character anyway but I tried to read some to broaden my horizons when it comes to reading fics.

Many of them seem to make Malfoy severely out of character, usually for the sake of a pairing. It's one thing to make him guilty for what he'd done and /slowly/ change him while keeping some of his canon qualities to him, than to do a whole revamp and suddenly he's this super nice dude.

** Bashing of pretty much any kind just turns me off from fics. Which is annoying because some have pretty good plots. But humans are complicated, simple as that and if you can't make me hate a character through well-written nuance and have to result to bashing, that's really just a sign of poor writing. Snape in canon, for instance, is an absolute piece of shit but at the same time, is one of the most complicated characters with so much depth that in the end, I can't help but come to respect him. I still hate him (canon, at least), of course, because he's still blinded by hatred and treats students like trash but the flaws in his character as well as his convictions make him so thoroughly human that he's extremely fleshed out and well-written.
