In my upcoming fic, I am going to kill a bunch of characters, mainly OC. However, I decided that one of them should be familiar to the audience, so I thought I should go and kill a minor background character. My final decision fell on Astoria Greengrass. (Why do I feel like I have to add the fact that I am not killing her for shipping reasons lol).

Anyway, my question was. Would you tag her death? She is only mentioned on book seven and Harry never interacts with her, but considering the fact that Daphne is popular among the readers I feel like I should. I really would appreciate your help.


** I have a question, you said that she will only mentioned in the Daily Prophet, but is Daphne Greengrass part of your story? In not, I don't think you should bother.

Daphne Greengrass, while being only mentioned once, somehow got popular with the readers (pretty sure it's because she can be anything the author want without being OOC since she doesn't have any personality and also has a cool name). Astoria doesn't even have this, canon books only talked about Draco's wife and her name is only given on sites like Pottermore, and Cursed Child (which make her hardly canon at all).\\
So, if her death is just a there to have a somehow familiar death among the victims, without any "consequence" (something like seeing a grieving Draco or Daphne), puting a "Character Death" tag would just turn away some readers (someone before me mentioned that a lot of reader filter out this tag) for something that's hardly a character and more an OC.\\
Some people might yell in the comment without the tag thought, but people always yell in the comments.

*** Yeah, Daphne will not be part of the story that much. I'll put a warning in my notes just in case then. Thank you for your insight. :)

** I wouldn't tag it as Major Character Death because it's a tag that's commonly excluded in fic searches. I would tag it as background character death/minor character death.

To cover your bases, you could still mark it as "Author chose not to use content warnings" while still having the BCD tag.

** If you're planning on killing a bunch of characters, just go for the universal 'Major Character Death' and 'Minor Character Death' tags.

*** I am going to add a kidnapping and character death tag, so the killings won't come as to a surprise to anyone.

My concern was the fact if I should warn about Astoria's death specifically. Her's is going to be mentioned mostly on the Daily Prophet and once at the final chapter when the culprit is revealed, and Harry won't even interact with her before her death.

However, if I add 'Major/Minor Character Death', I am concerned that the readers will presume I am going to kill a more proeminent character.

**** Well... I don't tag for who specifically will die - I just put the generic tag. I suppose that's a personal preference, but I just don't like putting huge spoilers in my tags.

***** Me neither. I think I will warn them in my notes that a background character is going to die. Thank you for the help :)
