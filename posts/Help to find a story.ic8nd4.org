I don't know English, so I use the google translator.

I'm looking for any Harry Potter fanfic that deals with him doing the work of Peter Pettigrew. I mean, let Harry take care of him while he's in that monstrous, child-like form.

to make it easier to make it similar to the story "In Willing Sacrifice by GeMerope"
