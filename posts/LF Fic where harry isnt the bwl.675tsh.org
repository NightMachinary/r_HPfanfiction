I want a fic where harry isnt the bwl not like people think his brother is when he is but that it is confirmed that his brother is the bwl and it follows Harry through his life being the brother of the boy who lived and the benefits of it and the down side to that too.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

** Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man is a good one. And the sequel is out and currently being released.

Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
