I will preface this entire post by saying that I have not really been keeping up with post-series updates on Pottermore or wherever else, so forgive me if some answer is out there already.

We all know that Regulus Black became a Death Eater very young, subsequently discovered Voldemort's plan regarding Horcruxes, and then turned on him which led to Regulus dying in the cave. I love Regulus Black - we know so little about him and he can be whatever a writer wants. I think he's a font of endless ideas to explore.

But when I think about what happened in between him joining the DEs and then sacrificing himself to destroy the locket, I just cannot think of the moment when his loyalty switched or an exact reason behind his switch. Was it a change in morals? Was it because he was scared and wanted to just live a normal life? As close as he and Kreacher may have been, I just don't believe that Voldemort using Kreacher that one time was enough for Regulus to jump ship (in fact, I have a whole other theory about why Kreacher was volunteered for Voldemort's request). There has to be something else - something more - that happened.

Regulus really wouldn't have had exposure to people to challenge his blood supremacy beliefs (which I whole-heartedly believe that he held for most, if not all, of his life), especially after Sirius left home. I find it hard to believe that he would suddenly grow a conscious in the environment he was in. Further, Regulus was presumably morally fine with use of dark magic, so the idea of soul-splitting likely wouldn't offend him as much as it offended Slughorn, say.

In my own head-canon, Regulus is quite like Sirius in a lot of ways. I see him as smug, arrogant, egotistical, stubborn, incredibly intelligent, sharp, and often has a hard time admitting that he could be wrong. I think that Regulus is also extremely loyal to those with whom he shares beliefs and expects the same loyalty in return. This leads me to believe that Regulus was simply an entitled young DE with dreams of grandeur and a high place in Voldemort's regime - he was a Black after all, basically wizarding royalty - and this wasn't happening in the way that Regulus wanted.

I believe Regulus slowly grew disenchanted with Voldemort personally, not his cause. Regulus expected more in terms of respect and loyalty. The DEs were subject to total control by Voldemort at basically all times (unsure if this is canon, but I could see Voldemort subjecting DEs to mind-reading regularly to make sure that they weren't plotting against him). Regulus wanted the same transparency from Voldemort; he wasn't going to stand living with double standards. I have an idea that the ultimate tipping point for Regulus was that Voldemort was using Horcruxes for himself only and had no plans of sharing immortality with his followers. Regulus felt such a sense of betrayal from someone who he had risked his life for. His turn on Voldemort was done out of spite and vengeance rather than out of growing a conscious about the tactics Voldemort was using to win the war. I believe the letter from RAB supports this theory - there is nothing explicit in the letter that destroying the Horcrux was the "right" thing to do or that Voldemort was a monster for what he was doing to non-purebloods.

But honestly, my ideas about this change every few months. What are your theories behind his defiance of Voldemort? Canon, non-canon, head-canon, all thoughts are welcome!


** I think Regulus is a representation of an ideal of morality that seems to definitely exist, but we don't have good reason for why it exists. That is to say, Regulus seems to represent that gut feeling you have-- that sickness when you know that something is wrong in your core, but maybe you weren't taught that it was wrong (i.e parents who support Hitler, Mussolini, other shall-remain- unnamed-despots... and the child KNOWS it's wrong, feels it, grows away from it in time even if their surroundings don't support it).

Maybe irl it's social media... maybe at Hogwarts it's overhearing the other houses talking around him. He died really young-- 18 or 19, I think? Young enough that a biased modern court would write his crimes off, old enough that he probably knew what he was doing. So shortly after he escaped the blinders of youth, he died at the hand of his own remorse.

It's impossible to to know, and I love to speculate.

** I'm currently writing a Regulus-centred fic, so this is a question I actually thought about a lot.

Regulus defecting only because of what happened to Kreacher doesn't seem really plausible, especially considering that his death leaves Kreacher (and the rest of his family) vulnerable. Kreacher was still alive, and he knew the truth about the Horcrux, hell, the locket was at Grimmauld Place! If Voldemort found out Kreacher not being dead, he could have thought it suspicious enough to investigate, which would result in him finding out the truth about what Regulus had done and possibly deaths of every living Black.

The Blacks were known to be a family that firmly believed in the pureblood supremacy. I think both, Sirius and Regulus, grew up listening and believing in the /truths/ they've heard from their parents. Why wouldn't they? I doubt Walburga or Orion allowed their sons to venture into the muggle world or let them made their own opinions about muggles and muggleborns. It wasn't until they went to Hogwarts that they had a chance to see the world outside of the bubble of Grimmauld Place.

And here is the difference between Sirius and Regulus. Sirius met James on the train, and he must have liked him enough to be willing to try something different - he was sorted into Gryffindor, breaking the tradition and exposing himself to the new perspective. Regulus followed the tradition and stayed pretty much in the same environment he grew up in - surrounded by purebloods in the house named after Salazar Slytherin who, as far as we know, also believed in the ideas of pureblood supremacy.

Sirius was open to seeing the truth, while Regulus clung to the lies his family had told him when he grew up. I think joining Death Eaters was another lie Regulus chose to believe. During the First War, Voldemort operated a little differently than what we've seen in the books - his actions were more secretive, and yes, there was a war, but I don't think he was acting like the madman we've seen in the series. Death Eaters were probably presented as some exclusive club, a brotherhood, a promise of companionship and glory or some shit, especially for the potential candidates. Perhaps Regulus was as impulsive and reckless as his brother and didn't think it through. I don't think Regulus realised what was going on until he turned 17; before Regulus reached maturity, he was useless to the Death Eaters: he couldn't apparate, he was still under trace, and spent most of the year in school. So there was very little action for him, and the illusion of a secret brotherhood could only grow stronger during that time.

But when he finished his education and could become a full-time Death Eater, he probably got scared of what they were willing to do to reach their goals. Sirius insinuates Regulus didn't have the stomach for killing and torturing. I believe it was the moment when he couldn't cling to the lies he had been told any longer and wanted out. Not because he suddenly decided muggles and muggleborns were alright, but because the promised brotherhood turned out to be something completely different than what was promised.

In OotP Sirius says:

#+begin_quote
  /my parents, with their pure-blood mania,/ */convinced that to be a Black made you practically royal./*
#+end_quote

It's not a big stretch to say, Regulus thought the same, and yet there he was doing Voldemort's bidding, bowing and kissing Voldemort's robes while the man ordered him around. For a Black, it was probably the end of the world to practically be someone else's servant.

Unfortunately for him at that point, there was nothing he could do - he was stuck, a Dark Mark on his forearm, and no way to quit, no way to escape. Defection meant death, and I believe Regulus chose to die on his own terms - not as a servant on his knees, but a Black: proud and arrogant to the very end. I mean the note he had left for Voldemort:

#+begin_quote
  /I know I will be dead long before you read this,/ /but/ */I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret/*/./ */I have stolen the real Horcrux and I intend to destroy it as soon as I can./*
#+end_quote

I know we are laughing that Regulus basically left a f**k-you-note for Voldemort, but it's the truth. It's the middle-finger Regulus showed Voldemort one last time before he died and once again, it wasn't a death of a man who spent some time on the run, exhausted and scared and hiding in the woods. He died with his head held high, believing Kreacher would be able to destroy the locket and Regulus would be the part of Voldemort's downfall. And that note tells me that Regulus and Sirius were more alike than most people tend to believe.

*** I love this analysis. I definitely imagine that Voldemort was a little less unhinged during the First Wizarding War. Not sure if this is canon, but I imagine him much more like Tom Riddle (appearance-wise), not the snake-like madman we see him as in the movies. He's charismatic, manipulative, and not as openly dangerous as Harry and co. know him to be. Perhaps much of the violence, at least early on, is done covertly. I see the First Wizarding War as one of mainly propaganda to entice more and more to Voldemort's cause. It starts out with /some/ reason, maybe. Then as his supporters grow so does his brazenness. The DEs go beyond just a political group with strong influence.

I think that it is very realistic for Regulus to have believed that the DEs were a powerful social club of like-minded, powerful, and influential purebloods and then he either felt pissed off that life after Hogwarts wasn't what he expected or he was scared shitless at what he was suddenly expected to do. As others here have commented, a 16 year-old DE is practically useless, so they wouldn't see the full scope of what being a DE entails. I wouldn't be surprised if the violence was hidden from younger recruits altogether - then once they came of age they were ordered to injure, torture, kill. At that point they've been marked and are really stuck between the choice of killing others or being killed themselves.

Wow I can go on and on about this stuff. The First Wizarding War is such fertile ground for character and world development.

**** I find the Marauders Era and the First War with Voldemort completely fascinating. Maybe it's because we know very little about that time, but everything just seems more complex, more intriguing - the characters, the setting, the wizarding world as a whole. And well, Regulus is my favourite - there is just so much you can do with him and so much you can build around him.

** I think I agree mostly with what you say, except I believe it was less to do with personal arrogance and more to do with realising that Voldemort didn't give a toss about anyone other than himself, which Regulus was willing to put up with until he realised Voldemort had made himself immortal.

In my headcanon, Regulus died every bit the blood purist bigot you'd expect from a member of the Black family.

** Regulus is my favorite character. I love when this discussion comes up!

The other day I read a fic that said something like “Blacks might go down, but they'll take you down with them”. I think Regulus realized that he had tied himself to a madman and he wouldn't be able to escape, so he decided to make his own way out that at least had a chance of bringing Voldemort down too, as a last sort of fuck you.

It's my headcanon that Regulus and Orion were both in on it. Orion died in the same year and Sirius mentioned something about his father and the wards on grimmauld place. Granted, it's probably a coincidence, but it just works out too well for me to believe it isn't. I think they realized that Voldemort was a liar (if they found out about the horcrux, who's to say they didn't find out about his parentage?) and an absolute psychopath, and being Blacks, they refused to bow to him. Every Black we meet in canon is exceptionally arrogant and proud, even Sirius.

It's also my headcanon that horcruxes fuck with your sanity. I mean, you're splitting your SOUL into pieces. If Voldemort was already super violent and insane, I'm sure Regulus realized that nothing good would come of his rule. Yeah, he might ensure pureblood rule, but they'd be ruling over the ashes, and what's the point in that?

That being said, I still think Regulus was very brave to do what he did. He had to have known he was going to be ripped to pieces by inferi. Idk if I could walk to my death knowing that, even if it meant I got a little bit of revenge.

*** He is my favorite character as well and I love the ideas about the very impactful last few years of his life. I love the thought that Regulus also may have found out about Voldemort's parentage, which only added to the disillusionment. However, I have my own theories about Orion's death. I just feel that Walburga (and perhaps even the Bellatrix/Narcissa/Andromeda branch of the family) would have been punished if Regulus and Orion were in on it. I mean, what better way to punish the proud Black family than by ending their entire lineage?

** Sirius said that his parents also agreed with Voldemort's narrative until they saw what he was capable of doing so my guess is that the Blacks might have been blood purists but not terrorists. My headcanon was always that they were mostly isolationists because they didn't seem to look down on other magical creatures like some of the other Death Eaters did. Kreacher absolutely adored Walburga and Regulus sacrificed his life for him.

I think Regulus viewed the Death Eaters as a club of Pureblood elites who influenced the Magical World through politics and key positions and would pass laws that would deter the Muggleborns from joining their society. I agree that he got disenchanted with Voldemort when he realized that becoming a Death Eater basically meant signing yourself into slavery to him.

Also I could see why Regulus did not agree with Horcruxes. They seem to be presented as items so dark that many dark wizard and witches won't cross the line at them. Besides he probably worried about both the fact that with an immortal Voldemort, he'll be his slave for life, as well as not knowing how that would affect his soul, since now they were bonded through the Dark Mark.

*** I completely agree with this! I feel like the Blacks had a level of sophistication that they wanted to maintain but were not interested in the severe methods of purging the wizarding world of Muggleborns and stuff. They probably wanted things like not allowing Muggleborns to attend Hogwarts and buy wands, and having a system that favoured pure bloods even more to emphasize their status. Aside from Bellatrix who is her own kind of insane, none of the Black children really supported Voldemort's cause. Not even Narcissa who was a blood purist but didn't have a Dark Mark and wasn't on Voldemort's side, she was on her own side to do what it takes to keep her family safe.

I think you're right that Regulus felt like he was joining an elite pure blood club that was going to have more power once Voldemort took over the Ministry. Then he saw firsthand how unhinged Voldemort really was and probably recognized how expendable his Death Eaters were to him and realized this wasn't what he signed up for. Especially considering how young he was. He was 16 when he joined and 18 when he died and you're still somewhat innocent at that age so I'm sure when he saw the horrors Voldemort committed, it scared the shit out of him and he realized this wasn't what he meant to sign up for.

****** It also seems that the racism manifests itself a bit differently than hatred for muggleborns and muggles in the magical world as shown by the depictions on the fountain of magical brotherhood. House elves, goblins and centaurs are tolerated and accepted to a certain extent but they are expected to worship the wizards and witches. Then when they change the statue to the one from "Magic is Might" it just replaces the witch and the wizard as sitting on a throne made of muggles. That would indicate that they don't really care much about the other magical creatures as long as they mind their own business and do as they're told but they absolutely hate muggles and muggleborns and want them eradicated or enslaved.

** I realize I'm really late to this conversation, but this thread was too interesting to ignore! I imagine this isn't a popular opinion, but I like the straight-forward explanation of Kreacher being the reason he turns. Sure, there are probably other reasons that factored into his decision, but I think the harm done to Kreacher --- and not the fear of Voldemort himself --- was the tipping point. To me, it all plays into the whole idea of love being stronger than anything else in the HP universe and Voldemort's complete lack of understanding of that is what leads to his downfall.

Muggleborns don't mean anything to Regulus because, much like how real-life prejudices are formed, he doesn't have any real personal experiences with them. His family have told him all his life that muggleborns are awful, and then as far as we know he doesn't make any muggleborn friends in Hogwarts to negate that opinion. Kreacher, on the other hand, is someone who has literally taken care of Regulus since birth. In fact, considering what we know of Regulus' home life, Kreacher may have been the only person who consistently had his back and was there for him. In a rich pureblood household in the 70s, Orion Black would have been expected to be out exerting influence in society, not spending as much time at home. Sirius would have been more focused on his own concerns, and he'd eventually be forced to leave the family anyways over differing beliefs. Add to that, Regulus isn't like Draco where he has a mother who dotes over him and clearly loves him, he has Walburga Black --- who while probably still cared for Regulus, doesn't seem like a particularly nurturing woman and might even have touches of the Black family madness. I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility for Regulus to see Kreacher as a close friend or even as part of his family.

So, when Voldemort forces Kreacher into the cave and then leaves him to die when he could very easily take Kreacher with him, that isn't okay with Regulus. It's one thing for Regulus to fight and risk his life in the name of defending his home against the faceless threat of muggleborns, it's another for him to see a member of his family be treated like garbage and be needlessly left to die without a second thought. To make a shoddy real-life parallel, imagine following someone who you really believe in for years, and then they turn around one day and shoot your dog --- that isn't something that you're going to let slide. Voldemort essentially makes the same mistake that he does with Snape, he doesn't understand the close bond they have with beings he sees as replaceable, nor does he realize how far they're both willing to go for them.

It doesn't entirely make sense to us, sure, but a lot of decisions based off love (in whichever form it takes) rarely make any sort of rational sense. Why did Lily throw herself in front of the Killing Curse? She didn't know it would grant her son protection, and if she was thinking clearly, she'd realize that Voldemort would just kill her son right after her anyway. But she isn't thinking clearly, and by doing so, she helps save the world. I think stuff like that is part of what makes the message in Harry Potter so powerful, and I like the idea of Regulus being another example of seemingly stupid decisions made for love contributing to the defeat of the greatest evil that anyone's ever known. It's cheesy af, and there are a lot of cooler ideas down in the comments for sure (y'all are smart apples), but it's the take I like to go with lol.

** As many people here already said, I headcanon Regulus thinking that the DE were basically just an exclusive club for pureblood wizards with the same ideas and views. But after he joined and became of age (17), he learned it was more that what he thought he signed up for.

If I remember correctly, Sirius told Harry, that Regulus never was the one for torturing and killing and I do believe that that's true. Yes, he was blood-purist but he never wanted to kill anyone. I think he believed that if Voldemort ruled the Wizarding world only pure-bloods would go to schools and stuff like that but that was it.

And I do believe he wanted out but never knew how until Voldemort took Kreacher to the cave. Regulus then learned how to destroy Voldemort, which was also his way out. Also, he could've easily apparated out of there with Kreachers help, but I think he wanted to die, so if the plan didn't quite work out, he would die on his own terms instead of getting killed by Voldemort.

Also, unlike Sirius, Regulus didn't have anyone to run to if things got bad. Sirius had James, but Regulus had only Kreacher as far as we know. He didn't have anyone he could rely on or run away to, so if he had the change of heart even earlier, he couldn't act on it until he learned Voldemort's secret, because he saw first-hand what happens if you don't obey.

Anyways, he's one of the most interesting characters and I love how everyone can headcanon him differently since we have so little information about him. From all HP characters, he's by far my favourite one.
