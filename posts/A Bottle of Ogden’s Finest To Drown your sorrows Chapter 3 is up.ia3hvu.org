​

Marigold Evans Black was Lily's younger Slightly more vicious sister. She was The happy medium between Petunia's judgemental and resentful nature and Lily's Overly friendly and accepting one. Marigold was a prankster, The silent challenger to the Marauders' throne.\\
But that has been during her Hogwarts years. Before the war started, Before James and Lily died. Before she married Sirius , before he Betrayed them. Before she became Alastair Moody's Protégé and Amelia Bones' Rival. Before she couldn't stand to look into the eyes of her own nephew, Without seeing her dead sister looking back at her.

Marigold was once Nyx, the Midnight prankster. The unknown challenger to the Pranking throne. She was once a Spitfire, Vicious but kind. A loyal friend and brilliant sister. She was once the girl that mapped the black lake Single-handedly, Negotiate a peace treaty between the two centaur herds, And she was the only student at Hogwarts to ever eat one of Hagrid's rock cakes And lived to tell the tale.

She was the only girl with Enough chutzpah to Terrify Sirius Black into a date. Sirius In the early weeks of their relationship was often heard muttering to James,” I swear to Merlin mate, She's as terrifying as my cousin Bella, but she's sane .I don't know if that makes it better or worse. But She's bloody brilliant mate. Scary but brilliant. I think I might be in love or I might be drug... you mind tYing me to a chair and testing that Jamesie? Get Moony to do the spell work, I don't want you blowing me up.”

But that was before the war, Before Voldemort Burned down the world They had built. Before she had to bury so she loved. For her sister's death , Marigold had been curse breaker, Now she was an Auror. The Head of what was left of the elite Hitwizard squad. She was the old war dog now that Mad Eye had retired. Kingsley Shacklebolt's Petrifying mentor and the biggest thorn in Amelia Bones' side.

Marigold drink yourself to sleep every night, Still trying to live with the guilt of turning her nephew over to her magic hating sister, She just couldn't stand to see Lily eyes without screaming. She just couldn't raise a nephew her husband, A man she still loved Despite her best efforts, Marigold couldn't raise the boy her husband had tried to kill. Not that Dumbledore or the ministry Objected to her decision, No one wanted the boy who lived to be raised by a death eater's wife. Even if she was his aunt or The most terrifying Auror alive.

Before The war before the betrayal, Before the heartache. She was Merigold Evans Black, Promising Cursebreaker, Beloved wife, Brilliant sister, And one of the finest pranksters To ever grace the halls of Hogwarts.

Now She was a bitter woman, Riddled with guilt and a borderline alcoholic. Who was fighting the ministry tooth and nail To divorce her incarcerated monster of a husband, But like the Archaic Institution that the ministry was, They wouldn't authorize the Disillusion of her marriage without the consent Of the head of the house of black. Arturus the Vindictive old man Had refused it every time she had made a formal request. According to Lord Black , Before the bastard had met his maker, If his heir was going to shame the family by marrying a mudblood, And making her his lady. Then they were bloody well going to stay married Until they both took their last breath. The house of black According to Arcturus Deserve that much respect. The old man had even had the gall, To demand an heir from Her after he Turned down her last request. With a mocking little note informing her he had scheduled Conjugal visit for her with Sirius. The bastard had demanded she fuck that Traitorous Death Eater, until a Sprog came about.

Marigold had Shattered every window in the ministry with the force of her fury After she had read that. Amelia put her on administrative leave for a week after that.

If Remus Lupin haven't found her two days in too A drinking spree At the hogshead During that week of leave. Marigold would probably be dead. Marigold and Remus had a strange agreement after all these years. They have slowly come to resent each other because of acts that were not there own. They have made a twisted pact of a sort, Neither willing to let the other die just yet. Because they were the last of the circle still mostly functional And breathing under normal circumstances Remus and Marigold Saw each other twice a year on Harry's birthday and the day of Lily's death. They met at Godric's Hollow. Every year at the Potter residence And together they walked to the graves and their dearest friends and beloved relatives. Remus always had a sorrowful smile To answer Merigold ever increasingly bitter laugh.

In once a year they transfigured each other Into salesmen ,vicars , And on one memorable occasion a circus act. Anything that would discuss them and they went to Harry's school to check up on him. Every year they saw A young boy in baggie second hand clothes With a kind glint in his eye the same as his mother's . A little boy that could pass for his father's doppelgänger. And every year they would slink away from the school yard With shame and guilt in their minds. Before together going to drink away their sorrows , Before separating Only to repeat the process Again the next year.

Marigold didn't stop drinking or break Her self-destructive pattern until Amelia slammed a case file Stamped Crimson with the Abuse On her head.

The Victim in the case was her nephew.

Marigold haven't had a drop since.
