Looking for good fics that feature Harry staying in the muggle world for longer than age 11. Be it he is summoned by the cup in fourth year, or someone stumbles upon him in fifth year, or even if he manages the stay out of the wizarding world for the entire war. It doesn't matter, just as long as he doesn't show up in first year because he's living the muggle world.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** Well this doesnt hit the mark but your request brought this up in memory bc the writer did not choose to make Harry super powerful or even magically gifted. When you finish these other fine suggestions that I want to read too, please give this a try. Its one of my favorites. linkffn(almost a squib)!

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

  The day Harry Potter turned eleven was the day he would have re-entered the magical world. But the letter never came; Harry Potter was a Squib. Dismissed by the wizards, he makes a quiet life for himself and will not stand for them to ruin it.
