** Because Kings and Queens are targeted the most. Knights and Rooks aren't always used for attacks. They can also be used in safer positions to protect the attacking pieces (Queens and Bishops).

After castling, rooks are in one of the safest positions on a chessboard, and skilled players usually put their rooks in the same row/column with no obstructions so they can protect each other. A sufficiently skilled chess player could win against an average opponent without moving his rooks from the last row.

Knights are ones which are ridiculously hard to protect. Protecting them with a rook or bishop is hard, because every move involves switching 1 row and 2 columns or vice-versa.

I highly doubt the chessboard would've allowed the King to be replaced, in any case. And even if it did, the King would surely die if they were to lose. Wizards' Chess doesn't destroy the rest of the pieces after a game is over. Even if they were not allowed to move forward, atleast they wouldn't be injured/dead.

Honestly, Ron haters will find any stupid reason to shit on him.

*** So you're calling me a Ron hater? Don't make these accusations. Anyway, the king never gets captured like in wizards chess, just like a real game.

**** The King threw his crown down. There's no way to know what would happen to human "replacements".

I don't see you denying it mate. And a glance at your comments is enough to know that it isn't just an accusation.

***** I don't care if you look at my comments. I'm just saying if I hate Ron, there are plenty of reasons to bash him:

Ron...

called Hermione a nightmare in public.

- called Hermione a know-it-all at least twice a week for at least the first few years at Hogwarts (PoA ch 9).
- generally mocked Hermione's academic interests except when she was helping him with his homework.
- Some people (/perhaps/ /a bit unfairly/) blame Ron for the Scabbers, Crookshanks situation, when Hermione was being dismissive of Ron's reasonable concerns (/perhaps because Ron had been calling her a know-it-all twice a week since first year?/).
- mocked Hermione for being interested in justice for house-elves.
- was jealous and didn't believe Harry and he abandoned him after Harry's name came out of the Goblet.
- was sexist (called girls trolls).
- was dismissive of the idea that anyone would like Hermione enough to ask her to the Yule Ball.
- had a jealous meltdown and treated Hermione like crap about Krum and the Yule Ball.
- started fights with Hermione often enough for Harry to notice---even in fifth year which otherwise had no major incidents.
- started off sixth year by hitting Harry on the head (/not with intended malice, but it was nonetheless a sign of things to come/).
- was a jealous dick to Hermione about Slughorn's party (which she invited him to anyway, for some ungodly reason).
- was a sexist controlling asshole when he slut-shamed and attacked his sister (Harry had to hold him back),
- then---out of jealousy over Hermione ostensibly kissing Krum *two years prior*---he verbally and emotionally attacked Hermione for a couple of weeks.
- was aggressive with the girls on the quidditch team---enough to make Demelza Robins cry,
- then, to get even with Ginny for kissing before he did, and to get back at Hermione for kissing Krum, and to score a notch on his belt, he took advantage of Lavender's affections and *made sure to publicly snog and more or less grope her in front of Hermione and Ginny*..... thus blowing off his date with Hermione without having the courtesy to tell her first.

  - (/Hermione finally snapped after being/ */abused/* /by Ron for a couple of weeks and sicced canaries on him/).

- complained all the time about the food and accommodations during the horcrux hunt, and complained about Harry having no idea how to find horcruxes.
- started a fight with Harry and then ditched Harry and Hermione half-way during the horcrux hunt.

******* I don't need psychological help. Seeing as you obviously are not a psychologist and should not be telling people to get help, then just click on your own links. An unhealthy hate could be defined as Harry's hate for Voldemort. Same thing.

** I'm not that good at chess so I may be wrong, but becoming a Queen could be pretty dangerous. The piece may be powerfull, but because she is so powerfull, she can be put in a lot more dangerous situation that, say, a rock.

As for not using a King, I'll be optimist and say that Ron took into account the posibility he could lose. Even in loss, you can manage to save a bishop, but the kind will always be sacrificed.
