I've read a good number of fics with manipulator!Dumbledore, and even many comedy fics with a stupid/incompetent Dumbledore, but I don't think I've seen any non-comedy fics with a stupid/incompetent Dumbledore. (Assumption is that only manipulative or stupid explains what he does with Harry.)

Would that even work? It seems to me that as he holds several top positions, a non-comedy incompetence would just be a depressing indictment of that whole society.

That is already there but having an assumed awesome Dumbledore takes the sting off a bit. Without him being legit great it might just drop into pure depressing blah.

  During the Christmas holidays of his fifth year Harry realizes that he should do something to keep things from spinning completely out of his control. He proceeds to make new allies and embraces his more Slytherin side to make use of his considerable resources.

*** Presumably he finds others who are competent? Does their prominence in the story keep it a bit upbeat?

How much focus is given to Dumbledore and his actions? Is he just background or do they have to constantly deal with his incompetence?

Does it overall avoid being a depressing slog (for the characters)?

** I was thinking about slightly less offensive way: what about Dumbledore with the Alzheimer disease? He is really old and combined with whole anti-Riddle operation has bus factor of 1 (i.e., him), it is truly frightful situation.

*** He also seems to be the leader of the people trying to keep the society functioning as something inclusive. With him debilitated people like Malfoy would have their way...
