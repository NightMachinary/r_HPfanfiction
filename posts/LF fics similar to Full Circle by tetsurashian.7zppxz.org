I like the fucking with people thing, being reborn into your own body and messing with people. Any pairing is fine, but i want something funny and irreverent linkao3(Full Circle by tetsurashian)

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate') Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (crack with a hint of seriousness, my specialty)

  You came, you saw, you survived. But at the end of the day, you're still children. It doesn't matter how many battles you've won, how many Dark Lords have been triumphed, or how many personal travesties become medals of honor. You deserve better; the Sun is out now. [mermaid!SI/OC, many odd couples]

  One day, Christopher died and woke up as everyone's favorite character-Peter Pettigrew. "Don't suppose there's a return policy on this kind of thing? 'Cause...I think I want a refund." With Christopher as Peter, how much will change? Semi-SI(Self Insert)/OC. Marauders-Era. undecided pairing, slash, m/m, m/f, bi, multi-shippings
