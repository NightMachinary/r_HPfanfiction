There's a fic I read ages ago that talked briefly about how time turners were invented, and the general idea was that an inventor was visited in the night by a masked man, and the man instructed the inventor on building a device. Upon its completion, the masked man revealed himself to be the inventor himself, six hours older. He explained the inventor must use the device, the first Time Turner, to go back and instruct his own younger self as his older self had just done.

I always thought it was a really awesome concept, but can't find the fic because I can't remember any specific lines from the excerpt.


** linkffn(2630300) has this exactly as described literally in the last chapter but I'm not sure its actually what you're looking for as its just kind of mentioned off hand, not the subject of the story. also this is pt3 of a trilogy.

** Hopefully no one will be terribly offended this isn't either Harry Potter or fanfiction, but this online short story is a good read with a similar plot element.

Really? Sounds like a showerthought... what's the story? Such time travel paradoxes are only really enjoyable in a comedy like Back to the Future.

*** I don't remember which story genius, that's what the fucking post is for. I gave the cliff notes version, the version in the fic is much better presented.
