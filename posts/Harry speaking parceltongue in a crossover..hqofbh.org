I love parseltongue and I want to see people not of the HP universe having to deal it.

Are their any?

Without any character bashing?

I just want to see Harry speak unsettling hissing language to a snake and upsetting people.

*Edit: Parseltongue.


** He speaks to parcels?

Harry Potter and the StarCruiser UPS Truck?

** I've been on a really big stargate kick and this just gave me the idea of 1 Harry speaking in parseltongue in front of the sgc and 2 Harry somehow being able to talk to/control/influence the goa'uld because he's a parselmouth... never gonna write this but I would love to read it lmao

*** Oh god me too. Parceltongue is so underutilized in crossovers. I love the moment that the person with an upsetting power uses it in a different universe. The more upsetting the better.

That would work so well. Reminds me of the Orochimaru in stargate crossover. How many snake people can you send to a universe that isn't a huge fan of snake people?

Harry would be hunted down instantly lmao

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.
