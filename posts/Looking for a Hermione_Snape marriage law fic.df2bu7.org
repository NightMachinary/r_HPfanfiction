:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey everyone! I'm looking for a fic I read ages ago. Hermione is forced to choose a partner because of the Marriage Law, and ends up with Theodore Nott. Snape is married to Nott's mother, but in the end they end up together. It's a really long fic, but I remember enjoying it. Does it ring anyone a bell? Thanks!

EDIT: Why the downvote? I'm almost certain this is the fic you asked for unless there's a 2nd fic that fulfills your request...

HG alongside a bunch of others in her Hogwarts year is forced to marry, spends some time in some kind of marriage counsel thingy administered by Snape and ends up choosing Theodore Nott due to some common interests.

**** Never liked how people downvote things they don't like rather than things that don't contribute. But it makes even less sense in this case since, well, duh, /obviously/ a thread asking something SS-related will have SS-related replies. I mean, why even open the thread in first place if they dislike it?
