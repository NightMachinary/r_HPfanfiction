Do you know where he is ? He didnt updated since 2016.


** Yea, he is pretty much gone from the fandom. Don't expect any updates, his twitter stopped getting updates at the same time as his fics. I just hope it was a decision to stop, and not something worse. But I guess the fact that fanficauthors.net is still up suggests that he is ok.

A shame anyways, both "Perfect Slytherins" and "Howarts Dawn" would deserve to be finished. Love those fics, same as much of his other stuff.

** Your best bet would be to ask on the Cear Azkaban group to find out.
