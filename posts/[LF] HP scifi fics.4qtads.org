Any good recs for a futuristic HP fic? Maybe a crossover with say, star wars or star trek or the like. I read a few star wars crossovers that were interesting, they mostly incorporated the MoD as the reason why Harry is in that universe (immortality i think it was ... unsure right now ... in 1 i remember him being send into the distant past instead! Interesting concept imho). :) If not, then maybe something that deals with more modern science, as in muggle science, maybe? Thanks guys! ;)


** "Blue Magic", very nice Mass Effect Crossover where the two verses seem not as unbalanced as in other crossovers.

Some of these stories I haven't finished reading or no longer exactly like but I still consider them fairly good.

There's a third story in the Inquisitor Carrow trilogy and a fourth will be coming soon from what I understand.

Just click on Darth Marrs's name for a lot of good HP/SCIFI xovers

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

*** You like that one? That's one of the ones I usually use as a demo for what's wrong with scifi and magic combined. Magic should remain the province of the wizard, tech the province of the technologist, with the odd technomage in the middle but not so that every tom, dick, and red shirt can say "Oh, yeah, we know all about magic, we have x that can do the same thing you can with your wand. So yeah, you should just give up on magic completely and accept our super awesome post-scarcity lifestyle."

The handful of times I've tried to read this one I can't get past te healing part.

Harry's trapped somewhere with people he doesn't know so he just starts saying all this stuff about himself and magical creatures and muggles are totally in on it all? yeah, no.

** Currently reading linkffn(Harry Potter Geth by mjimeyg). It's a pretty good read. Only about half way through, and I'm enjoying it. I'm a little lost as I've not played Mass Effect, but there's enough background to keep from being totally lost. I find Harry a little over-powered, but it's not too bad.

I second Browncoat, Green Eyes. It's one of my absolute favorite stories.

linkffn(Harry Potter an Ancient's Journey by phoenixstave) (originally by keiranhalcyon2010) is also a great read. Sadly not finished, and probably never will be.

linkffn(Isis's Bane by althor42) and it's sequels (or rather forks) are great. HPxStargate SG1. One of my favorites as well.

linkffn( Oma's Choice by jacobds) is another HPxSG1 crossover. Wraps up Voldy pretty quick, then completely abandons HP world IIRC. So it's mostly a Harry in Space story.
