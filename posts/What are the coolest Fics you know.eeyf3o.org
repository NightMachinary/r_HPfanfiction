** I'll second Lens of Sanity. Plus there's /Wastelands of Time/ and a more obscure, rougher-around-the-edges fic /The Innocence Of Guilt/ that my teenage self found really cool years ago. YMMV, but they have epic battles and a badass protagonist without turning him into a Gary Stu.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** A bit different from the other suggestions, but Ginny in The Changeling and Armistice series by annerb is just so sleek, smooth and polished. It doesn't start off as so but she does very quickly gain her edge. The other older girls in the story are also mysterious and have such a way with words.

No spoilers, but there's one scene towards the end of the latest fic where Ginny is put on the defensive and the way her ploy works out is just one of the most dialogues I've read. And it gets better with every reread!

** I'm surprised this isn't here, but "The Life and Times" by Jewels5 is easily one of the best fan fictions (not just HP, but overall) I've ever read. Kept me off my seat the whole time. Characters are very well developed, and are supremely cool too! It is set in the Marauders' Era.

** I would recommend linkffn(Jamie Evans And Fates Fool) for this. It's a gender bent Harry, but if you can get past that it has a BAMF Harry Potter and a fantastic end batle. The author somehow managed to straddle the line where we get amazing action without bogging us down with details.
