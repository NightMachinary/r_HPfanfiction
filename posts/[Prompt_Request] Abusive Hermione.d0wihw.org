We see a ton of Abuser! Ron in fanfiction, but we rarely, if ever, see abusive Hermione.

Please keep the discussion civil.


** I remember the short one-shot [[https://fanfiction.net/s/8359767/1/Another-Sad-Statistic][Another Sad Statistic]] by Lucillia has this as the "twist" (can a 500 word fanfic have a twist ending?) linkffn(8359767)

There are definitely a lot of fanfics that explore the bird attack incident and the implications that has on Hermione's relationship with Ron, but I'm having trouble finding them as most searches for "Hermione" and "Abusive Relationships" have Hermione as the survivor as opposed to the perpetrator of abuse (understandable, as many readers like Hermione and like to put themselves in her shoes).

*** I mean abusive Ron actually has less basis in canon. Hermione sent those birds after Ron in the HBP.

I blame Emma Watson/the movie writers for making people forget the flaws of the character.
