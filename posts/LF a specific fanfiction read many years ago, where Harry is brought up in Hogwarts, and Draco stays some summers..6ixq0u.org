The fanfiction was housed at a site called 'The Big Green Chair', and it included (as said in the title) Harry being raised in Hogwarts. Lucius sent Draco to spend time with Harry, (before Hogwarts started iirc) and they developed a relationship. Voldemort is alive in this fic btw, and had never 'died'. The end includes Lucius using polyjuice potion to turn into Draco, and coming to the Dursleys house and tricking Harry, and delivering him to the Dark Lord. It is rather long, and spans over all of the years, and especially summers, at Hogwarts.

This is as much of the fic as I can remember, but the site was lead by a single author, and she had a TON of other good, and very very dark fanfictions on it. Must have been 7/8 years ago now, so I know it's a stretch, but does anyone recognise it? And knows where to find it?


** I've most definitely read this somewhere. This might be it? It's on Ao3 now.

*** this is exactly it! I cannot thank you enough, it's been bothering me for years now and yet I still couldn't find it? Pretty sure the domain was taken down but I'm so glad they're posted to AO3!

Seriously, thank you so much ðŸ’—
