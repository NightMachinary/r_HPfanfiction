After reading many millions of words of fanfiction I finally decided to try writing my own.

I would really appreciate some comments, criticism and feedback because I rather any problems I may have be pointed out now instead of reappearing over and over.

Thanks so much!


** Ok, my initial thoughts, and I'm sorry if this seems harsh...

1. You really need a beta. You're missing loads of question marks, which is quite basic grammar. You also have confusion over to/too, quite/quiet, and you're missing a few commas.

2. Harry seems wildly out of character. Look expectantly at Mrs Weasley for food and then banging his head on the table when he has to wait? Fighting and yelling at Ron over food? Harry is neither entitled nor dramatic.

3. The OC seems a little... cliched. The overly tragic backstory, starting Hogwarts late, beautiful but scarred and damaged....

4. Sirius is a bit out of character and is acting like a 14 year old boy. Yes, he's meant to be immature and whatnot, but he's usually very brooding and miserable, not hyperactive and teasing his 15 year old godson about girls (which also feels a little inappropriate).

5. The whole dream thing feels a little corny to me.

Now, the good points:

1. The dialogue still doesn't feel quite natural yet but is drastically better than the vast majority of first-time writers. Generally speaking you understand how people talk and replicate it well. This is definitely your strong point.

2. Although I criticised your grammar, it's not so bad that it can't be fixed with a beta and a little bit or relearning the rules. I know it's dull, but revise the basics of punctuation and go over common mistakes in vocab. For example, you write "expectingly" instead of "expectantly". This is very common and is the sign of an inexperienced writer, not a poor one. On the whole, your grammar and spelling is good.

3. You're clearly good at creating characters and backstory, the reason it feels contrived and cliche is that you've done it too fast. I can see you've put a lot of thought into it, which is great, just resist the temptation to reveal it all at once.

*** Thanks so much for your criticism. It's not too harsh at all. In fact, I'll address your points one by one.

I need a beta: Well I must admit that I didn't do the most thorough proof reading in my excitement to post the first few chapters. I will go over what I've written and look for the mistakes you've mentioned. Commas might be my weakest point to be honest. I'm not sure of the rules when using them in dialogue.

Harry is ooc: Darn, I guess I missed the mark on this one. Not much to say other than I'll try to get keep his interactions true to his character in the future.

Generic OC: I think that some parts of her are clichéd. Her uncle abusing her and her joining Hogwarts late. But I really tried hard to get away from any other clichés and I think it will be more evevident in the later chapters. I specifically refrained from describing her as beautiful or attractive because she isn't. She's covered in long, ugly and angry scars and she's really skinny without much form. The only part of that could considered pretty is her long dark hair. I don't want to spoil too much of the rest of the story but I can at least say that things aren't going to get magically better and everything won't work out for her. Her scars aren't going to be magically vanished and she's not going to take food supplement potions so she suddenly has curves or whatever.

Sirius is ooc: Again, darn. I missed the mark on this again. Same as Harry really; I'll try to portray him better in the future.

The dream thing is corny: I agree, it is corny. I'm considering taking it out really. That or I have to think of a really good reason to keep it (which is possible.) What do you think?

Now the good things.

Dialogue is in general decent: That was actually one of my biggest concerns, that my dialogue is unnatural. But I'm not going to delude myself that it's perfect, or even close.

Grammar is in general decent: To be honest I'm still disappointed in myself, seeing the mistakes you've pointed out. I'll work on fixing this up.

Character creation is decent: I would disagree with you here. You said that you viewed my oc as a beautiful girl with a tragic past. That means I've failed pretty badly. I attempted to portray her as a damaged girl with a tragic past and severe psychological trauma. For the part about rushing to reveal characters, I would say that I am wary of doing this. It's just hard to know how fast to go without any experience.

Thanks for taking the time to read my story and write up all that feedback. I really do appreciate it. I hate when my work is subpar, and the things you've said will definitely improve my story.

Would you be interested in being my beta? I'm not sure how these things work but I wouldn't ask too much for you or give you hard deadlines. I'd just be happy to have your help fixing issues in my story.

Edit: By the way, did you like the story? I won't be offended if you say no :P.

**** I'm sorry, but as I work full time + my own fics and undergoing part time study, I just don't have the time to be a beta and I'd just let you down! Definitely request here and the fanfiction forums though, because they really can go a long way.

I don't think your OC is generic, I think it just comes across as cliched because everything was there all at once. It was like "oh, an orphanage, and oh, scars, and oh awful uncle, and oh, everyone's mean to her...." To make this give the character depth rather than just an eyeroll, this stuff needs to be drip fed to the reader. Think about Harry himself - we see him in a crappy home life situation, but don't find out his parents were actually murdered until a couple of chapters in. Then, we don't find out the full extent of his parseltounge abilities until book 2, which is also where we're introduced to the fact that he suffers from other students ostracising and scapegoating him. Then, we don't find out about the betrayal until book 3, and so on... So, you haven't failed in creating the interesting character itself, it's simply overwhelming the reader with the tragic past that makes it feel cliched.

No, the dialect is still not perfect, but dialect is HARD, and even very good writers still mess it up all the time. I know it sounds small, but the fact that you include contractions, slang, and noises goes well beyond the vast majority of novice writers. You should honestly feel proud of yourself there.

***** No worries. I understand that everyone's really busy and being a beta is a lot of work.

I'll take your advice and really hold off revealing any more of my character's tragic past. Hopefully what I've done so far hasn't ruined her character, although from what you've said I'll probably need to change some of my earlier writing. Your example of Harry is makes a lot of sense. Do you think I should try to mirror what Rowling did with Harry's development?

Your appraisal of my dialogue is good to hear. That being said, do you have any advice? You mentioned it being awkward in a few places.

It's a lot to ask, but do you know any qualified people that might be willing to beta my story? As an experienced writer you I'm sure you have a lot more connections that I have.

****** It's not about mirroring JK Rowling, but taking notice of how authors gradually introduce characters to the readers. When you initially meet someone, you tend to make a first impression of their character, and then as you get to know them you pick things up and find out more about their lives. That's how it should be for the reader too. It's about showing rather than telling.

Not to blow my own trumpet, but as an example, in my own fic, I introduced my OC with her dad congratulating her on becoming an Auror, and almost immediately encouraging her to skip work and come with him for a lunch time drink. At the end of the chapter, she goes home and talks to her mum, who is watching tv and doesn't know who Harry Potter is. In the next chapter, just her and her mother are having breakfast. Later, she mentions going to her dad's for dinner. In chapter 3/4, she mentions her dad advised her to give up on something, and her mother says that's her dad's solution to everything. In chapter five, she mentions that her dad has a different last name and designs broomsticks, but doesn't like Quidditch and has an ambitious but vague plan for success. At no point have I mentioned the word "divorce", nor have I had her explain to any other characters that her mum is a muggle and her dad is a wizard, nor have I outright said her dad is a bit of a deadbeat, but gradually the reader has worked it out for themselves.

For your story, perhaps you could introduce initially that the OC has scars, but maybe the fact that her uncle gave them to her shouldn't be revealed until much later on. Perhaps rather than writing the word "orphanage*", you could describe the rows of beds with lots of children, maybe you could have them gossiping about her appearance. I don't think the conversation about admitting her to Hogwarts should have taken place until at least chapter two or three.

As for dialogue, I think a large part of it comes from the fact that you don't have the characterisation quite right. Especially with main characters you really have to know them inside and out to be able to write them naturally. This sounds weird, but trying writing out actual scenes of dialogue from the books to practice. So, to get Harry and Sirius right, find a chapter in OOTP where they're talking, and from the book literally copy what they're saying into a word document. It just helps you learn the patterns, the way they talk, and their mannerisms. It helps you resist the temptation to insert your own personality or fandom ideas into the characters. Perfect point - at no point in the series does Sirius talk to Harry about girls, despite the fandom misconception that he's Barney from How I Met Your Mother!

I think another reason the dialogue feels awkward is that a lot of it is unnecessary. How many times do we need to be told that Harry's slept in until noon? Does Harry need to say everyone's names when he enters the room? Can't you just say, 'Harry greeted them all as he entered the kitchen'. The writing practice above will also help with this.

As for betas... hmm, I don't know anyone in particular, because I proof-read my own stuff then get my boyfriend to read through it. I really want to help you, so I'm happy for you to send me messages asking for general plot and writing advice like this, I just don't have the time to go through and work on grammar.

*Also, I know orphanage is the go-to for fanfic writers, but there haven't been any real orphanages in the UK since pre-WW2. In reality, she would go into the foster care system, either in a children's home (which tend to have a very small amount of children) or with short-term foster parents. At that age, the concern would not be finding her adoptive parents, because she's too old and the process takes years, but setting her up for the future. I know this doesn't work within your fic, but it's something to consider if you're planning to rewrite anything.

******* You explain everything really well. In fact I went ahead and reviewed my first chapter using the feedback you gave me. Hopefully it's a least a smidgen better than my first draft.

Harry no longer acts entitled or overtly dramatic. Sirius no longer teases Harry about girls (I'm ashamed to have fallen for the stereotype here.) It's no longer stated that the girl is in an orphanage. It's not clear anymore what happened to her. All you learn is that she had a scar on her face, something bad in general happened to her, and her uncle is no longer her guardian.

Also, I'll try to keep in mind your point about unnecessary dialogue for future chapters and when I'm reviewing.

Really? That's great! I'd love to have your help. And honestly, you're far too experience and knowledgeable for me to want you to waste your time fixing my grammar or spelling. I'll look for another person who can help with both plot and grammar. I wish I could proof read effectively, however I read extremely fast meaning that while I'll fully understand the story, it's hard for me to pick up writing mistakes. I'm still going to try my best to proofread nonetheless.

** I haven't read it yet, but I'll give my first impression. I glanced at the first chapter and it has a single paragraph that is more than 2 lines. This indicates to me that the fic will be pretty much nothing except dialog and not to have high expectations.

*** So your criticism is write more non-dialogue stuff?

Also, feel free to check out my second chapter. It's got a lot of paragraphs that are more than two lines. I'm just starting out and I don't have a writing style that's set in stone. If you give me good feedback I can easily incorporate it into my developing writing style.

Edit: I was stupid at first, forgive me.
