Everyone knows that Voldemort's name in French was "Flight from death", and his name acted as taboo in the second war. But what about the first war then?

It always puzzles me how did people started calling Voldemort You know who or he-who-must-not-be-named, as both names are quite ridiculous in my opinion.

My thoughts on why people started calling Voldemort You know who is because his name had ALSO acted as a taboo in the first war. Given the fact that in the second war Voldemort did make his name a taboo and it takes down any protection spells or weakens wards that are casted, in order to track people from the order or anyone that openly defies him. This system makes think that Voldemort didn't just started doing this unless he just found out he could do this which is quite impossible because he spent years researching and claiming experience on using dark magic and of course making horcruxes.

And JKR did also said that only Dumbledore dares to say his name, and encourages others do say it, but why? To me Dumbledore is a manipulative sod that did many wrongs. Dumbledore KNEW Voldemort wasn't dead, maybe him encouraging people calling his name is just an act, to easily track Voldemort down and taking him down, since Dumbledore was the only Voldemort was actually scared of. And that was until the prophecy came in and y'all know the rest.

This is just a prompt guys, plz don't take it too seriously if it doesn't match your opinion thx.


** Anyone who says that means flight from Death is a fucking moron who can't speak French

**** It's pseudo-french. It's not grammatically or linguistically correct.

**** Voldemort :\\
Vol = Theft, Robbery, Stealing. . .*OR* Flight\\
de = Of, From, By, For . . . (depend of the context)\\
Mort = Death

​

It's broken French. But even without it, I think it is more likely that Voldemort's name was about "stealing" from Death (by becoming immortal), rather than running away from it (or flying away?).\\
But I still like the name, exactly the kind of thing you would expect from a arrogant teenager, an edgy name badly translated into another language (because it sound cool I guess?), the fact that he kept this name during all this name make it even better.

***** I like it because both flight of death and flight from death work. The first one fits his arrogance and perceived invulnerability, and the second one hints at his greatest fear, an important point in the books.

** I don't think Voldemort used the Taboo during the 1st war because the one we see in DH (that can be traced anywhere in Brittain and destroy the less resistant protections) use Ministry ressources to work (the same one used for the Trace I think) and Voldemort didn't have access to them during the 1st war.

But I think you are right that Voldemort worked hard to make his name feared during the 1st war. I don't think it was really spelled to be detected when you use it, but I would guess that using this name in public was a good way to receive the visit of some bad people in the following days. And even in close comity, it was a war where you didn't know who you could trust, one of your closest friend could be, in fact, a sympathiser for the cause or worst, under the Imperius.

​

I also think this is why Dumbledore wanted people to use his name. That strategy only worked because people started to call him "You Know Who" or other stupid monikers, exposing the one who said his name as his worst opponents. If everybody kept saying Voldemort, the Death Eaters would not have been able to target everyone, and the name would not have been as feared. As for Dumbledore, he kept using his name because he honnestly, he already was pretty high on Voldemort personnal kill list, and Voldemort was the only one among able to duel him, so he was not more in danger by using it.

PS: This is also why I think Voldemort didn't put a spelled Taboo on his name during the first war. While Dumbledore can sometimes make mistakes, I don't think he would ever ask people to actively destroy their own protections just to make a point.

** Personally, I don't get why he'd go through the trouble of making a fancy Dark Lord name and then making people too afraid to say it. Maybe he realized an anagram wasn't an effective way to shed ties with his Muggle father but couldn't just make a new name so instead he made people too afraid to say it? Kind of like later on when he starts yelling when he gets called Tom?
