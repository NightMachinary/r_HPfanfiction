Looking for fics where Harry is badass. Whether it's post-hogwarts, time travel, professor Harry, or anything like that. Just not those fics where he suddenly becomes a god because he's the heir to everything.

Would prefer fics that are 4th year or later


** If you're okay with a comedic twist on badass Harry, try this one of mine: Does Voldemort Even Lift, Bro?

  This story takes the trope/cliche of Harry Potter working out to become a fitness buff to its logical and completely ridiculous endgame. Now it's time to meet Beefcake Harry, Dudebro supreme. Also starring his mentor, a great big buff guy... named Thanos. And stoner Dumbledore, because why not?

**** You are the author of this masterpiece? I've had it bookmarked since it first came out! It's just one of those fics that I love, even if the style isn't usually my thing. Great fic!
