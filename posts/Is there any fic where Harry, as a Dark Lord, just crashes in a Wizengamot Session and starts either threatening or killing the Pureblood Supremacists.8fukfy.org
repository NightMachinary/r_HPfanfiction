Been reading for the first time "The Sum of their Parts" and this popped into my head.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): they organized a revolution, stormed the Ministry, and just killed off the Wizengamot. Hermione is a little unhinged in this fic.

**** She also can do no wrong. This is what I like to call starfox syndrome. The writing is good, don't get me wrong. It's just rather irking that across all of their work Hermione really isn't ever given any real flaws.

***** But she and Harry are not likable in this story.

On the other hand, Ron, Percy, Ginny, Neville, and Victor Krum shined.

****** Justified killing in HP universe does NOT damage one's soul, whether it was using Avada Kedavra to euthanize someone (Snape on Dumbledore), burning your teacher to dust and blowing someone off their brooms in self defense (Harry), or killing those sadistic Death Eaters to protect your loved ones (Molly).

She doesn't use any dark spells in this story. Most people she killed were those Voldemort supporters she sentenced to death after trial, and those foreign invaders she killed in self defense.

The one time she contemplated fully cold blooded murder was when she suspected Neville undermining her.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
