Hello all!

I'm looking for some help on a fic that is pretty much a series of one shots.

It's centered around Molly Weasley's relationship with each of her daughters in law, and each chapter/fic will tackle a different topic or type of relationship. There will be one (maybe two) OCs as canon wise we met Charlie's SO.

Any takers?


** Happy to do a beta read.
