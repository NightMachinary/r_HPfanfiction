I remember one where he makes friends with the goblins and it's a big deal because nearly no one is and he wants to make a change in the wizarding world.


** I don't know how much Harry acts like his mother in either of these, but try linkffn(The Daisy Chain by slytherinsal) and linkffn(Pranking the Tournament by Gardevoir687).

*** A bit of warning; The Daisy Chain is Snarry, which some people dislike. Haven't read it myself but I remember it being linked previously for someone looking for SSHP.

**** True. I'd forgotten that. As I recall, it was more of an "I'm gonna marry you when I'm older" thing than an actual active relationship, which may be why it didn't stick in my mind. Come to think of it, though, that could be a reason to disqualify it, since Lily was the pursued, rather than the pursuer.

  in a burst of accidental magic, Harry uses legilimensy to see pictures of his mother, and wish magic turns him into a little girl who looks like Lily. Vernon dies, and Petunia looks for somewhere to move. In Crawley they meet a little girl who also has accidental magic and with Petunia's knowledge and Dan Granger's cunning, plots are made. Fem! Harry, an experiment for me.

  When Harry learns something that could prove he didn't enter himself into the Triwizard Tournament, he decides to take it once step further and prank everyone in retaliation. However, his prank may have some unforeseen side effects. COMPLETE! Edited as of 11/13/19!

*** I've been following this one and there's definitely things that I like about it. It explores Snape's regrets over how his own friendship with Lily turned out and the parallels with Draco and Harry, which is nice. But it leans heavily on the 'Lily has a temper because she's a redhead' trope and Harry has a temper too because in this fic he takes after his mother instead of James. There's been several chapters so far where Harry has gotten away with physical violence that he should not have, including punching the people he claims are his friends. I'm still reading when it gets new updates, but I think that I need Harry to face consequences for his temper for me to really enjoy this one. Otherwise he's just a bully that's getting away with it because of his resemblance to his mother and that kind of makes him what Canon!Snape always accused him of being and takes away from the authors point.

  Around the time most young children do, Harry's hair goes from his father's dark locks to his mother's bright, most-likely-magical red hair. It changes everything about who Harry identifies with, who he wants to grow up to be, and who he thinks he is. Instead of having James Potter as his idol, Lily Potter turns out to be a much better influence. So instead of seeing a scruffy, most-likely-a-muggleborn boy standing beside him in Madam Malkin's before their first year, Draco only has eyes for the scarlet haired, green-eyed creature who just walked into his life and instead of an enemy, he finds a reason to be better than he'd been raised to be. Not that Harry will ever notice, given he's trying to simply survive at Hogwarts.And Severus might not make it to see these boys graduate when his heart kept giving out seeing his very-Slytherin godson repeat his own history and go chasing after a green-eyed, red-haired Gryffindor. Turns out the Malfoys aren't that bad and Dumbledore definitely is. Remus is at his wit's end and Sirius gets a chance to actually live up to his title as Harry's dogfather. Tom Riddle is not prepared for any of this.
