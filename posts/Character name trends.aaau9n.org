Has anyone else noticed that the naming of magical characters follows a general trend?

Characters coming from families who support the Dark Lord (or more traditional families) have names that are seemingly Latin or Greek, like Lucius, Draco, Sirius, Regulus, Orion, Bellatrix (and nearly all Blacks), Rodolphus, Rabastan, Severus, Augustus, Amycus, Alecto, Marcus, Merope and so on.

On the other hand, characters who come from families that oppose the Dark Lord seem to have names that are more modern I'd say. Names like James, Peter, Ernest, William, Arthur, George, Frank, Alice, Neville, Harry, Horace, Charles, Kingsley, Amelia, Susan, Edgar, Benjamin, Cedric, Michael, and so on.

Yes, I know there are exceptions to this, like Remus, Bartemius, Theodore, Luna, Xeno, and a few others, but it does feel like there is a general trend here. I'm also aware that Peter was a follower of Voldemort, but he wasn't one at first. Same goes for Severus. I'm also not looking at the root words of these names - if I were to look at the root words, they would all have origins from Latin, Greek or Hebrew - I'm just looking at their current versions.

Names of muggleborns are excluded from this since they do not come from magical families, so don't whinge about Hermione. So are names foreign (well, characters with foreign origins anyway) to the British isles like Igor, Antonin, Fleur, Apolline, Parvati, Padma (although those two are ancient names).

EDIT: I'm also not including Albus and Aberforth because we know next to nothing about Percival and Kendra's views. From the books, it looked like Percival killed the three muggle boys after the attack on his daughter - which isn't really enough to speak much about his views, really. Muriel says that Kendra went around telling people she was a pureblood in spite of being a halfblood, but that isn't enough to tell anything about her either. Aberforth says that he learnt secrets and lies on her knee, and that doesn't say much either...and that's it. I'd put Elphias and Dedalus in this category.

Augusta, Minerva, Pomona, Emmeline, Hestia : they're excluded for reasons that ought to be obvious - we don't know their maiden names (or anything at all, really).

Like I said in the beginning of my post, the naming trends were about families, not characters themselves.

Thoughts?


** Some more exceptions - Albus, Elphias, Aberforth, Amos, Hestia, Dedalus, Augusta, Caradoc, Nymphadora.

Also, as an Indian, I'm obliged to point out that Padma and Parvati are extremely common names. They do have ancient origins but they don't feel old-fashioned at all.

*** I thought of including Augusta and Hestia, but we don't know their maiden names (and their families' inclinations). It's the same with Minerva McGonagal, Pomona Sprout, Emmeline Vance - we don't know their maiden names, or in the event that they're unmarried, if they went against their family's views and became "blood-traitors".

Nymphadora is not an exception - she was named by her mother Andromeda, who was a Black by birth.

I did not include Albus and Aberforth, because we don't really know much about their family's views (and by family, I mean Kendra and Percival). From the books, it looked like Percival killed the three muggle boys after the attack on his daughter - which isn't really enough to speak much about his views, really. Muriel says that Kendra went around telling people she was a pureblood in spite of being a halfblood, but that isn't enough to tell anything about her either. Aberforth says that he learnt secrets and lies on her knee, and that doesn't say much either...and that's it. Same goes for Elphias Doge, Amos Diggory, Dedalus Diggle.

This is why I didn't include older people who were belonging to older generations - we know little about /their/ families' views.

**** But if Andromeda was opposed to Voldemort, she could have named her daughter anything other than Nymphadora. I think the classification shouldn't be about wizard families supporting and opposing Voldemort, but rather the kind of families they come from. Who knows? Maybe some families had Christian ancestors while other "very old" families didn't, thus resulting in Greek and Latin names.

** Well there's a thing in Britain that posh, snotty people look down on common names and less posh people give children more common names and think weird names are a bit snobbish. So the families that are snobbish have a tradition of naming people older more unusual names. Also more traditional wizarding families give their children more traditional names. As families go through time, they get less traditional so all of the old people have traditional names, but younger people have less traditional names. Simple enough.

*** You seem to have mistaken this as a post about characters' inclinations. It isn't. It's one about the characters' families' views.

  Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagal, Pomona Sprout, Augusta Longbottom
#+end_quote

We know very little about Percival and Kendra Dumbledore. I've edited my post a little, talking about this. Minerva, Augusta and Pomona, as I said, we don't know their maiden names, and therefore, nothing about their families. It is the family that they're born into that gives their name, and Minerva may have been born into a Darker family and turned her back on them at some point...maybe (it can be possible after all).

#+begin_quote
  Peter Pettigrew, Walden Macnair
#+end_quote

This is not an exception. He was on the light side in the beginning, and only switched because he was a self-serving coward. Macnair's first name is quite old, since it's Anglo-Saxon (and therefore Germanic) which is outside both the groups I mentioned. There are a few names like this in the series (Thorfinn is another Germaic name).

Vincent, Gregory and Theodore are exceptions, yes. Same goes for Luna and Remus.

** I don't see it, to be honest. To me it seems like you are trying to find something which does not exist.

And even if it were to exist, what purpose does it have beyond merely existing? Do you want to attribute the modernity of a name to the characters behavior? Names have no influence beyond the influence we grant them. Moral luck, now that is something you would want to look into if you want to measure the importance of the upbringing of a person compared to their actions!

A bit of flavour? Flavour adds a bit to depth to worldbuilding. Nothing game-changing, but it is an addition nonetheless. And I've always felt that the depth of canon was subpar at best, and shit at worst.

You're going to have to elaborate on this; I'm afraid I didn't understand what you were trying to say here.

I think it does the opposite. If you can tell the affiliation of every character by his name, that makes the world very shallow.

**** Flavour? To me it wouldn't matter much, I guess. I am ambivalent towards most of these things, I'd say. Naming comes from tradition, doesn't it, or it is because of some trend or some such stupid nonsense. I can't find it in me to care about stuff like that.

The idea to relate moral luck to the behavior of characters instead of relating their behavior to their names is something of a brainfart, I admit.\\
The fundamental question of moral luck is how our moral responsibility is changed by factors over which we have no control. Let's say purebloods are born into the situation of being purebloods, they are raised by purebloods to act like purebloods. They have the moral duties expected of purebloods, that is to say people expect them to be defendors of tradition and pureblood values, correct?

Now muggleborns on the other hand are raised by muggles, people that come from different backgrounds with various influences when it comes to morals. They are raised to become "worthy members of society" as defined by the ethics and moral laws of a society that is ruled by the people. Most muggleborn grow up learning that they need to stand up for something which they believe to be right, and that they need to act when something happens they perceive as wrong.

Now, is it /more/ morally reprehensible for the pureblood to defend his customs and traditions against the muggleborn or is it /more/ morally reprehrensible of the muggleborn to act against the pureblood's tradition and customs? - We could continue to spin this thinking up and about forever, I'd imagine, and I'm afraid my English is not good enough to discuss it without having to rely on my dictionary, however I'd want people to dig more into moral reasoning.

​

Uhm, did I make sense? In my head it did make sense.
