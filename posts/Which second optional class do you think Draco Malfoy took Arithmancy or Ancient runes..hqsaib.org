Draco Malfoy was in Care of Magical Creature and seemed to not have Divination, and since I very much doubt a blood purist like him would have taken Muggles Studies, which class do you think he took? I personally can't draw between one and the other. Also, anyone realised that Hermione and Malfoy probably had a class they shared without Harry and Ron? I'm surprised we haven't heard about it in the books. Although, it would be very in-character of Rowling of not considering the fact.


** Maybe both? He doesn't come across as unintelligent in canon, just arrogant and whiny...

Then again, he's nowhere near impressive to catch Slughorn's eyes in HBP (but I'm sure that has something more to do with his father's imprisonment).

I'd say if anything, Malfoy probably took Arithmancy over Ancient Runes unless Runes was a passion project - Arithmancy probably has more practical value for him.

Edited for typos from being on the phone.

*** Oh, can you not only take two? Harry and Ron only take Div and Care. Agreed on Arithmancy. Seems to be more the practical choice

**** I'm sure you could! I think you can take as many classes as you'd like, with either a time turner or independent study.

However, iirc, Arithmancy was at the same time as divination for the Gryffindors, and I think that was the case with Ancient Runes, too... But I'd have to check the book or HP wiki to confirm that.

If that was the case, I think Malfoy could only take one of he was in Care of Magical Creatures, too.

Then again, your story, your timetable lol!!
