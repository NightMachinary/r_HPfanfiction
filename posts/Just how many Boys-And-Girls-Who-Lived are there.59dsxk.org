So I had an odd thought again...actually, it's not that odd at all; what if Harry Potter weren't the only Boy-Who-Lived?

To be precise; canon-wise, Harry survived Voldemort's killing curse because of the deliberate sacrifice his mother made. But there are also other orphans (living with relatives) that we encounter throughout the course of the books.

We know that, for example, Neville Longbottom escaped a Death Eater attack on his parents, though said parents were tortured into insanity rather than being killed outright.

And Susan Bones's +parents are dead+^{My} ^{mistake,} ^{everyone} (and she's in Harry's year), so it can be assumed that she was born before the fall of Voldemort and possibly that +her parents died protecting her+^{I} ^{thought} ^{Edgar} ^{Bones} ^{was} ^{her} ^{dad,} ^{not} ^{her} ^{uncle.}

Has anybody run with the idea that:

- Anyone can use self-sacrificing magic, not just Lily Potter nee Evans?

- Many of the orphaned students attending Hogwarts are alive because of such sacrificial magic, and have blood protection (and all of the crazy fanficcy powers that come with it) like Harry's?

- Harry Potter's case is only notable because his mother's sacrifice not only a) reflected a Killing Curse onto their attacker, b) that attacker was Voldemort?


** There are some specific circumstances behind this event. It's significant that Lily could live if she just allowed Voldemort to kill Harry. Yet, she repeatedly refused. It's her choice that's important here.

  JKR: [silence] Can't tell you. But he did offer, you're absolutely right. Don't you want to ask me why James's death didn't protect Lily and Harry? There's your answer, you've just answered your own question, because she could have lived and chose to die. James was going to be killed anyway. Do you see what I mean? I'm not saying James wasn't ready to; he died trying to protect his family but he was going to be murdered anyway. He had no - he wasn't given a choice, so he rushed into it in a kind of animal way, I think there are distinctions in courage. James was immensely brave. But the caliber of Lily's bravery was, I think in this instance, higher because she could have saved herself. Now any mother, any normal mother would have done what Lily did. So in that sense her courage too was of an animal quality but she was given time to choose. James wasn't. It's like an intruder entering your house, isn't it? You would instinctively rush them. But if in cold blood you were told, "Get out of the way," you know, what would you do? I mean, I don't think any mother would stand aside from their child. But does that answer it? She did very consciously lay down her life. She had a clear choice -

  ES: And James didn't.

  JKR: Did he clearly die to try and protect Harry specifically given a clear choice? No. It's a subtle distinction and there's slightly more to it than that but that's most of the answer.

  MA: Did she know anything about the possible effect of standing in front of Harry?

  JKR: No - because as I've tried to make clear in the series, it never happened before. No one ever survived before. And no one, therefore, knew that could happen.

  MA: So no one - Voldemort or anyone using Avada Kedavra - ever gave someone a choice and then they took that option [to die] -

  JKR: They may have been given a choice, but not in that particular way.

  And Susan Bones's parents are dead
#+end_quote

We don't know that. Or to be precise, they probably are alive in the books timeframe.

Her uncle Edgar along with his immediate family died in the first Voldemort's rebellion ("That's Edgar Bones ... brother of Amelia Bones, they got him and his family, too, he was a great wizard" ~OoTP). She almost certainly didn't live with her aunt Amelia ("Our newspapers. Amelia Bones ... it just said she was a middle-aged woman who lived alone. It was a -- a nasty killing, wasn't it? It's had rather a lot of publicity. The police are baffled, you see." ~HBP). So she either had some other close family, or as is more probable, lived with her parents who were never indicated as dead.

The problem with the 'Voldemort offered to spare Lily and she refused' concept, though, is that it relies on Voldemort having enough honor to offer to spare Lily in the first place. It essentially punishes Voldemort for showing a morsel of humanity; if he had just gone and killed Lily without giving her a chance to surrender, he could have taken over the entire wizarding world easily.

Instead, he was blown to bits and ended up on the brink of death for the next 15 or so years, before getting to try and take over the world again, before being blown apart and sent to limbo for eternity. Considering the predicted alternative, that's a poor reward for offering to spare someone's life.

****** Yes, you are misunderstanding. It was not a punishment for offering to spare her life. It was a punishment for offering a “you or him” deal in a way and then trying to claim both.

The deal itself was not what made him lose (although, in a round-about way, it was); what was instead was the fact that he forgot that “trade your life for another's” deals can go both ways. He'd offered her a chance to trade her life for Harry's, and that she did, only it was the opposite of the answer he'd wanted, and that he immediately discarded her actions was the reason for his downfall.

******* I dunno...I think that the deal offered by Voldemort was more along the lines of 'I'm going to kill your son, do you want to die as well? y/n' rather than 'Should I kill you or your son?'.

That said, considering that Harry can be forced to compete in the Triwizard Tournament without his consent, I can see 'Lily tricks Voldemort into accepting a binding magical contract to take her life instead of Harry's'.

- Voldemort: My Dark Lord uses Avada Kedavra again to banish your Chosen One.

- Lily Evans: Hah! You've just activated my trap card, Unforgiving Interdict!

- (Unforgiving Interdict: Activates when a creature card uses the same move on two consecutive turns. Turns the effect of the move back on the creature.)

- Voldemort: Noo! You made my Dark Lord destroy himself!

- Lily Evans: ~smug look~

You are seeing it wrong, then. It wasn't an “I will kill your son, and maybe you too” thing (1 up to 2); rather, what it was was “I will kill your son, I will not kill you; step aside” (1 and just 1). It's a fairly important distinction because what Lily did was trade the mercy for /her/ for mercy for her son (which only works if she was sure to stay alive otherwise), and in taking it back he broke the deal he made. Did that count as a contract? Maybe, maybe not, but we do know it worked because of that distinction.

Of course we do know he would have interfered the moment she didn't step aside. But as far as magic cared he gave mercy and then took it back once the deal was struck.

That said, the thing about the Triwizard Tournament, as convoluted and unlikely as it might or might not have been, has no bearing on the whole “Lily's sacrifice” thing. Also, Harry did write his name himself, willingly, it's just that he did it for an essay for Defence Against Dark Arts and from that essay Junior tore a strip with Harry's name and put it into the goblet. While I don't necessarily agree with the whole “binding contract” thing about it (though it is canon that one can enter one without meaning to) as we do know that Dumbledore pushed him so that Moody would be able to investigate and Bagman pushed him because he is a gambling loser but we do not know whether or not the goblet would have actually done anything to him, his name was written willingly by him even if not thrown into the goblet knowingly.

PS. Yes, I agree, it would be a good name for a fanfic.

And yes, you did seem to imply that, whether intentional or not.

Now, I agree that views aren't enough... for normal people. But, as shown by Walburga and Wonderful and the Malfoys, wizards and witches aren't the smartest. They will go to hell and back to remove squibs, muggles, half-bloods, and muggle-borns.

Was he? I've last reread the books quite along ago, but I've got impression that he was basically nobody before he found about prophecy.

Nor are Potterverse muggles, or real people. But this sort of went off rails, even if they join purely because of their beliefs there is no reason to assume that Voldemort doesn't reward his followers.
