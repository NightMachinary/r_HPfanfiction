I think it would be cool if Harry found a book on Eldritch Deity Worship in a bookstore before coming to Hogwarts, and ends up becoming obsessed with the Old Gods, and recruits other students into a cult where they start with animal sacrifices before moving on to darker stuff

  (Dumbledore bashing! Lovecraft Lite!) Exploring the Dursleys' attic led Harry to discovering a few hard truths. His mother is alive and well. She has been imprisoned for years. Oh, and did we mention she's none other than the Crawling Chaos, Nyarlathotep? Watch out, Magical Britain! Sanity's going bye-bye with this Outer God and her son...

** you probably already know about it and it doesn't really fit the request because its demons not eldritch horrors(and also its Hermione not Harry. wow this doesn't fit the request at all lmao), but linkffn(Hermione Granger: Demonologist) is good.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

  Voldemort is small potatoes compared to the Great Old Ones, much to he and the rest of the HP crew's dismay.
