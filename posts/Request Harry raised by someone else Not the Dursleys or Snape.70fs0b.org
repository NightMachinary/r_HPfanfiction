Looking for stories where Harry is raised somewhere that's not the Dursley's, and not Snape either because I read a ton of fics on Harry being raised by Severus Snape. (I love them of course, but it's very likely that you'll be giving me a story I've already read with Snape raising Harry).

I'd also rather not have it be a cross over fic.

Any rating is fine, Would rather it be completed. Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash.

For instance: Harry raised by Weasley's, Harry raised by Sirius or Remus, Harry raised by Dumbledore or Minerva or other Hogwarts Professor (Not Snape of course), or say the Lovegoods or whatever you want. (Just as long as it's not cross over).


** "The Accidental Animagus": Harry is raised by the Grangers

"Growing Up Kneazle": Harry is raised by Kneazles, and later by Arabella Figg

  When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts.The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in.This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did.He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  An odd, dark-haired man rescues Harry from the Dursleys when he's nine years old. Harry would have been thrilled if his saviour didn't claim to be a disillusioned madman come back in time to stop his other self from taking over the world. Add to that his apparent belief that Harry is important to his plans, and things become just a little bit complicated.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

** "Harry Crow" - Harry is raised by goblins.

One of the first fics I ever read. It drags on in the middle, but overall decent story. My only complaint would be that it is a little too long. If you have read anything by robst then you'll be familiar with the writing style. I soldiered through this because I had never read anything like it. It's one of the top stories on ffn

Linkffn(8186071)

I reread it recently and it isn't as good the second time, but you may find it interesting.
