alright so i wanna read a fic featuring a war-like AU and after some research i've found these 3 fics that seem to appeal to my interest. Now i've been having trouble finishing stories since well, i just can't find ones worth reading and i really wanna know if any of these 3 are worth spending time with as i've already wasted enough. So kindly let me know what i'm in for in each fic and if putting spoilers help then i can allow them if they don't change the experience much. Oh and do tell about the romance (if any) as i primarily read romance and how badass/powerful harry(because preference) in each fic.

Here are the 3 fics

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] I'm worried this story will be more politics/scheming than actual magical battles/wars. Nothing wrong with Politics and i'd like there to be tactical ingenuity to some extent but i'm leaning towards the war aspect of things.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] I'm not entirely sure this is even a war-like AU but i'm interested in the whole "Voldemort-mentors-harry" thing. Plus 1.2 million words seems overwhelming so i wanna worth if most of the fic delivers or is there a certain point of the story where it becomes worthy of the time spent.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2980054/1/][The Resistance of Azkaban]] just tell me what you think of it and what i'm in for when i start reading it.

Your responses are deeply appreciated.


** I can't tell you anything about Resistance. I have issues with Emperor: how it takes apart the Wizarding World, heavy muggle vs wizards themes, interpretation of magic... As has been pointed many times, it would be better as original fiction, with HP elements swapped out for an original magic system. It also gets bogged down in warfare, with OCs that I personally dislike (with the exception of Petrovsky, cuz he's funny) and long, detailed scenes of combat that quickly start blending with each other. There are some that are good - those are the ones featuring Harry. Emperor also features infodumps and the prose is... workmanlike. It does what it needs to do, but there are scenes that could use more awe, which the author struggles with. Overall, I liked it very much at the beginning, today I'd rate it 3/5. Also, the update rate is atrocious, not helped by the author's two other ongoing fics.

POTDK, is one of the best fics in fandom. It has the best Voldemort. It has the best Snape. It reinterprets HP in some very interesting and creative ways. Don't be put off by the wordcount, It's pretty much seven fics posted as one. Romance is scarce and Harry's development into a badass is slow and well-realized. You won't find fast-delivered wish fulfillment here. It's not without its faults and I've no doubt forgotten some of them (been a while since I last looked at it), but it's very good. Unfortunately, it's abandoned.

** Prince of the Dark Kingdom /gets/ very war-like, without some of the ridiculousness of Emperor, which has a more long-term scale to it (I believe).

I would say go with Resistance because it is the only one of those complete. I have read it, but I don't really recall it too well, other than the main cast is Hard.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom is abandoned, and Emperor has super slow updates.

EDIT: They're all worth reading, though I gave up on Dark Kingdom near the end, and Emperor gets sloggy at parts.

**** It got bogged down and became a slog to get through at one point for me.

** It's interesting to see so many people leaping to defend potdk. I normally see it described as "that fix I gave up reading because it gets super weird". Maybe I'll have to take a look.
