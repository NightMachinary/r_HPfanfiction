This may seem like a jerk move, but there's someone on fanfiction.net that freely admits to reposting some random fic they saw in AFF. No indication that they have permission or who the original author actually is. Maybe this is a jerk move, but can you guys leave reviews explaining that this is not OK? I'd be pissed if anyone did this to me. Link below.\\

** While I understand that it is annoying but if they announce that it is in fact, someone elses work, how is that any different than when people save stories before they are taken down and send people the files? There are tons of old stories that are not on websites anymore but still get passed around for interested readers. EDIT: I fully believe that credit should be given to the actual author but many times, authors are no longer around to ask permission. I just don't see how increasing a stories exposure is a bad thing

*** I agree with [[/u/Kazeto][u/Kazeto]]. But I'd take it a step further. If you saved it for yourself, and wanted to repost it but couldn't contact the author, then ideally I would like to see some acknowledgment of that. Or like you said, at least give credit to the original author. Just don't pass around a complete product as if you came up with the idea and executed it.

*** For one, it sets a precedent. If you saved the story for yourself and then reposted it after the original went down and there was no way of contacting the author, that is fine. But when the original is still there and accessible, even with a notification copy-pasting the whole thing rather than simply linking to it is bad form; especially when so many people will still attribute the story to the person who'd reposted it, despite the story summary stating that it is not not their work.

For two, this particular piece of ... something, seems to be smut, and that is not allowed on that particular site. And while I disagree with their somewhat weird decisions about mature content and censorship in general, straight-out smut just does not belong there and with that I can and will agree.

***** And I had actually found it after a quick exercise with google, prior to posting my previous comment.

Tentatively, for though I do not see this link as being against the rules I don't really like the fact that I am posting it, here is the link:

[[http://reversathon.livejournal.com/42866.html]]

I'd spent some more time searching and it appears that this particular author has a history of posting stories on reversathon, whatever that actually happens to be, so this may very well be /the/ original post. So no matter how much I don't want to be rude, it still goes to the original point; and there's still the fact that the story is smut and as such has no place on the site it got posted on (that being fanfiction.net).

** Here's a link to ffn's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/support/][support page]] where it explains how to report things like this. It's not a jerk move to report them for this.
