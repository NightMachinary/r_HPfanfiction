For a long time iv had this idea for a shipping fic iv wanted to do.

Where Harry was taught music at primary school before Hogwarts to try and wash away the "Freakishness" and brings that love of music to Hogwarts. Every night he would sit at the window of the Gryffindor common room and play a piece and sing to the night sky to relax from the day. And from 2nd year on someone joins him from across the castle, slowly building up across a few years until the two finally meet.

It discourages me a little as i have never seen anything in the written form that places emphasis on Music that wasnt just "lol random sappy pop song Ginny sings about her and Harry". Any good reccomendations you could give me? or any advice on where to start with this fic?


** I've read one where music was a branch of magic taught at Hogwarts. Many years ago on ff.net not sure if it's still there. I remember that in this fic Hogwarts anthem was not just some stupid song but the thing that made wards so strong strengthening them year after year.

** Music is a big part of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3634826/1/Volunteers][Volunteers and the sequel Ember to Ember]]. In this fic Harry's son (written pre-DH so no canon kids) is a music prodigy and Draco is a music teacher and choir director. Music is a large part of the story but doesn't drive the plot. It's really well done and a great fic. Linkffn(3634826)

** I'm not sure if there's much of anything, fanfiction or not, with music as a central /theme./ As a central element, yes, but as a theme, I'm not really aware of anything off the top of my head where the narrative was aimed at saying something about music, rather than using musical elements in the story to convey the themes of the story.

From the way you described your story idea, it seems you're after fanfiction that utilizes music as a central element, not theme, as such. One story off the top of my head that seemed to do so decently is Krahae's /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536939/1/Ganymede-Rising][Ganymede Rising]]/ | linkffn(5536939).

As the description suggests, it's a take on the indy!Harry genre of sorts, but Harry doesn't go out shopping at Diagon or meeting up with goblins or sticking it to Dumbledore or anything like that. Outwardly, a summer romance story between Harry and an OC who is a beginning and unsure musician. Intended to be a twoshot / threeshot, but the lone chapter that exists is fairly complete as it is, in terms of the narrative arc traced out by the story. Worth a read I think.

  A slightly different take on indy!Harry. A summer vacation leads Harry to do some exploring someplace not so far afield. Sixteen, bored, and faced with the newest threat to his sanity - the cute waitress. Music and a little mayhem. Post 5th, slight AU.

** I really like Lay Me Low although it's not music so much as one particular song that holds significance throughout the story. Definitely read the authors note for the first chapter. Linkffn(10421274)

  What begins as Severus' anger at Sirius Black's attempts to seduce Hermione leads to a life he never thought he deserved to live. The past and the present mesh together in a story of protection, betrayal and trust, and how the Battle of Hogwarts might have been fought. Rated MA for tender sensibilities.
