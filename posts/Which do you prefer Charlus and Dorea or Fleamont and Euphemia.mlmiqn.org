Or both, because both could technically exist?


** The latter. For one, I prefer the names and I like it when there isn't such an obvious relation between Sirius and James. I enjoy it when they're the /Potters/, this poitioneering small family, who took in a Black and not because James' Mum is one. It would just feel unearned because you could argue it's far more easier to take in family.

Though I think it is fun when authors explore the Potter Family and add Charlus und Dorea as an Aunt and Uncle of James.

*** I do really like the possibility they could be aunt and uncle. It would make the family feel more fleshed out and real, rather than just a succession of each generation having 1 son each. Especially for the time big families were so much more common, after a certain point (going back up the family tree) it begins to feel weird that Harry doesn't have /any/ relatives

** Fleamont is such an adorable name! I really appreciate JKR's humor here, as she even stated that "Fleamont became a great duelist because so many made fun of his name".

I don't like James and Harry to be that closely related to the Black family. Even though I don't mind third cousin marriages, I prefer to see Harry and Ginny only very very distantly related. (For those who don't know yet, Ginny's grandma is Cedrella Black)

Of course, Charlus and Dorea can perfectly coexist with Fleamont and Euphemia. Dorea would just be Harry's great aunt then.

** Pretty much every Potter not named Harry is a very vague blank slate with at max a few personality traits thrown in, so I'd say you can safely do a coin-toss. I personally like to see Fleamont/Euphemia and tend to really enjoy the Fanon depictions of Fleamont even more than the Fanon depictions of Charlus, but when you need a Black family connection or you just aren't feeling like acknowledging the ridiculousness of Fleamont's name then Charlus/Dorea are the obvious pick.

#+begin_quote
  MA: What about Harry's family --- his grandparents --- were they killed?

  JKR: No. This takes us into more mundane territory. As a writer, it was more interesting, plot-wise, if Harry was completely alone. So I rather ruthlessly disposed of his entire family apart from Aunt Petunia. I mean, James and Lily are massively important to the plot, of course, but the grandparents? No. And, because I do like my backstory: Petunia and Lily's parents, normal Muggle death. *James's parents were elderly, were getting on a little when he was born*, which explains the only child, very pampered, had-him-late-in-life-so-he's-an-extra-treasure, as often happens, I think. *They were old in wizarding terms*, and they died. They succumbed to a wizarding illness. That's as far as it goes. There's nothing serious or sinister about those deaths. I just needed them out of the way so I killed them.

"Old in wizarding terms" seems more like in the 100s than 40. Which would make James' birth a kind of freaky event, like the birth of John the Baptist to Elizabeth in the Bible.

Fleamont and Euphemia feel like real people, and real grandparents especially. I can see Fleamont puttering around his potions lab, tinkering and tweaking different potions he's inventing. I can see him with knobbly knees like Harry's.

Even if you want to write a story with pure blood aristocracy Fleamont and Euphemia are still much more interesting to me. It becomes a story not about a family that's on the same level as the others. I don't want to read about how Harry is the richest person in Britain.

I've never seen it as cheapening their relationship, but more emphasizing how everyone in the Wizarding World is related in a disturbingly close fashion.

Sort of like how Ron was horrified he was related to the Malfoys, but Harry was much closer related by marriage.

But other than that, the family dynamics (and it being almost a precursor to Ted and Andromeda) always seemed really interesting. There's nothing more heated than family drama lol.

**** Yeah, so basically JKR said (probably on Pottermore, before the Fleamont/Euphemia thing), that the Potters were an old pureblood family that basically had a surname too common to be included in the Sacred Twenty-Eight. Like, /old/ old pureblood family, as the first Potter's son married Iolanthe Peverell, the granddaughter of Ignotus Peverell.

So, having all of that set up, it just really doesn't make sense to me to have a wizard named Henry name his son Fleamont, even with the Fleamont backstory. Like, Henry as a pureblood name I can accept, Fleamont I could even accept, but not both. Both names just seem a little too Muggle-like for a pureblood family that is as old and traditional (inferring from it not being said they married halfbloods, like the Malfoys) as the Potter family was said to be, at least for me.

** I love Charlus and Dorea, and by extension Arcturus. I think it was in Honor Thy Blood that I was first introduced to them, and how they fought against Grindelwald. By having another good Black, it shows that Walburga is the nutter, and not necessarily the entire Black family, and that Toujours Pur can refer to pure intentions, or magic, and not blood.

When I see Fleamont, I picture a frail, weak man who ignores the world and buries himself in potions. It just doesn't fit in my head that James and Harry could come from such a person. Charlus on the otherhand is a war hero and nearly beats Grindelwald in almost every story I have read that has him in it, same with Arcturus. You can really see Harry in Charlus, well, the other way around but you know what I mean. Harry hates potions, to have his grandfather be a Potioneer is sad.

As for Euphemia, all I picture is a brunette Narcissa. A loving mother, but basically just a housewife. Dorea though, she's a friggin QUEEN. Powerful, sharp, witty, and able to end battles with a single look. Of the two pairs, Charlus and Dorea just cement a certain amount of character and power in my mind, while the Flea and Euphemism are just so... lacking.

We see that James and Harry stand up for what is right, and to have their parents/grandparents do the same by fighting against Grindelwald has a certain familial warmth to it. I'm not explaining it well... it's just nice for Harry to share more than just his looks with his family.

It also would explain why Voldy went after James' parents. If Charlus nearly defeated Grindelwald, Tom would not let him live. But why in the world would he go after the inventor of Sleekeazy's? I can think of a few reasons, but it's cool to think that even in their old age, they posed a threat. Meanwhile in canon, Flea and Euphemism get clapped by dragon pox.

I guess Dorea and Charlus have a better characterization and depth than Fleamont and Euphemia.

And on a side note, where the heck does Fleamont come from? Every first born character in HP shares their middle name with their father. Harry James, Neville Frank, Draco Lucius, even Severus Tobias. But it's James Charlus, not James Fleamont. They make a pattern with names and then throw it away! It hurts my ocd...

*** Well firstly, Fleamont's grandmother's maiden name was Fleamont, and she was the last of her family, so she asked that her grandson be named after her family. It used to be common enough to do. Fleamont, on the other hand, hated his name, and JK states that he became a talented dueler because of it. So yeah, just like Snape and Slughorn, and even Lily herself, being a potioneer doesn't mean you're untalented and can't fight.

Secondly...James Charlus is fanon, back when Charlus and Dorea were the only other Potters we knew about. It's not his real name. Personally, I think he's James Henry, after his grandfather. Neville Frank and Severus Tobias are also fanon.

Thirdly, Draco's grandfather also died of dragonpox.

Fourthly, those are all fanon personalities. Fleamont and Euphemia had James so late in life, you can literally create whatever you want out of their lives. Just like that author did regarding Charlus dueling Grindelwald, and Dorea being...glarey.

** Charlus and Dorea, as names, sound better to me than the other two. However, with how much of a blank slate they all are, that's basically the extent of how much goes into my thinking.

** It depends on the story. For example, in a time travel ff to the 1940's, I prefer Charlus and Dorea if only for the fact that it would be fun to write how they got married despite light v. black between the two families. also, if you put harry in Slytherin, maybe he could actually talk to Dorea without it being suspicious. I like Fleamont and Euphemia for Marauders Era stories, because as probably said in the comments somewhere, having James' mum be a Black kind of downplays how much she loved Sirius as her own son. Think about it, if Dorea was James' mum then it might look like she just took him in because he was a family relation.
