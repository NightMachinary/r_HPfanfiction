The idea is that James is their loved and spoiled prince and Lily put him down, rejected him and insulted him for years and they are just not sure if she deserves their son.

I prefer no bashing of any characters and want Lily and James to stay together


** Oh that could be a cool twist! I don't read Marauder era fics but that sounds interesting

*** I like Marauder stories, but for some reason James' parents are never described in ways that make me think that, yes, of course, James was a little spoiled brat first and those are the people that spoiled him. I mean, they don't need to be Dursley level of spoiled, but I want people that make me think James is the apple of their eye

**** I think it's canon that his parents had him late in life? That could factor into spoiling him I think

** How do you "not bash" characters that have less than two whole sentences in the entire series, none of which we can be sure are real? Anyone making fics with them has to basically create the characters, and do so based on the /opinions/ (not facts) of others.

You better just say what type of James and Lily you want. Less drama that way.
