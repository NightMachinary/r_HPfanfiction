Is it canon or fanon that Flitwick was born from a human and a goblin? I would like to read a story about an /adult/over-seventeen years old/ Harry getting into a relationship with a goblin woman or man, thank you. :)


** I second this request. Could be interesting.

Further, does anyone have any stories where Harry ends up feeling for any non-human? Besides Veela - that's too easy.

*** GRIMMY! :) Yes there needs to be WAY MORE human-nonhuman relationships going on! I mean it is a fantasy world for crying out loud, where is the DIVERSITY?! Why is it THERE if nobody's going to USE IT? You know? :( Branch out, take some risks, put Harry with a giant girl, or at LEAST a half-giant ala Hagrid, or a troll lady, or a goblin or a mermaid or something! It might as well not be a fantasy world at all given the nonexistent interactions there is between species!

***** Oh Grimmy! It depends what kind of mermaid, and also maybe headcanons on how genetics get distributed/influence the halfling. :) It could be that the mermaid's scale colors are determined by the human parent's hair color, or the mermaid has the human parent's facial features but with like gills and webbed limbs and stuff. :) I personally used the first bit for my headcanon on halfling children of harpies/human partners, but with feathers instead of scales. :)

** I've seem it happen in Harem fics a few times, but its been a long time since I've read one.

Considering their are selkie, acromantula, and house elves on school grounds I think the fandom has a surprising dislike of non-humans.
