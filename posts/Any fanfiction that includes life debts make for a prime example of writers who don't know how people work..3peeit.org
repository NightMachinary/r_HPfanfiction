** Depends what you mean by life debt. If taken to mean a serious (but not magically binding) debt of honor in the context of a highly conservative semi-feudalistic patronage-based wizarding society then it can work very well. If taken to mean a magically binding obligation, well there's precedent for that conceptually in the canon magic system (goblet of fire for instance) but I would say it's usually a lazy plot device.

** Including life debts in a summary seems rather weird, seeing as they are canon (even if JKR used it in a weird way). Pettigrew owed one to Harry. And seeing that Pettigrew was an honorless traitor, it was most likely magically binding too. Though it's not "dedicated for life", as I remember it, but "until repaid".

*** If I'm not mistaken, Dumbledore uses the label "wizard's debt." That doesn't imply that you necessarily owe your life to them, nor that you'll lose your life if you fail to honor it. It's just... a debt. Well, it's a /magical/ debt of some sort.

The implication is that magic will somehow move a person to honor the debt. Somehow.

Yeah, pretty vague, I know, but then again that's true about a lot of things in JKR's magic system. And that's a good thing, too, because it gives the rest of us more to write about. So long as you don't fill the concept with something that ridiculously contrary to canon, it still arguably within the boundaries of canon.

Now that's uncalled for. If the summary refers to her as "ice queen" then there is an issue. But using DG as a primary character is ok in itself. She's basically an OC in any fic, because besides her name and house there's nothing else we know.

Agreed. It all tends to go that way. I'm calling it the "if only" syndrome where Harry having a different girlfriend changes everything: Harry was just one step away from getting the life he deserves and being able to steamroll Voldemort if only...

- ...he dated Daphne Greengrass. His Slytherin side would flourish, pureblood connections and etiquette would develop and libraries of deep magic would open up. Voldemort never stood a chance.

- ...he dated Luna Lovegood. Excessive pluck and funky strangeness leave Voldemort off balance and the Lovegood's posses a wealth of esoteric magic. If nothing else, just send the Snorkaks after Voldemort.

- ...he dated Susan Bones. He would quickly have protection, training and support of law enforcement, new spells and tactics gallore. Scarcrux would be detected, Dursley's get their commupence and Dumbledore is shown to be an old coot. Voldemort never stood a chance.

- ...he dated Cho Chang. He would have....wait, barely anyone writes HP/CC stories? Don't they realize it takes much more suspension of disbelief and convoluted plots to get to Harry/Daphne than Harry/Cho?

***** I think Cho suffers from what I call "Varsity Head Cheerleader Syndrome". She's the older popular attractive girl who seems to have everything going for her and from a distance any guy would find her attractive. Then you finally get to know her and she's not as perfect as she seemed and the image you had of her shatters. Sometimes you find an actually decent person underneath that original image but in Cho's case we found a shallow, overly emotional, gossip that was basically the farthest thing from what Harry needed.

Very true, it's a possibility. But so many fics turn people around who we know to be patently unpleasant (Snape, Draco, Voldemort even) so why not Cho? It wouldn't take much doing. More popular characters could be cast in a similar light: Daphne could be indifferent, amoral, fence-sitting and opportunist, not someone to confide in, trust or fall for. If so many fics can work around those hefty negative why not work around Cho's snobbishness? EDIT: I just think she deserves more of a chance.

******* She does deserve a chance but when it comes to characters like Snape/Draco/Voldemort there's either redeeming characteristics for the first two or just a desire to understand how someone could become that evil. With Cho she's just neutrally unlikable. That sounds weird but basically she's just a character who is neither a hero or a villain she's just a normal teenage girl among a cast of abnormal teenagers so there's very little to make her stand out.

Hermione has brains, Ginny has being Ginny, Luna is quirky, Daphne and Susan are barely shown in canon so they're popular girls outside of Gryffindor that the author can shape into what they need them to be. Cho is established as an emotional, slightly shallow, popular girl and that doesn't give the author much to work with.

A good author could probably shape her into a likable character (she did come back in DH to fight at Hogwarts), but a slim minority considers her a good match for Harry. I've seen her written really well in Cedric lived fics because the author usually just leaves her attached to him and lets her grow into a good friend for Harry.

They do share a couple of facial features. They have similar chins, similar shade of red hair, very similar blue eyes. . . (blue eyes? stupid lazy directors) and their facial structures are not that dissimilar. She looks more like a sister of Lily Potter than Petunia ever did.

****** As someone below pointed out..... turns out it was you. Hmmm, I am going to continue as if it wasn't.

As someone below pointed out, Cho's biggest problem is that her archetype is that of a typical teenage girl. Who just happened to have her boyfriend die at school. There is a lot of potential there, but it takes a really good author to emphasize that something normal can be wonderful as opposed to accenting something that is special already.

This is one of my big issues in writing in general, a lot of stories have a subplot of the main character wanting to just be a normal person, yet they refuse to do normal things or have normal friends. This is especially bad in Harry-Centric fanfiction, don't get me wrong, Harry is special, he needs to do the things he does to survive, but when authors try to make Harry strive for normalcy, they rarely actually have him interact with anyone normal.

Cho would make a wonderful normal girlfriend who Harry is with for a few years, they fight and bicker over dumb things, she doesn't like dealing with all his hero drama, he can't find himself to care about her normal drama. They share sweet tender moments of a quick kiss in the hallways, a study session in the library, a quick pickup game on the pitch. She is a year older so during the 7th year you could have her at work, him at school, or him on the hunt worrying about her. Maybe he visits and puts her family in danger? Maybe the life styles are too different and they break up, to re-unite later when they both are more mature. Or, more likely they fall in love and break up a year or so down the line, maybe they become friends again, maybe not.

Sorry for the rant, my point is that the reason most people dismiss her, is the same reason I think she has a lot of potential.

** Life debts are an interesting concept if they're magically bonding, and society reacts accordingly- i.e. magic knows when you rigged it, maybe, and only triggers for death that would have definitely happened otherwise. I would also require backing out be an option- it just costs you your magic, or even something less than that. not your children's, just yours, but it does cost you yours. It's not repay them or die, it's repay them or pay the fee. I'd mention somewhere that the malfoy-weasely feud began with a life debt incident, triggered accidentally, or some similar bit of history that could fit in the background, that doesn't ring too far false

They're less interesting if they're part of society that people feel obligated to act on, since that means it's just obligation asking, with less hard feelings, potential for abuse, or resentment.

** I don't pretend to understand the appeal either; there's potential in that place, but many a writer just use it to skip from what is a life debt to a soul bond and from there to a lazy attempt at romance that has no actual romance but just people being together because “because”.

But life debts do exist in the original story, and they do make sense in the setting because it's an archaic and secular society that still holds such concepts as “honour” on the pedestal. Is there anything inherently magical in it? Honestly, I do not know; on one hand one could say that yes, there is, because Peter Pettigrew had been stopped by his life debt and Dumbledore calls it a “wizard's debt”; but on the other hand, once such a thing had been a concept so ingrained that even a scoundrel, all but the worst of people, would try to pay a life debt if owed, and Dumbledore too has a tendency to use words that segregate muggles and wizards even if he does try not to.

In any case, it's a one-time thing. For a life saved, one demand, possibly of saving the saver's life, or possibly of obedience of the one being saved. On one's honour, one's self, as a person or as a wizard. That is a life debt.
