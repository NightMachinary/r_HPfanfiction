I am fine with AUs, no slash please if its the center focus. Minor sideplot slash is okay. Please no WBWL.

Specifically, I am looking for fics where the MC is proactive and cunning. Doesn't necessarily have to be about politics. I just want to read a story where the MC uses the brain to get ahead. Bonus points if they are charismatic and attractive.

  Grace wants a broomstick like James, she wants an owl like James, and, most of all, she wants to go to Hogwarts like James.

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE. A/N: Slytherin-Harry.
