****** Yes, I am sure this sentence will most truly prevent minors from playing. I heard these sentences work wonders at porn sites. /s

** Why not 16+? In most of the US that is the age of consent (which would make more sense in a school setting).

Or maybe even 15+ for Europe (Germany, Italy, Serbia, Albania, Austria, Estonia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Portugal, Macedonia, Montenegro, San Marino, Liechtenstein, Bosnia, Heregovina, France, Greece, Monako, Poland, Sweden, Croatia, Denmark, Iceland, Romania, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic)

  Dark Arts
#+end_quote

Shouldn't it be Defence Against the Dark Arts? This is Hogwarts correct? Or is it Durmstrang?

Any reason why it's DA instead of DADA?

NVM got it. It's suuuuper cool, and /Dark/.

#+begin_quote
  Muggles Studies
#+end_quote

So is it gonna be about Muggles (Doubt it's interesting), mugglewank or Muggles are super evil barbarians/muggles are dangerous, so they must die?

#+begin_quote
  Divinition
#+end_quote

I struggle to see how that could be interesting in any way.

#+begin_quote
  Librarian
#+end_quote

Same as the Divination.

#+begin_quote
  *No real characters*, all made up by you.

  Write at least a paragraph for background, your personality, Kinklist and a *picture*.
#+end_quote

No words.

#+begin_quote
  Give the Sorting Hat something he can work with.
#+end_quote

Why would he need any of this? Excerpt for personality.

BTW how is this dark?

#+begin_quote
  Right now Hufflepuff is leading the Points System and Slytherin has a lot of people so... please, consider joining the other Houses!
#+end_quote

BUT YOU JUST MADE THIS. HOW ARE THEY IN A LEAD?
