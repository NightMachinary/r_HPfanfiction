I'm looking for long, well written romance stories with lemon scenes throughout. Preferably with a competent Harry and without a Harry-Ginny pairing. Maybe a story where Harry is raised by Sirius. Thanks in advance for the recommendations


** [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185][Forever Knight]] is kind of what you're looking for. Harmony with explicit scenes and a competent Harry. Its AU divergence point is the summer between HBP and DH, so no Sirius. Canon personalities for all characters, though the story itself can be dark in places.
