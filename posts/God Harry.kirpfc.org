That abomination has a sequel??? I'll hand it to the author, he writes because he wants to write despite what anyone else thinks and I do find that kind of tenacity admirable. But still, wow! And that's coming from someone who enjoyed HPMOR, My immortal and other things that almost everyone finds awful (although I'm not sure if my immortal counts as proof because my enjoyment of it was marveling at how terrible it was in terms of plot, execution, grammar, and maturity in the authors notes)

*** The first sequel was in game of thrones and was honestly kinda shitty too. Loads of weird messages and somewhat edgy too. But the newest sequel is in WoW and is pretty decent, a lot less obscure political messages and more actual story, it helps that Harry has already been a god so he doesn't re-tread that path.

****** Some people find harry annoyingly preachy and Mary Sue and don't give the story enough time to see his cockiness bite him in the butt, others just don't like it because of the amount of author tract and how much it tries to give lectures to the readers. others simply don't connect with the story and that is that.

******** Nope. I read it, I enjoyed it and I don't think there was anything like that in it. In my opinion, it was a well-written fic. Harry was mostly rational, and he's a pseudo-scientist, smart, but cocky and arrogant in the beginning. Later, it bites him in the ass. Hard. It delivers plot twists well. It explores some pretty interesting topics and philosophy. I can see how some might not enjoy that though.
