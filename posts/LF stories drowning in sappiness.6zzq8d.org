#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

** This one is definitely fluffy enough, although it's not particularly great, and a bit of a canon rehash.

  "Good evening, Arthur." The patronus said, in Professor Dumbledore's voice. "I would greatly appreciate it if you and Molly were to meet me downstairs - I will be arriving shortly with someone I'd like you both meet." It was a little over twenty minutes later that the Weasley parents were introduced to a tiny five year old named Harry Potter.

  Harry had no idea why the boys in the Great Hall drooled over themselves as the students from Beuxbatons made their entrance, but he knew better than to let an opportunity slip. He hurriedly stole Ron's sandwich. It tasted gloriously.

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.

** I just came across these a few days ago. The user pottermom on ffnet has a lot of very fluffy stories featuring Harry/Ginny. I'll link one (you can just check the author for the others), but there are a LOT of stories I ended up adding. Deja Brew, which I didn't add, I'd also recommend, but it's not really fluffy (the very, very end kind of is). It's mostly angst, but I still liked it.

The ones that personally interested me were All the Girls; Cupcakes; Fort Grimmauld; For the Sins Against My Father; Fun Things To Do At Grimmauld Place; Ginny's Appetite; Harry and the Beanstalk; Great Expectations; Harry Goes Shopping; I'm with Stupid; Identity Crisis; Jealous Guy; In Sickness and In Health; Visiting Hagrid; Uncle Harry; Say, Cheese!; Relationship Goals; Teddy's Need; The Two Brothers; Perils of a Permanent Marker; Serendipity; Missing Moments; Always; A Man, a Boy and an Umbrella; and Clueless linkffn(10966494)
