** I've seen one where everyone was a time traveller except Harry himself... I'll have to look it up though, been a while since I read it.

Was a weird one, had Harry being all lonely because everyone was working at cross purposes to fight off the current war, leaving poor young Harry alone, doing his homework, and not really socialising with the highly motivated time travellers who act as if they know him so well they barely need to interact with him.

I think the author was depressed. I'll see if I have it bookmarked on my old phone in a bit.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
