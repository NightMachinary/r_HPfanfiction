*** Maybe he doesn't want them targeted immediately. Maybe he just feels the conditions aren't right. Maybe he feels prophecies are a load of bs. Maybe this one is a responsible Dumbledore who realizes it's a death sentence.

Most importantly it isn't a serious prompt.

*** Perhaps he thought it wasn't right to put parents at risk, let alone people who aren't even born yet to be in Danger? The Parents made an Oath, a Choice, something that is portrayed well in Book Seven.

Just food for thought

** I think the order of events to get to this point are rather obvious.

Dumbledore gets the prophecy and has to find the child it speaks of so Dumbledore starts inquiring about which female members of the order are pregnant/expecting. Turns out, it's all of them plus Sirius who managed to get himself pregnant while polyjuiced. Hilarity ensues

*** Yes, she would have been. For this prompt though, I'd imagine the idea is that the prophecy was given in late 1979 instead of early 1980.

**** You'd have to change the prophecy then. After all, it starts with "approaches". So the kid has to be on it's way in order for it to be given.

For morbid hillarity you could have Dumbles getting all order females pregnant at the time to get either an abortion or magic them into premature births so that no kid gets born in July

** The story would need to have one of the mudbloods' parents come in to explain "the pill" and "condoms", which, frankly given that they all start having children at 20 when they are going to live for at least 150 years, is probably a good thing for all wizard kind. Can you imagine having a child when have another 130 years to live?!!

**** Look, I'm all for Hermione being wrong in a fic (god knows there are way too many Mary-Sue Hermione fics). But calling someone a mudblood and saying it's justified is almost an exact analogy to racism, xenophobia, or antisemitism, depending on how you interpret muggleborns.

Rowling made very one dimensional house in Slytherin. In the books I never really saw a 'good' student. There was Andromeda Tonks, Slughorn, and in the movies Snape (I refuse to call him good in the books. He was fairly irredeemable).

Pureblood culture is never justified and frankly it's boring.

**** Exactly. Using that word is an instant downvote from me, as while it's a fantasy word, it's still expressing a racist sentiment. Even if one not targeted at a real group.

**** I think you're reading it wrong, I thought they meant it in a snarky way, like the purebloods wouldn't even know how to control pregnancies, and they'd have to get a muggle in to teach them because they're backwards and start pumping out kids at 20.

My issue with the comment is the assumption that wizards don't use birth control, despite the really small families, and that they all start really young, despite none of Harry's classmates parents being the same age as the Potters were...as far as we know.

***** I disagree. Quotation marks would make it snarky.

Lack of knowledge of birth control would definitely explain the Weasleys though.

****** I guess. That's just how I read it.

Annnd no it wouldn't, plenty of large families exist in the modern world who know about, and have access to birth control. A far more reasonable explanation is that they had their heart set on a girl. Given that they stopped having children, despite Molly still being perfectly viable, age wise. You only need to look up the Quiverfull movement to see how large a family two healthy parents can produce.
