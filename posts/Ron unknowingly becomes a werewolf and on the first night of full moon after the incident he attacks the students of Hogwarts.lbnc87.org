I remember the trio was trying to get some magical item and they were through a similar gauntlet to that from the first book that tests different abilities. Each one managed to solve one of the challenges but at the end they are attacked by the guardian of that item who was also a werewolf and he bites Ron. Also the guardian could break himself apart into venomous snakes and then reconstruct himself (kind of like the villain from Naruto) when hit by a spell. That's all I remember. Thank you for your help.
