Like using ancient words of power just so Slytherins can't watch them practice quidditch on the pitch. Or curse of eternal darkness on filch's cat so they can get a book from the library.


** /May, 1992/

Hermione: Harry, why are you levitating the Black Lake?

Harry: I lost my glasses so Fred and George are helping me look for them.

Hermione: Why not just summon them?

Harry: That's a Fourth Year spell, Hermione! How are they supposed to know that?

*** Tangent Rant: The fact that Summoning Spell is Fourth Year spell is such BS on the JKR's part. Harry and Co conveniently always learn spells just in year they need them for plot reasons, rather than in order that would make sense by effect complexity. Because Chekhov gun learning scenes help make up book's volume, instead of anyone from trio just recollecting that they learned necessary spell year earlier or before that.

**** The only time I've seen it actually be an actual Fourth Year spell in a fic is where it's a CONTENT AWARE summoning spell, where the activation object lets you grab specific objects (say, in a library system with tags for books, "accio books on dogs" would grab the books with the tags for info on dogs and bring them around corners to you).

***** Yeah, precise stuff like this probably worth Forth Year level, but simple attracting specific familiar object in not far distance should be on the same level as Levitation Spell. Especially if you consider the fact that they learn Alahamora in the first year, spell that literally opens mechanical non-magical locks without wizard even knowing anything about lock's internal construction!

****** Don't get me wrong, I love abstract magic that isn't just physics manipulation. One of my current projects has the seminal principle of warding magics being "door theory", the idea that magic becomes stronger if there's a way to bypass it. A wall is stronger if you add a door, the door is tougher if you add a lock, the lock becomes harder to pick if you hide the key in an accessible location. The gauntlet in Philo Stone wasn't a challenge to get through, it was a supercharging of that principle with long, tedious tasks so reinforcements could prep to take down invaders.

Anyways, "levitate an object to me" is only slightly more complicated than "levitate an object". Also absurd is how "remove something from someone's grip and send it to me" is covered before "bring this object to me".

**** Let's not get started on her ridiculously dull magic system and complete lack of imagination in that regard and focus on the fact it has allowed for fanfic writers so much room to work with.

*** So not long ago I happened upon a thought experiment about what would happen if an entire rain storm worth of water all fell out of the sky as a single massive drop. The short version is without magic it isn't possible, but ever since then all I could think of was using the lake for something similar to that in an OP Harry story. Would he kill the Merpeople that live in the lake and quite possibly himself in the process? Yep. Would he also manage to drown a dragon and look damn cool doing at the same time? Well isn't that the important thing really?

*** Yes, how dare Hermione assume Fred and George, who are fourth years, would know a spell taught near the beginning of fourth year.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
