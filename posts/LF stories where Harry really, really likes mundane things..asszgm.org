I'm not talking about boring stuff. I mean, stories where Harry packs a can opener and cans upon cans of food because canned food is convenient. Stories where Harry uses sensible stationary because it's easier to use than quills, inkwells and parchment. Stories where Harry rides a bicycle around the halls of Hogwarts because he can't fly a broom in a hallway.

So, if anybody has any of those to recommend, that'd that be great.

How is a bicycle convenient or easy to use in a castle with a dozen different levels, which are connected via stairways?

*** I live in a bicycling college town, so I literally see people ride their bicycles down stairs all the time, and if they need to go up stairs, they hop off, run up the steps, and hop back onto their bike.

***** Bike bells, and a reckless disregard for the safety of others for the sake of their own convenience. Plus, once it becomes his reputation, people will get the hell out of his way; nobody wants to get hit by a speeding bike or have their feet ran over.

***** True, true. Would still be great as a crack fic, I could see Fred or George trying it out, and the Professors reactions; lol.

"Nothing like this is against the rules; is it, professor" Fred asked, smiling sweetly at McGonagall.

"Well... no, but it's completely impractical! You can't use it on the stairs."

"Well we can always use it on one ground, it'll help us keep from being late." George said.

"I... I, don't think..." McGonagall sputtered.

"It's not against the rules!" Fred sing songed.

The next day, another educational decree was passed. Or Flitch added bicycles to the list of banned items. For it to work you need to up the "incompetent adult" trope even more. Or have the twins use a different form of transportation each day.

** I don't remember the name, but there was a fic where Harry was staying the Bones during the summer and went school supply shopping. Harry asked if they could go to a muggle office supply store. Amelia's like, "Sure, but why..." Harry introduces them to paper and pens. And it's so cheap!

#+begin_quote
  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
