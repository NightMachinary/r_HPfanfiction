-ritual/dark magic/wandless/powers type harry

-fluer and or luna love interest

*** There's also linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House). Technically it's meant to be a Slytherin Hermione, but she's more of an original character.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11280068/1/][*/The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5244847/Belial666][/Belial666/]]

#+begin_quote
  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** Yes I'm on the same boat. If you want a good fic with strong Harry I suggest Harry Potter and the Daft Morons, The Harem War, Rune Stone Path, Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, and King of Magic.

*** The reason I downvoted this is because it doesn't contribute to the conversation. All you did was insult the OP for having different preferences to you - which is a subjective matter, so no one's tastes should be judged "good" or "bad" without some further reason - and provide a recommendation with no explanation at all.

That kind of comment doesn't build a conversation, it just raises tempers and hurts feelings. If you're going to tell someone that they're wrong, then at a minimum, explain what the objective problem is.
