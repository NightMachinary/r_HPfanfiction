Well, actually, I'm looking for two fics. Can't remember which one had this title.

One was a Lily + Marauders reading the HP books in the RoR. I've seen a couple before but they always get deleted.

The other one had the same setting and characters, but they read excerpts from fanfictions about themselves. There was an ongoing joke, in which eyes (mainly Sirius' eyes) were described as ‘limpid tears' and ‘orbs', and the phrase ‘tongues battled for dominance' was regularly mocked. I looked for the fic ‘The Marauder's Companion' recently, but it's been deleted from ff.net. :/


** So the second one is definitely Marauders discover fanfiction by Coconut Banana, and the first one is on fiction hunt. sorry for format am on phone :(

*** I don't know if it's a reupload because I've never read a fic by that name before, but I've just checked a couple of the chapters and it's pretty much exactly what I was looking for! Thank you!!! I'm not sure what fictionhunt is but I'll look.
