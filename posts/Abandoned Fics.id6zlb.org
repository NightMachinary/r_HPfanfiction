Do you guys get extremely annoyed when you're reading something and it just gets abandoned abruptly?

Like the sheer number of abandoned fics on ff.net just pissed me off.


** I think 4 or 5 of my top 10 are abandoned.

That said, I typically read fanfiction for the creativity and worldbuilding, so unless the plot is really something special it doesn't affect me that much.

If the fic abandons at a logical point (at the end of a story arc) or after an initially high-stakes premise has devolved into a soap-opera-esque adventure, that's almost as good as complete for me. It's the ones that had a really interesting plot and just cut off somewhere in the middle of an arc that hit the hardest.

** I mourn when it is abandoned on a cliff hanger. But... eh... I'm no angel when it comes to finishing fics myself so it would terribly hypocritical to complain when others do it.

** I prefer abandoned fics to deleted ones

** No. Be grateful for what you get. I know many fics which I wish were left abandoned and not finished with the horrible non-plots just because the author felt the need to check that “Completed” box.

** Not too annoyed generally. Most completed stories have shitty endings anyways, and I'd rather have it be abandoned so I can draw my own conclusions than to have a confirmed shitty ending.

** It has happened a lot so I mostly read finished stories or those who are updated weekly but I do read some unfinished ones if someone I know does say it's good and doesn't end on a cliffhanger
