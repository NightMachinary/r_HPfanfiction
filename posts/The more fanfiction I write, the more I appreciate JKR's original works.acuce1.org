When reading back Rowling's works, I'm always impressed with how well the world, characters, and story fit together to support the overarching plot and themes.

Sure, if you look at it with a microscope, you will find many flaws, and even more perceived plot holes.

However, everything is there for a reason and does its job. Let's look at the fandom's most famous example:

Is Dumbledore inconsistent? Sure, he is! But if you make him consistently good and competent, he'd solve all the problems, and that wouldn't be fun. It wouldn't be Harry Potter. The same goes with making him bad or incredibly incompetent.

Is there be a better way to portray Dumbledore than JKR did? Probably, but I haven't seen it yet, and I've read millions of words of fanfic.

The books were marvelously crafter, the prose is simply beautiful, and the characters are distinct and three dimensional, almost from the very start.

And she writes a detective-mystery novel like almost nobody else, dropping clues, obscuring them, having twists that shock but aren't unforeseeable, and still being delightful - with a likable protagonist. How many detective novels manage that?

And if she wants to, she can change the mood, and plays with the reader's emotions like a fiddle. She wants you scared? You bet 13 year old me was scared reading CoS. She wants you to feel sad? I'm sure I'm not the only one that cried when Dumbledore died. She wants you full of adrenaline? You bet your ass I was nervous as fuck before the third task.\\
Just with words, she accomplishes so much.

Lastly, so many of the fandom's proposed changes would change the series in a way that it wouldn't be "Harry Potter" anymore. They would take away the magic, or they would take away the themes or completely change the genre of the novels.

I can honestly say: I always liked the series. Reading fanfiction never changed this, but writing it did: Now, I love it.


** Additionally, JKR is much more concise than a lot of fan fiction writers out there. GoF and OotP are the most action packed books in the series and are only ~190k and ~257k words respectively! I don't think I've come across a fanfic that packed that much worldbuilding and plot with that word count.

I have to say that I have come across fics with amazing prose and interesting plots and characters but those were dependent on the canon characterization that was there.

I think a lot of "proposed changes" try to make the story better but take away from the magic of the story. Something can be done cleverly but many fix it fics tend to make things too easy and protagonists have a cakewalk.

Because the original source is fantastic, many stories follow the stages of canon. If it ain't broke, why fix it? Also, most fanfic is romance centered, the genre least focused on in the series. Every other aspect was so good that it makes sense to focus on developing better (or other) relationships in stories than the main canon ones.

I personally wish the romance portrayed was better and that the pacing of DH was fixed, but I really enjoyed everything in all!

JKR studied the classics, she knows the archetypes that make a story work and added her own twist to it.

** It's always weird to me how so many people hold up fanfiction as "proof" that other people could have written /Harry Potter/ better than JKR, because fic, by its very nature, isn't meant to replace the source text. Sure, fic can explore situations and concepts ignored by canon and expand on minor characters, but people only write and read those fics because JKR did the hard work of making people care about the world and its characters in the first place.

** Heh. I love how this post comes up so soon after the other one does.

She set the stage with some real amazing world building. Which is why Fanfiction is so good and easy to write. I'm working on one right now myself. I'm doing a AU after the 6th book, because the 7th book always reads like a bad fanfic to me. (well so does book 6, but that's another story).

JKR is a great young adult author. She aimed the books at kids, which is why she pulled the real punches. Which is why fanfiction is so much fun. You can actually write realisitc works rather than a children version of what 'war' looks like. Yes, the books are "magical" from a young adult point of view, but the older I got and the more I learned about people, the more I learned that the book wasn't very realistic to war and death. Which is fair for a kids book.

****** Easily explained by the castle shifting and the fact that the basilisk travels through pipes means it needs easy access to plumbing. The castle being a semi-conscious entity obliges in any way it can.

The annoying thing is that "plumbing wasn't accounted for in Hogwarts original planning" which throws all sorts of questions to the logic. Plumbing was around for, like, a thousand fucking years before Hogwarts in some form or another. The Romans figured it out to some degree and the native south Americans had similar concepts as well. It's rudimentary physics, easily tested and implemented. Plumbers are not grand mathematicians. Pressure differentials, when understood and figured out, are not grand mysteries in terms of engineering. You don't need a physics degree to fit pipes and see how outflow and inflow are affected, just simple logic and basic skills.

It doesn't explain why such an old castle has proper plumbing *NOW*. It's almost a derogatory statement. It's an affront to logic. There would have been a huge hubbub about implementing complex plumbing networks to an ancient castle with complicated magic and a mention of such an endeavor if it was AT ALL RELEVANT. Ugh. Much easier to say Hogwarts always had it and just leave it as that.

*** Lindsey Ellis has a fantastic video essay on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGn9x4-Y_7A][Death of the Author]] which touches on JKR specifically.

Personally, I find it mildly offensive to retcon or add nuance to your world that isn't specifically stated or at least implicitly implied in the text: once you publish, the world isn't yours anymore, it's the readers'. I think it is okay to add depth or background or explanation later, but I really dislike anything that tries to control the audience after the fact, unless it is egregiously wrong from the author's original perspective, especially of the original intent is supported by the text. The reason why we use the word 'canon' to represent truth in fiction is derived from biblical argument, as religious arguments often use text as "canonical" evidence toward religious truths. Without God around to simply dictate what He meant, we must only suppose meaning by what is physically evident. It is the same in fiction -- the author's is the word of God -- but that word only has direct meaning if it is supported by the text. It is fine to talk about your own work after publishing, but it I don't think it's fine to alter your work after publishing, especially if it contradicts or is not supported by the published text. Also, if it doesn't make any F/@$ing sense, like *Accio/ traveling at the speed of light, et cetera.

Half the reason people hate the "remastering" of the original Star Wars trilogy is due to this concept; you have an author meddling in something that no longer belongs to them. It's like saying the version of the story you enjoyed and interpreted is wrong, and from the source, so it's extra hurtful.

Have him be good and competent but overwhelmed by the sheer number of duties he's taken on.

Young Dumbledore fell into Grindlewald's sweet talk about ruling over the muggles because he was so smart and obviously knew better than they did. Of course, he learned he was wrong later.

Old Dumbledore has decided that his age, wisdom, and intelligence should be used to guide the wizarding world(actually guide, not rule). The same pride from his youth has him taking on more and more duties in order to guide more and more people, until he gets overwhelmed and can't really help anyone. What should prevent this from falling into bad fandom cliche is that this Dumbledore still believes in an individual's right to make their own choices. He guides, not controls.

So Dumbledore is good and competent, when he can be where he needs to be, which is probably a great deal less than the conflicts the story creates.

I'm not sure how someone noticing and explicitly acknowledging it would make canon better. Would it be its own subplot, making sure Dumbledore has less to do? Or just a minor, consequence-less change where he acknowledges in a few words in the beginning of HBP that he didn't take some of his posts back on?

Either way, how would this affect HBP? That is what I'm interested in: How would the acknowledgement of that fact made any of the books better?

No, Dumbledore is written as a plot device in a children's book. As long as you take the Series as it is, you can enjoy it. But as soon as you take their actions seriously, you end up trying to find explanations in very dark places.

And that is fine for the series in my opinion. It really depends on the work if it needs that stringent correctness - or would you make the same complaints about SF5's new Grindewald story? Because that has a lot of contradictions, too.

For the most part, but Dumbledore's character can make a lot more sense if you frame his actions as understanding the necessity and terrible repercussions involved that don't come up until Deathly Hallows. Dumbledore /KNOWS/ that Harry must die to defeat Voldemort, and rather condemning a child to death to defeat the enemy, decides to engineer things in any way he can, while he can, towards Harry living and Voldemort dying. There is only so much you can impress upon someone before they are ready to accept the truth, and so Dumbledore often /seems/ like a plot device when there are perfectly reasonable explanations for his actions, albeit often misinformed or resulting in the reader's or Harry's frustration. Dumbledore really did sort of raise Harry like a lamb for slaughter, but Dumbledore deeply regretted it and wished there was another way.

It is not unreasonable to assume that Dumbledore had eyes on Hogwarts the entire time he was "away with emergency summons to the Ministry." He could have (and did) swoop in the very moment he was needed.

Dumbledore's actions, from beginning to end (from Harry Potter's original defeat of the Dark Lord to D's death), was to convince Voldemort that HP was his greatest enemy. The Philosopher's stone might as well had been made up. It could have been anything in the mirror, it could have been fake from the beginning. It's entire purpose in that story was to convince Voldemort to come to Hogwarts in some form and go after it, requiring someone who /was not/ Voldemort to actually obtain it (stipulated by the mirror itself -- which was the only real obstacle). All the other trials were just window dressing to the mirror. Harry also going for the Stone was a bit of plot magic, misdirection, intentional suggestions (Dumbledore gives Harry an invisibility cloak, Hagrid lets "slip" a bunch of clues about Fluffy, Hagrid gives Harry a Flute, Hagrid brought Harry to the Gringotts vault where the Stone was sought after just days later, and Harry has a 'chance' encounter with the mirror beforehand) It's all engineered to gear Harry toward the Stone, which is relevant to the plot but also engineers the longer running feud between Voldemort and Harry, started when Harry "defeated" Voldemort as a baby. Dumbledore manipulated everything to result in Harry meeting Voldemort-Quirrel at the mirror.

Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts when Harry needs him most in the first book because Dumbledore would have easily beaten Quirrel at the mirror, but it needed to be Harry and Voldemort at the end, so that Voldemort understands Harry is a threat. Dumbledore needed plausible deniability, and Dumbledore already knew that the love-blood magic thing was in effect. It also creates a precedent for Harry to figure out things on his own rather than relying on others, which is most fully realized at the pinnacle moment where Harry marches off to his own death. If there was a sliver of doubt that anyone could save him, Harry might not have fully accepted his own death.

The only way, in Dumbledore's mind, for Harry to survive and Voldemort be defeated, is for Harry to become the Master of all three Deathly Hallows and accept death -- allowing Voldemort's Killing Curse to remove his own horcrux but giving Harry a second chance. It's a massive gamble, but Dumbledore's entire character is engineered toward creating that situation while being massively guilty and regretting it every step of the way.

This might seem illogical or contrived, but Dumbledore is a character and a character is a person, with all the flaws in logic intact. So, the story plays out the way it does for dramatic reasons but I don't find fault in Dumbledore as a character, only his character's logic.

The only thing I really dislike about Dumbledore is that he never checked in on Harry at 4 Privet Drive. There are insinuating circumstances that might suggest he knew of Harry's overall well-being there, but that upbringing plus the horcrux could have easily turned Harry into a psychopath and thus the next Voldemort.

She had an opportunity and didn't waste it. But you can't possibly tell me that she is a writing powerhouse because she has one successful franchise. I am noy saying she is a bad writer, just not an exceptional one. There are writers that you can identify just by reading the stories a bit because of how unique their writing style, wording and storytelling are. J.K Rowland is bland. She isn't a great writer.

I do think that luck is a PART of how she came to be where she is now in literature, but of course I also recognize that another PART of that is that she used the opportunity she had very well and didn't mess it all up, which is more than a lot of people can say.

Same with me, I don't like the DH plot at all. This ridiculous collection of Deus Ex Machina, author fiat, plot armors, the “lucky hero” trope, and the “good guys don't kill” trope is very disappointing.

She made a huge deal out of Harry Potter walking to his death willingly, but I think it's just a cheap ripoff of the Bible. I actually find this message extremely disturbing, as it basically boils down to: “we Wizarding Britain were abject failures, so we need to sacrifice our children to save us from those sadistic genocidal maniacs!” It's not only Harry they threw to the wolves, but almost the entire Hogwarts was brutally traumatized, tortured, and turned into child soldiers.

She apparently wasn't too clear about what a freaking dystopia she had created. Then in Epilogue, nothing had apparently changed!

At least she made up somewhat in her post DH interviews.

****** It's mostly constructed from a quote that you can easily interpret in this way:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well --- not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.”
#+end_quote

(from: Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 37 - "The Lost Prophecy")

******* There's also the whole thing about him setting Harry up to die /at the proper moment... raising him like a pig for slaughter./

***** She also significantly underplayed the ending of the first two books. In the first book /Voldermort/ was on the back of a professor's head who was teaching in the only school in Magical Britain. Apparently after discovering this, Dumbledore didn't seem to be doing much but give Harry and his friends some house points.

In the second book, a Basilisk was discovered in the school. From Rowling description of the Basilisk, it appears to be the magical equivalent of a WMD like the Nundu. The Basilisk was unleashed by a student possessed by a dark artifact. Apparently after this was discovered Dumbledore just gave Harry some hot chocolate. Ginny wasn't given any form of possible PTSD treatment by a mind healer, and none of the students who was petrified informed their parents and the DMLE. Dumbledore didn't inform DMLE that a class XXXXX creature was discovered inside his school and that a dark artefact was given to a student by a terrorist.

Seriously, what the fuck?!
