It's an author that started (I think) with Innocent, a fic where Sirius escapes Azkaban 5 years earlier and asks Harry if he wants to live with him the first time they meet it has a couple of sequels and prequels so if you have time ( 2-3 Weeks) give it a read it's really good.

The one Marauders era fic in the bunch is "White Flags" It's a story of the Marauders 7th year. (Don't worry about the description it's not a Lily/Sirius fic)
