:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Recently remembered an old Harry Potter fic I was reading back between 2002 and 2007 with Oliver Wood at Hogwarts as the focus. It might have been a second person point of view reader insert? It might have been on quizilla (not certain)? I read it as the chapters came out and I'm not sure if it never finished or I just didn't keep up with it anymore. Potentially it's most identifying element was that it had Time After Time as it's theme song - this was in the days of heavy and slightly silly HTML everywhere including sparkly sprites and songs on every page. Unfortunately I don't remember anything more than that - not the title, author, or plot.

It's been eating at me the last few weeks, becoming a nostalgia itch I need to scratch. What was teen me reading?


** Was it any of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6015128/Charlote-The-Nightmare-Reaper][this author's]] stories? Googling "'Time After Time' oliver wood fanfiction quotev" turns up some weird stuff.

*** I haven't used fanfiction.net before, but that page looks like it only shows their favorites rather than what they've written themselves? I'm way out of the loop.

Yeah google wasn't terribly helpful, so I thought I'd turn to the experts. Time After Time was just the theme song, not a title or subtitle I don't think. It was on every chapter of the fic.

Thank you for looking!
