So I was reading through Harry Potter x Percy Jackson crossovers, and I get to the third chapter (its also the last chapter) and it was if ALL of the clichés had been pulled out in this ONE CHAPTER.

I thought it was just to funny not to share.

I mean absolutely no hate towards the author, but it was just INCREDIBLE how much there was!

Just scroll down and be in awe.


** Ah yes, the legendary "Radiant Arabian Nights". She is infamous in the fandom. 600+ stories started, almost none finished, all clicheed to the max.

Another example?

Scroll down a bit until you see the inheritance list. As I said, just an example. Most of what she has written is like that. I don't think you will find too many stories where there isn't a massive (read: 5 pages+) inheritance list in the first or second chapter.

Although I gotta admit, you probably found the fic with the biggest list.

**** Yea, 658 actually. I mean, on Nov 17th alone she has started 10 new stories. I check up on her profile every once in a while. It is all just so weird.

From time to time I leave a nice review to cut through the negative ones, her "About me" on the profile suggests some medical/mental issues.

**** I checked that, so checked again. You are right, I thought it was over at ~1/4th of chapter 1 since there is normal conversation again. Turns out, that was only like 10% of the full list.

*** No need for adoption when you can canonically shapeshift and get pregnant.

Now if there only was an explanation for why does he have 28 biological parents.

**** He doesn't have to.

You can (I think) inherit multiple titles from one parent. In canon, the Peverells did get subsumed into the Potter line. Gryffindor could easily be the same - considering all Potters for the past +- 300 years have been in that house. Fleamont was canonically Harry's grandfather on his father's side - first name, not family, though. Anyways, gods can get up to weird stuff.

***** I wasn't talking about his titles. He has 28 people in the parents category. And sure, most of them are gods, but they are still written down as godly parents, not great-great-great grandparents. That must've been a massive magic fuckfest, is what I'm saying.
