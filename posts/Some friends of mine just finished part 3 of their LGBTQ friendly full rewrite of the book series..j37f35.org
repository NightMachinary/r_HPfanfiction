This is not my work, it's written by my friends. Since they don't use reddit I thought I'd share it here so more people get the chance to read it.

Part 1: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25587061/chapters/62096878][The Path to Self Worth]]

Part 2: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26041951/chapters/63329092][The Nature of Evil]]

Part 3: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26156128/chapters/63639886][The Scars of the Past]]

--------------

It's worth noting that this is a FULL rewrite of the books and story. It's not simply a touch up of the writing in the original series. Many story elements and a lot of the plot differ. It might therefor be a more interesting read than it sounds on the surface.

If you want more information read the disclaimers, tags and synopsis.

Happy reading! :)


** JKR comments aside, was the original not LGTB friendly? Did I miss something or do I not understand the term? Sure Dumbledore didn't boasted about being gay, but it didn't look like was trying to hide it either. What book plot points need to change because of LGTB? Curious here.

*** You misunderstand slightly. The main purpose of this rewrite was to touch up the lore and thus giving a more realistic version of the same story with healthier themes. The LGTBQ+ friendly elements and themes are supplementary to this work.

One major theme, which you might guess from the title of the first part, is self identity. In this work Harry is raised by Lupin instead of the Dursleys. Because why would Dumbledore give Harry to some abusive muggles in the first place?

The series focuses on the idea that bonds and relationships matter more than blood ties. The only reason Harry is obsessed with his parents in the original is because he was never given an alternative. Then later when he gets proper father/mother figures he still keeps that obsession even though he should view people that have actually raised him as closer family than his parents. Hence why his name in this work is Harry Lupin.

Themes like that regarding self identity and what is important as a person tie heavily into things like transgenderism and sexuality. Essentially you can learn about those things without actually talking outright about them.

As to answer your actual question, while there not being outright transphobia in the book series, JKR's recent comments can't be ignored. After "coming out" as a transphobic person she as a famous author has a lot of influence to spread that kind of negative and bigoted way of thinking. Therefor this series is written for fans of the series that either want to read stories that are LGBTQ+ friendly or are confused about such matters. In essence, it's meant to be educational. Especially for younger readers.

As for actual examples of transphobia in the books, one could question any magic that is based on gender. Things like the stairs in the female dorms that turn into a slide if a boy steps on them.

What would happen if someone that would identify as a girl, while being born otherwise, steps on them?

Regardless, my point is that there aren't specific things that /need/ to change in the books to be LGBTQ+ friendly. But there are certainly things that could be changed for a story with better themes and messages for young readers.

****** I'm admittedly only 11 minutes into the video, but the video seems to be a proposal as to how to approach the "death of an author" when an author outs themselves as a bigot. Sort of a similar concept to looking at the constitution of the US. It's about how to approach a work when new information about an author's bigoted views come out. It's certainly an interesting debate.

However, my question was on how JKR's views are transphobic, not how to approach the HP book. The video is predicated on the warrant that JKR is a bigot. There's no actual analysis of JKR's views and how they're transphobic. For example, the video mentions that JKR is advocating against marginalized groups but there is no actual discussion of how she's advocating against them.

******* I'm not here to debate and I don't intend to. I simply wanted to share the wonderful work of my friends. Why people seem to make this into a debate thread is on them, not me.

My point by linking the video was that while JK may think she is doing the right thing, she is not. Therefor one has to consider how to approach her work as a reader.

I am not taking this discussion further because discussing this subject with strangers isn't high on my priority list.

****** Run this by me again, you don't have time to debate people to defend your wildly exaggerated overblown opinions on a child's book but you /do/ have time to rewrite the whole thing to fit a progressive narrative and removing imagined slights?

Also I would like to point out that

Is a sign of /sexism/. Its a display of archaic social opinions mixed with a magical world, that thinks girls still need to be protected more then boys. THat its okay if a girl sneaks into a guy's room but not the opposite.

So, what I'm trying to say is: Cease your discrimination appropriation.

I didn't write this story, my friends did. I'm not even a Harry Potter fan although I have read the books growing up. I shared the story here because I wanted to do something nice to them by getting more readers interested.

When I said I didn't have the time to debate, it was because I was literally leaving to hang out with some friends.

You quoted half my statement and deconstructed it as something else. I proposed it as a questionable situation regarding how trans characters would fit into the world.

I even said in my response that it was beside the point anyway because the question "What needed to be corrected in the book?" was the wrong question to begin with. The rewrite wasn't about fixing LGBTQ+ things, it was to change multiple themes in the book that can be related to LGBTQ+ characters/readers but doesn't have to. Themes like self identity and kinship.

What I'm trying to say is: Learn some reading comprehension before trying to make an argument.

This isn't even my story and I'm not gonna waste more time and effort debating people on this post regarding irrelevant questions.

**** So basically a change in plot but with more LGTB characters and themes on the foreground? Okay, valid. The thing is that I thought you were going for a "fix the story" kind of vibe keeping everything else the same.

***** The story is vastly different, that is the main purpose of the rewrite. You'll notice that while reading it.

Everything else is supplementary. Reminder that I didn't write this, my friends did.

**** That's true, I haven't read it yet. I didn't mean to offend! It's a running joke on their podcast that lots of fanfiction has LGBTQIA+ characters. I just meant you should crosspost to their subreddit because I'm sure they'd appreciate the work that's gone into this.

Quick edit to add a link to another series they rec'd on their podcast. This one is alternate universe where Sirius doesn't go to Azkaban, so not the same as the one you've shared. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987408/chapters/1947158][Stealing Harry]]
