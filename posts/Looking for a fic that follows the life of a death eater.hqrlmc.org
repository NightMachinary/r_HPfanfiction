I wonder if there are any fanfiction that follows a pureblood that grew up in a pureblood supremacist family, that sees the decline of power of purebloods and sees voldemorts cause as honorable? Basically what i am trying to say that a conflict has two sides. I want the death eaters to be seen as troubled or misguided persons instead of being evil just for the sake of it. Preferably marauders era because many death eaters joined then.
