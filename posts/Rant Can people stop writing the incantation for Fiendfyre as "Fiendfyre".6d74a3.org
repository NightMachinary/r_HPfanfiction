Also it's spelled "Fidelius", not "Fidelus."


** It would be quite nice if people stopped using the name of the spell as the incantation and vice versa, and even more nice if people spelled things corektly.

I don't see it happening anytime soon.

To be fair, a lot of canon characters use incantations as the name of the spell.

**** Shit like this is a very good reason for having a name for a spell that's different from its incantation. Even if you can't actually cast it that way, you'll freak people out and it's stupidly unsafe.

Cops don't relax about pulling the trigger just because the safety is on.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
