I don't want fics where the death eaters were right or dumbledore was evil I just want docs where dumbledore is a good guy and Voldemort is the same as he was in the books but Harry was just born evil I want a fic where Harry is completely evil nothing can change that

Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil.

*** In that fic, is he properly evil pretty much all the time or does he turn into most wonderful protective brother/friend/lover with a heart of gold as soon as he meets Luna or Hermione or whoever?
