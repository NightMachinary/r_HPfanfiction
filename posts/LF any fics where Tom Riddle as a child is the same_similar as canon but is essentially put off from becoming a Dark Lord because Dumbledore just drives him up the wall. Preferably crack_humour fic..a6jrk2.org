Basically a nutty Dumbledore hellbent on driving Tom away from the dark side in ways which would make any man crazy.


** I'm just imagining washed up Dumbledore exhausted from fighting G being like "you know, my boy, you remind me of me from my youth! Why I was always writing in my diary and planning with my chums, of course my plans were much more diabolical than yours. Why by the time I was your age, I had a rough outline to set myself up as grand chancellor for all magical beings with muggles servicing our needs. I didn't waste any effort with silly things like murdering people. Why, I remember during the summer of my seventh year, I had a rousing time in magical Guinea. Of course, you can't find that on the maps now a days."

Okay, might work better with dark lord harry but it still stands, it is like your parents describing their youthful sex antics to you.

** Excellent! This thread made me get around to finishing this story, which has a still somewhat morally ambiguous Tom, but unfortunately isn't really a humorous fic. linkffn(12331839)

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
