I am really into time travel right now and it's always Harry, Draco or Hermione, sometimes Ron that time travels. sometimes Snape too. and I read fics where Dudley(!) is time traveling, but no Neville? it has to be only him though, not as a group, so it will be from his POV, or alternating with characters from the past. (I just don't like the premise of group time traveling, so I never even checked any of those)

either getting back to his body or going to the marauders era will work. would love for him to have a friendship or relationship with Snape, but I feel like I shouldn't be picky with this.
