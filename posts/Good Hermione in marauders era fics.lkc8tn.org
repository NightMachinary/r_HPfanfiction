Can someone please recommend some fanfics in which Hermione travels to the marauders era? After 6 year please. There are many fics in which Hermione falls into the marauders era when she's 13 or 14. I want the fics where Hermione has gone through the war...


** linkffn(the debt of time) is a really good one. super long. starts off with a changed dh then back in time then other stuff i prob shouldn't spoil. it's a sirius/hermione fic with a decent amount of remus/hermione in there. rated m i think so be warned. i absolutely loved this fic

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

** Storm of Yesterday seems like it would fit what you are looking for. It's Hermione/James and really nails Hermione's devotion and love for Harry as well. Linkffn(11494764)

****** It really was. It's so hard to find more decent ones. Debt of Time is pretty good (I don't think that author really misses) if you want to start out in Marauders Era they posted a chronological version of the story on their Ao3 page.
