Harry Potter the Blue Wizard! Harry can instantly understand and learn how to cast any spell that is cast upon him. This is great for charms and learning to duel... No so great for most Transfiguration...

And oh boy does he get a surprise in Moody's first class when he understands the underlying theory of the Killing Curse.


** Would that only be wand-cast magic or could he theoretically learn Dragon Breath in 4th year from the Horntail or the unique "popping" method of house elves from Dobby in 7th year?

Especially as that would be more in line with a Final Fantasy Blue Wizard.

*** That would be rather neat. Bonus points if his biology doesn't automatically adapt - i.e. dragon breath would burn off his throat, meaning he needs a bit of prep work to use it.

*** RAW, yes.

LORE, yes.

You can't learn Divinity-based stuff, but then again you're unlikely to survive them. But you can learn stuff you should be physically unable to, since it's possible to learn to emit noxious spores from a schroom despite not having emitters.

So, yeah, Dragon Breath is a go.

** One could use the scar-horcrux as a kind of justification - once the remnant feels the spell it recognizes it, then it becomes instinctual for Harry, like speaking Parselmouth is.

  'Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it -- you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nose-bleed. But that doesn't matter. I'm not here to teach you how to do it.

*** Why? They might actually win, what with their experience and Harry would still get in trouble with 'authorities'.

Better cast Expelliarmus at Malfoy during a feast. If timed right it will result in a pie to the face, and "I thought he was pointing his wand here" plus Malfoy's stalker-ish tendencies make that a plausible explanation.

That it would start a battle as food and spells started flying and would take a while for the teachers to stop... Well that is a bonus. Another boon is having the teachers around to reverse the more unpleasant spells on the spot.

**** Nope, that's the Black Mage.

The Red Mage stereotype is a versatile mage who can use at least two classes of Magic (black/white or light/dark for example) but who can't access the strongest spells of each type

They are, depending on the source, pretty good at swordplay too.
