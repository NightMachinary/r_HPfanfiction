I'm on Book 3 of Alexandra Quick and the text and stories of the House Elves are as compelling as the story of the wizards!


** I'm currently writing a fic where Harry is indoctrinated into the ranks of house elves. I have written about 20 pages of expository material on the history, social context of their labor, psycho-sexual system, etc. that are all commonplace, writhing just beneath the surface, in any society.

Once I have a nice meaty first chapter going I'll message you, if you want.

** This Sacrifices Arc series does. It goes really in depth in later books and it also goes into dementors, werewolves and goblins. It's a drarry series though, so I don't know if that will put you off.

*** Does it ever get out of the "Draco always agrees and is basically Harry's slave"? I know they stay separate for a while but I think it continued it put me off.

**** It actually does because Draco eventually realizes he wants to be his own person and not someone that is always hanging on someone else's success like his fathers and Harry's. It's a slow growth for him, but it's one of the reasons I like this fic. Lots of character development and it doesn't happen over night.

** I thought about writing a brief story about having Dobby decide to give his powers to Harry Potter at the beginning of CoS without any explanation or exposition. The story's first act would focus on Harry's discovery of the new powers in a comedy of errors. Unfortunately, it became quite clear that the story would quickly devolve into a superpowered Harry fic and that's not really my style.

In any case, thanks for posting this topic. I think the other suggestions redditors have listed sound quite interesting.

*** That's a shame, it sounds like an interesting fic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] explores house elves a bit. I really like how it was done.

** My headcanon of House-Elves is that they are genderless. And that they reproduce by budding, where in a magically saturated environment they can grow small ones in pods/sacs on their backs. The newborn/hatched house-elves would be fully grown, yet very tiny, and would increase in size, if not power, as they age.

*** Interesting... How do they become "servants" of households/wizards? Is that magically sat. environ sort of a marketplace incubator??

**** More or less. Or they can absorb magic at a higher rate/concentration from living wizards and witches, so they have a symbiotic bond to care for the wizard's surroundings.
