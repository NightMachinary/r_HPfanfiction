Hoping there is one out there were he asks her on a whim (before Neville) and they become friends and something more in later years. Thanks! Also would love any Harry & Ginny being friends and turning into more. Thanks again!

*** Holy hell, that story is /bizarre/. I'm three chapters in and despite its weird premise I'm shocked at how much fun it is.

**** Exactly, it's a premise that should not have worked, but the author made it work.

*** I've been enjoying myself with this story on your recommendation (thank you again, by the way), but this is a frankly terrible response to the OP: Harry doesn't ask Ginny to the Ball, he goes with Parvati. He doesn't even dance with Ginny at all.

** "The Yule Ball" by Epeefencer has Harry ask Ginny. (On mobile so no link). It's a one shot.

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!
