Okay, so I reached that time of the month again when I can't find any fics that I want to read, and none of the ones I'm following are updating. So I need your help people! What are good and recent fics (of decent length) that you would recommend?

PS: Oh I know what you thought about when you saw the title, you little perv :D

*** I'm reading this one as it comes even though I'm not a massive fan of it, I can't help it. It's got a good premise and the makings of a good story but something is off about it. All of the Darth Marrs' fics I've read have been the same way, he starts to overuse jokes and starts to jerk off his characters.

For example, in the scene they're playing poker and Harry wins a hand the person he's playing against stands up and starts shouting about cheating and is then banished. It just felt unnatural and look how good Harry is and look how bad everyone else is in comparison.

The latest chapter was good and gripping but it could have meant more and been more shocking if it wasn't alluded to in the previous chapter.

Just little things like that spoil it for me.

Oh and Hermione's prominence in this fic.

** The only recently completed good fic that I've read is A Cadmean Victory. Linkffn(a Cadmean victory).

That said, I've been reading some of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2298556/][Wanda Ginny Greenleaf's]] stuff recently on someone's suggestion (can't remember the user off the top of my head) from this sub. It's decent (i.e. borderline worth reading), but the author needs a beta badly. Lots of spelling/diction errors and definitely some head-scratching moments.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
