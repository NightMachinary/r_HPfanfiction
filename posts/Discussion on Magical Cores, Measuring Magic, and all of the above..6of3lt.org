** I prefer magic to be a force. You cast your spell and magic does something. The way it does it should remain mainly mysterious. You don't need energy, mana or something else to power it, all that's needed is magic.\\
When you add something like magical energy to it, you make it similar to physics fundamentally, and I prefer them to be different in nature and separate.\\
Magic should be metaphysically different from the mundane. That's the point. It cannot be supernatural if it's rooted into the natural. It should work in a completely different way than the rest of the universe.

Do I hate magical cores or magic as energy? No. But I strongly prefer the other way.

I feel that magical cores and the like remove the 'magic' from magic.

**** It doesn't really matter since the result would be decorrelated from the amount of magic. If there is no energy, the same magic is used to cast a lumos or an avada kedavra. It's just magic doing something when you cast a spell, the spell can be more or less complex or powerful, but ultimately, it's just magic doing something through mysterious ways.

Then, even if you could quantify magic, it wouldn't give you any useful information apart from the amount of it present somewhere. it just isn't pertinent.

****** No. A force is only the exerting of an action. It so happens that the amount of work exerted is dependent on the amount of force in the physical world because the physical world works in a certain way. Magic doesn't have to work the same way.

Quantifiable force only means that you are able to know and quantify the amount of force available. That this amount of force is related with the result is true in physics, but it doesn't have to be with magic. And if magic doesn't work with energy or through quantities, the amount of it is irrelevant and of no consequence in the result.

And here you got something that works in a completely different manner than physics.

Obviously, you don't need anything quantifiable in this model, but you keep insisting on introducing it into it.

That implies that you're spending energy to cast spells and thus that magic is powered by energy. It's not a detailed explanation, but it's an explanation nonetheless. The problem is that it explains the way magic works /fundamentally/ and that it makes it look similar to the way physics work. It's less mysterious and exotic than a force that works with a completely different set of rules.

Not necessarily fundamentally. Rowling doesn't explain much what magical theory is. In the magic system I describe, it would be about how /spells/ work as opposed to magic. And about the various laws of magic you have to follow to make your spells work.

Also, from canon we know there are laws of magic. For example you can't transfigure or conjure food.

And also, for flavor, I like to see magic as something that have a lot of completely arbitrary and particular laws (some that are true for all magic, or for a field of it, or even for a single spell), discovered by wizards through trial and errors.\\

** To me, canon implies that on top of knowledge/skill/practice, most spells require sustaining a certain level of mental focus and emotional intent. So while that doesn't mean you use up some quantifiable number of "magic points" like a video game or whatever, at the same time you can't just mindlessly rapid-fire powerful spells machine gun style. I'd also imagine it would be difficult to cast spells on opposite ends of the emotional spectrum (patronus and cruciatus as an extreme example) back to back without taking a break. It's not about "recharging" in either of those cases, but there are just certain limitations to human concentration that you have to be realistic about. Doing mentally strenuous or emotionally draining things causes mental fatigue in real life, and that limits performance. Magic should be no exception right?

** Nothing in canon supports the idea that somebody can "run out" of magic. Magic is never treated like a depletable resource. In the days leading up to the first Triwizard Task, Harry casts the summoning charm hundreds of times in order to master it. He didn't run out of magic. He didn't have to take days off to allow his "mana" to refill.

In canon, magical talent is determined by intelligence, aptitude and effort --- just like any other skill. Neville wasn't a bad student because he had a weak "magical core;" he just lacked confidence and coordination. Hermione wasn't a great witch because she was born powerful, she simply studied longer and harder than the rest of the class combined.

Magic is great because it's /magical/, and /mystical/ and /mysterious/. When you quantify magic you're replacing the whimsy with a videogame mechanic, or shitty anime trope. Harry has no mana bar or magical powerlevel.

I dunno, it's like you're taking away something fun and unique about that setting and replacing it with something boring and cliche.

To make matters worse, most "magical core" stories use it as a shitty plot device. Nine times out of ten, magical cores are an excuse to justify Harry being stronger than everybody else, despite him not having earned that strength in anyway. It's the laziest form of power fantasy, and power fantasies are already the laziest type of fanfiction.

And when the author /doesn't/ give Harry the largest +dick+ "magical core," it's only so that he'll seem like the underdog. After all, why bother creating a threatening and scary villain when you could just reduce everything down to simple, quantifiable numbers? Words are hard, after all.

But to be honest, you can ignore everything I've written above. I don't hate magical cores because they go against my headcanon, or because they fail to meet my lofty literacy standards, or anything like that. I really just hate them because they're always shit. I mean, I didn't even know what a magical core was when I first started reading fanfiction, so how could I have known to avoid them? My hatred of magical cores is something that's been beaten into me by dozens of shitty fanfics. I've never seen them add to the story in a positive way.

*** Honest question. By this logic, is Dumbledore special? Or could anyone be as powerful as Dumbledore?

I've never liked the idea of Magic Cores as a "mana pool" that could be drained. But I do like the idea that magic is in your genes, and just like some people are taller than others, some people are inherently more powerful than others. But I also think that hard work and studying and stuff plays a big role. Kinda like muscle strength. I'm a 5' skinny mini. My husband is 6'4" and build like a line backer. I could go to the gym every day, and I'll never be able to bench press more than him. But if I worked out it, I could absolutely bench press more than most of the people my size. And maybe I can't lift more weights than my husband, but I could outrun him (like having altitudes for different branches or magic). I also believe that any "magical exhaustion" wouldn't be a matter of not having magic to cast a spell, but just being so tired that your spellwork might be sloppy or weak. Like how your legs tremble and ache when you run too far.

*** I agree with pretty much everything you said.

This whole compulsion about making magic "balanced" and treating it like a videogame mechanic is very strange to me. It seems to show a fundamental misunderstanding about fantasy storytelling. I can't think of any classic fantasy where introducing regularities into magic would make it better, it is always left as a mysterious force. The universe in Harry Potter presupposes a somewhat organized study of magic, but there is a huge field that is left unexplained. Nobody is supposed to know how magic truly ticks, what are its limits. Reducing it to some chemical force is lazy storytelling for writers who want to "fix" the series, usually with a painful pop-science theme. It never goes well.

A similar complaint goes for any fic where Harry goes on a hardcore training regime, and we are treated to the fiction version of a gym montage. The idea is that Harry never becomes a super powerful wizard in the books and needs to grind for a bunch of level-ups until he cah take on Voldemort. There are many indy!Harry fics that go like this, Again, this shows bad storytelling. Does the story profit from having Harry do this? Character progression needs to be an organic part of the narrative, not a videogame balancing act.

Don't need days off to 'refill' mana. Nor is that what I'm implying, I'm just saying that adding tension to a battle through artificial asspulls isn't better than simply saying, "He was growing weary as the spells continued shuttering through his wand with immense speed and power, he had weaved thunder and lightning, shattering them against Voldemort's constructs, he could not continue this for long, should he risk his own Magic overcoming him".

As opposed to "Harry threw a Stunner at Voldemort's shield, Voldemort threw an Avada Kedavra, Voldemort sneered at Harry as Harry dodged the spell. Harry threw a piercing hex, then a ripping curse at his target, but they all splashed against a shield. Voldemort cackles. Harry gets FUCKING PISSED AND HE SCREAMS EXPECTO PATRONUM AND SUMMONS HIS GOLDEN PATRONUS MEGA ZORD. Voldemort dies in a blast of fire and brimstone so powerful that the Elder Wand shattered."

Eh, getting tired after casting a shit ton of spells doesn't seem to take any Magic away, it, in fact, adds it, it adds a sense of impending danger, how does Harry escape this? How does he deal with Voldemort in the graveyard when he has already used so many spells within the maze? I can list off several stories that had no quantifiable Magic, yet still somehow managed to be boring. It's because the wonder of Magic is Magic itself, not the person using it.

This is surely the wrong way around.

In a world with quantifiable magical power, casting "bigger" mega-spells is a viable tactic, as you can simply overpower your opponent due to having a larger quantity of magic to them.

In a world without quantifiable magic, you have to be clever about dueling, because spamming the same tactic again and again will just fail again and again. If it failed the first time, it will fail all the subsequent times too. It's about the quality of your magic, not its quantity. The thing about unquantifiable magic is that /both sides have it/. It doesn't give the attacker an advantage because the defender also cannot run out of magic to use in defence. So winning a duel becomes about getting /around/ the opponent's defence, not blasting through it - see Dumbledore vs Voldemort in OotP.

The only time "blasting through defences" is a viable tactic with unquantifiable magic is where there exists a significant disparity in magical ability.

The same can happen with quantifiable Magic, quite easily.

I'm not saying Wizards can't take in ambient Magic for spells, or that they don't, I'm saying that there are consequences to too much Magic in your system and too little.

Quite the opposite, it's about utilising several different spells to one up your opponent as they don't know those spells and can't sufficiently come up with an anti-magic for them in time. Unquantifiable Magic is all about quantity over quality, that's the whole reason Hermione has such a big strap-on on throughout the entire series, she has a large arsenal.

How is that not also true for a person with finite Magic, or at least, finite enough so that it takes a couple moments before you feel up to another round of spells? I'm not talking video game mana, where you use it then that's it, as that's too much like humans and ATP, whereas Magic is more of a force than energy. I'm just saying that Wizards should also feel the strain from powerful Magic. There's also the fact that there is an objectively powerful Curse known as Avada Kedavra, that kills in one hit, that can be used no matter what and there's no real getting around it unless you use actual physical energy to dodge or summon physical items to place in front of the spell in time. With infinite Magic you get a situation where meeting an impenetrable defence or an ultimate offence, is impossible to get around.

Quite the opposite. If I know I have more power than my opponent, my best tactic to win is to take skill out of the equation and just throw all my power at them from the start. That way they have to use all their power to counter my attacks, and then when they run out of power (or the strain on them becomes too much, or however you want to put it), I'm the only one left standing with the ability to cast spells. Their skill doesn't matter if they have no juice left.

And if I know my opponent has more power than me, then they'll just use that tactic against me.

With quality as opposed to quantity as the deciding factor, I am giving my best for the entire duration of the duel, and the winner is decided by who a) is better at magic, where skill is unequal and b) who uses what they know better, where skill is equal.

But your opponent can be Magically Inferior and still defeat you. Just because a Strong Man lifts thousands of pounds and can punch holes in a brick wall, doesn't mean he can beat a practised MMA fighter.

Except this doesn't really make sense. In the quantity scenario, no matter the quality of my opponent's magic, I can wear them down, because they have to use up a unit of magic to counter each unit of my magic. If I cast a spell with power 5 and they cast a shield with power 5 to counter it, and I have total 100 power and they have total 90 power, my best bet is to just keep forcing them to cast shield with power 5 until they have no power and I have 10.

Indeed, quality is if anything a handicap in this situation. You mention, for example, "shields built to withstand incredibly powerful battle magic" but actually increasing the quality of my spells (and thus their power) is just going to make me tire faster. The most efficient way of conserving my strength is to cast a shield that only just blocks their spell. Either way, I'm going to run out of power to fuel my shields before they run out of power to fuel their attacks. Whether I channel all my fuel into a single high quality shield which will repel several of their attacks in a row before breaking, or whether I conserve my power by casting a succession of weak shields which block one spell before breaking each... it doesn't help me either way. I only have so much magic to counter their attacks, and am going to run out before they do.

Because in the unquantifiable situation, if I can cast a spell with power 5 and they can cast a shield with power 5, I will never win by just hitting them with the same spell again and again. I can only win if I change to a spell with power 6 - which depends on my general ability with magic, as if I have studied hard I am more likely to be able to cast more powerful spells - or if I put them into a position where they cannot cast their shield.

  Consistency, it's a literary element that some people would call vital.
#+end_quote

Its almost like if you started a story without it then the story would consistently not have it. If you have adequately shown that hard work and effort yield rewards then you don't need numbers involved at all.

Harry Potter magic is whimsical and free. If you read series like Trudi Canavan's Magicians' Guild trilogy then you'd see that quantified magic with cores limits magic. It also shows people with more power beating down on multiple weak opponents, the combat is basically pre-decided by who has more power, the way this makes the series work is enlarging your core is considered dark magic and the series focuses on whether its okay to do a bad thing for a good reason. It /has/ to focus on that because the magic has to take a back seat. Magic can't be used liberally, it has to be valued the world isn't nearly as amazing or fantastic as the Harry Potter world, their magic is limited.

The question you need to ask is what is the point of limiting magic? This is because if quantifying it isn't limiting it then its a cheap way to overpower characters. You make your favourite characters strong and your least favourite weak. What do you gain? If the limit isn't reachable, i.e. it doesn't interfere with normal life then its not doing anything and therefore what is the point? If it is then magic becomes a scare resource. There is also the problems with making up a system and sticking with it. Is a transfiguration worth ten units of magic, a conjuration thirty? does a matchstick to needle take less than a desk to a pig transformation? Dumbledore likes to conjure chairs, does he become easily deflatable by Crabbe or Goyle if he has to go to too many meetings and creates too many chairs? Its an information heavy thing that takes away from the story telling without adding anything. Fatigue can be a real thing, injuries can be a real thing, mistakes can be real, surprise can be real, there are so many ways to have a character struggle why do you need numbers?

Something else is magic is fundamentally illogical, it can do things that make no sense. Numbers and maths are almost pure logic, if magic was logical wizards would be too. You're dragging down the mystical and the special to something mundane by trying to quantify it.

No, Dumbledore's a Wizard because he's a Wizard. This makes sense because Crouch Jr also said that there was a significant difference between someone in Harry's year and him in terms of if they can cast a Killing Curse. So it's probably because Harry lacks something Magically to make him a full Wizard or he lacks something mentally. Dumbledore is a Wizard because he is a Wizard, he has that something, Voldemort didn't account for that something so Harry was an independent variable.

Sounds like a whole lot of Headcanon and theory, nor do you have any proof that what Dumbledore was saying something cryptic on purpose, Dumbledore said it had a Magical Power limit because he would be the only one in turn capable of getting across the water. He did not account for someone like Dumbledore (Regulus I believe used Kreacher to apparate him there) who equals him in terms of innate power, Dumbledore says 'so only one Wizard' because in the case of supplementing Voldemorts power you could use two wizards or multiple Wizards combined on said boat. But I'll give it to you simply because Magic is an incredibly abstract concept. This still doesn't disprove that Magic is internal, with my example from Fantastic Beasts. And if it's internal and you cast, you lose that portion of Magic inside yourself, the only explanation is that it regenerates and the Wizard creates more, kind of like Insulin when you consume a lot of sugar. This is why I like The Magician's rendition of "A Wizard can overheat and turn into a creature of pure Magic".

Probably not, seeing as how they can actively push it inside themselves to become an Obscurial. If Magic is internal, and Wizards generate it, which they likely do (though that's not all they're limited to, I'm not saying that) then when they cast a spell they use up what's in their body, so it either regenerates at a faster rate than they can cast or we are just not informed about Magical Exhaustion. I imagine it isn't a common problem in the Wizarding World considering the classes Harry takes probably account for that so students don't accidentally overdo it (hence why they learn such a small amount of spells in the beginning).

But when a Wizard uses so much that he can't possibly create faster, what naturally happens? The Magic around him attempts to fill the void, but the Magic around him is wild, it has no real limit on how much it wants to go in, it can go over his natural capacity and destroy him.

But Rowling is known to have no idea of the science or math behind anything. She said this quote about Magical Illness, which essentially means, "Hey, I need a plot device that I'm going to ignore when you think about the fact that you're using Magic to override the grip a Wizard has on his wand, there's also the fact that transfiguration can lead to the creation of a permanent magical creature".

Well studying also means getting a grip on Magic and learning to control it well. It doesn't automatically equate to knowledge itself being the source of power, but knowledge being something that facilitates the growth of power.

You're also quoting something that himself admitted he didn't get past his own fourth year.

** As I see it, magic is like a muscle. If we say that a standard first year with a full core has 100 units, with 0.1 unit recovery in a minute, and that at the end of the year has a core of 110 and 0.15 unit recover/min. This also brings forth the question of where magic comes from. I see at as a form of energy like electricity, heat and movement. The core is like a battery, and it uses your body as a generator, with food, oxygen and water for fuel. There is actually very few fat wizards, something I think comes from the fact that if they use magic daily, a lot of the food they eat is converted into magic.

But, the idea that magic is something mysterious and occult, is also good. It's just that so few manage to pull it off.

** Even if there is no magic drain on the self at all, casting a spell still requires thinking, maintaining a constant focus, recalling a number of minute details, and making specific fine movements of the hand, wrist, and arm.

All of these are things that get fatigued with use even for mundane things. So at least you're going to end up with muscle fatigue of the arms (so you won't be able to make movements as quickly or as accurately, and at some point you won't be able to cast at all), and similarly for mental exhaustion. having a magical core just adds another constraint.

** I personally don't really like quantifiable magic because it's a bit counterproductive to the main plot of the books, because if you can quantify magic than it's just a question of numbercrunching and saying:

"Muggleborns consistently have ( the same amount of / less ) magic than purebloods, thus they (aren't / are) inferior."

So if you're gonna have quantifiable magic you gotta take some special care with the plot because the purist party line will be different.

That said I did like the core system used in the Pureblood Pretense; the author actually word-built it up across the series, across the series magical exhaustion is somewhat rare happening only after brewing some rather advanced potions and stuff of the like.

Harry does have a big +dick+ core but the story does mention big +dick+ core problems and it actually does introduce reasons for why you'd try to quantify it in the first place.

And cores aren't really used as shorthand for "bigger core == better wizard" for your everyday work a normal-ish core seems to do the trick, you just need a bigger core if you're delving into more arcane fields.

I will admit that this seems to be the exception though, most fics I've read that mentioned core don't really have as much work put into the concept.

*** But that way doesn't make sense at all. I say that because Voldemort's spell was detecting ADULT wizards. *Even Dumbledore pointed out that "age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth", since Voldemort set the bar by preventing two or more adult wizards from getting on the boat.* Voldemort's spell to detect so-called "magical power" was simply yet another example of Voldemort's arrogance. He failed to acknowledge the possibility that an underage witch or wizard could ever find the boat, therefore he didn't take it into account. Dumbledore basically spells it out.

Voldemort's security is supposed to be flawed in-universe. Dumbledore pointed out that Voldemort made a mistake by overlooking underage wizards. What is commonly considered an example of quantifiable magical power is simply one of Voldemort's many instances of arrogance and/or plot-induced stupidity.

If magic is really quantifiable, then it contradicts canon purely off of Dumbledore skill. If Dumbledore's "magical power" value is only 1 (as per the vaue given by Voldemort's spell), then that means every other witch and wizard is less than 1. Given the gap in skill between Dumbledore and everyone not named Voldemort/Grindelwald, that would mean every other witch and wizard would be worth a 0 based on Voldemort's security system.

Yet as Rowling herself said, you are either a wizard or you aren't. You can't be half a wizard or half-magical. Characters in the HP series are either wizards or they are not wizards. Even if magical power was quantifiable, you can't be 10% magical. Even muggle-borns like Hermione and Lily are witches, just the same as Bellatrix is a witch. Either a character is a wizard or they are incapable of magic at all.

***** The thing is that if magical power is quantifiable, then by that logic, Dumbledore would be inferior to two adult wizards. The problem is that we know he is far, far beyond that.

We KNOW that Dumbledore's skill is on a whole different level compared to the average wizard. If the average Auror is about 4 times better than the average wizard, and McGonagall is about 5 better than the average Auror, and McGonagall+Kingsley+Slughorn held their own against a watered down Voldemort... then wouldn't this make Dumbledore at the very least 60 times more "magically powerful" than the average adult wizard. And that's if one downplays Dumbledore to be Voldemort's equal.

If Voldemort was checking for magical power, Dumbledore would be worth like 60+ average adult wizards at the bare minimum and thus Dumbledore wouldn't be able to use the boat. Therefore, there is a difference between this fanon concept of "magical power" and the power of the spells themselves. Fiendfyre itself is equally powerful whether it comes from Crabbe or from Voldemort, but Voldemort has more skill and experience coupled with the capability to control Fiendfyre and thus his magical skill is what makes Voldemort's spell more dangerous than Crabbe's. The same can be said of every spell.

This means that either magic cannot be quantified, or that the quantity itself has no value. But if the quantity of magical power has no value, then it serves no purpose and thus has no effect on anything.

Since if Dumbledore has less magic than two average adult wizards, it doesn't explain how that same Dumbledore could effortlessly handle dozens of Aurors (and Aurors themselves are much more powerful than 2+ average adult wizards) based on the talent he has demonstrated on-page alone. Surely it must mean that either:

- Magical power" is nonexistent (only intelligence, experience, and talent) as per canon, hence why Dumbledore is leagues beyond anyone other than Voldemort or Grindelwald. It reconfirms that Voldemort was only counting the quantity of adult wizards, rather than their quality ("magical power").

- It creates a massive plot hole because it implies that Dumbledore has less magical power than two average adult wizards, and since Dumbledore is the most powerful wizard, it means that everyone else has a "magical power" value less than 1.

Meaning that, as per Voldemort's defences, the average adult wizard has less magical power than the average adult wizard. If McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley all got on Voldemort's boat, their combined "magical power" would be less than Dumbledore's? Meaning that according to whatever standard Voldemort's boat spell works on, the average adult wizard has higher "magical power" than McGonagall, Kingsley, and Shacklebolt.

Yet if McGonagall could beat 4-5 Aurors in a duel (as implied by Madam Pomfrey in OotP), and Aurors are at least 4 times as "magical powerful" as the average wizard (given that its kinda implied the average wizard didn't take their NEWTs, meaning they at best have nine Acceptable OWLs), then the average wizard would be at the very most be worth something like 0.035 compared to Dumbledore's value of 1.

*TL;DR: If Voldemort really was checking for magical power, then it opens a massive plot hole so big that it contradicts the entire canon. Voldemort's boat spell has so many loopholes that it would make the locket the most vulnerable Horcrux if said loopholes were exploited. Magic and "magical power" being quantifiable just contradicts too much of canon to be canon, and arguably raises some unfortunate eugenics-esque implications regarding Voldemort and pure-blood supremacy.*

Using a deus ex machina to save the hero is a /plot device/ it has nothing to do with the way magic works and very much with the way the author writes their story, and you can very well devise a deus ex machina with a completely logical magic system using quantifiable magic.

The consistency of a magic system has nothing to do with how logic it is. It has to do with the way you write your story and the way you respect or subvert the rules established in your story. For instance, Alice In Wonderland is consistent /and/ illogical.

That you want magic to be logical and quantifiable is a matter of personal preference, and nothing more. It doesn't make more sense in a story, it makes more sense to you.

And something else makes more sense to me. I prefer something that is fundamentally less logical and metaphysically different from the way the rest of the universe works, and you prefer something closer to physics.

*********** By saying Canon Magic is odd and mysterious and that's the reason you like it, is simply saying that you like bad and inconsistent writing. Let me break down what I think Magic should be, Magic should have no general limitations, but spells and fields of Magic may have limitations. The way I see it is that Magic can create energy and destroy it in a direct fuck you to physics, so Magic is omnipotent in its own right, therefore Food, Gold, etc... are all within the realm of possibility but probably require more power than it's worth. Magic, therefore cannot be energy, but there are forces in this world that are quantifiable (Gravity being the main one), so there is no reason to think Magic isn't the same. You mistake me for someone that wants it measured or verifiable defined, but I'm not of that opinion, hence my flair. I'm just saying that Wizards should have limitations on how much they can use Magic. Whether it's because they risk putting their body in danger, or they have a form of exhaustion that even physically taxes them, or both (Which I personally think should be the rationale). I recommend reading The Magician's series, Magic is never solely defined, but after intense and large battles, the protagonist describes himself as Magically fatigued and unlikely of being capable of producing another spell (should he risk burning up and becoming a Niffin, a creature without humanity or a moral compass, it's made of pure Magic). I assume this happens because his internally generated Magic cannot be generated faster than he is casting, so his body ends up trying to take Magic from the environment, the environment, however, is filled with Wild Magic, it's like putting Salt Water into a fresh Water supply to increase the amount of Water, in short, that Magic isn't used to your body and it ends up storming in with abandon and then the rest is history.

Well, consistency isn't about logic, it's about making rules and sticking to it. Those rules don't have to be logic and they don't even necessarily have to be known by the reader to be consistent, they have to be followed by the author, or transgressed in a way that makes sense.

Wizards acting like Energiser Bunnies doesn't exactly add tension to a story. It doesn't have to remove tension either, infinite ammo can work in an action movie, but generally a hero getting exhausted during a fight and staying standing thanks to stubborness or willpower while risking everything on that last spell tends to be a more compelling narrative than energiser bunny trying spell after spell until something works or the other guy gets him first.

*** Well wizards being "engergiser bunnies" is canon. There are no limits to how much magic can be performed. You argue that it doesn't add tension or that it should have consequences, yet as Scrimgeour mentions, "the other side has magic too". It doesn't matter if a wizard can infinitely cast spells if every wizard they ever duel can ALSO cast magic infinitely.

Since all wizards are capable of casting magic without physical or mental consequences, duels will always come down to the more talented wizards winning. For example, Harry can cast magic as much as he wants without tiring yet that doesn't matter if Snape, or Bellatrix, or Voldemort, or whoever can just use magic to defend or reflect Harry's spells without tiring themselves either. If one side can use the Stunning Spell 1,000 times then the other side can just cast the Shield Charm 1,000 times (or just cast the Shield Charm once to block all 1,000 Stunners).

In fanfiction, this means that the tension would revolve around wondering who the more skilled wizard is, assuming both sides are roughly equal in talent. Duels would be decided not by some concept of quantifiable, finite "magical power" (which arguably sounds like something Lucius Malfoy would argue to try justify his pure-blood supremacy) but talent, hardwork and intelligence... just as is the case with canon. The only exceptions are Molly vs Bellatrix or every Harry vs Voldemort encounter, because plot.

The only time wizards being "energiser bunnies" would even remotely matter is in the case of wizards versus any non-magical beings (i.e. muggles and squibs) or to a far lesser extent, magical non-wizards (i.e. goblins or house elves).

Ask any great chess player, they'll tell you how tiring a chess game can be, although it involves close to no physical effort.

It can also involve a lot of running and ducking and dodging which is physically tiring, especially in a stressful situation.

Finding yourself in a situation where you must outsmart or out skill your opponent when one tiny error can get you killed while having to pay attention to your environment because an unexpected attack can come from anywhere at any time has to be extremely tiring, even if the spellcasting itself isn't.

** Personally I do believe that there must be some kind of limit to storing magical energy, because that makes the most scientific sense. I am fully aware of how fictional and hypothetical this all is, but you can't create a chair from nothing. You would need a very large amount of energy to generate the mass, either from within the caster or the world around them. I consider a combination of these to be true, that wizards must passively re-charge their magic from their surroundings while they rest and eat. It just makes the most logical sense.

Now, that would affect a person's stamina in spell casting, and although some people are born with a slightly greater capacity for magic energy than others, I should imagine that you can increase your capacity. Just as physical stamina can be improved, and like how the stomach will gradually stretch to a larger capacity as you have larger meals, you can improve your magical capacity by using a lot of energy at once on a regular basis, although not too much or you'll be exhausted. But realistically, people don't tend to use that much energy and so very rarely hit their limit. It would take a lot of intensive training to significantly improve your maximum capacity.

However, this doesn't affect a character's strength, only how long they can continuously cast a spell which is unlikely to ever come into play. Spells tend to take up a fixed amount of energy, and its strength from there depends on the caster's mental state, and how accustomed to the spell they and their wand are. Powerful emotions, like love as we know, create powerful magic, and wands are also known to "learn" magic from their owner.

But in most stories, this isn't really necessary to come into play. And even if a character does come close to exhaustion, you can just say they're tired which can be explained in other ways, e.g. they haven't slept or eaten in a long time (which is effectively more or less the same thing) so prejudice against this system can be avoided.
