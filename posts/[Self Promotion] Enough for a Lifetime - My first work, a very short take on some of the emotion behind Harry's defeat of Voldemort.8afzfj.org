** I'm not going to say the writing of the story is bad, because there's really not enough to properly judge it. But I can't help but ask "Why?"

You say that this is, from the description, another look at Harry 's final confrontation with Voldemort. From the title of this thread, I'm presuming you decided to focus more on his emotions.

But you didn't /really/ focus on his emotions. You mentioned that he kind of hates the Wizarding World, and that he couldn't tell if he drew the hatred necessary for the Killing Curse from that or from his feelings toward Voldemort. Then you kind of just said that he wept, afterwards.

You're not breaking any ground here.

And even if you had, you'd have been breaking the ground on a /character we don't know/. Harry Potter never had it in him to fire the Killing Curse, canonically. Not /all of his friends died/. You're, like, lightly tapping on the emotions of a character no one knows.

And it's worth noting that this review has nearly as many words as the story itself.

  In the years to come, they would often ask: "How did it feel to strike that final blow, to end the war?" He knew they would never understand. Later, they would ask: "Isn't your life boring now, don't you miss the excitement?" He would say, "I've had enough for a lifetime." Another look at Harry's final confrontation with Voldemort.
