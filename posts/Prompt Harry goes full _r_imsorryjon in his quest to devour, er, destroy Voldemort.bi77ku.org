Bonus points if it happens during battle of Hogwarts.

Triple bonus points if you can get him to say "I'm sorry Tom, I was hungry" as he eats things that really shouldn't be eaten, like skrewts, minions, and small businesses or landmarks.

** "It's over, Harry Potter. I have won. Your friends lie beside you, dead. Throw away your wand and I'll show you mercy."

"Don't do it Harry!" Hermione cried, absolute dread in her voice. "You promised!"

"There was no other way..." Harry gasped as he held his wand and threw it as far as it could.

Hermione broke down crying, "Voldemort went too far."

Ron went from calm as he knew his fate, to slightly confused but still knowing his fate.

"What do you mean?"

His questions were answered when Harry dropped to his knees and his body started twitching.

Recognizing an Animagus transformation, Voldemort quickly encased Harry in a shield. But when the transformation finished, what was left was an orange overweight cat with black stripes looking quite bored.

Voldemort laughed for a full minute before dispelling the shield.

"That! That's your last hope? Your last plan?" He then smirked, "Well, you won't have to get ridiculed any more. Avada Kedavra!"

But by the time the spell hit the stone where Harry used to be, he had already leapt off killing and maiming all the Death Eaters.

"Voldemort went too far."

Suddenly, every death eater was distracted in trying to hit the cat, who the muggleborns recognised as Garfield.

Harry tore off someone's arms, bit into other's head, and then immediately jumped on the third one, scratching him from the head to the feet with his sharp long claws.

Slowly he started growing bigger and bigger.

The wards of Hogwarts prevented the escape of all the wizards and witches, who were forced to watch one bloody take down after another.

Sometimes he would take a few seconds to savour the taste of a kill, but no one could land a spell on him.

Within minutes, only Voldemort was left standing. In his madness, Harry had even killed many who were in his team, such as Zacharias Smith. The defenders were hiding behind something or another to save themselves from this rampaging beast.

As he twisted and rolled out of the spells Voldemort was firing, he started to grow bigger and bigger tentacles from his tails. Each of those appendages started slithering to different parts of the castle.

Finally, Harry bit off Voldemort's wand arm and started chewing on it.

"Stop Harry! That's Voldemort! Don't you think he would taste atrocious?!" Ginny shouted from behind a chandelier she was hanging on to.

Harry stopped for a brief, critical moment, and briefly his head turned back to human. He looked around him, then at what he was eating, and finally at Voldemort bleeding out on the floor.

"I'm sorry Tom, I was hungry."

But then his head shifted back, and quickly devoured the limb. He then went on to slowly eat each part of Voldemort slowly and carefully, so that Voldemort's death was prolonged.

When the deed was finally done, Harry sniffed the air, nodded to himself, and slowly prowled out of Hogwarts.

No one, not one soul, dared to stop him.

I'm going to hell for writing this, but sure why not. An acceptable sacrifice in exchange of praising the lord Garfield, I can do that.

*** I seem to remember a fic where Harry turned into a honey badger and Voldemort into a snake and Harry ate Voldemort but Daphne came and made Harry spit the snake out. It must have been in one of those collections of one shots by an author I can't remember (Nonjon? Rorschach's Blot?)

"Bow to death, Harry."

Riddle was disquieted. His breath hitched for a moment. He knew he could show no fear, not now, not here - the moment of his greatest triumph, in a graveyard, in front of so many of his followers.

But, still. Still. He was unsettled. Harry was, to all appearances, nothing special. A scrawny fourteen year old boy with bad hair and worse glasses. And yet the child's face was totally blank, his lips slack; his eyes were flat, lifeless circles.

Blood seeped slowly down the boy's forearm from an open wound inside his elbow, and yet the boy didn't grasp at the wound or nurse the pain in the arm. He simply stood there, wand held carelessly in his hand - an odd sort of grasp only using his four fingers, the thumb hanging to the side, like he was some sort of monkey grasping at a twig rather than a human.

Tom considered using the Imperius curse to force the boy to bow but decided to go with a much more direct route to break through his seeming indifference.

With the tiniest flourish of his wand and a deceptively delicate incantation, he hit the boy with a torture curse. He could sense the feral anticipation of his followers as soon as he began the "kr" sound at the start of the incantation. His followers had seen him cast the curse often enough, and done so themselves - they knew well what was coming.

The sickly red light connected with Potter's chest. He hadn't even attempted to dodge. His odd four-fingered grasp on his wand slackened slightly, but he otherwise made no sound. A minute trembling occurred in his limbs, and slack lips parted slightly.

The boy was insane. That was the only possible explanation, Tom reasoned to himself. He gave a thin smile and pushed even more power into the curse. An unbreakable mind could withstand mere pain, but Tom knew his use of the curse had transcended the simple application of stimulus to pain receptors. Lord Voldemort's cruciatus struck true, straight to the brain and warped its perception of reality itself. When Lord Voldemort used a torture curse on you, your reality quite literally became pain.

A thin dribble of spit leaked from the corner of Potter's mouth. With a slight exhalation, a small bubble of spittle formed, and thin purple lines of something followed along the veins of his hands. Purple-black traces started flowing up his neck, filigrees of filth tracing an outline of his face.

Tom gave one final push of power into the curse, attempting to break the boy's very soul. A drop of black ichor dropped from Potter's left nostril onto his upper lip. Lightning-quick, the tip of his tongue darted out, licking the dark slime, leaving behind a smeared trail from his lip into his mouth. The drop was followed immediately by another and another until a thick trail of brown-black ichor flowed freely from his mouth, pooled in the curve of his upper lip, then spilled over and slowly followed the outlines of the boy's mouth.

A wave of stench rolled forth and assaulted Tom's rudimentary sense of smell. From the gagging and retching he heard behind him, it was far worse for his followers. While maintaining the curse, he cast a quick wordless, wandless air freshening charm.

The smell worsened. Decaying bodies. Rotten fruit. Bloody diarrhea. Used tampons left rotting in a public toilet. The smell was beyond comprehension. Tom's concentration slipped. The moment the pain curse lifted, the boy's body jerked and shambled to the left.

Was he trying to escape? He wasn't even moving at a real walk. His legs shuffled, his arms twitched and flailed. The boy's head lolled to the left and turned, keeping his eyes firmly fixed on Tom's face. The body lurched and twitched and fell towards the other - the dead spare lying on the ground. As his body fell forward, his head maintained its laser-focus on Tom. A thick, wet crunch echoed out as the boy's neck clearly broke. Yet the eyes did not blink. The black ichor continued to ooze from his nose.

The boy's hands scrabbled blindly, eventually seizing the hand of the other dead student. He hand arrhythmically, slowly bringing the hand towards his face. And yet the eyes wouldn't stop boring into Tom's.

This was too much. The time for grandstanding had clearly passed.

"/Avada Kedavra!/"

The sickly green light shot forward, impacting the boy in the face. His head snapped backwards, pulling his neck so far that the back of his head hit his own shoulder blades. Whip-fast the head rebounded forwards, this time flopping bonelessly to the graveyard's grassy soil. The neck continued to lengthen. His hands stopped trying to bring the other boy's hands forward, and instead the snake-like neck simply writhed around until Potter's mouth was touching the flesh of the other boy's hands.

A wet, gurgling crunch.

Slurping. Chewing.

Swallowing.

The head started to turn back, yet he continued to eat the cadaver's hand, his lower jaw unhinging and revealing bruised, fleshy tentacles, each with their own ichor-dripping-nose and black mouth.

A voice emanated from the boy, needing neither lips nor tongue to make itself understood.

"I'm sorry, Tom. I was hungry."

The graveyard was silent. Even the sounds of retching Death Eaters fell away. Tom felt his awareness fading to black, a single jagged circle of vision remaining to him. The circle split into to two and covered Potter's eyes. All he could see, all he could conceive of were those eyes. Green light, too bright to comprehend, too dark to understand. The green faded to purple, brown, black, to the nothing that underlie all meaningless reality.

"I can hear your insides, Tom.

"You're hungry, too."
