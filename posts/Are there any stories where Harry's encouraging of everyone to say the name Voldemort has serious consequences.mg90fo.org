And by serious consequences I mean massacres of the student population or something similar, and Harry gets smacked in the face with the realization that while being afraid of a name is silly, being afraid of the psychopathic mass-murderer behind said name is just common sense.


** But he didn't know it was taboo until deathly hallows?

**** Yeah, just checked. But my point still stands that Harry wouldn't have known about the taboo.

***** I wasn't even thinking about the taboo, more about how basically only Harry and Dumbledore are the only people not to refer to Voldemort as You-Know-Who, or He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named; then combining that with the whole "fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself" line from Book 2, which I felt was rather condacending on Hermione's part given that she didn't grow up in the magical world, and therefore had no first-hand experience on just why being deathly afraid of Voldemort is completely sensible. And more than a little ironic, given that she herself picks up the nomenclature later on.

** I've read two or three where he uses it to ambush the snatchers, but none where it caused the kind of problems you ask about.

I have read one where someone points out that saying the name during the first war often led to people being killed, so Harry insisting on using the name is hurting his own cause by insulting everyone who's old enough to remember that time.
