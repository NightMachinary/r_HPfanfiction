** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/8480][The Head Boy's Education]] is probably the only one I know of that covers one character educating another about sexual relationships in the HP universe, but I'm curious to see what others come up with!

*Summary:* Head Girl Hermione explains to Head Boy Harry how to properly interpret and enforce school rules that are suspiciously similar to the posting guidelines found on a certain fanfiction web site. Crack-fic parody, centred around the distinctions between "M" and "MA" -rated stories.

I usually give smut a wide berth (or just skip it), but this fic is far more cracky than smutty.
