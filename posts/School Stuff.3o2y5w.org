School Stuff!

So recently, a post on [[/r/HarryPotter]] asked "What are your favorite parts of the entire series?" and I replied

#+begin_quote
  All the school stuff. I mean, the homework, the exams, the going to lessons all that stuff. I love it. I love it twice as much as it's all magical. If theres a fan fic about just school stuff I'd be very happy indeed.

So, I thought I'd bring it over here... are there any fics focusing on the school aspects of the books? Any pairing any time, whatever I'm easy.


** You've probably read both of these, but

linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow) puts a lot of emphasis on classes, lessons, and the foundations of magic.

Another is [[/u/kwanli]]'s linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School by kwan li), which has a lot of focus on schoolwork, though it's very much an AU.

**** It isn't like Ender's Game with magic...it IS Ender's game with magic. Still a good story.

  ::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. (Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.)

  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.
