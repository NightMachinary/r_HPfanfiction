Hello, I am looking for the stories that feature a romantic relationship of an epic magnitude. The love story to top all love stories, that made you cry and laugh(therefore has the potential to do the same for me). The kind of love that survives trough the war and the toll of time.

I generally prefer it when the author makes a relationship very complex and not black and white, but I'll take what I can get. Het,slash, femslash all will do and also any kind of usual triggers are acceptable(rape themes, torture, older/younger, incest etc). I just want the story to make me feel as strongly as possible. Thank you in advance.

** Really really enjoy [[/u/TE7]]'s story /The Pureblood Princess/. There was a nice build up to the relationship and the epilogue made me feel feelings I would rather not have felt. linkffn(6943436)

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

It's in EPUB format because it was removed from the internet and I managed to save it before it disappeared.

SS/HG, Post-Hogwarts, AU (because it was written before OOTP was published). Hermione needs help identifying a Dark potion, and Snape seems to know more about it than he'd like to share. Adventure, Romance (slow burn with human flaws), and both are kept very in-character. Novel length, plus a sequel!

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
