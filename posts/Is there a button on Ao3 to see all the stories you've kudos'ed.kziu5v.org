Im forever losing stories. Is there a way to see everything I liked on Ao3 that isn't 'History' because Im always testing and abandoning stories and it'll take me ages to sort through them...


** I don't think so, but I'd be happy to be corrected.

Just bookmark everything you'd kudo.

*** I only bookmark stories I'm currently reading... So regularly updated wips...

Because otherwise I'd have 4000 stories in my bookmarks and that's the same mess as my history....

Ffn has a 'favourited stories' thing which wouldn't be that hard to implement on Ao3 surely? And I prefer ao3 really to ffn but damn ffn has it on point with the favourite stories tab...

**** Isn't bookmark in ao3 the same as favourite stories on ffn? I can see what fanfics other users bookmarked 8n ao3 but definitely not at ffn. Ao3 doesn't really bookmark like ffn with chapter and exact position, doesn't it? For unfinished stories on ao3 I use the subscribe or mark for latter buttons.

***** Yeah, also in bookmarks I can use filters to find the fic/series that I want to reread. For me it's just a better way to organize what I have already read because there's no way that I'm going to scroll through all of my history or subscribe all one-shots that I've seen.

** I don't know anything that works exactly like that, but I use the AO3 Enhancements extension which can show you whether or not you've kudos'd a work. [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ao3-enhancements/eljennickgdbghppcaenkcinjafmnfoi]]
