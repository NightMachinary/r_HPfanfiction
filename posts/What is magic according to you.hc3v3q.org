like the title says. Is it some form of energy or metaphysical force or is it a glitch in the fabric of reality that certain lifeforms learned to exploit? Where does it come from and where does it go? How does it work? All ideas no matter how silly are welcome.


** I view magic as essentially irreducible - it is its own thing, not something which is made up of, or explainable in terms of other things.

Consider the (highly simplified) chain of explanations for matter:

- Matter is a collection of atoms.

- An atom is a collection of sub-atomic particles.

- Sub-atomic particles are collections of elementary particles.

- Elementary particles are made of strings?

Unless this kind of reduction just goes on infinitely, eventually there has to be a fundamental thing, something of which you cannot ask "what is that?" because the answer is just "it /is"/.

I view magic as that kind of thing. It is fundamental; a thing of which you cannot ask "what is it?" because the answer is itself.

Of course, magic still has /behaviour/ which can be described, and rules that it follows etc. But those are the answers to the question "what does magic do?". The answer to the question "what is magic?" is simply "magic".

** The ability to bend and warp reality with your will, with it being easier the greater you level of need or want is. but the more a person practices and uses their magic the less strong feelings of need and want factor into things. Knowledge even wrong knowledge also helps. Because the more sure you are of how reality works the easier it is to muster up the will to work specific pieces of magic.(belief that you can actually do what you want to do is also important, the less you believe you can do something with magic the more need or want you need to be able to actually do it).

A large part a magical education involves wizards and witches overcoming mental blocks.

There is no wrong path to learning magic. Magic at its core is personal for everyone that practices it, even if most magicals never reach the level were they that actually becomes important.

Wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort are as powerful as they because they have reached the point were they are fully aware and have a understand that they are walking their own personal magical paths that will only fully work for them.

That is just what I remeber from my own personal headcanon. I use to have a lot more of it But I have forgotten most of it.

** Science falls under magic, not the other way around.

**** What is science? The intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment, according to Oxford Languages.

So usually people say "Magic is part of science we haven't discovered yet", but I don't think that's accurate. Magic doesn't fall under scientific laws. It goes over them. Science, as the Muggles know it, is incomplete. Because magic is no longer accessible to them. So they work with what they /do/ know and have (and do a pretty good job at it.)

I personally think that all the "pseudoscience" Muggles used to believe in (alchemy, astrology, divination, etc) were eventually phased out as "fake", partially because anyone who could get results went to Hogwarts and disappeared into the Wizarding World, and partially because of the Office of Misinformation/Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee spread false information. That left "magic without magic" --- chemistry, physics, astronomy --- things that could be explained without knowing or having magic.

(Of course, there are exceptions to this. At higher-levels of Muggle science and math, different rules and laws go, becoming more complex, like how Algebra gets replaced by Calculus and how Math 55 supersedes Calc, but we won't go into that.)

It was also easier for the Wizarding World to monitor and control. "Safer", if you will, for Muggles to play and experiment with. It also explains why wizards are able to modify Muggle tech to work for them (Knight Bus, Express, camera, wireless, cars, motorcycle, etc). Ordinary Muggle tech fails /with/ magic because it was made /without/ knowledge of it's existance.

The things that wizards have known, in some part, for thousands of years (your mind affects your magic, love effects your magic, see Dementors, Patronus charm, conception of Tom Riddle/How Merope was left 'heartbroken' after TR Sr left) have recently been rediscovered by Muggles. Mental health is becoming more and more important as the years pass. Belief, focus, desire, skill, etc --- things that aren't tangible, that can't be scientifically proven, but are necessary for magic. They're also important for Muggles too. Believing in causes, focusing on a particular subject, being skilled at something...it's how humankind has moved forward /forever/.
