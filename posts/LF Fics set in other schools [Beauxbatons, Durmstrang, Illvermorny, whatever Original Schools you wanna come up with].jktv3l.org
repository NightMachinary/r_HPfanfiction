As I said in the title, looking for fics set in other schools. Harry and Co can still attend Hogwarts, but most of the 'action' should take place in the other schools. I don't care what the actual plot is, so long as a lot of it takes place in a school other than Hogwarts.

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by theSanti.

No smut btw, probably the best WBWL fic out there. Majority of the plot is at Durmstrang.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** The Alexandra Quick series, starting with Thorn Circle: linkffn(3964606)

Set in an OC magic school in America. Alexandra Quick is one of those few fics that has pretty much /nothing/ to do with the events of canon - I think they get mentioned once or twice as "did you hear what happened across the Atlantic?" type news and that's pretty much it.

  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

EDIT: Well, it got us something that technically fits the request. It is a Harry/Tom Riddle though, which raises some alarm bells for me.

  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

****** Yeah. Hopefully it's more of a Full Circle kind of Harry/Tom Riddle story. :)

You're right that it definitely does fit the request, but even if I don't enjoy it, hopefully someone will.
