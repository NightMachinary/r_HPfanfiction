This is for [[/r/harrypotter]] and the June Creative Writing Assignment! I tried to take a classic Jewish tale that I heard growing up and give it a magical spin and a wholly new backstory. Hope you guys enjoy it!

--------------

The Wizarding Jews of Eastern Europe were beset upon at all ends. They faced prejudice from their Muggle neighbours, who decried them for their Jewishness, their lack of cleanliness, their golden galleon hoarding, and spread rumours about blood sacrifices made for power. They faced prejudice from their kings and queens, their dukes and duchesses, their counts and barons and lords and ladies. Their leaders shunted them from ghetto to ghetto, shtetl to shtetl, trying to find a home suitable enough to contain them and their clear wickedness. They were decried by their Jewish brethren, who saw their ways and wands as a perversion of God's power and an affront to his omnipotence. Their wizarding fellows treated them only slightly better, due to shared general confusion at their abilities and power, yet that only extended so far, for the Wizarding Jews were the perpetual other, existing only at the fringes of any group they were a member of.

At the time of this tale, the Wizarding Jews of Eastern Europe were led by an extraordinarily powerful wizard by the name of Yehuda, son of Bezalel. Yehuda was a proud and pious wizard who thanked God daily for his extraordinary powers, beyond those of the typical wizard. He cared fiercely for his brethren, and was loved by all, yet was denounced as a heretic by those who cared little for the Wizarding Jews.

One Sabbath morning, when Yehuda was commencing his daily prayers with several of his followers, a messenger burst into his synagogue. He wore the clothes of a Muggle, and sported a long beard. Yehuda did not draw his wand, for he believed magic was forbidden on the Sabbath. The messenger cried: “Yehuda, son of Bezalel! There is a horde bearing down on our city. In God's name, please, I bid you to help us!”

Yehuda, son of Bezalel, was angry. How could they hate him, accuse him of blood sacrifice, and then beg for aid? He could only bow his head. “I cannot help you,” he said. “I am forbidden from using my powers on the Sabbath.”

The bearded Muggle left in disgust, muttering about the greedy, selfish Wizarding Jews. He continued his prayers. When the preliminary Shacharit prayers were almost completed, the door to his synagogue burst open again. A royal envoy, wearing robes of the finest gold, dismounted his horse and walked in. “Yehuda, son of Bezalel!” he cried as he unfurled a scroll. “Your prince bids you to aid the duchy in battle. If you follow this royal order, you and your people will be wealthy beyond your wildest dreams!”

Yehuda, son of Bezalel, was irritated. How could they demean him, shuttle him from ghetto to ghetto and shtetl to shtetl, and then demand his aid? He could only clasp his hands. “I cannot help you,” he said. “I am forbidden from using my powers on the Sabbath.”

The envoy left the synagogue, his robes trailing behind him, muttering about the classless Wizarding Jews, who would be destined for the middle of the firing squad if he had his druthers about him. Yehuda continued his prayers. He finished the Torah service. When they were finished their additional Mussaf service, a Muggle Jew strode into their synagogue, breathless. His sidelocks were curled, and his yarmulke was askew. “Rebbe Yehuda ben-Bezalel!” he cried. “If you do not aid the rulers in this battle against the horde, can you not see how much worse our life would be? We would be displaced, dismembered, and disabused of our heads! Please, consider lending your assistance.”

Yehuda, son of Bezalel, was outraged. How could they, who spat on him, called him a false Jew, accused him of heresy and insulted him, plead for help in the name of brotherhood? He could only bow his head. “We are forbidden from using our powers on the Sabbath,” he said.

“But your powers are not in the Talmud, nor the Torah,” the Muggle Jew said. “The Lord, Blessed Be He, did not forbid your powers.”

“It would fall under work, and all work is forbidden on the Sabbath,” Yehuda said. “However, you are permitted to join us for our Sabbath meal.”

Frustrated, and nearly apoplectic, the Muggle Jew strode out, cursing the Wizarding Jews for their short-sightedness, and for providing a bad name to all Jews. Yehuda sat down with his congregants and ate the cholent prepared the night before. He prayed to God for guidance. Midway through their meal, a wizard entered the room. He had a short white beard, flowing purple robes, and the lines across his face were deep. He sat down next to Yehuda. Recognizing the wizard, Yehuda offered him a bowl of cholent, which the wizard accepted. As he ate, he spoke.

“We cannot win this fight alone,” he said. “Most of our numbers are stranded, or have been assimilated by the shamans of the horde, drunk on power and blood. We need your help.”

Once more, Yehuda bowed his head. “I cannot use my powers on the Sabbath. I am truly sorry.”

The wizard nodded, as if he understood. “Would your God object to the protection of innocents on the Sabbath? I may know little of your faith, but I know He would not want you to sit back and watch the horde's carnage.”

Yehuda closed his eyes and prayed. How many of those innocents had spat on him, demeaned him, and made life hellish for the Wizarding Jews? Yet he also knew that the book of Vayikra demanded that any Jewish law should be broken in the name of preserving even one life. He withdrew his fir wand from around the Torah scroll. “In the name of The Lord, I will go with you.”

Yehuda, son of Bezalel, and the wizard departed the synagogue, along with dozens more of his congregants. When they reached the field where the battle was taking place, they saw that the invading horde had nearly overrun the local forces. He spoke the words of the Lord's emeth, or truth, through his wand, and raised the ground below their feet into a great clay golem, as tall as the skies, that smashed the incoming forces. When the horde was decimated and no longer a threat, he waved his wand once more, returning the creature into the dust of the ground. He said Kaddish for the creature, and returned to his synagogue.

When he arrived, he was greeted by the Muggle, the Muggle Jew, and the royal envoy, all of whom promised feasts, titles and wealth and renown beyond his wildest dreams. When they spoke, Yehuda, son of Bezalel, could only ask for one thing: to end the persecution of his people, and allow the Wizarding Jews to live and practice in peace until the end of time. The royal prince granted Yehuda's wish, providing a plot of land for the Wizarding Jews and whoever wished to join them, where they could practice and remain free of all harm.


** Wow. Very interesting. Essentially a golem...?

** I love this! It's really interesting to see the Jewish folklore that I heard growing up, too, be reimagined.
