How do you deal with the fear that someone will steal your ideas or even copy and paste your story word for word?

I've been writing a fanfiction for about two years about Lily Evans. It focuses mainly on her friendship with Severus but I have plenty of original characters and plot points. I'm scared to post it because I've literally dedicated a massive chunk of my life to it and I feel like I'll always have the fear someone will plagiarise it. Fanfiction.net doesn't do anything about plagarised work and because it's fanfiction I have no legal rights on it.

So authors, what do you do?


** Well one. Get over it. It sounds harsh I know but that's a risk you take when you publish your work. Either someone will take it and translate it to another language and claim it as their own. It happens in YouTube, it's happen in the fan world, hell it happens in the real world. All I can say if you have created this bubble with all your time and energy tossed in then make it something spectacular. Open a Tumblr, do a Facebook page, build a following if it's supposed to be his epic story and hopefully one of your fans will tell you if someone did snatch your story. If it's just a one-shot or a simple story about a lovely friendship then put it out there on the popular fan sites. Keep the same pen name and nake a point to put a disclaimer that this is yours and you give no permission for it to be taken. Either way... Just post it. it's a risk, not a promised one, but you're opening yourself to the good feedback and the trolls. Just do it.

** Easy. I had my fanfiction stolen. It was published by someone else. One of my readers noticed. It might happen, it probably won't. Not much to do about itðŸ¤“

** There's frankly nothing you can do to control what happens to it after it's been posted. Even if you delete it, it will still be out there somewhere, so either post it or don't. It's a choice we all have to make. If you want people to read it, post it. If you want to keep it to yourself, then don't. There isn't really a third way.

** I don't worry about it in the least. I believe in open-source creativity; after all, isn't that what fanfiction is? Taking someone else's world and characters for our personal use? I mean, the number of fics quoting chunks of canon nearly word for word is incredibly high.

Yes, I probably would be a bit angry if I found my work reposted by someone claiming they had written it all by themselves and to praise them for it, but these things either don't get noticed or they do and then word gets back, and it gets taken down or not. :shrug:

I find the ability to share my stories far more valuable than the hypothetical situation in which someone actually takes the time to steal and repost them. And if I ever get good enough that it's an actual issue, I'd assume that my followers would eventually notice and shout them down on it. And if not, it doesn't really hurt me anyway. I can go to their copy of it and smile at the reviews they got because in the end it's still people reading and enjoying the words I wrote.

** Thank you everyone. And your right, I'm just going to post it. There's nothing really else to do. Post it ... or don't. And I want feedback. So I'll post it

** Imitation is the highest form of flattery and all that. Obviously they shouldn't copy it but if they do then give yourself a pat on the back for writing something worth plagiarising.

** I've had my stories stolen quite a few times, and honestly, I don't sweat it. Like, most of my shit is on FFN, so he takes my 20 chapter completed story, takes 2-3 chapters of it and leaves it hanging, for what purpose? A power trip over the three reviewers who don't realize it's plagiarized? It's annoying, but ultimately petty and meaningless.

** I've had stories stolen several times. It's not a big deal--never been more than an annoyance for me. On FFN, the publish date proves your were first, and you can submit a plagiarism report, and they'll take down the stolen story. I hear AO3 is even better about it.

People /ask/ to use my ideas regularly and I always say yes. I'm happy to contribute to the community that way. I did have one case where someone stole my first chapter (with some changes) to write their own story based on it. I had a conversation with them and told them it was fine as long as they credited me and kept it to that chapter. (Like so many stories, I don't think it got past Chapter 4 anyway.)

** I don't want to discourage any fanfictionauthor from writing fics, but basically you are stealing Rowlings work OC's and so on.

*** Nope. Being inspired by an OC is not the same thing as stealing it.

ETA: Maybe there's a nicer way to put this, but I don't want people to stop writing fanfic because they think it's the same thing as stealing.

**** That's true, but OP intends to use OC's of Rowlings making like Harry or Hermione. That's plain stealing and contary to Rowlings work OP's fic has no copyright on it.

That's plain inaccurate and unhelpful. Yes, JKR has the legal right to control her characters, but since [[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3753001.stm][she's fine with people writing non-commercial fanfiction]], it's not "stealing" at all.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Wrong. As a pretty accurate rule of thumb, if you write something creative, you get a copyright. In the case of fanfic, the situation gets a bit tangled because the original author also has rights over part of the work, and you have to have their consent to have written your derivative work in the first place. But in relation to a third party, you certainly do get an enforceable copyright.

Of course, since JKR hasn't given permission to use fanfics commercially, you wouldn't be able to get much in the way of damages if you actually tried to enforce said copyright. But theoretically, you could sue to stop someone from taking credit for your work. If you felt it was really worth the time and expense of the court case, and you had sufficient proof of authorship.

** I must admit I haven't put anything I've written up yet, but I can't really see why I would care? What does it matter if they do? You still know you wrote it, what else are you really getting out of writing it in the first place? If anything I'd probably just be amused that they felt that stealing it was worthwhile.
