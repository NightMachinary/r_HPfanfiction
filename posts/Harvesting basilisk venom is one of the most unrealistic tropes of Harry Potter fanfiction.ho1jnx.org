** destructiveness is not all encompassing. destructive substances are destructive to some materials and barely react at all with other materials. real life acids are stored in glass flasks.

basilisk venom destroying horcrux is a magical property, it doesn't tell us anything about how it would react with a glass or metal container. even if it was too volatile to be stored in glass or metal, it comes from inside the basilisk, so a container made from basilisk skin, bones or flesh, or if all else fails the venom sack itself should be able to contain it.

** I like the idea that the basilisk venom destroys magic AND is extremely corrosive and poisonous to a living being, but it would act normally, as a Muggle potent acid, which can be stored, on normal, no-magic things. The basilisk venom destroys the magic held in the Horcrux, while the item destroying part comes in from its natural corosivenes... After all, after magic is destroyed, some founder Items are no more than a cup of gold, a locket and a diadem of silver.

** You're making a baseless assertion. I get that you like your idea, but it doesn't mean you're right. Just because it can destroy a horcrux doesn't mean it can destroy a glass vial, and it doesn't mean it won't react to this "air container". After all cesium (one of the most reactive elements) ignites when exposed to the air, but does just fine in glass (under vacuum), so why don't you think basilisk venom wouldn't be the same?

** Without going to fanon, we know canonically there are materials available in setting that can resist it. Goblin steel for one, given Godric's sword. We have no indication in canon that it's reactive with glass or stone, either.

You're treating it as corrosive, when it's simply described as magically poisonous enough to do irreparable damage to horcruxes. It didn't dissolve Harry on contact after all, and he was bitten directly. It was just going to kill him by poisoning had Fawkes not stepped in.

It's corrosive. It's why it's able to destroy Horcruxes because it destroys the /container/ beyond repair.

Correct and we know that's the case in the HP world: goblin made steel; a magical metal. The diary was not magical or special beyond it being a horcrux, something Harry points out. Dumbledore removed the stone, a magical object, from the band, which was not magical. As far as we know there is no special magical glass.

*** It is canon that Basilisk venom is Highly corrosive as well as Highly poisonous. Do your [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Basilisk_venom][research]]. Goblin made steel is the only thing that can withstand it, and only because it absorbs it into itself. It entered Harry's blood stream but was quickly neutralised by the phoenix tears.

**** I would hardly say quickly. Harry got bitten, climbed down the face of Salazar, walked to Ginny, listened to Tom monologue for a bit, spent a good half minute stabbing the diary, watched as Tom died and Ginny woke up, and then Fawkes cried on him. I'd say that would take a good 3 to 5 minutes, at the very least. If the venom was as corrosive as Rowling said, then Harry would be dead by then. Also, when talking about the magic system set up by Rowling, I think you have to take it with a grain of salt.

** I think you're making a baseless argument by assuming that corrosive means it will destroy everything. If that was true then the venom would eat right through the basilisk itself wouldn't it?

You're also confusing venom with an acid, which it isn't. You can make a good argument that the basilisk venom destroys horcruxes because it's such a powerful venom that it destroys the very soul of an object and therefore destroys the horcrux.

But let's just assume it's corrosive like an acid. Acids are generally stored in glass/plastic containers, even very strong ones. Fluoroantimonic acid is probably the strongest acid that is known currently. It will eat through almost anything, so we have to store it in containers lined with Teflon. But we can still store it in those containers.

I personally hate the harvesting the basilisk trope as a plot point. I find it to be a very lazy way of getting Harry lots of money/magical artifacts/other things he might need for the authors plot. But it makes sense. Also just because the author doesn't describe every nuance of how it's harvested and what type of glass it's being stored in doesn't mean it's being harvested into some regular glass vial. It's a magical world, whose to say the glass isn't enchanted or something and the author just didn't feel like describing a scene where Harry goes to a shop to buy a bunch of basilisk venom resistant glass vials.

** One i would think that if you harvested the venom sacs themselves you could store the venom safely. As far as how corrosive the venom is it still may be safely stored in Pyrex/glass vials as even the most corrosive acid can be stored in similar items. Also do we know if Basilisk venom is not actually two binary agents that are mixed when they reach the fangs? IIRC IRL there are snakes that have two types of venom they inject. So why not have the "king of snakes" have something similar.

As far as I recall every item in canon that the venom came into contact with was a material that an acid could corrode (metal, flesh, paper). Also, instead of the Sword of Gryffindor being destroyed by the Basilisk venom it incorporated it into itself. Thereby suggesting that there may be a method/material to contain/store it.

So while your initial point is a good discussion topic I think the conclusion you reached is flawed.

Edit: not sure if anyone else mentioned it but Harry's arm (flesh, bones, blood vessels etc) wasn't dissolving from the basilisk venom (if it was as corrosive as you suggest) rather he was dying due to the poison aspects.

** You are assuming that the venom is wholly destructive to everything, yet, we don't read about it hurtin Harry's hands, or even sizzling while touching the ground.

It destroys Horcruxes because it breaks the magic in them, and that's not all inclusive too, The Sword of Gryffindor absorbed it and became stronger for it.

So it's not hard to think that with the proper tools you can place them in a flask.

** Another question came to mind as I was looking at this post. A medium size rattlesnake (Eastern Diamondback) is 3-6 feet (split the difference 4.5 feet). A large rattlesnake is considered 6-8 feet (split 7 feet).

A medium rattlesnake delivers 12 milligrams of venom. A Large rattlesnake delivers 20 milligrams of venom. That's a 2/3rds increase in the amount of venom delivered for a 2.5 foot increase in size. The Basilisk was 60 feet in size. If we extrapolate from the rattlesnake that should result in 1,526,511 milligrams of venom per bite (or converted to milliliters) 1526.511 milliliters eg 1 1/2 liters of venom.

Now in canon we know the fang goes into Harry's arm but it doesn't come out. Which means any venom should go into his arm. We know that a snake can control whether it will use any venom (dry strike if none) but that's doubtful that happened here as the Basilisk was in a fight and had lost it's eyes, and was trying to kill Harry at the time.

So the question is why didn't Harry's arm get flooded with venom? Yes, I understand plot hole/story reasons but without the snake actually squeezing it's venom sacs to inject venom there would not be any venom in the fangs (basic hypodermic needle) to kill the diary Horcrux. I doubt a snake of that size has the muscle control to only allow a few drops out. Besides which a few drops wouldn't make it to the end of the fang.

So at a minimum there should have been a half liter of venom in Harry from a bite that used only 1/3 of the normal venom. Which should have resulted in venom pouring out of Harry's arm.

You can also extrapolate venom sac volume where you will get roughly 48 liters (which tracks nicely with many fics that "harvest" the Basilisk).

I think you made a great point and I am glad you posted it.
