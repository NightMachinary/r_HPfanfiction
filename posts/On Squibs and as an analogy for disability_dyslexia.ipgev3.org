I'm writing my first fanfics set in a present day (ie 20 years later) hogwarts. Are there any quality fanfics that deal prominently with squibs?

Has anyone played with the ideas of squibs?

Any thoughts on them?

Linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down)

Harry ends up back in time and pretends to be a squib for a while. Being a squib seriously sucks.

The fic was significantly better than I was expecting it to be.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Holly Potter and Alex Kann's friendship should have ended at 11. Their futures lay in different worlds: witch and Muggle; magic and science; Scotland and London. Then Alex came up with the idea of selling potions to Muggles. Their waning bond is revived, but can it last while running a nascent illegal business, the challenges of school and new relationships?
