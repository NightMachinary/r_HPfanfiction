I've people recommend fics where Harry gets abandoned, but decides to continue. However, nothing where getting abandoned by his best friends finally breaks him and he leaves.


** That could be really interesting. The way I see it is he wouldn't be able to totally abandon magic, not at first. He has no home, no real money and no way of supporting himself. But Harry could use magic to get himself new documents and maybe even leave the country for good. Magical travel is off limits as it would be monitored, but what is to stop him using his invisibility cloak to board a plane and just leave. Just finds himself a safe place to live and lets magical England deal with Voldemort by itself.
