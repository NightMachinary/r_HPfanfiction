In a lot of "Gray" Harry fics that I have read, most of them lack any sort of morally questionable behavior and usually just have Harry oppose "Dumbles". What are the best fics with a Harry that is actually questionable in regards to his actions? No slash or bashing please. Thanks in advance.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts) and it's sequel Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Physical Adept) have a Harry practically raised as a shadowrunner, very pragmatic and very grey. Also has a take on a Harry who uses quite a different form of magic too, if that's your cup of tea. Both are complete with the author getting a head start on third year before they start posting.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

He has used his summer to relearn the material he should have over the past three years, as well as set himself up for success in the future, getting rid of Divination.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.
