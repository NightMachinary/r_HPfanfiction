In particular, I'm looking for any fics that follow a format similar to the books, mainly fics that are set in Hogwarts, have overarching storylines and mysteries that unravel throughout the year, new aspects of Hogwarts are revealed (I love how magical and full of Secrets the castle can be), Harry wants to fight, but the Order won't let him, etc.

As you can see, I've gotten nostalgic about the books and fanfics written before HBP came out. Any suggestions are appreciated.


** I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks]]: Harry and Hermione investigate the disappearance of [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Sally-Anne_Perks][Sally-Anne Perks]], who, in the books, was sorted just before Potter but then wasn't called to be tested for the OWLS (even though her name would be between Patil and Potter, both of whom were called). What was probably an error by Rowling, the writer spins out into a mystery that does an amazing job of capturing the feel of the early books.
