This story has gripped me unlike almost anything else I've read lately and would absolutely recommend it to all. That being said I'm looking for more like it, not necessarily with all the parts, but maybe with some mix of them.

Stuff like

Ravenclaw Harry/ not gryffindor

HarryxDaphne (although I think I've read most of these by now)

Legilimency Harry

Gellert Grindelwald involves in the story

Well Written


** While these stories are only vaguely similar to the /The Mind Arts/, I'll try to satisfy at least some of your criteria.

Not Gryffindor/Well Written/(Not Grindelwald but still) Mentor!Dark Lord/Not HarryxDaphne but Daphne is sort of in love with Harry:

/Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux/ linkffn(11762850)

Not Gryffindor/Hints of HarryxDaphne/Grindelwald/Well Written:

/Black Luminary/ linkffn(12125300)

/What You Leave Behind/ doesn't really fulfill much of your criteria other than being Well Written, but I would definitely still recommend it if you enjoyed /The Mind Arts/ linkffn(10758358)

Lastly, /The Unwinding Golden Thread/ and /Concentric Wavelengths/ are almost nothing like /The Mind Arts/ but they both involve Grindelwald and are Well Written so I'll recommend them anyways.

**** No, no official pairing as of yet. The author is actually kind of all over the place in regards to how Harry interacts with women. Harry and Daphne just have a bit of a special relationship so I threw the story in there.

****** Yes, they have. Here's a quote from the AN in chapter 25:

#+begin_quote
  Now that we have gotten that out of the way, I do *NOT* want to allude that Harry will not end up with one of them [Hermoine, Tracey, Amy, Daphne, Astoria, Aenor]. Because he will. Which one, well, I doubt you'll get it right at this point in time. But you sure are welcome to guess. Bragging rights for whoever gets it right about a hundred chapters in advance! If someone should actually guesses right /and/ also predict correctly how it'll happen, I'll write a minor character in his (or her) honour that'll probably die a horrible death.
#+end_quote

Regarding romance in general though, I took this from the author's profile page:

#+begin_quote
  Romance will certainly play a part, though this is by no means a love story. However, I do not see the need to reveal with whom Harry will end up eventually. Once the story is finished, I'll probably add a tag, but not before. If you only read stories for pairings, I'm not entirely sure you'll be happy with this one.
#+end_quote

Romance and pairings are discussed more throughout other author's notes, but those two quotes give you the gist of it.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

** Hold up. Wasn't the Mind Arts had the wizarding population of only ten thousand in Britain? I had to quit right after that. The sheer amount of stupidity in involving such a low number makes my brain hurt. Unless the wizards are constantly using condoms to stop having babies, their numbers shouldn't be this low.

  canon WW is 3000
#+end_quote

This just shows JKR is absolutely terrible at world building. A population of 3000 is not enough to sustain a society.

If it was 3000, there wouldn't need to be a government with various departments, a body that passes laws, executive communication with the Head of the State of a nation with 60M people, and so on. If it was 3000, a simple council would be more than sufficient to take care of all aspects of governance and laws.

  ethnic cleansing

Any kind of ethnic cleansing will destroy a society with a population as small as 3000. Heck, a single mass killing would destroy it, forget systemic ethnic cleansing.

In the second bullet on behind the scenes. Fair to not, JRK is not good at math or the larger, more intricate parts of work building. I agree low numbers don't make much sense, but they aren't deal breakers for me, especially if war deaths where heavy and accidental deaths are more common in the wizarding world.

All you have to know is simply basic math, basic economy, and basic common /sense,/ to know that a society of ten thousand is simply unsustainable should /any/ kind of war breaks out within itself.

It's mind boggling to talk about a children book's fantasy and make a serious attempt to apply realistic principles to it and argue everything that doesn't follow reality is ridiculous... in a damn work of fiction. You're singlehandedly lowering the collective IQ of every fiction reader
