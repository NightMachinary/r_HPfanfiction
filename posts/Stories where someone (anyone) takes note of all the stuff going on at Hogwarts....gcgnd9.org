In linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) the ministry gets involved after the Basilisk incident and basically delves down deep into the health-and-safety nightmare that is Hogwarts. Basilisks, horcruxes, and animagi are all discovered as aurors sweep the castle and basically make everything safer.

Are there any other stories like this? Hogwarts is such a health-and-safety nightmare (Trolls, Cerberuses, Lord Voldemort, Basilisks, Dementors, Dragons, Lord Voldemort, Death Eaters, Blood Quills, Umbridge, Poisonings, Murders, and Lord Voldemort) that you'd think at some point in the 7 years Harry is at school someone from the DMLE or something might notice something. Or maybe someone, anyone might write home about all the crap that goes on. Any fics like this?


** Casual reminder that Hogwarts used to permit hanging students by their wrists as a punishment and that it seems that Dumbledore was the one who forbade it; that Dumbledore himself permitted corporal punishment to continue at Hogwarts (Arthur Weasley "still has the marks" from a punishment); that the Ministry reintroduced corporal punishment when it gained control of the school from Dumbledore in OotP.

I don't think wizards are generally supportive of the idea of protecting children from pain/harm/danger - which is an idea pretty unique to the last 120 years or so. At the time Dumbledore was born, child labour in dangerous industries was widespread, with children as young as 4 being sent to work in factories, and many children dying or contracting terminal illness in industries like chimney sweeping, mining etc.

*** Dumbledore became Headmaster when the Marauders were children, its quite likely that Arthur was at school when Dippet was Headmaster and punished under him.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  When Harry arrives at Gringotts, Hagrid produces the key but there's nothing else proving that the child is Harry Potter. What if there is a dark story behind the origin of the Boy-Who-Lived. Bashing Potters, Sirius and Dumbles. Good Goblins and Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. HEA in the end.
