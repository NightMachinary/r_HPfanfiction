Whether through an inheritance test, or an Evans family tree, or some other means, Harry Potter finds out that his grandfather (Lily Evan's Father) is the brother of US WWII Naval Hero, Cdr Ernest Edwin Evans.

How is this?

Harry's Grandfather also fought for the US Navy in WWII but in the Atlantic. He would move to Britain in the late 40s to distance himself from the U.S. and the memories of his dead brother. He would marry Lily's Mother (Harry's Grandmother) and live out the rest of his life in the UK.

How does this affect Harry?

That's for you to decide.
