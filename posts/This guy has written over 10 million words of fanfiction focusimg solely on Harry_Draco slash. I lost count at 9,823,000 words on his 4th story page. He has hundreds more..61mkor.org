** I'm genuinely curious as to why you were counting - what made you start?

Aside from that, Nora Roberts publishes 4-5 romance novels every year, some people are just prolific writers I guess? I wish I had that gift, haha.

** Am I the only one who thinks this is a bit disturbing? Am I really in the minority here? Legitimately curious. I don't think writing 20,000 words of Harry/Draco slash a week, every week without pause for 12 years is healthy.

  20,000 words of Harry/Draco slash a week

Setting aside the fact that it's not even true, how is the HP/DM slash part relevant to whether it's healthy?

Writing is clearly what the enjoys spending her free time doing.. I don't see how that's any more unhealthy than any other hobby one devotes a lot of time to.

**** Except it is true. Do the math if you don't believe me. If you knew someone who only spent their free time writing out a single pairing in FanFiction, don't lie to me and say that you wouldn't have some questions or be concerned. This subreddit never ceases to amaze me with how degenerate the audience is.

***** How do you figure that's the /only/ thing she spends her free time on?

I haven't added up her wordcount myself so I'll just trust that you're right, and assume she puts out 20k per week.

20k per week is a lot, but it's not an unfathomably huge amount. 2,858 words per day, so about two / three hours per day? Maybe less, since she's obvious pretty experienced. I wouldn't call that unhealthy.

Assuming it is a full three hours per day though, that's about [[https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/business/media/nielsen-survey-media-viewing.html][two hours less]] than the average American spends watching TV.

Hell, I spend 2+ hours every day commuting in the train. (Maybe I should start writing on the train...)

As for the pairing, she seems to write other stuff too. But even if we put that aside, almost everyone has a OTP that they love. It's normal.

Yes, you are. I'm envious of anyone who has found a hobby they enjoy that much, and the free time to indulge in it.

** Posting a link to someone just to make fun of them. Aren't you a charmer.

I've read a few of her fics and she's a great writer. Why don't you just keep your homophobia to yourself instead of pointing it out to everyone.

** What exactly is the point of this topic? Some people are prolific writers and able to churn out thousands of words like it's nothing. I personally do not enjoy her stories, but she has loads of fans, and she clearly enjoys writing and has a process that works for her once she gets an idea. It's not harming you, is it? Live and let live.

** She's not a guy. Also, not all of her stories are HP/DM as is immediately obvious if you actually looked at the list of her fics.

*** Gender is irrelevant here, this is pretty fucked regardless. Also, sorry to burst your bubble, but 90% of /her/ stories are Harry/Draco, and if you bothered to page through them and add up the word count, you'd see that about 99% are this pairing. So I fail to see your point.
