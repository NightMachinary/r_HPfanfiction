So this idea's been bouncing around my head for a while.

What if wizards were present in the Manhattan project, and directly contributed to the development of the atomic bomb? This was during the height of the Grindelwald war in Europe, so it's entirely possible that both sides attempted to send wizards or squibs into the project.

Alternatively, one of the qualified individuals who was invited to participate in the project was a wizard/squib, and once this came to light his knowledge would be in great demand. I, personally, might tie this in to a Tom Riddle era fic, where Hogwarts might invite the person in question to be a guest lecturer or something along those lines.

This might even lead to Riddle getting mentored by a wizard (or squib!) who instills in him a fear/respect/appreciation of non-magicals and what they are capable of, leading to a change in his political stances...

  One-shot. In an alternate history where the Blitz lasted a few months longer in London, the young Tom Riddle's life takes a very different turn.

** I know that PoA has a scene where there's a [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wizard_in_the_Leaky_Cauldron][wizard]] in the leaky cauldron reading A Brief History of Time while wandlessly stirring his tea. Maybe he's supposed to be an Unspeakable or something. Judging by that, magical physicists would probably be a thing.
