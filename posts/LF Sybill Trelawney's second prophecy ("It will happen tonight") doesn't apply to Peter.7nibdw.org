  "It will happen tonight. The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by his followers. His servant has been chained these twelve years. Tonight, before midnight... the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master. The Dark Lord will rise again with his servant's aid, greater and more terrible than ever he was."

Now, prophecies aren't binding, unless you're in a fanfic that says they have some mystical binding power. But what if Peter were killed in the Shrieking Shack, or otherwise didn't escape, or he got away, but didn't return to Voldemort, but this particular prophecy still came true?

Think about it; MacNair, a former Death Eater, is on the grounds that night, and the time between sunset (Buckbeak's thwarted execution) and midnight is plenty of time for Lucius Malfoy to hear of Sirius's apprehension-but-innocence.

And if Barty Crouch Sr. were called to account for sending Sirius to Azkaban without trial or questioning, any shock (psychological, or from being hit by a stunning spell, or anything) could allow the Imperius on his son to break; any of those three Death Eaters (the first two 'chained' by the need for discretion and public image, the latter chained by the Imperius) could fulfill the prophecy within the given time limit.

Heck, if Peter were killed by Sirius & Lupin in the shack, his murder (and yes, revenge-killing is still murder) could wake up the shard of Voldemort's soul in Harry's head; it could be the servant chained for 12 years, either bursting out of Harry's head to rejoin Voldemort, or possessing Harry's body.

So, does anyone know any such stories where that second prophecy, doesn't apply to Peter?


** Only a semi-related question, but: Is there any historical precedent for being incarcerated for murdering someone who faked their death, serving your sentence, being released, and then /actually/ murdering them?

I mean... could you be charged for murdering the same person twice?

**** That's called Double Jeopardy and that wouldn't apply here.

For example, if you rob a convenience store and the case goes to trial and a verdict is decided, either guilty or not, you don't, in the future, have legal impunity for robbing that same convenience store.

Double Jeopardy is for /a case/, not a specific /crime/.

***** Unless you mean it doesn't apply in the UK, then this would be an example of double jeopardy. You can't charge someone for murdering the same person twice because, due to the nature of the crime, you can only murder someone once.

**** I'll assume you're referring to Double Jeopardy, as the other factors of the fifth amendment don't apply.

I replied this to someone else, but Double Jeopardy wouldn't apply, here. It's meant to prevent you from being tried twice for the same charges, not any specific crime.

Although, if we're talking about the UK, I think Double Jeopardy doesn't apply to murder cases, since 2003.

** In retrospect, calling Peter /chained/ is really stretching the meaning of words, even for a prophecy. There was nothing stopping him from leaving at any point, and nothing materially changed to allow Peter to seek Voldemort. If anything his discovery /limited/ his options further, forcing him to seek Voldemort when he would have preferred ignominy. Hard to call the intentionally neglected last resort freedom.

I agree that he was free to go seek Voldemort at any time, as Quirrell did the year before, but Peter was hardly a free man. Legally dead, any attempt by him to re-integrate into wizarding Britain (his home) would raise a great number of uncomfortable questions.

He could have attempted a quiet life on the continent or overseas, but without desperation pushing him to illegally travel across borders and risk recognition he could very well have felt trapped. Aside from the fact that he may not have known other languages/had the connections to falsify identification.

**** It's fair to think that Peter's metaphorically trapped. But he's hardly being freed by having his options narrowed further.

**** Hmm, I wonder...who else could Peter have possibly turned to?

He could theoretically create a false identity and go try and live life somewhere else, but even if he went to the other side of the planet (like, New Zealand), he'd have to either live as an isolated hermit and handle all of his own food and water and shelter and entertainment and all of his other needs, or he could live amongst muggles, and go to elaborate lengths with mind-affecting charms to create his cover, or he could try and live among wizards, and again have to create some kind of false identity that can pass magical examination.

Practically speaking, spy for the Death Eaters or not, creating a false identity out of whole cloth and starting a new life with it would most likely be beyond Peter's ability to do alone. For that matter, returning to masquerading as a pet rat is probably out of his reach too; he'd be highly unlikely to find a family in a foreign land that needs a pet enough (and is hard up for cash enough) that they'll take an old rat (who's missing half his fur from stress) from the garden, that and missing half his hair and a toe would make it hard for him to sneakily dispose of and replace an existing pet rat, assuming he can find a family who already owns pet rats.

So yeah, if Peter can't go back to being a pet rat, and he can't create a cover identity that won't fall apart, his only choice really is to seek help from somebody he knows.

But all of his former friends want to kill him (or send him to the worse-than-death Dementors) for being turned by Voldemort, all of the former Death Eaters want to kill him for supposedly betraying them, most anyone else would turn him in after learning of his involvement with Voldemort, and even if they didn't he'd be highly vulnerable to blackmail...basically, he's legally dead, and everyone wants to make him factually dead too.

Voldemort is pretty much the only one he can turn to for help, because the Dark Lord is in just as dire straits as Peter is. If not more, really.

***** Even after Prisoner of Azkaban, Peter was still "dead". Dumbledore says "there's not a shred of evidence" to support Harry and Hermione's story. Getting a long way from Britain and finding a small community, even one with access to magical amenities, wasn't out of the question.

What pushed Peter to Voldemort was his pathological need for external validation. He didn't consider running off solo because he's psychologically incapable of being alone, and Voldemort is the only one he already knew would accept him.

Perhaps if he hadn't spent twelve years as a rat he would have been a bit more rational and able to see other options.

***** If it was not for plot he could have gone rat and become a pet to some random person out of millions again and never been found for the rest of his life. :( But yes plot made his best friends find him after twelve years and made him the pet of the best friend of his best friend's son. :( Also plot made him go to Voldemort after that. :( He could have hidden easily in the world again, but he did not.
