My wife has decided that she wants to try reading some Harry Potter fanfic since it's something I enjoy reading. So I'm looking for a good first fic for her to read.

She tends to like romance books, even the horrible cheesy ones, but also likes a bit of mystery, action, or suspense in there as well. No works in progress, she's not very patient and I think she'd rather read something with an ending. Something well written and not overly long given it's her first one. I'm also thinking something not crazy canon divergent, so it's not a huge shock to her and won't make her stop reading when Harry starts dating a house elf or something.

Thanks in advance!


** I think linkffn(I Know Not And I Cannot Know - Yet I Live and I Love) is a great beginning point. Very well written, short, and close to canon.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** Always start with [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Nineteen Years and Beyond by Northumbrian]] series. Start with “Tales of the Battle” and go on (the previous stories are good as well, but I think TotB is the best start).

** Usually, I wouldn't recommend any of the following fics to someone, but it's probably best to read a trope heavy fic before being fed up by said tropes :

Harry Potter and the Method of Rationality. It was the 1st fanfic I read and it left me an excellent impression (which was destroyed years later when I made the mistake of re reading it). Though the story is kinda crazy and the various problems around the author are not helping.

Otherwise, wouldn't any fic written by RobSt be a good start? I personally dislike him because of his OTP (always the same Harmony with the same Perfect Hermione), but he does write romance and, from what I remember, doesn't really do crazy (if you except things like perfect goblins). Since she never read fanfics, she won't even be bothered by the cliches he uses.

*** You're suggesting how a lot of people started of Fanfiction. Stumble across it somehow and end up reading the truly bad stuff with an unexplainable amount of favourites, then gradually their taste improves and they read better quality writing

Although you didn't suggest ‘My Immortal' so that's a start ;)

**** Haha that's a good suggestion, not the my immortal one, that's trash, but something with heavy tropes may not be a bad idea. They are usually just big cool ideas that everyone loves the first time they read them. They just get old and tired after the 20th time.

** I typically don't self promote but my story may be a good first step into fanfic. Although the story obviously diverges from canon it sticks to the tone of the books and the world already created. No bashing of canon characters either. Fairly short too. Edited to add it's a romance as well (Daphne/Harry)

  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.

** Here's a list of stuff that I really like! Please pick and choose. Whatever you like. If you don't like any that's fine too.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9297215]]) follows Dean and Seamus through the years. It's actually amazing, even if not centered on the main characters. I'm actually sure you won't regret reading these, it is very canon compliant and probably okay for a first time reader. COMPLETE

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6458305]]) has Dudley redemption...and his daughter is a witch. COMPLETE

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/951044]]) is an amazing post hogwarts fic in which Ron and Draco have a lot to do with. Draco redemption, Ron and Harry friendship, Ron and Draco friendship. COMPLETE

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/866743]]) Is Dudley redemption in which he is kicked out of his home for being gay. We love Petunia and Vernon. COMPLETE

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498]]) is incredible. A series of what ifs, with 16 works, each about 8000 words. COMPLETE

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7129525/1/Dudley-Dursley-and-the-Quest-for-Truth]]) In which Dudley learns more about wizards and witches in the safehouse, and starts to realize that his parents may not always be right. Set in Harry's 7th year: Dudley starts to become a good person. COMPLETE

Edit: Edited down to more canon compliant stuff even if its centered on other characters. Might be interesting.

** If she likes Romance Novels, she'll probably like Future's Past by Darkseraphina. It's written in full "Oh, Mr Darcy, how very forward of you!" Romance-Novel style prose and the romance is quite fun - time-travelling fem!Harry with Orion Black, and they've got a very tumultuous tug-of-war type dynamic that I enjoy greatly. It's very similar to Claire in the TV Show Outlander, if she's familiar (if not, she'll probably enjoy it as well - it's got similar vibes!).
