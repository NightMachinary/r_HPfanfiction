So I've been watching the new Netflix series /Big Mouth/, which is somewhat hit-and-miss for me personally, but one plot device I really like is how the preteen characters' libidos and other urges come to life as a "Hormone Monster" and "Hormone Monstress" (which only they can see, btw). Seeing puberty embodied by a literal giant furry monster is, I think, quite a brilliant move, and it made me wonder: are there any HBP-set fics out there where Harry's "chest monster" morphs into an actual monster that follows him around and talks with him? Consider this a prompt if no such fics exist yet.

(Since I can already sense that /somebody/ out there is going to mention it, I'm going to go ahead and include a link to that old Robot Chicken sketch about [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-eZ6Prg1ww][the Pubertis monster]].)


** Lol. I can imagine the chest monster becoming obsessed with Ginny, and Molly Weasley goes all Ripley on the monster - "Not my daughter you bitch!"

*** Well, my idea was that it would be a monster that only Harry was able to see and interact with, but that's a pretty funny idea...

And now that I think of it, here's an even better idea: what if Luna, due to the sheer power of her quirkiness, was also able to see Harry's monster, which she thought was a Crumple-Horned Snorkack?

**** That's pretty good too! I was just going along with the whole alien-chestbuster angle.

** Ohhhh I know this may not be exactly what you're looking for (and you'll probably have a hell of a time finding it) but in Drop Dead Gorgeous by Maya, Harry is part-Veela, and the 'chest monster' is actually his Veela instincts trying to claim a mate.

Iirc, Malfoy names it Horace and demands that it gets hazard pay.

Basically it's one of the funniest things I have /ever read in my entire life/

*** Unless this is a bootleg copy where somebody else stole the idea and rewrote the whole fic, it appears to be available [[https://app.box.com/shared/jnapbqp4si4imjl2dc26][here]].

Also, holy crap, the fic has its own [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13283197-drop-dead-gorgeous][Goodreads]] and [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Drop_Dead_Gorgeous][Fanlore]] pages. I'm impressed.
