/"Your mother can't produce food out of thin air,” said Hermione. “No one can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfigur--”/

/“Oh, speak English, can't you?” Ron said, prising a fish bone out from between his teeth./

/“It's impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you've already got some--”/

-HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS

--------------

This idea came from something I posted on another thread where I wanted to see fics exploring Molly's day to day life as a magical housewife with a limited budget. How does she make ends meet, what charms and spells does she know to prepare food and do other chores, what's her dynamic with Arthur like, etc. And then this silly "what if" intruded... What if out of desperation one day...

/...It was very a bad day. She had already run out of supplies in her larder and Arthur would only get his salary the day after tomorrow. She had to put food on the table or the family would go hungry. Maybe there was a tiny chance that there were some ingredients left.../

So Molly waves her wand to do a spell that was supposed to be a hybrid of increasing the quantity of something and transforming it--except she hasn't increased or transformed anything. She actually produced food out of thin air! Not being that bookish, she thinks that:

1. she's finally gotten the hang of an advanced household spell
2. there must have been crumbs of bread left that she managed to increase into a whole loaf, and other bits and pieces of ingredients that got transformed to a stew--not feast level quantity but enough for sharing as long as she rationed out the portions.

...But really, she managed to disprove Gamp's law. Since that day, she has unknowingly been repeating that feat when in tight situations.

*** I actually ended up reading about theories on that event a few minutes after posting the prompt. The exchange can be found here: [[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/93306/how-did-molly-weasley-make-sauce-out-of-nothing-if-gamps-law-states-that-this-i]]

**** I now think it would be funny if someone "discovers" what Molly is doing setting off Hermione and other like-minded people to debate using the arguments laid out in the website linked above. Some world renowned Transfiguration masters come to investigate and declare Molly to really have disproved Gamp's law leaving everyone else flabbergasted. Then Ron smugly declares, "I told you that my mother can make good food appear out of thin air." :-)

*** Well they do imply that the Weasley's have a very large garden. That would save a lot of money on food.

** What people tend to forget is that Molly Weasley got 11 owls at Hogwarts. The woman was phenomenal at Transfiguration and Arthimancy. It was to the great disappointment of many a master spell crafter when she chose to be a homemaker instead of going for her mastery. Her cookbooks have been hailed as miraculous for the quantities of confectionery that enable the user to summon. And quite a few spell crafting contemporaries on the continent have started examining the intricacies of the wind movements and before the War More than one magical university had requested Mrs. Weasley present her spell crafting theory to their students.

​

Molly Weasley turn them down but she did go on A book tour A few years after Hugo Weasley was born, She finally had an empty nest and had some time to kill so at the urging of Arthur who is finally ready to retire she started to submerge herself back in the world of academia, Much to the shock of her children and the delight of the spell crafting community, This was the woman who managed to circumvent one of the cardinal laws of transfiguration after all. Her work was a stroke of brilliance

*** For a few seconds I thought I was reading one of those articles on Pottermore that try to expand on the Harry Potter characters' back stories. And then I remembered that this was a prompt. :-) Thanks for this.

*** You know it's a good prompt if the beginning makes you think it was the author or the original series that wrote that.

**** This is a prompt. Sorry I know I made it sound like you were reading an article from Wikipedia or something, But it's all just prompt inspired character backstory, I honestly have no idea how many owls Molly Weasley got in cannon. Everything I wrote was inspired by the prompt above

** There's quite a lot of fanfics that completely ignore this law. I've lost count of the times I read about some character conjuring up a tea set and scones, or biscuits, and so on...

It's annoying to see how many times you see it, or when some author has completely skipped over how suddenly Harry, Hermione, and the rest of the gang can all produce corporeal patroni, at age 13, when Harry has to have a boggart/dementor to learn it and it still took him forever and he didn't start teaching it to the DA until 5th year...
