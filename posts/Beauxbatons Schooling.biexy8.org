There are a lot of fics that revolve arou d Harry going to some strange unheard of school or Durmstrang besides Hogwarts. Yet I have not found one where he goes to Beauxbatons instead. So that is what I am looking for, a fic where Harry goes to Beauxbatons instead of Hogwarts.


** Linkffn(The Duelist by Sereven) is the only one I can think of.

  Albus still didn't fully understand what magic young Lily had wrought that night. At the time, he'd only been grateful her noble sacrifice had earned them peace, however temporary. He should have looked into it deeper. He should have done something. Unknowingly, long dead, that arrogant girl might just have ruined everything. (independent!GWL, black/white magic)

  In which Harry goes to Beauxbâtons instead of Hogwarts. Butterfly effects ensue, with Voldemort reviving without opposition from Harry, Dumbledore trying to save the situation and Fudge making everything worse. Meanwhile, Harry learns French.

Confession, it's long, slow going and I've never read it to the end. But what I have read is good.

** I don't know of any where Harry goes to Beauxbatons instead of Hogwarts, but in linkffn(Harry Potter: Unchampion) he transfers there after 4th year. There's another one, but I can't remember the name, in which Harry unlocks metamorphmagus abilities, and he and Hermione both go to Beauxbatons as girls.
