Could be drabble/oneshot/multichapter.

Just imagining James Sirius Potter calling Kingsley Shacklebolt "Uncle" in front of people, or the Weasley or Potter kids talking to Professor Neville Longbottom casually, or such.

They'd be around influential people so often, that it wouldn't even phase them, they wouldn't even consider them famous. Whereas there's a new band or something like that, that's "less famous" and they go nuts over.
