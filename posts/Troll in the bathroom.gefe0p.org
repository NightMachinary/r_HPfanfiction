What if..

Halloween of First Year, Hermione shrugs off the insult by Ron, but Harry is continually reminded of his parents death, putting him crying in the bathroom when the troll breaks in?


** Would they ever even become friends? I feel like Neville would step up. Oh the possibilities.

** Under the circumstances, /Hermione/ might try to comfort him, with persistence, logic, but no empathy whatsoever. It could be glorious.

*** To elaborate, imagine someone like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_Nor%C3%A9n][Saga Nor√©n]] trying to do it; while Hermione is probably not on the autism spectrum, it's not a stretch for early-canon Hermione to make the same kinds of mistakes.

Imagine her quoting statistics about how /most/ orphans still end up OK or remarking how Harry appears to be reasonably well-adjusted ordinarily, and so his parents' death does not appear to have affected him that much.

For the record, this isn't intended to be a bash but rather a setup for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cringe_comedy][cringe comedy]]; while Hermione isn't very helpful in the moment, Harry does appreciate her good intentions in the long run, and they do end up fighting or escaping a troll together.
