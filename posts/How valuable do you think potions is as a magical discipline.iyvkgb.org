I think it's definitely useful enough to have as a core class to teach everyone the basics, but in your head canon, does it add enough value to specialise in?

Why would you brew potions if you could just buy them? Are there added benefits to making your own? How do you imagine regular Wizards, or specialized professionals (aurors, curse breakers, professors etc) use potions?

Could you recommend any noteworthy fanfics or fantasy stories in which you liked the use of potions?


** Why do you cook meals when you can just order takeout?

I imagine it's cheaper to make your own potions (especially if you also collect/grow your own ingredients), probably more efficient for easy/quick brews, and you would have more control over the brewing process and quality of the ingredients.

Anyone who works in potentially dangerous situations (aurors, curse-breakers, anyone working with animals, etc) would presumably want the wizarding equivalent of a first aid kit to hand - dittany, essence of murtlap, anti-venom etc. Most households would probably have these as well!

*** That's the thing, it seems like in most Harry Potter stories they are almost exclusively medical (except luck, love and polyjuice)

I'd like to think there's also enhancement portions for dangerous or demanding professions or recreational stuff for the general population.

**** There are lots of medical ones, but off the top of my head there are also ones for general health, beauty (pimple solution, sleakeazy's), cleaning (doxycide). There are probably specialised potions for Herbology and Magizoology (fertilisers, feed etc), maybe duelling (something to do with accuracy or reflexes?) - I'm pretty sure study aids are mentioned in the books too?

But yeah, I'm sure that if you can imagine it, there'll be a potion for it!

** If you think buying something is worth it, who's gonna make that thing ?

Here you go, you have your answer.

After that, it's just a matter of supply and demand. If few people try to make a living out of making potions, then going for a potion-related job would probably be good business-wise.

Anything beyond that is a matter of creativity. But I can definitely imagine a potion master fighting with potions : grenades, temporary boosts to... “stats”, poisons... plenty of opportunities here.

** i mean, in an ideal world the point of a school is to teach students information that they will find useful in life.

it's like a combination of cooking, pharmacology, or chemistry classes at a high school. most people cook for themselves. people don't make their own medications, but it's still good to know how they work; and for those who go on into fields where that information is relevant, it's important to get a solid grounding in the basics.

imo it makes sense to make your own potions instead of buying them if you don't have a ton of money but do have the knowlege; like how some people make herbal stuff to treat minor complaints irl. willow bark tinctures instead of aspirin, valerian teas for insomnia, stuff like that. hell, there's an online collective dedicated to creating safe homemade HRT.

i'm not too familiar with British school systems, but to my knowlege most schools irl require students to take science up to a certain level; the stuff i learned then is still useful now. i imagine it's the same in this particular fictional world (or would be if Snape was a good teacher.)

*** Yea I agree, I was just wondering if people would think it a worth while specialization when students can pick flashier wand waving subjects. (Like Snape implied and many fics also put potions on lower priority when Harry starts actually learning)

**** i mean, plenty of ppl irl choose to drop science classes once they have the option. i think it's all subjective here, especially when you take into account that Snape's shitty teaching probably made a lot of students less likely to continue taking the class (or to consider careers in which Potions knowlege would be useful.)

#+end_quote

Think of everything chemical in your life, from drugs to cleaning products to cosmetics to paints, etc. In the wizarding world all that shit is potions.

So the common wizard has instant dry/no dribble paint, magical mess remover, fx tier cosmetics, etc.

Healers have drugs, enough said.

Aurors have magical luminol, veritaserum, antidotes, throw an object and a vial of blood in the cauldron and the potion tells you if the blood donor touched the object, etc.

Curse breakers likely need it as drugs to heal themselves after they receive their just deserts for being dirty graverobbers.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes, because you need professionals dedicating themselves to research and production. You don't expect a doctor to mix his own drugs, a policeman to mix his own luminol, your ass to mix your own degreaser. Many potions are also mentioned to be too hard to be made by amateurs, and the ingredients too expensive to risk wasting them.

** I mean, if nobody takes potions, then there's no more potioneers to make potions for people to buy. So, it's going to be lucrative if you specialise in selling.

In terms of day to day life, I'd say it's kind of like Food Tech is for us (cooking class from secondary school, basically). It can be useful and lucrative if you specialise in it as a career, but otherwise it's just slightly cheaper to make stuff yourself than buying it from someone else (home cooking vs take-out). There's probably a lot of the easier day to day stuff at the 'plaster and ibuprofen' level that people can make easily if they wanna put the time in, too.

I always imagined Curse Breaking to use it a lot. It's pretty common for older civilizations to anoint (ceremonially oil up) their dead, so perhaps magicals made magical ointments that had effects which were best avoided or dispelled with potions. Or if you can't poke your wand through a gap to dispel a trap, you get a drip and let a potion flow through that'll do the job for you. That kinda thing.

Aurors might use flashbombs if there's somewhere they can arc a potion but not line-cast a spell. Or emergency 'health potions' (adrenaline, big painkillers, etc) if they don't have time to cast actual medical magic. Or anything where they don't have the focus or headspace to cast regular magic, I guess.

At the end of the day, Rowling's toolkit is flexible enough that you can basically pick a function you need for your story and invent a magical doodad or spell to solve it and it'll probably fit just fine.

** It definitely does. Specialized Potioners don't waste their time brewing easy potion like a cure for boils. They probably brew difficult potions (Felix Felicis, Veritaserum, or any other "difficult" one not mentioned in canon) where they can maximize their profit and must spend most of their time doing research.

Anyone managing to create a new potion (Wolfbane) or to modify an existing potion enough to reduce its cost must have struck rich. Most of the "simple" potions are probably sold as a side product for another business (Apothicary, Joke shop . . .).

** I imagine most people would simply buy potions from people who make them full-time as their career. Better than accidentally poisoning yourself. Aurors can simply buy the potions they need. Aurors have no real need to adapt potions, though they do need potion knowledge to recognize them and investigate their use.

I think that potions becomes very important to a few select careers (potion makers, healers) and those at the highest magical levels (Dumbledore/Voldemort). Healers might need to synthesize new antidotes like in Arthur's case, for example. At the highest level, potions do things curses can't do. Voldemort's cave potion, for example.

**** Well he uses high-level potions (albeit it's probably Snape who brews it) to contain an unknown curse within his hand. He could fuel his trinkets with potions and they do a bunch of weird things. The little thing that shows him that Harry is not possessed by Voldemort emits smoke puffs. I always imagined that the Pensieve contains also some sort of potion that serves to both store the thoughts and allow you to sink into them.

** 1) it's likely cheaper to do so 2) if you are confident in your abilities and have time, you can whip up a potion for whatever you need a potion for. 3) you can be confident in the potency of the potion and know that you brewed it right. 4) goes along with 3 I read a fic where people would do this so they could make sure that fresh ingridients vs old ingredients were used if that helps the potions potency 5)aurors knowing potions would also help them to be able to identify potions they encounter in the field/maybe know how to counteract them which can help when time is of the essence by

** I think in a modern fantasy setting it'd make more sense mass producing potions. Ingredients would be produced by specialized farmers, brewing would be done thousands of doses at once. Government agency to ensure quality. People venturing into the forest to gather a few handfuls of ingredients and brewing in a small cauldron at home isn't really economical.

There'd still be a large requirement for many professions to know basic potions knowledge in order to learn things like recognizing poisons and quickly administering the right counter, recognizing spoiled medical potions, and inventing new recipes.
