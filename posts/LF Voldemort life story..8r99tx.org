Really want a story that makes you side with Voldemort's choices, Grows up in orphanage, Hogwarts years, desperate need to avoid death(Horcruxes). Validation in wizarding war.


** One could argue that Limpieza de Sangre does this. It's a female!Voldemort but you get to see most of her life, discover why she did a lot of what she did, and more.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

*** Thanks for posting this.

Just finished reading it, Exactly what I was looking for, minus the female Voldemort. Though my libido might disagree with my brain and consider it an improvement.

this one does it in an AU sort of way that's canon compliant. Its beautiful and twisted . Where tom riddle grows up isolated and disturbingly advanced for his age, because he grew up with adult horcrux harry in his head.
