(For those of you who don't know, /Tom Riddle's Schooldays/ is a fanfic series that details Tom Riddle's school years and for now just 4 books out of 7 are out )

Apparently the site has expired so are there some mirrors or something?


** I have the four downloaded in epub format. I don't think this Reddit permits me sharing it, but you can pm me later if nobody else can provide the links.
