** Sport does not lend itself well to stand alone plot. That's why there's almsot always something else there, like a character biopic or a romance or anything. The drawn out and repetitive nature of it, in any sport, will always make that a hard sell. There needs to be something more.

For example, the 1976 F1 season isn't really that much more interesting than the 1975 F1 season if you just look at the mechanics of the races. What's interesting, and had a profound affect on the sport as a whole and likely helped create modern sport broadcasting as we know it, is the Hunt and Lauda rivalry. That's why there's a movie about that, and not the specific races.

Sport makes a good backdrop to develop and understand people. It does not make for good plot.

*** I wasn't saying not completely without romance it just seems like any quidditch fanfic i find eventually shifts to be completely about the romance and glosses over the quidditch aspect.

*** this fic is so underrated. one of my top 10's, wish it would be updated to badly. At least the last chapter isn't a bad stopping point, as far as abandoned fics go.

Although the OP is looking for more quidditch oriented fics rather than romance, I think this strikes a happy medium between the two.

**** I know it's a world of magic, but it feels too unrealistic. Like, it turns quidditch into a bloodsport, but I feel like with the way it's presented people should actually be dying. Like, iron bludgers flying at a hundred miles an hour and hitting people in the head, things like that.

***** yeah there is definitely some required suspension of disbelief, with some incredibly (and unrealistically) durable atheletes capable of sustaining stupidly fatal injuries over and over again.

at the same time, the rest of the fic is good enough that I'm willing to look past that, even if I'm rolling my eyes at some action scenes
