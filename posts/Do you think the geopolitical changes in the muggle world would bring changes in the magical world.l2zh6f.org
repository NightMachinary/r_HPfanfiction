This has been on my mind for a while and I'd love to get different perspectives on it. So let me know what you think.

The world has gone through massive geopolitical changes over the last millenium.

Witches and Wizards, while having their own form of evolution, development and society, have had their own way to life.

In the 1600s, the statute of secrecy became international legislation. However there is a possibility it was practiced domestically as well in kingdoms.

So, do you think geopolitical changes would've affected magical society? Like the formation and dissolution of USSR, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, The Kingdom of Prussia, the changing of hands of Alaska etc.

Not to mention the number of times boundaries were changes in European nations prior and post WW 1.

One particularly interesting point is, what do you think would happen to magicals in countries that were colonised? Like Brazil, African countries, India, Vietnam etc. Would the magical societies have been suppressed and conquered or would they have escaped the clutches of the colonisers?

Let me know your thoughts.

Edit : If yes, to what extent would the changes be reflected in magicals?


** Honestly, it is much easier to just use the 1692 borders and roll with that. The war of Spanish succession is perhaps the last conflict which might have bled over.

Personally, I think that most magical nations are still monarchies. The changes which led to democracy (agricultural, industrial and medical revolution) are irrelevant to the magical world, as are most other issues which led to the abolishment of monarchies.

That is not to say that the magical world is full of absolute monarchies, but at least the leadership would pass along the royal line. After all, the separation of the worlds was about secrecy, not about changing government forms.

Most of these places would never have been magically colonised. After all, you separated the worlds in 1692. There would be a few trading exclaves in Asia, but those are outposts at most. The only place which would be interesting is North America because there would be no US. Because even if, for some reason, the British colonies revolted, most of the land is French or Spanish claimed. And with magic, it is a lot easier to project force. The French could leverage their whole Auror force to put down a colonial revolt and be back for lunch rather than having them unavailable for months. The Spanish colonial Empire is a lot harder to judge. After all, they lost it because they were devasted by a lot of wars before Napoleon delivered the coup de grace. All of that has never happened in the magical world.

Edit:

Also, quite a few places would have no nations since that concept was only introduced there by imperialism and the independence movements afterwards. Places like Australia come to mind.

*** I don't feel the magical world could support monarchies at all. The premise of the feudal system was that the King owned all the land, and then gave it out in return for money/soldiers to enforce his rule with. The magical world just seems too small and decentralised for that to work with. As far as I can tell if you have a wand you are functionally self sufficient, and there is no way of stopping somebody apparating into a random field, putting up muggle repelling charms and living out their entire life without anybody else finding them. Any form of magical governance had to be opt-in, which explains how it was so easy for Voldemort to take over the ministry. With the exception of those who worked there or were being specifically hunted, the most that affected people was who was responsible for stopping shoplifters in Diagon Alley.

**** A lot of tribal people had kings or chieftains, not for the sake of land distribution, but for the sake of following a strong leader. And, especially without codified laws such as ours, monarchies make succession clear. By having a known heir for a few decades, you prevent a lot of the cases where people fight for power.

Nevermind that until 1692, the worlds were not separated. The "opt-in" government was not an issue, they had no issue with following a Muggle King (albeit probably with a lot of autonomy). Outside of England, a few city states and to a lesser degree, the Netherlands and Sweden, there was no parliamentary tradition. Monarchy was the way to go for 95% of magical Europe.

***** Before the SoS it wasn't illegal to show a muggle magic. That is very different from all magicals being eager subjects of the muggle monarchs. The Wizengamot is named after the Witenagemot, which was the Saxon council of lords. It it therefore plausable to suggest that this institution, and therefore at least some element of wizarding self-rule, predates the Norman conquest. Remember that the wizarding world is a lot smaller than the muggle one, and therefore can afford to be more flexible in its governing structure.

** It has to? Surely? Flamethrower, the author if you've read any of their stuff, really goes in heavy on all the geopolitics of magic so most of my opinions are based on their stories.

But countries with a monarchy surely have a "wizard lord" person? Like Merlin was to Arthur? The Ministry has a "Muggle Government" section. I can only assume that whatever the Muggle country does, the Wizard community has to follow since the Muggles are bigger and more numerous and don't have to hide anything. So I'd a country changes hands, the wizards have to adapt.

Perks of Harry Potter taking place on an island instead of central europe. No border problems. ....Let's not talk about Irish wizards....

The international statute, is kinda dumb and full of holes since Muggleborns are a thing right? If there's 1 witch in a family of 5 and we assume all those siblings then know that magic exists? That's not many generations until everyone has a cousin with magic right? And it only works if literally every single country agrees to do it, otherwise we'd be seeing wizards whenever we went on holiday? Or at the very least talking to locals who knew wizards?

I don't know about colonisation but I can only assume they went the same way as muggle colonisations because you know, racism.

*** Well I get the need to adapt, but I'm wondering how far the change would go if it happened.

Arthur had Merlin, yes, but that was a different age altogether in comparison to the near 1600s. By that time, monarchies were losing power. I'm not sure when Magna Carta came in place in Britain. So it's not necessary that monarchies were supported by the Wizards. There's a high likelihood the magicals had disassociated themselves by thay point and had begun avoiding muggles.

If you look at countries in Africa, Latin America or Middle East, Greece, Indian Subcontinent, all these places underwent changes in regime and administration on a regular basis. Be it at a tribal level, city level or larger.

Isn't it possible that magicals would've gone further into seclusion to avoid being subjected to problems or having their powers misused, and thereby hidden their magic from muggles?

With respect to Colonialism, I'm not so sure. The Wiki describes the African school to be powerful, users of wandless magic and all the students are animagii. So I'm not sure Colonial wizards, if they existed, would've been able to subjugate them as easily as muggles.

Thanks for the fic. I'll definitely check it out.

I never really liked this. It cheapens the whole idea of wands just for the sake of trying to give Uagadou some brownie points.

Not even Dumbledore and Voldemort, despite having seen all kinds of magic all over, decided to ditch their wands in favour of going wandless.

There might be some advantages, like not being disarmed (unless it happens quite literally), but I like to think that the average well-trained wand user can stomp the average well-trained wandless user.

The main, seven-books canon lean heavily in favour of wands fine-tuning wizards' magic. Hell, not being able to use a wand is one of the biggest reasons behind the goblins' butthurt-ness.

***** Lol, I agree. Not a fan on wandless magic myself. It makes understanding the magic system as a whole a lot more annoying because it changes everything.

NGL, Grindelwald using it is pretty cool, in FB 2, but yeah.

** I like this as a very interesting thought experiment of how societies could have developed given different pressures. My reading is that the Statute of Secrecy was officially enforced by European wizards from 1692. Logically, for it to have been enforceable, the societies must already have been completely separate, probably for a long time before that and then waited for the final holdouts to die off before codifying it. So I say the last major influences of the muggle world would have been in 1600 or so.

I can't see wizards being major colonisers even before the SoS as the major driving force behind emigration from Europe was escaping from persecution and lack of economic opportunity. For wizards you just need to apparate into a random field, set up muggle-repelling charms and you are set for life. No need to cross the Atlantic for that.

Therefore the fate of magical communities in colonised areas would have been dependent on how much collateral damage they suffered from the subjugation of their muggle counterparts. In the Americas they may have been mostly wiped out by the plagues and genocides, or left untouched healing and hiding themselves with magic. In places with long standing existing 'civilisation' like China and India, they probably were already mostly separated from the muggle world, if only because one day they decided they didn't want to pay taxes, and so stayed like that.

I think that most geopolitical shifts after the SoS would have passed them by, unless you headcannon that there were some magicals working with muggle leadership to impose them. On the other hand hundreds of years of history would have led them to have their own politics. Drawing magical boarders from the late stages of an EUIV game would be as valid as anything, and probably quite fun. Maybe the Catholic Church, which must know about magic, decided to annex Greece, or the British Isles is a single magical nation because a group of Irish wizards conquered England using mercenaries payed for with Leprechaun gold. Then when the mercenaries realised they had been tricked and were out for revenge, the Irish were only saved by the intervention of a fearsome clan of Welsh dragon tamers, and swore fealty in return. Go wild.

*** My own theory is very similar to yours in the beginning. I too believe that in order for thr SoS to be adopted, it probably would've been in practice for much longer and it was only enacted to hold people accountable and tie up lose ends. That's one of the pillars on which international conventions developed in the past.

With regards to Monarchies, the Divine origin theory was the predominant theory in place with the development of state. One of the reasons why rulers were closely associated with the clergy. They told people they were sent by god to rule.

I don't believe that Wizards would bow to an individual without magic or believe in that theory and hence would have broken off a bit earlier. They would have started off as their own small societies hidden away and grown from there.

Also the persecution of magicals by the religious would make more sense if they refused to follow their orders or be under their control.

I don't believe that magicals were colonised either. I believe they would have escaped or hidden their resources away if only to spite the colonisers or.to protect their own heritage.

However in Asia and Africa, particularly India and China, as per the religious stories and faith, magic appears more integrated into the culture. So how it would have turned out there is still something to see.
