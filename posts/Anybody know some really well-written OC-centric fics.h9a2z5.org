I know it's not everybody's cup of tea, but I do enjoy a really well done OC-centric HP fic. Perhaps it's because some of the ones I've read have taken the opportunity to use their OC as a way to further "explore" the world, or perhaps make some interesting headcanons. I live for off-beat OC characters that play off the canon cast in interesting ways.

Anybody got some recs for interesting OC fics?


** You used the wrong flair, my boy, the correct one would be a request. Recommendation is used when you, the op, recommends a fic.

*** I'm two chapters in and I'm very upset it doesn't have that many reviews or favorites! It's quite unorthodox and engaging!

** Should I assume you've already read linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff)? Lots of fun, keeps Harry and his adventures at arm's length while instead exploring the fascinating world of magic from the perspective of a teenage girl.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** Holly At Hogwarts on Ao3. Next gen fic, the OC is Dudley's daughter.

Things I really enjoy about the fic(s):\\
Dudley is still Dudley (mostly).\\
New branch of magic to learn about.\\
Holly has a muggle brother.\\
The author plays with magic in a refreshingly different way.
