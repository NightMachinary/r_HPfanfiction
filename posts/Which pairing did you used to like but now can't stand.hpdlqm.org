Self-explanatory. For me it would have to be Daphne/Harry. At one time it was a breath of fresh air for the fandom to have such a utilisable framework for new works but instead it became saturated with very similar works always featuring her as essentially "The Good Slytherin" with zero character flaws.

Also didn't help other irksome cliches became common with her such as marriage contracts and soulmate bonds.

**** I am the same way. I cannot stand Harem fics. Harry has never struck me as someone who would ever be with more than one person. The problems with his childhood and lack of love and family, Harry has shown himself incredibly loyal (after all the times Ron was an ass, he stuck with him as a friend) and the idea of being with someone else after he is already with someone is something that would strike me as something he would find abhorrent. The only way around him willingly doing it then is some convoluted marriage-contract-esque plot device which are usually terrible anyway (very rarely have I read one that works well). So yeah, no thanks to Harem fics.

There's no writer who's good enough to pull of the wish fulfillment of Harry being powerful and loved by multiple women who all still retain their own personalities and priorities and dont become empty vessels for his pleasure.

** Snape/Hermione. It used to be my OTP. It's what got me into fanfiction in the first place. But now I can't stand it.

I read the books before I even saw the movies, so I kept picturing a much younger Snape (nothing at all like Alan Rickman!), which was why I was okay with the pairing. But now, whenever I think of Snape, I think of Alan Rickman. And the image of Alan Rickman with Emma Watson doing you-know-what is creeping me out too much to allow me to enjoy any Snape/Hermione fanfics anymore.

****** Myrtle was used to create the diary horcrux, so that version of Tom had only killed one person and it was likely an accident that he took advantage of to create his horcrux. I mean, he didn't even physically curse her. He just messed up with his giant killer snake and she caught a glimpse of its eyes when it was coming out of the sink pipe. Which makes me wonder about the mechanics of making a horcrux since he didn't kill her directly.\\
Murdering his father and grandparents was later and that horcrux went into the Gaunt ring. So I assume Gaunt Ring Voldemort would have been more twisted and nasty than Diary Voldemort.

Was he aware that his mother had used magic to force his father? I don't remember in the books if that was something Dumbledore had figured out on his own, or if Tom would have been able to find out.

Harry/Young Riddle still grosses me out though. I guess you could make it work if it was time travel and ended up before he'd fallen to the point of making horcruxes, and he had a solid redemption arc.

Usually if it was the young version of both, Harry would somehow manage to see the good in Tom and Tom would be attracted to his power. That or the story would feature a dark harry. It was weird and I'm happy the ship disgusts me now.

Basically Harry would always divorce Voldemort from Tom. And in the case that Harry was with the older Voldemort he'd either forgive him or excuse his actions as ‘part of the war'.

I could find reasons why he is the way he is (upbringing, orphanage, war world 2, trauma, mental illness etc) but while that can explain his behaviour, it doesn't excuse it. I'll never be able to understand good/Voldemort coupled with bad/Dumbledore. Just very weird to me.

Basic plot was Harry went back in time to Tom's school years, the two hit it off, and then got hurtled through time together as they tried to figure out what went wrong, and also tried to avoid dying. (I think Harry was stuck in the form of a cat for some reason too, but only for the first couple chapters. Shame I can't remember the name. The ending was pretty awesome.

** Harry/Ginny and Harry/Draco

I was first interested in Harry/Ginny because I was young and it hadn't really crossed my mind that you could ship things that weren't cannon lol But now I just find that most of these stories are really bland and I don't really see reasons why they should be together? Like everyone focuses on how she'd kinda look like his mom which is a bit weird and idk they just always seem to be written as a couple with no substance.

Harry/Draco was the next pairing I got into as it was so popular, but I find it really inconsistent. I don't mind as much in full AUs, but when they base off of the books it's always seemed like such a twisted pairing. Plus I find a lot of huge fans of this pairing can be really toxic (I know not everyone who likes this pairing is like that, but I've seen many writers attacked because their story with this pairing isn't going exactly as they want it to and I find that disgusting).

Honestly I've always had a mindset that as long as the story is good/interesting I don't discount stories just because of the pairing[s]. I've never really liked Harry/Hermione, but I have long time favorites with this as the main pairing and it doesn't ruin it for me.

** Lupin and Tonks, not because fanfics ruined them for me but because I got older. I loved them as a teen, now that I'm Tonk's age I find her entitlement towards Remus in HBP super uncalled for. Their relationship makes me uncomfortable. I also liked Dramione as a teenager (I was a rare breed who shipped both Romione and Dramione). I get it if someone likes Dramione as a fanon crack ship, but then I realized the amount of people who genuinely think that Ron was 'too abusive' for Hermione but Draco pureblood supremacist Malfoy was 'perfect' for her. That was too delusional for me to wrap my head around. Now I can't stand Dramione even in fanon.

** Remus and Tonks. It's cute at first, but overtime you realized Remus was forced into the relationship. Then it really ruined Tonks' character. Tonks having her every aspect of her character being erased and Remus already being an adult by the time Tonks is in Hogwarts, just makes their whole relationship even worse. Nearly all of Tonks' moodboards and aesthetics on tumblr always features werewolves/wolves. it really shows how her relationship with Remus took away all her character traits. We can't even be freed from this awful relationship. We can't be freed from the fact that a 40 year old man is with a 20 year old girl, we can't be freed from the fact that Tonks suddenly has feelings for Remus and it took away her character and Remus was forced into a relationship he didn't want to be in and the amazing character Tonks was in Hogwarts Mystery and OOTP, was erased just to shove this awful relationship that took away everything great about her character. Tonks died for this relationship.

**** I am pretty sure there are no clues whatsoever in book five, but do reread book six. There is that scene at the Burrow where Lupin doesn't want to stay for dinner and Harry & his peers assume Molly wants to matchmake Tonks and Charlie, who were of the same graduating class. Then in the beginning of book 7 they are married, followed by that scene where Remus wants to join the horcrux hunt and has a major freak out/pity party about being the old half breed husband to the young pregnant half blood Auror where Harry eventually sends him home. April '98 Teddy Lupin is born.

Let me get on my soapbox for this one:

They have a 13 year difference which generally leads to a chasm in at what point of their lives someone is. Imagine them talking about the end of the first war: Tonks would have been a 8 year old who notices a lot of relief in the family while she goes on with playing with her dolls - then you have Remus who has lost his entire friends network in a few weeks (especially if you count the McKinnons and Longbottoms as well as the Marauders). He couldn't see Harry anymore. Imagine the loss. How could they possibly connect?

And the economic inequality because Remus has trouble keeping a job, and Tonks is an Auror, and then I haven't even started to unpack Remus' self loathing as shown in book 7, which leaves me baffled even if Tonks were emotionally equipped to deal with that, what 23/24 year old girl would see that as husband material as Tonks clearly already did in book 6?!

***** I mean, Tonks was a kid at the end of the war but I don't think she went through it like, "tra la la mom is stressed." People who lived through it, children included, came out of it pretty traumatized, and everybody's trauma is different. By that logic, Vietnam veterans shouldn't be able to marry anyone who didn't also serve in Vietnam and that's just silly. It's possible for people to be empathetic and supportive of other people dealing with trauma without having directly experienced it themselves.

Economic equality isn't really that big of a deal in marriages. It's considered totally fine for women of lower economic status to marry men who are well off or have great jobs, so why is it an issue the other way around? I think that may have played into Remus feeling inadequate, but really his biggest fear seemed to revolve around his illness negatively impacting the relationship and his growing family. I assume aurors are paid well enough, so it wouldn't have been a big deal for Remus to be a stay at home dad while Tonks worked, and just gotten Andromeda to help with any kids during full moons. It would have been much, much more challenging for them if Tonks was also unemployable or working a low wage job, such as housekeeping.

The age difference doesn't seem too huge to me. But then again my husband and I have a 27 year difference. The younger you are the wider the gap can feel, but 13 years isn't uncommon or remotely insurmountable. She wasn't a kid just out of Hogwarts, she was a young professional woman working to apprehend hardened criminals.

JK is pretty terrible at writing relationships and it could have been developed way better (like many other canon relationships *coughharryginnycough*), but I don't think that Remus was forced to be in a relationship with her in any way. He definitely wallowed in self doubt, and they definitely had issues they needed to address, but that's the case in a lot of relationships. Based on her handling of cannon main character pairings I don't think we can set out expectations too high for side characters.

I do agree that Tonks was written really one dimensional after that and it sucked.

A Black, a metamorphmagus, the nephew of Bellatrix Lestrange, someone who spent their early years in a war. I don't think she had an easy life. She probably could understand Remus more than your average 23/24 year old girl.

Also, they are wizards. They live way longer than normal humans so the age gap probably isn't nearly as important in the long term as it seems. Also, don't forget that Remus was around 30 years old whereas the actor who played him was around 40.

Sirius Black might have been an exception, but otherwise it is safe to assume the Tonks's had only contact with Ted's side of the family.

And especially because wizarding folk can get that much older I don't quite get why Remus would be interested in someone who's prefrontal cortex hasn't stopped developing yet. A woman that was 13 years older than him, rather than younger would have been far less scandalous, imho.

But to your question, I always imagined AU as putting the characters into a completely different situation, whether that be time travel or an intergalactic war. But the point is you keep the characters' personalities, and in no circumstance would Draco's and Ginny's personalities mesh.

If you change the characters' personalities, they're supposedly OOC characters, but to me that's always seemed stupid. Just make a new character if you're going to change their personality.

Of course this is my personal opinion. I've seen a lot of fics with OOC characters notes in the description. Since I've read the books and gotten used to fanfic vocabulary, I don't ever read those, but it's obvious some people are into it, so to each their own.

Characters are defined by their personalities and by their environment.

For example:

Draco Malfoy is an arogant git that spews hateful and racist comments, always mentions his Father and is devoted to the Dark Lord.

Draco Malfoy is also the child of Lucius Malfoy, a devoted Death Eater from the inner circle of Voldemort. Draco met Harry Potter before they went to Hogwarts, was sorted in slytherin and has regular confrontations with Harry Potter.

Both of those descriptions /are/ Draco Malfoy. But both aren't needed for the character to exist in an AU. It's the types of fics where you say "What if". What if Draco was a good person. What if he wasn't a bully. What if Dumbledore was a megalomaniac. What if Voldemort wasn't insane etc etc.

Fans have defined Daphne as... well, Daphne now.

Guess all that can be done is to be on the look out for those precious few stories where this mold is broken, and where she is not a Clone.

***** I think the main problem with Daphne isn't that she is a "clone". In my opinion, she's as much of a clone as any other canon character.

It's not the character at fault. It's how people develop it. The fanon Daphne is an interesting character. A pureblood slytherin that has a half-blood for a friend and doesn't follow Voldemort.

She represents a link to tradition that Ron doesn't have. She clashes with Hermione, revealing some of her flaws. Hermione is a muggleborn. She has no connection to wizarding tradition and is extremely likely to look down upon it as outdated and barbaric.

She doesn't understand it; doesn't want to understand it and makes her own assumptions. She's arrogant, a trait a know-it all top-of-the-class would inevitably develop.

Interaction between Daphne and Hermione can allow them to develop in new and interesting ways. The same goes for a lot of canon characters.

Fanon Daphne brings in a lot of potential to the story. It's a shame that not many authors utilise it.

I used to like old-crow's works (linkffn(3230439) and linkffn(5084287)) but it's been years since I read them so I don't know if they hold up. The first half of linkffn(Junior Inquisitor) was okay as my memory serves (not so much romance but she was a character and she had a lot of interaction with Harry) but then it blows the evilness of its dumbledore way the fuck up and while I can take an evil dumbledore I have my limits.

linkffn(Insidious Inquisitor) doesn't have much more than the very beginning of a Harry/Susan/Hannah but it's a humorous one-shot I don't mind recommending at all.

I also remember linkffn(To Fight the Coming Darkness) as doing a decent job at making her an actual character but I need to re-read it to be certain.

***** When people say that harmione shippers are militant, they're not talking about /all/ harmione shippers, they're talking about /the ones to whom it applies./ It's a generalisation used for all the same reasons people use most any generalisation in casual discussion.

Much of the post to which I linked discusses the "Harmonians'"( which is distinct from a Harry/Hermione shipper) hatred for both fictional characters and real people whom they perceive as threatening their ship, so I find your (wrong) assumption that the piece is about the author justifying their hatred for an out-group pretty ironic.

I didn't say “it's warranted.” Please don't claim to be quoting me if you actually aren't.

Nobody, from what I've seen, is, as you say, shitting on you. Plenty of people are saying that Harry/Hermione shippers are militant. This is true of /some/ Harry/Hermione shippers, and untrue of many more, but the negative examples stand out far more in people's minds than positive or neutral ones. If you take this personally, that's your prerogative, but it's also your problem.

All fandoms have toxic jackasses in them, and all ships are shipped by toxic jackasses. That doesn't mean that everybody in any fandom and anybody who ships anything is one of those toxic jackasses, but the ones that /are/ are a /lot/ more memorable.

"not" and "unwarranted" literally means "warranted". Which means

"Justification or authority for an action, belief, or feeling."

So, you linked an article (that is over 10 years old might I add) to respond to my complaint about no harmony people here being militant. Which does nothing but poorly categorize a group of people, incorrectly, and is also hilariously out of date, with poor writing and terrible logic.

So did you have something to actually add to the conversation or did you just want an excuse to post a 15 year old blog post as justification for dismissing and belittling an entire section of the HP fandom?

******* Lemme add somethin', then: "no harmony people here being militant," is not the same thing as "no harmony people being militant." People in this thread are saying that they've encountered militant Harry/Hermione shippers and that those encounters have turned them off of the ship. Their not having had those encounters in this thread doesn't invalidate their having had those encounters elsewhere.

I'd thought I'd been pretty clear on this point earlier, but I evidently hadn't, so I'll say it explicitly: militant Harry/Hermione shippers exist, and people are allowed to have opinions on the ship based on their experiences with those shippers. This doesn't mean that all Harry/Hermione shippers are militant, nor that detractors of the ship or of the militant shippers themselves believe them to be.

** Err, I had a couple of weeks of reading Snarry in my early to mid teens and became gradually more uncomfortable until one fic that was the straw that broke the camel's back.

Also, at about 11 or so I was really into reading what I can only describe as gang bang fics which now are an absolutely nope for me.

I've tried a whole range of fics and I don't like Death Eater pairings. On the whole though, there are terrible and great fics in every genre. I try to read gen/no sex scenes (have many of the authors even had sex?), but I do need to switch up pairings if when I read them because otherwise you get trapped into the same pairings.

Some of the best fics I read were rare pair femslash fics where there isn't much of an established formula for the fics. For no particular reason, I now prefer to read fics with more prominant characters.

**** It more or less used to be less canon, but more and more recently, it seems more like a rehash of canon. That's mostly my problem with the pairing in general. The Forgotten Duo is a recent one that is very good so far, and isn't a rehash of canon Hermione. Canon Hermione in the books is tolerable, but in fanfiction where character development is very prominent those bad traits stand out a lot more, with the good traits. So it's more or less because recently it just becomes more rehash of canon which turned me off from it.

** When I first finished the books and movies I was so glad that Harry and Hermione didn't end up together that I was ecstatic about Romione. It never felt right per say, but I liked it and fought for it. Now I can barely tolerate Romione in fics and my favorite is when they have broken up but are mature and are still best friends/the golden trio --- not a fan of bashing. I also don't like Harmione though, and personally I wish parts of the trio had not dated in canon. In my ideal fic or fanon Harry is with Ginny or Draco, Hermione is with Krum, and Ron is with Lavender or Susan Bones or in the right style fic he could be with Pansy!
