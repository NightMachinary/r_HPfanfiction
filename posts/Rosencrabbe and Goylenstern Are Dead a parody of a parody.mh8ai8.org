One day I was pondering a storyline about Crabbe and Goyle being interchangeable, playing with the idea of people not being able to tell them apart (or really caring). I thought of how that's one of the gags in "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" (if you're not familiar with it, is a parody of Hamlet, involving all the stuff that happens off-screen in between scenes of the play).

So, I came up with this, using quotes from Hamlet as book/chapter titles, but I really don't think I have the talent to do it justice. I might play with it at some point in the future, but you all can have a go of it now.

** They still had it better. Rubenstein Hagrid was hated by Umbridge for being half-Jewish, half-giant.

*** I was spoiled for choice; Hamlet has such wonderful turns of phrase.
