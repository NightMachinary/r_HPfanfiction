** Ancient Runes has more use than just reading old stuff.

Animagi Potion

“Master of Death” came with some benefit

*** u/ParanoidDrone:
#+begin_quote
  Animagi Potion

This is technically already canon, if you take the old Pottermore stuff at its word. The mandrake leaf you hold in your mouth for a month becomes an ingredient in a potion.

** Master of Death being an actual thing and that this is the reason Harry survived being hit by the Avada Kedavra for the second time.

Also soulmates wouldn't be too off topic, since souls canonically exist in HP. Just make them super rare or something but it would be cool for them to exist.

*** If Rowling had prioritised logical worldbuilding while writing Philosopher's Stone, none of us would ever have read it

**** Eragon, Adventurers Wanted, LotR, and Percy Jackson are just a few that do that. I don't care if the logic is wacked so long as it stays true within itself. Hp was all over the place making no sense at times.

***** You're the first person I've seen who has mentioned Adventurers Wanted, which is one of my favorite book series (up to the last one). I just want to say thank you for validating my interest!

****** Yeah, the author suffered a major medical issue while writing the last one. A stroke iirc, and finished the book for the fans.

It's why the last book is different, he was in really different place.
