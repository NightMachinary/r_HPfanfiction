** That horcrux part pissed me off so much I was about to make a YouTube comment. Until I saw all the other YouTube comments about it...

*** Yeah, I think that was the first time I'd heard of Quirrell being a horcrux.

*** Blame Rowling, she said Quirrell was a temporary horcrux or something like that. It was pretty ambiguous IIRC.

*** Well , that's just redundant not literally wrong.

Voldemort's wraith is a piece of his soul , so he is his own horcrux.

It depends how you do define horcrux. If you define it as a "piece of soul" then yes , while possessed quirrel was an horcrux : just not quite.

** Why would /anyone/ think that the boa constrictor from the beginning of the series is Nagini?

** I'm not convinced about his assertion that the boa doesn't become Nagini. Let's face it, Voldemort is a brilliant and amoral wizard who likely has the ability and knowledge to turn an ordinary snake into a monster. To date, Naginis species has not been identified, not to mention there's not enough evidence to tell us where the snake came from, and until we know otherwise, I'm going to stick with Voldemort transformed the boa.

*** Also the fact that nagini was from Eastern Europe where voldemort was as the wraith, and the zoo snake was from Brazil and located in England also adds more weight.

*** Sure, and the whole world could be purgatory and the dementors are angels under a cursed glamor who don't eat souls, but rather free people from the misery of limbo and bring them to heaven; but if you want me to consider that as a real possibility, you need a better reason than "it's never said that they're not!" Hell, there's no reason not to believe that Nagini is poor miss Sally Anne Perks transfigured into a snake, but do you really think that's what happened?
