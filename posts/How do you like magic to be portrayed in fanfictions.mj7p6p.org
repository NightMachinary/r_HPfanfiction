So, I'm writing this fanfiction and I got stuck in how the magic will work in it.

For example, do you like when writers create an entire magical theory focused on intent and willpower? Or do you prefer when the writer leaves the magic unexplained as in canon?

And, if you do like magical theory in fanfictions, what are your favorites theories?


** I like a bit of both. There has to be some mystery to it because otherwise it wouldn't be magic. It seems like some aspects of magic are not understood even by those who use it. But canon shows us that at least some spells are dependent to a certain extent to the state of mind of the user. The Patronus requires to powerfully feel a happy memory, while "you've got to mean" the Unforgivables to work and a summoning charm really requires you to mentally visualize your target.

In terms of theories... my two favorite theories are the following:

1. Magic comes from the stars. Sun, being the closest star, is the greatest influencing force. However most people do not have the body build to draw magic straight from the stars. Instead the moon, whose rock attracts a lot of magic, is the one giving magic to wizards (and to some extent further away stars) when it reflects the light of the sun. That's why so many magical practices are dependent on the phases of the moon and at full moon when it reflects the most magic to earth its when the lycanthropic virus becomes active. Some wizards are however more powerful because their bodies are more sensitive to the light reflected on Earth on bodies of water or certain rocks. For example Tom Riddle did his first bout of impressive magic in the cave by the sea. And the locket is indeed the most well protected Horcrux.

2. Magic is actually dictated by the laws of nature. Nothing comes for free and every bit of magic you cast must come at a payment. We see that with the sacrificial love magic done by Lily and Harry when they willingly traded their lives for some loved's protection. Same thing for Horcruxes, where you give someone else's life, your humanity and a piece of your soul for immortality. Of course less powerful spells like Lumos require a smaller payment but even if you might not realize it, they eventually catch up with you. Particularly if they are used for selfish purposes as exemplified by the guy who invented Alohomora and used to commit several burglaries until one day someone invented a counter-spell and in his frustration forgot to put to sleep a Nundu he owned, which proceeded to eat him.

*** I don't like when Magical Cores are measured neither when it's just a matter of blood. For me, some are born with natural talent for magic (like Dumbledore or Voldemort) while others are regular, but can work hard to be great.

For example, in my opinion, Messi is someone who was born with a natural talent for football, while Cristiano Ronaldo is someone who worked really hard to get where he is today. In my opinion, magic works in the same way.

I hope it didn't sound too confused.

*** Why do you have an issue with people being inherently stronger than others?

I've always thought it made the most sense story wise.

Harry is an poor student. He knows next to no magic and has almost zero actual experience dueling. The only way that I can rationalize it in my mind is that he is significantly stronger than the average wizard (dementor incident) and that's what puts him on Voldemort and Dumbledore level.

Now in a completely AU fic, I quite like to read how knowledge and experience makes you powerful. But you still need some form of boost to get to Voldy's level. He is a master dark arts user for 50+ years longer than Harry. There needs to be some kind of balancing power.

By giving Harry a particularly large magical core you provide a reason why Harry has to fight him and also help even the scales. In my mind it helps reduce the feeling that harry read a few books and is suddenly a master of warfare.

You are probably right if you like fic which focus on other characters. But I don't often read those so Ill leave that to someone else.

**** A concept as crude as a "magical core" doesn't explain why it's /only/ the Patronus in which Harry is unusually strong.

If an arbitrary magical power meter existed, we would expect to see wizards and witches who are intelligent and confident but weak and/or those who are unintelligent and meek but powerful; we don't.

Instead, we see characters such as Neville who, almost a squib in his meekness, gains magical power as he gains confidence (and that's /before/ he gets the new wand); Lockhart who is not very smart yet so obsessed with how he is perceived by others, possibly the only part of his magic that works properly is Memory Charms; Bellatrix, whose sadism drives a powerful Cruciatus, while driving her to make highly suboptimal decisions^{1;} and, of course, Harry, whose emotional disposition and stubbornness gives him composure under fire, a powerful Patronus, and a rare ability to resist the Imperius, while making him impulsive, easily manipulated by the likes of Umbridge, Snape, and Voldemort, and (according to JKR, anyway) crippling his Occlumency.

These are only the most extreme examples; lesser examples abound.

Replacing this complex integration ofa character's character and their magic with an arbitrary magical power meter---it cheapens magic.

[[/u/A-ksar]] , this is also an element I would suggest incorporating into your magic system: learning a particular spell requires academic study and "book-smarts" (possibly excepting Dark Arts), but how well it's cast in any given instance depends on the character's personality, experience, physical and emotional state, and a variety of non-magical traits.

Don't get me wrong, if your premise /requires/ that your protagonist be innately more powerful than others, it's as good a plot device as any, if not very creative.

^{1} I am referring to Bellatrix's choice to torture Hermione at the Malfoy Manor in DH, rather than use Legilimency to get the information. According to Snape, she was the one who had taught Draco Occlumency, which would make her a Legilimens. Therefore, unless Hermione had managed to pick up Occlumency without anyone noticing (not impossible, but unlikely), Bellatrix basically got herself and Voldemort killed because she was too eager to hurt the Mudblood.

** I like the magic that, while the basic ordinary wizards and witches who don't delve to deeply have restrictions. The further you delve the more powerful you become and the less restrictions magic has until there are none, you can do anything. If there's a consequence for something there's probably a fix for it.

** With all things, you need a balance. On the one hand keeping it as vague as canon I feel hurts engagement and tension. If all you see of magic is 'doing whatever the plot demands' then you lose that sense of challenge or accomplishment from the protagonists solving problems with it. You need to show enough so the reader know understands the importance of the characters' actions. On the other hand, if you make it too well defined then you can kill pacing and tension by overanalysing everything that happens, so don't describe every single spell in detail. You may also accidently paint yourself into a corner by the rules you set, leave some ambiguity for narrative necessity.

Personally I am a big fan of worldbuilding and magic is an important part of that, so I prefer a more fleshed out system to play with, but that is just my preference. It also depends what the focus of your story is, don't waste your time on stuff which is irrelevant to the plot or the reader will get bored. If you are interested, I have had a go at starting something of my own and written a sort of introduction to how the magic works which I could copy here.

*** I agree with you. I can't explain too much, neither too little. I've been reading the text about magic from Taure and I think I'll follow a bit of his ideas.

I'd really like to have a look in what you are working. Thank you!

**** This is from my introduction, a combination skippable infodump for those who are interested without getting in the way of the story and justification for why I made the choices I did.

Most magic as shown in Harry Potter is quite boring. Wand movement + incantation = effect. This also provided no explanation as to why some people are better at it than others. In this fic, magic is a naturally chaotic energy that grants the ability to bend reality to your wishes with three components: imagination to picture what you want, willpower to shape the magic, and power to cause the effect. These affect what you can do, how precise and efficient the spell is, and how strong it is. Words, gestures and wands make this easier, but are not technically necessary. Generally the power required for a spell follows similar rules to the real world, move something heavier or faster, heat something hotter etc. For transfigurations, they are time limited, with more power being a greater change or lasting longer. In order to make a permanent change, e.g. a repairing spell, the end state has to be a stable configuration of the original material, so you can change shape or separate mixtures, but cannot turn wood into fish. A partial exception to this is alchemy (lead to gold is technically just a rearrangement of subatomic particles), which is why it is an incredibly difficult and rare skill. This is why you cannot magically create food, any energy you would get out from digesting would have to be at least matched by the magic put in to create it. There is a general principle that if something is already affected by magic then it is harder for more magic or physical effects to affect it, as it has to overpower the original. This means that heavily enchanted/magically rich objects become naturally resilient or even functionally impervious to damage, hence how artefacts such as Slytherin's locket survived so long in perfect condition.

Magic comes from the mind, and so has as many different variations as people's thoughts. Spellbooks work like cookbooks, where the author explains what works best for them, and it is up to the student to adjust to their own situation, which is why you cannot just read out a spell and it will work first time. A lot of low level spell creation is just changing the parameters on a standard spell. For example the Lumos spell taught in first year creates a point of light on the end of a wand. With some theory and practice you could change the colour, shape it into a cone like a torch, have it float beside you or evenly light a volume and then stop. As none of these are a sufficiently new spell, and are made for personal use, they are rarely written down, but can be done. I am putting my foot down on time-turners. The concept of magic able to manipulate time and being trivial enough to give to a schoolchild is a can of worms I don't want to go near, especially just for a gimmick for a single chapter in book 3. To do it justice would require effort and focus and taking the story in directions I would rather not. Many fanfictions extrapolate from the Goblet of Fire and unbreakable vow to create general use magically enforced oaths and contracts. In this story that doesn't happen, as even if people knew how they require unique artefacts or specific circumstances.

In terms of magical variance between individuals, in canon, not all wizards (or witches) are created equal. Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Voldemort would not have had the reputations they did if it was just practice and skill that separated them from the norm. On the flip side Neville is taunted as being nearly a squib, and Filch reads the Kwickspell pamphlet in hope that he could still cast some magic, despite not being deemed a wizard. This all points to a gradient of magical ability (which will change as you develop, e.g. Neville) rather than a binary magical or not. Raw power is not everything though, as clearer imagination, more focussed will, practice and intelligent spell use can all increase effective efficiency. Depending how you think and how you imagine the results of the spell, different people may have preferences for different spells or branches of magic. This is often influenced by upbringing and experience. For example an ability to visualise something very precisely is required for highly detailed transfiguration, while growing up next to a stream may allow you to cast better aguamenti charms as you have a fundamental understanding of the concept of flowing water.

Magic also has physical and mental effects on living beings. Magic is linked to sentience. Only sentient beings are self aware enough to create spells (innate magical abilities such as basilisk stare and phoenix teleportation don't count). The flip side is that magical creatures and animals which spend a long time around magic (e.g. Mrs Norris) tend to be more intelligent than a mundane equivalent, though they are still animals. At no point was it suggested that Buckbeak was sapient, but he was clever enough that you had to ask, speak respectfully and then bow before being able to ride him. High levels of magic in a body makes the creature magic resistant and generally stronger, more resilient and heal faster. This also applies to a lesser extent for wizards compared to muggles, so bludgers in quidditch are not completely lethal.

** In fact, I like both, but with certain limits. I mean: without exaggerating much at any point.

It has nothing to do with the question, but I remembered something I was thinking. What if some spell names mean nothing? So someone can say "Expelliarmus", for example, but the result of the spell is to kill because this person wanted to kill. And finally I thought about the likely results of a well-developed fanfic: fanfic can be very crazy, confusing, and brilliant. Because if what unfolds in this HP fanfic is what triggers "the intention is what counts," then when someone casts a spell, you don't know what will happen.

Anyway, for now it's just a thought.

** I like magic that feels magical and abstract more philosophical and metaphysical. I like magic that is full of symbolism. I prefer this approach to the scientific approach to magic where magic is also dependent of the muggles laws of the universe. And for magical power I think that great wizard are geniuses rather than people how have more power or what not. They have a better understanding of magic so they can wild it better. To give an example of an autor that has a magic system that I love is Taure.
