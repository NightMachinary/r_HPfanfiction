There are alot of AU Harry Potter fics but most of them concern voldemort in some way. Wondering if there are any good fics which don't include him as a character and therefore have to get creative with alternate sources of conflict.


** linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) goes for quite a while without him, but he does show up eventually. He's not set up as the over-arching villain, though, and he's just something in the background for most of the fic.

But oooh, boy. That fic is /not/ lacking in conflict.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.
