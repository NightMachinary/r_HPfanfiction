:END:
Hi guys I'm looking for a HP fic that i remember reading, probably on AO3 or [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]. Harry is adopted by James Potter's brother and raised elsewhere in europe. The brother is a teacher. I don't remember everything but i believe that in the end it turns out that the brother is actually harry who went back in time with ron and hermione. Does this sound familiar? Thanks so much!!!
