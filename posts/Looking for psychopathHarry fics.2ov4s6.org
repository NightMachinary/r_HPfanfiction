I just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5754212/1/Darkly-Dreaming-Harry][Darkly Dreaming Harry by Lineape]], which seems to be abandoned, and am wondering if there are more well written psychopath!Harry stories out there.


** I can't link them right now, but the "Screams" fanfics are multiple one-shots about a crazy Harry and Hermione.

** Theses a trilogy by greengecko where harry kills voldemort but then has trouble dealing with his horocrux inside him. During these times he loses control of himself and is dark and a psycopath. He gets adopted by snape and goes to auror training for a few years. Its over 1m words in total but very good and talks alot about the structure of magic. I think the psycopath parts are in the 2nd or 3rd novel... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance]]

**** Sorry... Its not that bad cuz hes already like 16 when he gets adopted so its not like snape is really his dad. They even talk about whether its worth it or not to adopt him for a few months. Also during his auror training harry grows more powerful than snape and snape cant really control him when he goes dark so there is that.

*** I started this story twice but for some reason never got past the second chapter. So far I only knew that it was one of the better Snape mentors Harry stories, but the horcrux premise sounds very interesting, I'll give it another try. Thanks!

**** So just trying to read this story again. Anybody else having trouble with the writing style? I don't know, it just feels sort of... flat to me. Don't even know why exactly, but in my mind the whole text just reads like a monotonous string of words.

** "Intoxication" by nos tres reges. It's not very gory or anything, but Harry's a psycho.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]] Harry pursues necromancy and gradually becomes more and more of a sociopath.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9094199/1/Grey-Clouds-Loomed][Grey Clouds Loomed]] Is about harry as a vampire from masquerade bloodlines, he is completely amoral, none of the "I might be evil but I have standards" shit that so many "dark" fics come up with.

*** Thanks for the recommendations. I read Too Young to Die, I still wish the author would write a sequel where Voldemort tries to recruit Harry. Doesn't look like it's happening. I'll try Grey Clouds Loomed. I like vampire!Harry (as long as he doesn't sparkle in the sun ;) ).

**** With Too Young to Die, I always imagine the sequel starting off >=100 years later, with Voldemort having been assassinated/killed. He's freed by people who don't know what he did.

He sets off, of course, to find his sister. Then followers of Voldemort (perhaps descendants of the LeStranges) captures him. They claim to know where Natasha is. They won't kill her if he resurrects Voldmort. That Harry had been kept alive as an insurance policy for V.

Of course, that comet that is needed to enter the land of the dead is going to make a reappearance in only a few short months.

I assume that Voldemort never bothered keeping up the Statute of Secrecy, and, of course, was hostile to muggles. So they too are always hunting for wizards/witches.

But, alas, I'm not much of a writer, ...

*** Just read Too Young to Die, honestly one of the best fanfic's I ever read. I really liked the Death Note anime, and I felt that the two played out similarly. Do you know anything else quite like it?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10859387/1/Heartless-Harry][Heartless Harry]] Fairly new story. He's described as a sociopath in this one, not a psychopath. I'm not sure if there's a difference.
