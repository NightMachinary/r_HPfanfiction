Not looking for Overpowered Harry, want a more believable powerful Harry. Harry Slightly smarter than in canon is fine, but I'd rather it be more believable as well.

No Ron Weasley bashing, please. Love Ron, and don't like when stories bash him. Would rather not have any character bashing in general, but if others have to be, I'd rather not have Ron be bashed.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash. Can be on ANY site. Anyone can be the main character. The Horcruxes can be a thing or don't have to be, or a mix of it.

Harry can do the DA club earlier than canon, or the Order members can be the ones to train him, or Dumbledore or Snape, or whoever. Or he trains just with Ron and Hermione.

No Lord Potter, No Harem Harry.

Would rather it be completed, or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.

Edit: Since some people were unsure, Harry can be smarter or more powerful than in canon, but I don't want him being unbelievably smart or unbelievably powerful, if that makes sense. So no sudden Dumbledore levels or anything like that.

** This may or may not fit depending on how specific you are about your first request. Harry is a lot smarter than he is in canon, but this isn't one of those fics where he could best a full grown wizard in first year, even though he will become extremely powerful at some point much later on. I have been told the progression is very believable and it meets all of your other requirements. The pairing will be f/m, but that's not for quite some time. Currently in the summer between year 1 and 2 but updating weekly; this story will almost certainly surpass a million words when all is said and done. linkffn(13352687)

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater.

** Linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) might qualify. Harry reduces lessons from Sirius and Lupin along with Hermione and Ron. The trio also teach Defense to other students.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Harry Potter realized from a young age that he was different. He could make things move without touching them, he could make his hair grow back when his aunt cut it too short, and he could talk to snakes. The Dursleys would always hurt Harry whenever he made strange things happen. Until one day, when everything changed.BOOK ONE - COMPLETECURRENTLY BEING EDITED
