:END:
As it says, can be a prompt enough for a oneshot, or a multichapter or whatever else. If anyone is interested in writing any prompt that people write down, let them know!

1st: When Rita Skeeter was a student at Hogwarts, she was one to get information on any and all rumors, leading her to some serious conflicts, and trouble. (I'd just really like to read Rita Skeeter's time at Hogwarts, I'd imagine her to be older than the Marauders, so she's not suddenly in their year). Maybe in Lucius' year, or in Narcissa's, or Bellatrix's year or something.

2nd: Dobby ends up taking Harry away from the Dursley's, keeping him safe at various caves, mountains, et cetra), while stealing food for him, Harry must learn to live "in the wild" but not becoming super OP with magic, but by cunning/cleverness.

3rd: Ron's desire of wanting to be different than his brothers and sister is so great, that he ends up being sorted into Slytherin. Horrified, Ron doesn't know what to do, he doesn't become friends with Draco, but strikes a deal with Blaise Zabini (Or Theodore Nott), to help him out.

4th:The possession that Ginny had went through in her first year put more strain on her than anyone had ever thought it would, making her more skepitical, cunning, and strong desire to change things. (Punishing of Death Eaters).

5th:Bellatrix Lestrange ends up back in time.... when Tom Riddle Jr was still a child ( he could also be a teenager at this point).

6:Dolores Umbridge is a toad Animagus, and ends up in the Dursley's house. (Could be a redemption arc for her, or not).

7:Fred and George make deals with Kingsley, and Moody with their products, and expands their business.

Feel free to list your own prompts, and feel free to talk to me, if any of these prompts sound interesting enough to you, that you'd like to write them.


** Cracky: Harry Potter grew up immersed in gangsta culture, probably because he was actually raised by thugs and hood rats in the projects. He's basically packs heat, smokes weed, slangs rocks, stacks racks, and doesn't love 'em hos.

Realistic: Harry Potter turns 11 and begins attending Hogwarts in 2011. This means the entire story begins 20 years after the original series, with all the problems that would happen due to the advances in technology, including muggleborn Wizards and Witches using Youtube and Instagram to show off. Wizarding society remains as dumb to advances in technology as ever, meaning the Statute of Secrecy has already been breached, and they don't even know it. By 7th year, Brexit is just as big of a problem for Harry as Voldemort is.
