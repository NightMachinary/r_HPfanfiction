I've read a lot of fics where he wants a nice family and gets one. Those are all heartwarming. I've been searching for fics which deal with the other side of the coin. Sometimes people who go through abuse are not great in family environment because they dont want to to pass off their abuse to ones they love.

So any fics where he is workaholic and negligent father/husband or some stuff like that ? Would like to read it.

  Tonight she wants to pretend the lies are true. Tonight she wants to believe that a girl like her could actually end up with the hero.
