I'm looking for a certain type of fanfic. One were Harry gets trained or is trained as a soldier. He could be using magic, a sword, anything. I'm basically looking for a badass Harry that takes the fight to Voldemort or goes off seeking other battles after the war as a merc, auror anything really. Just alot of fighting and pairing are fine. Completed please! Thanks for the help!

** Harry is raised as a warrior and defeats Voldemort at 16, then goes to Hogwarts and has problems integrating due to being raised to kill Voldemort and the resultant paranoia/social ineptness. There are fight scenes, and it's Harry/Ginny. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2559745/1/Learning-to-Breathe]])

Harry's child abuse created a paranoid, untrusting boy who learns to fight as soon as possible. Lot of emotional drama, some intense fight scenes. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal-Harry]])

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

** There's "Old Soldiers never die" by Rorschach's Blot. Harry leads a unit made up of veterans of the British Army against Voldemort.

I've written "Harry Potter and the Spygirl" - Harry gets combat training, primarily with magic at the start.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.
