I swear this sub spoils the ever loving shit out of me. So many good recs, so much interesting discussion. It feels like there are so many well written stories out there just waiting to be discovered, and all of you do such a good job recommending them! I know sometimes we all have differing opinions, but thank you all for being magnificent. I wish some of the other fandoms I followed were half as active as this one!


** It would be nice for sure, but most fandoms simply lack the numbers to support this level of activity. On average active fandoms have around 5000 fics on ffnet. Harry Potter has 800000. Twice as many as the second biggest fandom.

The activity levels here are a subproduct of the mindblowing amount of content.

** The Parahumans/Worm fandom is really good. Based around the web series written by Wildbow (proper spelling: Willybboopip), they are:\\
1) Worm- a superpowers story in an original world.\\
2) Pact- a story of magic users set in modern times.\\
3) Twig- a biopunk story set in an alternate history.\\
4) Ward- sequel to Worm. Currently in progress.

The dedicated subreddit to his writings is [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]]. Worm/Ward by far has the most active fandoms with [[/r/Wormfanfic][r/Wormfanfic]] and [[/r/wormmemes][r/wormmemes]].

Fanfic really is creative criticism that takes understanding of the source text and narrative. So many fandoms could do with a little of that introspection.

*** The Firefly corpus is pretty static at this point (though there are a few people still writing new pics for it) and I think that's part of the reason why there's no community around it. There's just not enough content (and new content) to justify talking about :/

My personal recommendations for the fandom are: - linkffn(Forward by Peptuck): Great "Season 2" continuation that really feels like the show and is even divided into episodes. Focused on River post-Serenity, but everyone gets some character growth. If you don't read all of it, make sure to skip ahead and read the Last Man episode, starting on chapter 66. It's one of the best Western stories I've come across and is a perfect depiction of Jayne. - linkffn(Two Gorram Days by Dyce) and the rest of the Horseshoe Nail series: A somewhat fluffy shipping fic focused on River/Jayne. I don't normally go for shipping fics, but this has an actual plot and is the best explanation I've seen for why River and Jayne are actually a good match. Definitely white-washes Jayne a bit though. - linkffn(A man of honor by thescarredman) and the rest of the Firefly Mythverse: Hands down, best writing in the fandom. The series develops all of the characters nicely, but Jayne, Simon, and Badger get masterful treatments that turn them into utterly fascinating characters. Badger's arc in particular makes you realize how shallow canon's depiction of him was. Cannot recommend this enough.

To be honest, I've been waiting a long time to be able to make those recs XD

  First in the series. Simon has found a cure for River's condition... or is she just a new kind of crazy? River/Jayne, sort of. Well, not really. Maybe so.

** While One Piece fandom is pretty decent, it is lacking in the fanfiction department. I would love if there were authors as devoted as those for Harry Potter. And if people could be writing more than just harem and slash.

** I wish more of the comic book fandoms - specifically Spider-Man had an active fanfiction community like this one. So much of those fandoms are just smut, It'd be nice for more what-if type stories like there are in this community. Especially because Spider-Man and Marvel already have a "multi-verse" established as canon.

*** I feel this real hard. Trying to filter out the smut and shipping from actual fics with a plot is a real nightmare, at least in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It's probably because the movies made every dude ridiculously attractive, but I feel like even the fics tagged Gen on AO3 are like 90% shipping

**** Agreed. FFN seems like it is slightly better, but not by much. It's a shame, because I'd love to read some solid Spider-Man fanfiction, there are so many different jumping off points within the story too that I think deserve some exploration. Maybe its time to just buckle down and just write it myself!
