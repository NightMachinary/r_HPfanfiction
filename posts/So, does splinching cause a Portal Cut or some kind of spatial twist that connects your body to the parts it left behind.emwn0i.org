** I've always assumed that splinching just leaves behind some random part, probably not neatly cut since there's no flat portal being passed through.

** I always imagined that apparition was philosophically kind of like a magical slingshot where you throw yourself at a place you imagine real hard despite mechanically being like an extra-dimensional version of those pneumatic tubes that supermarkets use for money transport.

Splinching is just the magical version of "Welp, you didn't keep your hands and/or feet inside the vehicle at all times" but the vehicle is multidimensional so you can lose bits in weird places.

** I think it ultimately depends on the tone the author is going for. Remember, Canonically, Susan Bones splinched off her entire leg (the left one if memory serves) at the hip while learning apparition and it was treated as no big deal, while Ron left behind some strips of flesh from his arm & shoulder and he almost died from an infection because of it.

*** To be fair, Hermione treated it with dittany and standard healing spells, and did not have access to the splinched flesh. The apparition teachers/examiners probably have spells that specifically reverse splinching.

Also, Ron fails his first apparition test because he left an eyelash behind. The piece/pieces that gets left behind seems rather random.

** I used to imagine that splinched body parts were still connected, just separated in space, so there would be no bleeding and you could just reconnect them with no fuss. Yet in Deathly Hallows Ron splinches off a part of his upper arm and bleeds badly, and rather than find it they use Essence of Dittany on the wound, so there goes that theory.
