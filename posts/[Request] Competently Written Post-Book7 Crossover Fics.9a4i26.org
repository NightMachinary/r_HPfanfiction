I'm looking for crossover fics that are well written, either completed or in progress and are post Hogwarts. I've read too much muck that is either crossover rewrite that beat for beat hits every single point in the books, or far future crap were Harry is the only living wizard alive cuz mAsTeR Of dEaTh shenanigans. I just want Harry and Co. with elements of other Fandoms. I just read an enjoyable NCIS/HP fic, don't even know a single thing from NCIS, yet the author is talented enough that I don't find myself lost or confused as to how the plot is fleshing out. So please, canon compliant, post-Hogwarts, any Fandom except for far future or sci-fi stuff like Star Wars.


** The NCIS fic I mentioned in case anyone is interested.

  Harry and Ginny are on their honeymoon when Harry stops into a bank to check their accounts. It's a simple choice, but one that will change everything for the couple. When Ziva and Tony join Harry in the bank, things take a dramatic turn and Harry is left wondering "why me?"

  Harry may have finished school but that doesn't mean that everything is all it seems at Hogwarts. There's something in the Forbidden Forest. The wizarding world call in their chosen one, Harry Potter, but the castle ghosts believe they need someone else, Danny Fenton. But is this muggle all he seems?

  Harry has had a love of Cartoons since his fifth year. Now that the war is over, he's gone to America to open his OWN studio of cartoons for Magical children.

** All following WIP fics involve more than HP characters:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8643565/1/Blue-Magic][Blue Magic]], linkffn(8643565): Nice Mass Effect crossover with Harry/Hermione, unfortunately abandoned

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11281891/1/Failsafe][Failsafe]], linkffn(11281891): Nice LOTR crossover with Harry/Ginny, unfortunately abandoned

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725354/1/Gods-Among-Us][Gods Among Us]], linkffn(7725354): Rare Battlestar Galactica crossover with Harry/Hermione, still active

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136): Ginny and Sirius are building their empire in the Land of Fire and Ice, still active

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7882249/1/This-Crude-Matter][The Crude Matter]], linkffn(7882249), is the unfortunately abandoned Star Wars crossover sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971). Although happening 120+ years into the future, Harry, Hermione, Luna, George, and Fleur still made it there. Some Jedi bashing, Grand Admiral Thrawn was cool.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12689889/1/the-Winter-Witch][The Winter Witch]], linkffn(12689889): Hermione ended up in Westeros and hooked up with Robb. The unique about this GoT crossover is that Robb got catapulted into the HP world. Still actively updated.

Completed crossovers after DH with more than Harry involved is extremely rare:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942), diverges after Sirius's death and crosses with Star Wars, although most actions take place with the HPverse. Its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), crosses with Stargate and begins after 2003. Harry, Hermione, and Luna were building a galactic empire with lots of massive space battles and planetary assaults.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), is crossover with Kantai Fleetgirls and already AU after Year 5, but the main story begins after 2001. Voldemort's final Horcrux corrupted the ship spirit of the sunken Bismarck and returned as the zombie Battleship BismarckMort. Fortunately, HMS Hood had also been recalled to defend Britain. This fic also has the extremely rare Harry/Hermione/Ron pairing.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-26436/DianeCastle+The+League+of+Extraordinary+Women.htm#pt][The League of Extraordinary Women]] crosses with several universes, among them BtVS, DC, Stargate, and rarely known one Terawatt. The hero from the Terawattverse will encounter her local version of the Trio in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28614/DianeCastle+The+Secret+Return+of+Alex+Mack.htm#pt][The Secret Return of Alex Mack]]. The author liked that Trio so much that she decided to write full story for them in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. Now, that fic is often recommended here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King][The Sea King]], linkffn(7502511), is a beautiful one shot crossover with The Deadliest Catch.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

** (linkffn)A Proper Romance by Keryl Raist

This is a Severus-Hermione Marriage Law fic, which I know isn't everyone's cup of tea. And IIRC, the crossover part with Buffy tVS is only for a handful of chapters in the middle. Maybe more, I'm not certain. It's also not entirely canon-compliant, as Severus isn't the only person who's fate has changed. I think it's good through HBP.

But the story itself is well-written. Characterizations are consistent, spelling and grammar are well done, there are no gaping plot holes or contrived situations, etc. Basically, it does not read as if it was written by an angsty 15 year old.
