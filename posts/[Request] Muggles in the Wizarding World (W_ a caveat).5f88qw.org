I'd love to get some recommendations for fics that have muggles somehow end up in the wizarding world one way or another.

The caveat I mentioned would be that I would vastly prefer a focus on less common characters/situations - maybe the muggle in question is a mechanic that is teaching Arthur about cars and he brings her to the Burrow, only for her to get caught up in a Death Eater attack. Or Neville gets a muggle girlfriend and decides to show off by taking her on a date in Diagon Alley. Or McGonagall gets a bit careless and accidentally drops a portkey to her office at the charming muggle bakery she frequents on the weekends, and the owner gets teleported to Hogwarts, mid-term.

Another preference would be for a female muggle, though this one is less important.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] has created a Muggle OC named Roberta Beadle, who first appeared in /Friends and Foes/, linkffn(9992917 ). She was a police constable who got inadvertently drawn into a magical murder case. After meeting Harry and Co, she became suspicious of their background, did some research, and was able to piece together a lot about them just from public information. Harry then invited her to 12 Grimmauld Place and introduced her to the magical world. [[/spoiler][She later became part of Harry's team and married Oliver Wood.]]
