I've read a lot of Harry is a bad ass fics. I'd like to read some where Hermione is the all powerful bad ass.


** Hermione is important and competent while avoiding being OP in these two fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus]] - Hermione wanted to be a great witch, and there is a house for those who want to be great - Slytherin. There is just one problem, it may be not the nicest house to be in if you're muggleborn. Nice story about Hermione getting more hardcore thanks to fighting Slytherin bullies. Sadly on hiatus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655][Hogwarts Battle School]] - Like Ender's Game, but in Hogwarts.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** All of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5's]] stories have bad ass Hermiones. Harry, comparatively speaking, is not very strong in his fics.

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is a wonderfully written, badass Hermione story. I've recommended it a few times already and written [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5bf1gs/lf_complete_stories_where_hermione_isnt_a/d9oc0z1/][a lengthy description]].

Hermione is getting very powerful in recent chapters of *Lady Archimedes*, linkffn(11463030).

*Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925), has a very strong Hermione too. She really shined during the few fight scenes.

I also rec [[http://kris-fic.livejournal.com/54428.html][Harem]], as she is quite powerful in it, but you do not have any scenes explicitly of her fighting. Most of her stories can only be found on her LJ.

For other BAMF!Hermione fics, linkffn(Roundabout Destiny; Sands of Destiny; Pride of Time) have her holding her own while back in time. linkffn(Bound to Him) has Hermione gradually growing stronger. Both linkffn(4349641; 1696491) have great dueling scenes, but are incomplete.

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.

  Voldemort had not only sent his Death Eaters to the Ministry, but vampires as well. Hermione and Harry fall to them and find themselves in new, undead lives. While Harry struggles to remain human, Hermione becomes what was believed dead long ago. She becomes a Countess, an heir to Dracula. Unfortunatly, there are no books on that. Vampire!Hermione/Harry, Dark!Hermione Dark!Harry

** linkffn(code of the Griffin)

I like it. Military training and advanced tactics instituted by a time jumping Hermione.

YMMV but it's a fun story.. a darker Old Soldiers Never Die.

**** Many times she's kind of a Twilight's Bella figure, paralysed in decision between the rippling good looks (apparently) of Harry and the, I assume, good facets, of Ronald.

And then she ends up banging the apparently male cat Mrs Norris when she somehow ends up as a cat Animagus when I skip 3 paragraphs.

Fanfiction, man.

*** That's like saying 90% of Harry-centric fics feature him being a badass. Of course some do, but most (good ones) are about him being an ordinary person working with the gifts he has. There's nothing wrong with people looking for a strong Hermione fic. Even most of the ones about her as a central character don't explore anything beyond her being the only person capable of basic research.

Edit: added good ones since of course fandom is full of super!InsertWhateverCharacter fics
