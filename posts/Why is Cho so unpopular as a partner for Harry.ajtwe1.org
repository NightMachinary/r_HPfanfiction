Given that this fandom is able to produce thousands of stories for utterly implausible pairings, why is Cho so unpopular?

I mean, I get that they canonically did not work out, but both were still rather badly dealing with Cedric's death, so the obvious fix would be either better coping, get them together before Cedric is in the picture or get them together later in life.

Marietta and her betrayal are another obvious issue, but the workaround is not so difficult. Either give Cho a worse treatment at the hands of Umbridge or make her realise how much Marietta fucked the chances for their survival.

So why is Cho so unpopular despite having countless possible story paths? I mean, there is one decent longer story with her as the partner of choice (Headman's hostage) and another cracky oneshot (Firewhiskey Nights).


** Because her canon romance with Harry is already the most realistic teenage relationship in the entire series.

In that is has over a year of buildup, only to not be anywhere near as good as Harry's fantasies suggested.

*** I get that. And I get why their relationship fails in canon. But given how popular utterly unbelievable pairings are, I really don't understand why no one writes Cho as a partner. She isn't my prime choice for Harry by any stretch of the imagination, but definitely within the top ten as far as probability goes.

If thousands of authors can do the mental gymnastics for Harry/Snape or Hermione/Malfoy, why can no one do something much easier for Harry/Cho?

**** Because their "romance" was already done and finished in canon. Unlike those others you mention that have no canon basis whatsoever and thus enable the writers to let their imagination run wild and project into them whatever they want, the Cho "relationship" explicitly runs to its doom in the book AND leaves most readers with a disfavourable view of the girl.

To actually make some fanfic romance out of it writers would need to let go of their simplistic ideas of how people and relationships work and give the character some actual development. 99% are incapable of that. The remaining 1% have different interests.

***** I do not enjoy those pairings with canon accurate characterisations for either of them. Excluding time travel, there is exactly one scenario how I can see a Bellatrix pairing happen, and there is not a single story even remotely close to it.

Same for Harry/Pansy. I don't want the "Slytherin top bitch", but I am partial to stories where it is just an act to blend in (which is what I have written after all). Stories like "Fade In (Let Me)" or "Ballad No 3 (rewritten)".

Also, what exactly is your point? We are talking about Harry and Cho here, and how there is almost no content for that pairing. What do my reading preferences have to do with that, much less what you wrongly perceive them to be?

Edit: Seriously, a poor ad-hominem? That's the best you can argue?

***** I mean, I have little interest in that regard as well, but given how many "Japan wank" stories are out there (katanas, random Japanese phrases, samurai and bushido), you'd think that someone would do something like that with China as well. IIRC there are one or two stories like that, but with Su(e) Li instead of Cho.

And while I hate those to the degree where I am writing a subversion of the Japanese GF story, you have to admit that a Chinese character is a good way to get into Chinese mythology (and how it is actually real) in an HP like setting. And it is still surprising that no one has written something like that, even if it would be poorly done.

Compelling/Interesting are subjective measures, and I think we can agree that based on the sheer volume of stories that dominate the most popular/reviewed stories on ffnet that people can be and often are interested/compelled by the most basic and random stuff.

** I think the real deal-breaker is Marietta's betrayal. It's not just that Cho's friend betrayed the DA. Cho actively defends Marietta, trying to brush aside the betrayal. Which got Dumbledore driven from the school and very nearly got Harry expelled and possibly arrested.

As you said,

#+begin_quote
  or make her realise how much Marietta fucked the chances for their survival.
#+end_quote

In canon, Cho is very defensive of Marietta, and very dismissive of Harry's friends, who haven't truly wronged her.

She is spiteful towards Hermione out of jealousy--though in fairness, I notice Hermione never tries to clear things up with her (Say what you will of Krum, he approached Harry when Skeeter's articles came out).

Cho's also highly emotional, taking offense at many relatively small slights--Ron's comment about her Tornadoes badge was rude, but given the backlash towards popular sports teams in America (heck it's often much worse here, at least with football), one would expect Cho to roll with the punches. What's more, that's how she identifies Ron (The one who hates the Tornadoes)--not his status as Harry's best friend, not Gryffindor Keeper, not "the tall redhead."

In short, unless one gives Cho an abundance more maturity than she has in canon, for Harry to have a relationship with her, it would virtually require him to distance himself from his friends, assuming we maintain the school-age romance.

*** This is probably going off on a tangent to the original question but to me, I think the reason that it seemed ok for Krum to approach Harry was because Krum was on speaking terms with Harry at the time since they were both in the TriWiz Tournament and they've already competed a few times by then. And that he was also directly involved in the "relationship" that he was trying really hard to build. It just seems weird for Hermione to approach Cho since they've never properly met and/or talked before and she is not directly involved in that relationship. She'd help Harry out when he asked for it though.

It would make more sense that Cho should approach Hermione though, following your logic. But like you said, she's not very mature at the time.

** The biggest issue is that there simply isn't anything really interesting about Cho that sets her apart from other potential pairings, shes boring.

Hermione -> female lead, childhood friend, ugly duckling, sexy librarian, muggleborn genius etc..

Ginny -> feisty redhead, quiddich star, was possessed by Voldemort, life debt, leader of the DA, 'light' pureblood, canon...

Fleur-> Sexy older witch, lots of power perversion potential, "veela bonds", *not* from Wizarding Britain, Triwizard Champion, closest thing HP has to a monster girl.

Tonks -> Auror, sexy shapeshifter, sense of humor, Black family drama.

Greengrass and other tertiary characters -> empty shell free of baggage, or has some meaningful connection like Susan Bones.

Villains-> strong motivations, often have notable gimmicks, pairs well with the notion that Dumbledore isn't all he's cracked up to be.

Crack pairing are pretty self explanatory.

There are many H/Hr and H/G stories that have her as a later-in-life fling before landing with the One True Love interest.

Dunno why Cho is so unpopular. It's possibly because she was boringly written in canon, with only largely unappealing traits shown.

** For me personally, Harry was Cho's rebound of sorts. She was still struggling to get over Cedric, still incredibly emotional distraught over the loss of Cedric, it just seemed like she dated Harry to have some sort of strange closeness to Cedric.

I don't hate Cho, and I suppose it could work in other ways. Let's say the epilogue doesn't happen, and Harry isn't with someone but then meets Cho and their friendship and further upon that romance goes further, I could see that being possible.

But, for right then and there; Harry was basically Cho's rebound, and it never set right with me.

When they got close Ginny began telling others not to call Luna "Loony," then during Luna's Quidditch commentary i love the moment where she goes off on a tangent to talk about how fond of Ginny she is lol thats the kinda thing i meant that demonstrates the bond they formed.

last two books do fail to use these traits and are what they are but Ginny still had her character fleshed out prior to then is what i was saying. where as Cho just never got that kind of writing for people to latch onto.

**** Some good, but again, predictable- shared hobbies aren't always a good thing when aside from her crying that's near all we know about her- she's rather 2D, and a shared hobby in itself isn't enough for a relationship to work.

Nothing says she's unskilled? How many games did she win again? Was it ever close when it was Harry against her?

***** She played well against Harry, repeatedly blocking him despite being severely outclassed due to the Firebolt being an international standard broom while hers was obsolete by book one.

It's like drag racing a stock VW beetle against a Formula 1 car. The fact that she managed to repeatedly counter Harry is proof of her skill.
