Hey guys,

I am once again looking for fanfictions (yeah I know, stating the obvious!)

This time I'd like fanfictions with a Harry who thinks he deserves respect (so no snitching behind his back or betraying his trust without suffering some sort of consequences because just forgiving every slight cheapens the worth of friendship! Friendship isn't something to be taken for granted, it's not something you can treat like shit! Note: I am not saying friendship needs work, but you certainly can't just do whatever and believe that your friends will just accept that whatever you are doing is great!) and love and also believes that his life is worth something (so he's not risking it without a good reason all the time!)

Bonus points if he doesn't let people walk all over him and if he's good at school (a rivalry with Hermione would be great!) :)

As always: No slash please (unless it's secondary characters!)

Thanks for your efforts! Stage is yours :)

greetings LAX
