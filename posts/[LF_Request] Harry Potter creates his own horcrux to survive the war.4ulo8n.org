**** You don't see him make it on screen, but probably somewhere near the end. Plus he kinda sorta did (at least used the theory) when removing the horcrux.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** How far does that story follow the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon][stations of canon?]] I've skimmed it only to the end of year 1, and by then Harry'd already 1. stupidly revealed himself to the whole school, 2. pretty much re-enacted the canon ending of book one (touching Quirell to kill him & fainting), and 3. received a power-nerfing Narrativium injection from AB only to be kicked back to Dursleys'.

  When Vernon Dursley's abuse escalates to unbearable levels, Harry Potter makes a deal that gives him incredible power at the tips of his fingers. Ten years down the line he's going to have to pay for it, but a lot can happen in ten years.

** You really have to go AU/OOC for this to work. In canon, you need to have killed someone and then split your soul to create a Horcrux. So, who does Harry kill to get a Horcrux? Is Harry now the Harry we know and love since he is willing to kill someone innocent for an insurance policy? Honestly, I question the morality of someone who wishes to use this plotline because there are too many questionable factors needed to go through with it.

*** Plenty of people who deserve to die, so why not use one of them (I mean many of those disgusting pieces of filth killed and/or raped/abused people who didn't deserve it...I mean why not use a deatheater? or a serial-killer (it's not as if the wizard world couldn't get one of those...transfigure something into a look-alike, switch the copy for the original and let people just assume the killer died...cast a confundus or something on the medical examiner to make sure it's not discovered and BAM you have your sacrifice!))...sorry, but if you carry the world, then doing that ("For the greater good" - come on Dumbledore ruined Harry's life (IMHO) so why wouldn't he go the extra mile if he's think his plan would not work? Hell, Harry himself would probably do it if he doesn't think there's another choice, come on: The guy willingly sacrificed himself, if Dumbledore insisted that he can't be sure it would work, then I am sure Harry would sacrifice a part of his soul (it's not as if you can't restore your soul later after Voldemort is taken care of!) for the cause!)

**** Why are you questioning the morality of people or judging them based on the plot lines they wish to create. Artists have visions, they have questions, and they have the ability to formulate realistic outcomes for those questions to fulfill their visions. Why is someone "sick" for wanting to ask the question of, "What would happen if Harry was willing to kill for an insurance policy?". The artist might think, "what would have had to happen to Harry for this to even be a possibility in his mind?". Then they might start to contrive a believable story, what makes them a "sick person"? WTF is wrong with you [[/u/UndergroundNerd]] in that you are asking to read this type of literature and then judge those that create it?

***** All people live to be judged whether you believe it or not. People thrive or fall based on what others think of them. Thinking some people would be sick or twisted to write this type of fanfic does not make the fanfic unenjoyable, it simply means it requires someone of the right mindset to write it to its full extent
