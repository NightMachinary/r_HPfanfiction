I recently read The Changeling by Annerb on ao3, and I absolutely adored it. Now I'm searching for fics along the same vein: fics that will restore my faith in the wild powers of women and sisterhood, but without being overtly political. Bonus points for romance! Thanks in advance! ♥️

Also, I suppose you could throw in some stories with Bellatrix like Delenda Est, but Harry kinda steals the show rather than letting her lead.

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Iris Potter doesn't do normal, and her fourth year at Hogwarts is evidence enough. Two new tasks. Tiny amount of femslash. Sort of complete, sort of abandoned.

** There is a fic which i havent started reading, but the summary is that, Hermione is bored now that the Horcrux hunt is over and she goes off on an adventure that sees her fall for Malfoy. it got me thinking about writing a similar fic where she admits to Ginny shes bored, and Ginny is the same. They go off on vacation together, meeting up with Luna and find out Luna is unknowingly caught up in some drama, and they help her out. No love interests (they are back home Auror training), just girls helping girls. Thoughts? I havent come up with any idea what Luna is caught up in, so any ideas there would be appreciated.

Perhaps Luna is caught up in some conspiracy related to Crumpled Horned Snorkacks/etc. For example, perhaps she has discovered the existence of a real creature and someone is trying to keep this information suppressed. Or similar ideas.

*** Would be interested in Hermione and Ginny helping Luna refind her love for these creatures, and her father, after the war. It could be a great adventure and healing fic, Hermione does camping done right, Ginny feels included and needed, and Luna gets to experience nature and finding clues that rebuild her faith. Could have the meeting of Luna and Rolf, not the path of love that it becomes, just a couple of girls meeting another nature enthusiast on the trails of a creature.

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Hermione is totally awesome in this story. And if you don't insist on magic, it will be a great read. Also, Ron is a model boyfriend here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]], linkffn(12614436): An adorably dark Hermione summoned demons as her friends. No romance though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]], linkffn(11463030): A super Hermione pretty much won the war by herself.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spygirl][Harry Potter and the Spygirl]], linkffn(10959290): Activated as the Spygirl, Hermione crashed the Death Eater party in the DoM, and proceeded to curb stomp the bad guys.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345): Narrated from Ginny's first person POV, it's an entertaining curb stomp fic with some quite erotic moments. Harry is a snake animagus here and likes to hide next to Ginny's tits.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107): This is the only completed Ginny lone time travel. She accomplished her primary mission objective efficiently and painlessly.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958-14/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm][Harry Potter and the Deadly Heller]]: Ginny gained the Slayer power during the Astronomy Tower Battle. Voldemort knew and began raising another army of vampires and demons. Ginny and the Trio had to fight those in addition to hunt for Horcruxes. This is actually my favorite 'Ginny joined the Trio in Year 7' fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028): Bellatrix is the star in this non Voldemort AU.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005755/1/The-Daring-Win][The Daring Win]], linkffn(12005755): This is interesting because it features Umbridge as the main character who raised Harry and outmaneuvered them all!

Waitasec... So Voldemort found out that Ginny gained powers optimised to fight against vampires and demons... so he raised an army of vampires and demons, as opposed to army of something Ginny's powers weren't well-suited to fighting?

** Those Gilded Chains We Wear by KuraiBites is absolutely amazing. I was a bit skeptical at first about the Hermione/Bella pairing, but I ended up falling in love with it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7755315/1/Those-Gilded-Chains-We-Wear]]

The Alkahest by shadukiam is another favorite of mine. It's Hermione/Draco [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6030910/chapters/13830103]]

The Debt of Time by Shayalonnie is one of the best fics in the HP fandom, IMHO. It's Hermione/Sirius. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10672917/chapters/23626929]]

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** I know there's a fic out there where Hermione basically takes over the protagonist role (Harry, for his part, is quite happy to be safely out of the way of the plot). Methods of Rationality also has a pretty kickass Hermione, but she's not the main protagonist so it might not be what you're looking for.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.
