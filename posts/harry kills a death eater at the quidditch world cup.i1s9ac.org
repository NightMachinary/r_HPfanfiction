** Ugh I know what that fic is but can't remember the name.

He summons a snake out if Ash that blasts the hole. He goes on to chat with Salazar's portrait in the chamber learn from him, summon snake through the water in the chamber, Hermione breaks his wand and he gets new one through the basilisk's tooth and venom.

It's a Harry x Fleur story and he goes out with Katy for a while too.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** I don't think this is the story but it's close. In this one Harry comes back from the future and saves fleur and gabrielle from deatheaters at the world cup. Killing a couple of them. The part that is different is that he is living with the flamels not Sirius.

  It all went wrong. Harry was locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond, unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him when Harry is sent back in time with one mission, to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.
