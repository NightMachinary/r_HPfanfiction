** The [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=2][DLP Library]] has hundreds of fics arranged by broad themes. In addition to that, a tagging system allows you to search by pairing or other themes.

[[http://fffn.darklordpotter.net/search/1][Filtered Fan Fiction]] allows you to filter FF.Net by a wide variety of very specific search criteria, including things to exclude.

However, I don't know of any project which lists fics by such specific fandom tropes. Perhaps it's something that should be done more...
