Maybe I just run in the wrong circles, but ridiculing someone for being against chattel slavery is kinda weird and it's hilariously common in this fandom.

To clarify, I mean the views of the authors and readers, not the characters. Having diverse opinions for the characters is great and I am not pushing against that.

Edit: Also pls no Dramione or Snamione. Never liked those.


** Going back to the classics, linkffn(Saving Connor) and linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) spring to mind, although I don't know if you were looking for more of an emphasis on Hermione herself.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** I feel like many post-war fics throw in at least a line about Hermione's efforts with the house elves - usually saying something like she's helped to secure better regulations and rights for them, but nothing approaching full citizenship or freedom.

*** You know what I'd love to see? A fic where Minister Hermione manages to push through a law giving house-elves full citizenship including the right to vote. She proceeds to lose the next election to an ultra-conservative backed by a huge house-elf vote. They adore his promises to abolish holidays, scrap the minimum wage, and re-introduce corporal punishment to Hogwarts.

Lesson of the day: if you grant the vote to a population with vastly different cultural values to your own, your culture is going to change.

** My /The Parselmouth of Gryffindor/ and Alma Lannister's /The Fight for Rights/ are both about crusades for nonhuman rights in general, though neither is focused on Elves. Might interest you.

White Squirrel is also in favor, and the /Animagus/ series (can't remember if it's already in /Accidental Animagus/ or started in /Animagus at War/) features a delightful free!Dobby.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and Fifth Element) - They have a bunch of elves learning to read and whatnot.

You'll probably find that most H/Hr are either mugglewanks or closeted animal/creature/beings-rights activists, with a few exceptions.

Not that I find it wrong to treat them right, I just don't care to read about it on a fucking fanfic that won't change a single thing, I'd rather have a plot than all 300000 rules of what you should and shouldn't do with elves and other creatures from Hermione's PoV, considering I do dislike her immensely.

  Sixth year fic. Examines H/Hr in context of his unwanted wealth and fame, and her need for independence. H struggles for magical control over a mysterious, powerful fifth element, receives an inheritance and has a dalliance that ends in disaster.
