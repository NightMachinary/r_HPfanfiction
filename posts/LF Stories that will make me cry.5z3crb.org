Would prefer longer stories, 75k+ ish. Doesn't matter so much to me what the pairing is (or even if there is one), but my favorite is HP/DG (read most of that pairing though).

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

***** Just finished it. That's easily the most I've cried due to a fanfic story, maybe excluding 'The Pureblood Princess' by TE7, and that was more due to the way Daphne was written in that story reminding of a girl I knew. So that was a bit more personal if a story for me. Pretty good read though.

  It did not occur to Harry Potter to wonder why his Snowy Hedwig was so much more affectionate than the other owls. It did not occur to him he would ever need to care. That's why she waited to tell him. (Canon compliant)

  Living with Draco was difficult; living without him is unbearable. But if there's one thing Harry learned from the war, it's that even when one life ends, the rest of the world goes right on living.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4008738/1/Red-Ink-Remains][Red Ink Remains]] is quite sad, it's written by the same author ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/24216/][Lady Altair]]) as Cauterize. Anything really by Lady Altair is potentially tearjerking. It requires a little bit of devotion to read to but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] has a moment that was very sweet.
