:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basically what the title says. From what I can remember of the story (which was uncompleted), Neville, James Sirius, Rose, and maybe Scorpius travel back in time to Order of the Phoenix. They do so by a malfunctioning time turner, which becomes problematic because the time turner only transmits (?) their consciousnesses, not their bodies.

This leads to Ginny and Hermione both becoming pregnant, because in order for James Sirius and Rose's consciousnesses to transmit successfully, they need their own bodies. But because they were originally conceived after their parents were married, their parents also wind up becoming spontaneously married at the moment of their new conceptions.

...I realize that this sounds like crack but this story was a serious fic that was actually pretty good. Any help is much appreciated, even if it's only to tell me that I'm SOL because nobody has a copy of this fic. (I'd rather that than being stuck wondering if this fic was really pulled or not, tbh.)

Oh, and before I forget, thank you in advance!
