Many fics refer to a wide array of books that detail supposed adventures the Boy-Who-Lived went on to have after defeating You-Know-Who. Like, at age 5, Harry took down a vampire clan. Harry is always surprised to learn that people have been using his name and likeness without his authorization, and girls are always tearfully disappointed that none of it was real. Is any of this in canon?


** There's no evidence that there were fictionalized versions of Harry's life pre-Hogwarts or that people made money from his likeness.

But he does have a certain amount of notoriety.

  He'll be famous --- a legend --- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future --- there will be books written about Harry --- every child in our world will know his name!"

I think his mystery is enhanced by his absence from the wizarding world, the first time we see him at the Leaky Cauldron, people are falling all over themselves to shake his hand and saying they can't believe they're meeting him at last. But we don't see that in later books because people are a little more used to the idea of Harry being part of their world, even if they haven't met him.

To be honest, the real version isn't that great of a story for a kid anyway. "Once upon a time there was a prince. The prince's parents were murdered by a bad man, but when the bad man turned to kill the prince, the bad man died. No one knows how it happened and the prince didn't actually do anything except for blink at Voldemort a few times. No, the bad man isn't going to come after your parents like he did to the prince's parents. No, the bad man hasn't been seen for about 4 years so you're probably fine."

Didn't Ginny say she grew up reading stories about him? Stories, plural. As in, more than just the voldemort thing?

** In canon, it is said that all witches and wizards have "heard harry's story" I think that like any hero, his exploits are naturally exaggerated. I know Ginny grew up hearing about the boy who lived. That is not to say that there are tons of children's stories about hit.

** Hermione mentions reading about him in history books, but there is no other info on books about him iirc.
