Hello,

​

I've recently rewatched the movies and for the first time I noticed the serious chemistry between Remus and Sirius (I feel so blind now). So now I'm looking for reading material, but I'm kind of struggling. I haven't read HP fanfiction since maybe 2010. What I'm looking for:

- No world changing AU like no-magic, modern day, etc. Preferably no major changes to the characters like one of them being a vampire and things like that

- Only complete works, no abandoned/WIP

- Preferably marauders/first war

- No one shots

- The longer the better really

- No major character death that's not book canon

​

Side ships or OT3 are totally fine.

​

It think that's it. What have I missed with this gorgeous OTP? What got you so hooked you couldn't stop reading? Give me your best Wolfstar fanfics, please :)

#+begin_quote
  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.
