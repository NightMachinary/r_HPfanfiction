** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5998729/1/The-Valley-of-the-Kings-Massacre][The Valley of Kings Massacre]] - A oneshot, but rather fun.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5915140/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Cursed-Summer][HP and the Cursed Summer]] - Good mid-length story, finished with an abandoned sequel. Harry goes with Bill on a cursebreaking adventure.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] - Has some elements of weird/powerful magic and cursebreaking

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/26/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][Magicks of the Arcane]] - Features mentor!Dumbledore, traveling, tombs, caves, exploring...

And I'd love to find more of those stories...

*** Just read Magicks of the Arcane and really enjoyed it. A work in progress, but good so far.

** [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=367][Parade of the Sun]] might fit what you're looking for. I haven't finished it myself, need to get back to it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9920217/1/The-Astria-Porta-Project][The Astria Porta Project]] The title betrays it already, but this is a HP/Stargate crossover. Harry wanted to find Voldemort's horcruxes in his own way, but found so much more instead. The treasure hunting comes up short in the story, because it's only mentioned and referenced unfortunately. Still, I mentioned it for completeness sake.
