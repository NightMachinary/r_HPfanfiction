How the Sorting Hat is used in a lot of fics is something that oftentimes bothered me. It's depicted as some kind of super sentient, all-seeing tool and I'm curious what you guys think about that and how the hat /actually/ works.

Is the hat capable of reading memories? Does it just get a read on surface traits and feelings? Is there some merit to it being this sentient OP legilimens?


** It is undoubtably the case that the Sorting Hat is genuinely intelligent, as it is capable of artistic creation (the Sorting Songs) and displays a lot of personality. If you want to limit the number of magical AIs running around in your fanon universe, you /can/ cut him down to just a chatbot-like illusion, but this goes fundamentally against the grain of canon.

On the other hand, you're right that it does not seem to be all-seeing. What we see of it in canon is limited, of course, but its comments during Harry's Sorting are all about the nature of Harry's personality, not about his memories, let alone his future. It /could/ likely have a look at some of Harry's memories, but it can't just take in all of them at once within seconds, any more than a human Legimilens could.

I think the magic of the Hat is all in all very like human Legilimency, and he's no better or worse at it than the average human Legilimens, just more experienced in deducing people's personalities from a quick glance at their thought-patterns. I certainly don't think the Hat could get past decent Occlumency any better than a human Legilimens. Why would it have to? There's no such thing as an 11-year-old perfect Occlumens. Perhaps some kids with good mental training and/or soul-focused accidental magic might be able to effect crude mental defenses, and the Hat can likely get past /that/, but why would it need to be the stuff of Voldemort's nightmares?

I think the idea that the Hat /must/ be an all-powerful mind-reading device likely comes from the idea that he's an artifact of the Founders and that artifacts of the Founders /must/ be deceptively powerful by default. But A), the notion that the Founders were uniquely powerful even by modern standards is misguided, and B), the Hat /does/ have a secret Founder-given power, and it's got nothing to do with being better at Legilimency than it looks: /it can summon the Sword of Gryffindor from anywhere in the world/.

**** Per /Deathly Hallows/, fairly sure it does summon the Sword from wherever it is currently.

*** Yeah, I agree that it does have a form of sentience but some writers almost make it seem to be almost human, which I think goes a bit far. And that it has been enchanted by the founders (Gryffindor in particular) is obvious. My main gripe comes from how it sorts students. Does it read memories or does it just go through surface thoughts, feelings, etc? Because I can't recall any instance in canon which insinuated that the hat could actually see memories.

Why so? What it shouldn't be is AI-level in intelligence. It is no /smarter/ than a human. But by all appearances it's as much a person as a flesh-and-blood human.

** Crack plot twist, the hat has just been a normal hat all this time.

An unknown rule is that the headmaster must be skilled in legilimency and charms in order to qualify for the position. Nobody is watching the headmaster right before or during the sorting, all eyes are on the hat or the student being sorted. So the headmaster can get away with sneakily casting a few spells, reading the students minds for the sorting, then using a ventriloquism charm and some simple animation charms to make everyone think the hat is the one talking.

The hat didn't actually start giving a song before each sorting ceremony until Dumbledore became headmaster. The start of term song tradition started because Dumbledore's always liked a good musical number, helps the nervous first year students relax a bit.

"But how did the sword of Gryffindor come out of the hat when Harry was in the chamber of secrets?" Space expansion charm, it was already in the hat when Fawkes brought it to Harry. The sword wasn't actually lost lost, it was just hidden somewhere amongst the chaos of random trinkets in the headmaster's office. Dumbledore found it, put it in the hat, gave it to his firechicken, and yeeted the firechicken down the chamber entrance. Boom, magic hat gives the sword to a worthy Gryffindor.

"What about when Harry talks to the hat when Dumbledore isn't in the room?" Dumbledore has a time turner and can cast disillusionment charms strong enough to turn completely invisible.
