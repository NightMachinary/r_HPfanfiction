:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Can anyone help me! I'm looking for a Harry/Ginny fic set when they are adults.

I remember something like the following; Ginny is forced to marry Draco Malfoy, however she and Harry run away to the muggle world before the wedding can occur.

They stay hidden for years, and have a child (probably called James) and like a mostly muggle life before they are found eventually by wizards again.

I also think Harry has a motorbike, he and Ginny are married and go by alias's to stay hidden. Also not sure that Voldemort was ever defeated.

This has been driving me mad for months, so anything would be very appreciated :)


** Sounds like /The Unbreakable Vow/ by Ash Darklighter.
