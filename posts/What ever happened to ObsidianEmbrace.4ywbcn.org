Does anyone have any copies of the author's fics? I know for awhile they were still listed under "notevenhere". The profile is empty now. If you have any copies will you please share?


** While I'm not sure whatever happened to ObsidianEmbrace, as all their accounts have seemingly been abandoned and they have disappeared from the internet altogether, you can still find at least one of their stories (A Life More Ordinary) on A03 under an orphaned account. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4957753/chapters/11384338]]

If you search, I'm sure you might be able to find their other fics as well on A03. I do hope that ObsidianEmbrace resurfaces eventually, I really did love their work.
