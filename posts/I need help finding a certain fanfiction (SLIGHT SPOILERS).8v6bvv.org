Ok guys, I need some help finding this fanfiction where harry has the ability of the guy from re:zero or if you don't watch anime or read manga, he has the ability to go back in time uncontrollably on death, most of the time it's months but it can be weeks or sometimes days(don't count me on this since I lost it a while back) and so he becomes paranoid at an age(that I can't remember) before he gets the hogwarts letter because when hiding from the gang of kids his cousin(that little shit) made he is killed by a death eater who is also with the head-nest-Quirell, then harry finds himself back in time a bit and this time hides in a different place instead of the old house the death eaters who avra kedavra'd his ass back in time were occupying. Also in hogwarts he fights Quirell after figuring out he had Voldemort nesting in the back of his head with a cutting spell which he also used to kill the mountain troll, but is killed(I think) and has to go back a few months which he also uses to hone his offensive skills(and I think he also founded or joined a new dueling club as a way to hone his dueling skills as he got wrecked by Quirell). Another thing that happened was that in the middle of class, Harry tried to kill Quirell but got wrecked(which I think is the reason he founded the club or joined it).

I know that this is a lot of information that I could've used to find it myself but I'm fuxking terrible at searching for books and novels or stories, so I already tried and failed terribly, so I'm putting my need of finding this actually good fanfiction on you guys.

*** Came here to say this. Also, OP probably would have been better comparing it to Groundhog Day or Edge of Tomorrow more recently.

***** I still haven't. I keep meaning to but just never get around to it. Just like the green mile now that I think about it.
