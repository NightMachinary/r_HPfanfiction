Hello there! I am looking for Fanfictions where Harry is paired with an OC that is Malfoy or any other Slytherin boy (like Goyle, Crabbe, Nott) sister. A prime example of the kind of story I look for is the story called "Twins" linkffn(9631399) I would appreciate as many reccomendatiobs as possible because I really liked the story but sadly it got dropped.


** Is there a uncensord version of twins?

  What if Harry had a twin sister, someone who grew up with him as they ventured through life together, instead of him facing the world by himself. And Malfoy has a sister as well, which makes life even more chaotic. Sequel to Battle of Wills, with AU elements. Story begins with Harry's 4th year. Harry/OC/OC/Fleur. Warning: wincest, BDSM, harem.
