I vaguely remember it but I know it has something to do with harry traveling back in time and befriending tom riddle and then dating him. They get closer, go through a bonding ritual I think? and then harry realizes that Voldemort is insane because harry left sometime after so he has to go back to the future and once he gets there he goes to Voldemort to make him sane again. I know harry also asked someone from the inner circle to help tom get through it too.


** Ahh I know of it. Can't remember it's name though. I'll have a look and get back to you if I find it.

  Harry wakes up on the first of August 1943, and Tom Riddle's presence seems like the least of his problems... until Tom makes Harry his problem. Old clich√©, new design. Slash HPTR
