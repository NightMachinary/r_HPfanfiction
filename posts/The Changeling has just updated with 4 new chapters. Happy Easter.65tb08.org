** I find it somewhat funny how the "Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why." summary is a bit too literal, as the story is already 6 years old.

** linkao3(The Changeling by Annerb)

If anyone hasn't had the chance to read this, I highly recommend it. Possibly the best, if not one of the best, Ginny-centric fics out there.

**** Is it not updated often? I really want to read it, but if it's probably not going to be updated for a million years I'd rather wait. I just can't cope with that kind of stress, lol.

AO3 says there will be 11 chapters, so there should only be one more, right?

***** It looks like only the epilogue is left but not sure when it will be put up. There's been an update every year or so but since the next update isn't a complete chapter it might be done faster.

****** I can't complain if she ends it with the epilogue, but honestly I'm really intrigued about the "what happened next" in this universe. Ginny sort of plays her role behind the scenes and it doesn't seem to be common knowledge just how involved in the resistance she was. It would be interesting to see if others sort of turn on her for not "doing more" and how she reacts.

***** Each year up until year 6(for ginny, so the events of the last book) was only one chapter, and they were super long, so it only got updated very infrequently, like once a year. However it is complete now. The author posted the second half of year 6 a few days ago and then posted the epilogue which covers ginny's 7th year today.

** I don't particularly care about Ginny, but this story is mentioned a lot. Why should i read it? What's so great about it? The summary tells me nothing and since I don't ship H/G I'm not going to read it for the romance.

Slight spoilers are fine if you manage to pique my interest.

*** You're in luck! There is very little romance.

I don't know if I can come at this from a perspective that doesn't like Ginny because she's always been my favorite but I'll try.

The Changeling is that fic where the character is surprise!sorted into Slytherin and you think the plot is going to go one way with the typical Slytherin tropes of politics and class nuances but it manages to subvert these tropes by elevating them. There are Slytherin politics, yes, but it's nothing as ridiculous as 11 year olds deciding the future of the Wizarding World, it's school children trying to figure out their place in this house that is so vilified, but being able to take pride in the fact that yes, they are Slytherins, and yes, there can be good in that.

One of my favorite elements is just the badass women. Not only Ginny, but Molly, Fleur, Luna, and Hannah as well (not to mention all The Parlor girls)! I feel like this fandom, and this subreddit in general, can be a little male character focused and it's so refreshing to see the women take center stage for a change. There is also some unique world building with The Parlor and the Sisterhood of Nymue that just hits all of my buttons.

The writing is so well done that the Ginny we know in canon is still there, just her experiences are different. If you want to read a truly excellent story, where Ginny realistically, and painfully, grows up in Slytherin, I urge you to read it.

Anyway, that's just my opinion. I may be unfairly biased because yeah, Ginny is my favorite, and yeah, this might be my favorite fic, but I don't think I'm being biased when I say that it really is excellent.

**** What about the golden trio, for lack of a better term? Do they have major roles like in canon but only taking place off-screen or do one or more of them get sidelined in the overall plot?

***** The trio does not have particularly major roles since they are primarily in the background (considering they're in a different house and busy having their own canon adventures) but they do have some particularly thoughtful scenes when we see the difference between how a Slytherin Ginny and a canon Golden Trio interact.

****** It's a very good model that I think more fanfic should consider. You've got the trio doing canon, but then OC-ish characters (anyone from the Pottermore 40) doing their own thing. No need for canon rehash, it can just be sort of mentioned in passing.

Thanks. That's what I was asking. I wanted to know wether they (more or less) have their canon adventures or if they just sit around while Ginny does everything.

*** I don't care about Ginny either, but in this story she's been done justice. My favorite part is the portrayal of the difficulty she faces in finding common ground with her family, after the sorting. It's done so well, and the best part is, it takes no flowery bullshit to do it - the writing is compact, even laconic sometimes, but so very meaningful.
