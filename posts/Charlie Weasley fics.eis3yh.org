Does anyone have any really good fics that have Charlie Weasley in it?

I really like stories with him, preferably where he gets together with someone whether it be a canon character/oc/muggle, whatever.

Or I was reading the Second String and I really liked Gideon Prewett in it, so maybe instead of Charlie it could be one of the twins?

Idk I just know I read a fic with Charlie in it where he got together with a Muggle and it was so good so I'm looking for more


** Monochromatic is about Pansy after the events of canon, and ends with her and Charlie getting together. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4083577]]

Rebuilding has a Pansy/Charlie subplot- they actually get married-, but it doesn't get revealed until later. spoilers, i guess? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11439594/1/Rebuilding]]
