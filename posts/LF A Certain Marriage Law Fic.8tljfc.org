It's an older fic, and I'm mainly looking for it to prove to myself I didn't dream it up. I've tried searching for it with the keywords “Marriage Law”, and nothing has come up, so those two words together are probably not in the summary.

Anyways, it was on Ff.net and, from what I can remember of it, had Ron and Snape as a pairing and maybe Draco and Hermione. Harry might've been paired with Ginny. I just remember Hermione lecturing Ron that marrying Snape wouldn't be so bad and that they could conceive a child through potions and surrogacy. Harry, I think, was laughing his ass off at Ron's fate the entire time.

Would be really helpful if this is found, because then that means my younger mind wasn't as crazy as it is now, thus meaning I didn't dream it up. Thanks.


** thats like being in some kind of hell world. the girl you fancy is lecturing you about how you can possibly have ass babies with an old creep and your best mate just thinks its funny that youre about to be raped

*** No, not “ass babies”. It was like a potion to make a fetus and then insert it into a surrogate mother. But yeah, it was really weird reading it and all of this happened in the first chapter -- I didn't get any farther than that.

** Marriage law is a totally ridiculous trope. It's basically government enforced rape, an atrocity that even Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Maoist China didn't dare to implement. Those (shippers mostly) who cooked it up have no clue about how people are going to respond to this kind of tyranny, and Hermione would never ever submit herself to this ultimate abuse of human rights!

That being said, I like the following 5 levels of responses to this travesty:

1. If they passed the law before Voldemort's defeat, before our heroes really got strong, the most likely outcome would be an exodus, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/][Escape]], linkffn(11916243)

2. Our heroes organized a mass exodus and left Magical Britain to rot, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6049450/1/Harry-Potter-s-Reaction-to-the-Marriage-Law][Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law]], linkffn(6049450).

3. Our heroes were too greatly weakened by the fight to defeat Voldemort, so they arranged for a third party to take care of those responsible for the law, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/There-s-Always-a-Way][There's Always a Way]], linkffn(2612901).

4. Our heroes took out those responsible for the law by themselves, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4960536/1/The-Obligatory-Marriage-Law-Fic][The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic]], linkffn(4960536).

5. Our heroes organized the infuriated masses, staged a revolution, and executed everyone who had supported the law, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005).

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive.

***** Fine, the khmer rouge implemented a number of policies of forced marriage in order to increase population.

#+begin_quote
  These marriage ceremonies consisted of no fewer than three couples and could be as large as 160 couples. Generally, the village chief or a senior leader of the community would approach both parties and inform them that they were to be married and the time and place the marriage would occur. Often, the marriage ceremony would be the first time the future spouses would meet. Parents and other family members were not allowed to participate in selecting the spouse or to attend the marriage ceremony. The Khmer Rouge maintained that parental authority was unnecessary because it “w[as] to be everyone's ‘mother and father.'”
#+end_quote

There are other examples of forced marriage where 1 or even both parties are being forced to marry due to commands from the state. A famous examples was alexander the great who forced his soldiers and generals to marry persian women who were a part of the existing aristocracy in order to incorporate the persian empire into his own.

********* It's an interesting argument, but I'd like to point out that the initial comparison isn't exactly fair, as there has never been a situation in our recent history, where the survival of a species came into question, which is what marriage law fics are premised on. So, the underlying claim that it's an evil law doesn't apply: it's a desperate law, although, granted, most fics never explore that theme and just use it as a crutch to get a ship together.

********** If their population drops too low, the last thing they should do is forcing them to intermarry with each other. Terminal inbreeding could become a serious risk.

If they were really desperate, they should encourage harems made up of Muggle women, since children born of Muggles and Wizards tend to be magical.

Or they could encourage marriages with foreign wizards and witches. It would certainly meet with more acceptance by the population.

No sorry, marriage law is a bullshit cooked up by silly shippers.

The story I'm looking for definitely didn't have Harry/Hermione as the main pairing; I know it was a Slytherin with Hermione, probably Draco. And, to repeat myself, Ron was paired with Snape. It was also a longer fic. Furthermore, I didn't read it and like it; I read it and thought of it as insanely weird, but it's bugging me on and off since I read it years ago and haven't been able to find it since.

Once again, I'm not trying to sound rude, it's just incredibly frustrating to get a response giving me stories that aren't anything like I asked for and then being told that I'm stupid for liking something I never even said I liked.

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9454389/1/My-Green-Eyed-Mystery-remake]])

its a marriage law fic where Ron gets paired with Snape, and Hermione does mention about a potion where two men can have man babies. the rest doesnt match with your memory, though.

its an AU where harry was sorted into slytherin, neville is the BWL, and the potters live. harry and ron arent friends. its actually rather inoffensive on the whole.

hermione gets matched with draco, but her and ron are already in a relationship. the four of them (snape, draco, ron, and hermione) get together to try to figure out a way around the marriage law

the main focus of the fic appears to be the harry/ginny pairing and some potter family drama though
