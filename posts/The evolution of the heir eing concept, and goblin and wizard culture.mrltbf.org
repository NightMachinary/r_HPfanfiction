I have been reading a few harry potter fanfics and I really love the heir ring concept and how they show wizard and goblin culture and politics. Im interested to see who started them and how they have evolved over time. Im therefore interested in the fics that they originate from and if there are any fics or tags you recommend. I mostly read on ao3 if that helps in any way.


** I'm not a fan of most of the goblin culture fics, but I absolutely love Lomonaaeren's [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1423924][Realm of Song]] series

  An AU where Harry wanders away from the Dursleys at six, is found by the goblins of Gringotts, and grows up in their Realm of Song beneath the earth.

** The trope has it's origin in the oldest indy!Harry fics. I do not know precisely where they started. I've been around a long time, on Hawk's TFF, DLP, and a few other places, but I'm not the oldest by any means. Someone like innortal or Clell might be able to make a more educated guess. I'm pretty sure that stuff even predates Robst and the original Harmonians.

I've honestly never liked the goblin aspect of the heir stuff. It's entirely rooted in fanon, and the reason I don't like it is because it doesn't make any sense to me. Why would purebloods trust their inheritances and family disputes to a bunch of nonhumans that they hate and that resent and hate them? I can understand why the goblins run the banks, I'm sure it's probably something to do with a treaty that ended the goblin wars. But there's no way in hell the wizards would ever trust goblins with something like heir rings or which kid gets to become a Lord in wizarding society. If something like that existed, a department of the Ministry would handle it, or something Merlin and King Arthur put together would determine how things fall out. A magical talking statue underneath the ruins of the original Arthurian court castle slaps you in the side of the head with the flat of a crystal sword and says YOU'RE THE ONE. I can't see wizards ever consenting to allowing goblins to control or even oversee that aspect of their culture.

You would think there would be a lot of fics that divorce the goblins out from the heir stuff, since it's really two entirely separate ideas, but I can't really think of any that ever have, save one or two smut fics where Harry went to the ministry's department of inheritance instead of Gringotts to sort out the massive harem he had dumped on his head. Maybe somebody else can think of one where the goblins don't handle that, but they've gone hand-in-hand for as long as I can remember.

** I like Never Grow A Wishbone by ShanaStoryteller. It reads better than political eleven year olds. I'm new so I don't know where the tropes originated unfortunately.
