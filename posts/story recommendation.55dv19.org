Reign of the Serpent Alphaaeph19 [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent]]

Hermione centric.

Hermione is taken from her parents at age 11 when she displays accidental magic.'The magical world has an Emperor, Salazar Slytherin who is a thousand years old, whose original ideals are that muggleborn-mudbloods are taken from their families and raised as magicals, earning status in the caste system.. mudblood-badger-raven-lion-serpent. All purebloods are serpents, Harry is a halfblood with a mudblood mother, and his father was a soldier in the empire's army, killed leaving Harry and his mother alone, their only protection Lord Sirius Black

Hermione is in a mudblood facility run by Umbridge, and earns a scholarship to Hogwarts, taking her two friends Dean and Justin with her. Hogwarts is a military training school, Headmaster:Tom Riddle. The students learn and form teams and compete in war games

I am finding this to be an excellent story, with characterizations I have not seen in HP fanfiction. A realistically written and plotted story. I highly recommend it.


** The whole idea of this story contradictory. If SS was extremely 'pureblood' maniac like in this story, do you think a half-blood like Tom Riddle would have any place in magical world, even if he was SS decedent(as the story says SS already sold his humanity)?

If in a story someone lived for thousand years, it's anything but realistic. A single event change in timeline should leave an enormous effects. And if the change occurs thousand years ago, by no means it's possible the events occurs exactly same way to canon upto 1900~1950.

*** yeah, this is true, but for the purposes of the story, it works, its an alternative universe. Change all the names to something else, and it's still an interesting story. I still recommend it.

*** The fic actually explains this later on, although I can't remember the exact explanation.
