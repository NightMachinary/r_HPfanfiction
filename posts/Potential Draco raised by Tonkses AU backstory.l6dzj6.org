• Lucius double crossed the death eaters by selling info to the Aurors after Voldemort died

•But he also kept death eater ties and helped criminals

•One days the Aurors raid a house full of death eaters

•The death eaters attacked lucius cos they thought he was responsible and the aurors attacked Lucius because he was clearly one of the death eaters

•Lucius dies rip

•Narcissa is told, she believes they'll come for her and Draco next

•She drops draco off at Andromeda's because shes the only relative still alive and unincarcerated

•Narcissa then goes out and wreaks havoc and vengeance on the death eaters who killed Lucius and dies fighting them

•The Tonkses keep Draco because Narcissa's will mentions Andy as like a last resort, and everyone else is dead (including a few people who would have been higher priority but Narcissa just killed them).

•The Tonkses move into Malfoy Manor because they can ayy and they raise Draco as their own, creating a less spoiled but still spoiled boy who isn't evil! Hurrah


** That sounds really cool. I could see Tonks as Draco's older sister who's way more popular and they have a sibling rivalry type relationship. Tonks could see Draco as a small little brat while Draco could see her as his overprotective sis. I could see this Draco being less mean and more nicer. he could still end up in Slytherin due to Andromeda, but will probably not spout the whole blood purity thing. If not, he can go to Ravenclaw or maybe even Hufflepuff. Though I guess it is possible for him to end up in Gryffindor.

*** Yeah! I think about the idea a lot, I've written some of a fic where Draco's a squib and gets raised by the Tonkses (but it doesnt have a plot so I don't really know what I'm writing haha), Draco thinks Tonks is very cool but would /never/ tell that. I like the idea of Draco taking up some Tonks-esque traits such as quoting muggle movies like Ted, dressing up like he's in Camden like Tonks and being really into various instruments and crafts like Andromeda. I also HC that Andromeda shrieks when happy and Draco does that too (they are a very loud family)

**** That sounds really interesting! I could see Draco acting a lot like his adoptive family while still retaining some of his arrogance, but in a more little kid way.

** This has been in my head for years. Having Draco raised by the Tonks after his fathers arrest. At this point it's just canon in my head.
