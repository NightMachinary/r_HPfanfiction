Before I start, I have to point out, I'm not to versed with HP lore, so I might be wrong.

Don't know if it was discussed previously, but something hit me just now. When Muggles will develop new engines and power sources, and venture into the stars, colonizing planets, and maybe eventually decide to abandon the old Earth for good, the magicals would be the only one left, permanently bound to it. As magic destroys tech, non of them could enter colony ships. And I doubt that portkeys could be used on distances of several billion times the radius of Earth.

The only way I could think of, is if they were dragged behind the ship in steel container, with some air scrubbing charms placed.


** The whole magic destroys electrical thing is nonsense. Diagon ally, the MoM and Kings Cross all exist in the middle of London. If tech was blown up by magic, there would be a massive 'dead zones' in the middle of London. There isn't.

It all comes from two almost throw away lines by Hermione in GoF:

#+begin_quote
  "Maybe she had you bugged," said Harry.

  "Bugged?" said Ron blankly. "What. . . put fleas on her or something?"

  Harry started explaining about hidden microphones and recording equipment. Ron was fascinated, but Hermione interrupted them.

  "Aren't you two ever going to read Hogwarts, A History^{"}

  "What's the point?" said Ron. "You know it by heart, we can just ask you."

  "All those substitutes for magic Muggles use - electricity, computers, and radar, and all those things - they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there's too much magic in the air."
#+end_quote

And later:

#+begin_quote
  Malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it.

  “He looks like he's using a walkie-talkie,” said Harry curiously.

  “He can't be,” said Hermione, “I've told you, those sorts of things don't work around Hogwarts..."
#+end_quote

So, you have to ignore the evidence and take what is written in Hogwarts; a History, and refers only to Hogwarts, as truth and applicable to the entire magical world. It is very possible that Hogwarts; A History is wrong, and people just don't try and therefore never find out it isn't true, or that there is something specific about Hogwarts it self. There is also no evidence that magicals can't /adapt/ technology, in fact the magical 'Wireless' radio, and the use of alarm clocks, and a car at Hogwarts hints that electronics can be used around magic. I say adapt because the wireless is specifically meant to be something not muggle, even if it operates exactly the same way, same with the charmed car.

So back to your original point, I would say magicals could in fact leave Earth in muggle space ships if they wanted to. If you want to read how fanfics deal with this: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4t7lac/lf_fics_where_harry_has_a_space_ship_cause_why_not/][Spaceship fics]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4xe42j/request_looking_for_fics_with_a_magical_exodus/][Exodus fics]] and a few in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4xi9uz/any_civilizationbuilding_fics/][civilization building fics]]. There are also other ways around this, such as having /magic/ spaceships, like in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/][The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig]], while in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/][Xerosis]] they use brooms and bubble headed charms. Meanwhile, a few fics have magicals unable to leave, not because of the spaceships, but because they are only magical on Earth. If they leave, they lose their magic. This is one of the major plot points in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]].

*** Yes! Everyone needs to read this and stop perpetuating that 'magic and tech don't mix' bullshit. The only source for that is as you mentioned, Hogwarts: A History, which is an old book written by wizards, whom are notorious for not understanding anything about technology. What most likely happened was someone brought an electrical gizmo to Hogwarts like fifty years ago and it didn't work because there are no outlets or the batteries died with no replacements available; wizards see this and say 'it must be all the magic around!' because that's a valid enough explanation for them, and they then perpetuate this misunderstanding to all new muggleborn and add it as a throwaway line in Hogwarts: A History Nth Edition.

To be fair, you probably /shouldn't/ bother bringing electrical gizmos to Hogwarts simply because they would not be very useful with nowhere to plug them in, having no signal in middle-of-nowhere Scotland (not to mention whatever wards might do to a signal), and the inconvenience of having to owl for new batteries every week. Unless you could figure out a way to make a safe and reliable magically powered battery/charging station/signal booster it would be pretty pointless.

******* It's not a wrong assumption. Sure, the panels would work, but considering all the things working against them---adolescent witches and wizards who could break the panels for any of the many reasons when they found those, the fact that the amount of sunlight your panels would get would be too low for a low amount of solar panels to help you any, and the probable loss of power from lack of a more efficient grid to connect your stuff to (related to the first one)---it's simply far too unlikely for solar panels to be a good source of power for anything electrical at Hogwarts unless you got a room built where you'd have both the solar panels and something or someone using magic to make an artificial light source that mimics the Sun well enough.

Had you expanded no your “Solar panels.” comment you might have gotten a different reply, but you did not and as such you got what you got. Because without actually planning for it and expending possibly a lot of effort and maybe also getting lucky enough, no, solar panels would not work as viable power source at Hogwarts, not for anything that could actually cause anyone to have a field of solar panels brought in.

** Alternate theory:

For muggles, the laws of physics are absolute. colonizing the stars will be a massive undertaking even if the planet is rapidly deteriorating and forcing everyone to cooperate just to survive.

The Wizards meanwhile just go "e=mc^{2} ? Okay, let's make m always equal 0 at all times and move on." It's far more likely that wizards, probably led by a half blood or muggle-born sci-fi nut will be the ones to successfully explore the stars.

And they could just refrain from using magic or go into a magical stasis or sleep for the voyage with a handful of house-elves or other magicals awake to maintain them.

There are TONS of stories where magicals have left earth along with or abandoned earth to the muggles or been the only survivors thanks to magic.
