Fanfics can be amazing but are so make or break. Do you think Fantastic beasts will meet expectations? I personally have high hopes, seems like a good cast.


** I have high expectations for the creature focus - fanon seems obsessed (rightfully so, since they're prominent in canon, but still sigh-inducing) with phoenixes, hippogriffs, basilisks, and what have you. I look forward to seeing this particular feature impact fanfiction both in Harry's time and in the ones that'll be sprouting from these new movies.

I'm nervous about Johnny Depp as Grindelwald and, for future movies, a shift in genre. God forbid a focus on romance. More theory and world-building pls.

*** Decision to put Johnny Depp as Grindelwald rankled a lot. I really don't care about the baseless accusation he suffered from, and the debate that ensued, but I just never picture Johnny as Grindelwald.

On the other hand, it could have been Jim Carrey. Really glad it's johnny depp when seen that way.

***** I have no idea, I was just sifting to see which actors would best fit the role (as Jamie Campbell does not quite fit age-wise), and saw a picture of Jim Carrey.

I then tried to view him as Grindlewald and cringed so much I have wrinkles.

****** I grew up with those particular big names being the HP characters, though. It might be different for someone who knew Alan Rickman as the sheriff of Nottingham before they knew him as Severus Snape, but not so for me.

Johnny Depp is just one of /those/ faces, like Dwayne Johnson and Nicholas Cage. You don't see their roles when they're spotlighted because they're so prominent.

Also, he isn't blonde enough to be Grindelwald. There's that, too.

******** Goodness, I realize Rickman wasn't the only successful author. To /me/, they weren't, if only because I was young enough to bury my face in my mother's shirt during The Prisoner of Azkaban on account of the dementors being spooky.

The answer that question is yes.

Low expectations for the additions to canon. Primarily I'm somewhat concerned that in order to maintain dramatic tension in a plotline involving Muggles, wizards are going to be nerfed.

**** 1st film was great, everything a Harry Potter film should be. 2nd was much of the same.

3rd started to go bad, everyone was going round in jeans rather than robes and it didn't work as well.

4th and 5th seemed rushed and just didn't quite work. the dueling was weird and the quality wasn't there.

6th, 7th and 8th were fairly dire, people fighting as bubbly air jet things and just argh.

Apparently, Cursed Child was even worse.

The films have been on a solidly downward trajectory since the 3rd, I don't know why this one should buck the trend.

***** I disagree with this.

In regards to how close they were to canon 1 and 2 are clearly the closest, but I think that adherence to canon isn't a good comparison to how good the film is.

For me, and almost everyone I know, 3 is the best film of all the Harry Potter movies. 1 and 2 are consitently in the bottom 4 for everyone I know (unless they say 1 for nostalgia) because Hogwarts seems very sterile. After 3 people start running around in normal clothes, messy uniforms and acting like children would if they were at a boarding school IMO (I've never been to one so I could be completely wrong here). It also makes magic dangerous, it introduces the dementors, it makes the unkown magic scary which for me is an important part of the Harry Potter movies, but not the books.

I don't agree with you about 4 and 5, I personally liked the dueling especially in 5 the effects during the final battle scene were amazing for me. 6 I'll give you, I don't like it much. 7&8 though I love, they really capture the desperation that Harry and Co feel, and the efectless magic, I liked it, it added importance to certain spells like Avada Kedavra and Expelliarmus.

****** I think they missed serious opportunities with magical dueling in 5. Instead of things being transfigured into animals to attack or objects being charmed agressively (other than in Dumble vs V) we got gunshot style spells and white clouds vs black clouds which just seemed shite to me. If you liked that then you're welcome to it.

Edit: And they shouldn't be running round in normal clothes acting like normal kids, they're in a school for MAGIC. They ride on brooms and wear pointy hats, they study potions and runes, they don't go round in jeans and a fucking t-shirt.

** I would like to point out that the last six films Depp headlined were box office failures. /Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger Tides/ was his last success.

*Into the Woods is not included because it's hard to suck with that ensemble.*

But yeah high hopes for the film and series. Nothing really to base the plot on which will probably aid it with this fandom.

*** Thats actually not correct. Both Dark Shadows and Transcendence despite doing poorly in the US and getting mixed reviews, were box office successes overseas and made far more money then the budgets they had. Alice through the looking glass also technically made money at the box office. His only real big flops since Stranger Tides were Mordecai (which I actually enjoyed), and The Lone Ranger (which actually made money against its production budget but the 150 million marketing budget ruined any profit and made it a loss).

Now to be fair, all "could" be considered as box office failures in that they were expected to do better. But we must keep in mind that box office profits overall are down (especially in the US), and he is certainly not the only headlining star whos movies have been floundering.

Hes also not headlining this movie so the whole comparison may be moot. In fact, quite a few people have no clue hes even in it lol.

***** Oh definitely. Imdb for example even says:

"Credited cast, sorted by IMDb STARmeter:"

Hes listed high because his name does carry weight (regardless of his recent history).... not based upon how big a roll he plays in the film.

The fact hes not featured in the trailers at all is another thing to think about.

**** When a film makes less than its production costs it is a flop. The Studio has to make payouts to Distributors and other profit sharers. When a film does not at least double its production costs it is a failure because it is not profitable. [[https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-box-office-gross][Explainer]]

So look at Transcendence

- $245 million worldwide total gross - $150 million in production = $95 million
- for arguments sake half goes to the Distributor. $47.5 million to be further divided down among theater chains
- $47.5 million to the Studio that made/financed Transcendence
- this doesn't even take into account marketing costs which can cost just as much as production does

***** By that very argument though Transcendence was not a flop since it made more then its production costs. You also have no real clue how much actually goes to various sources or what the contracts were between the various parties. Thats strait guess work. And in my very response I made it clear all the movies listed could be considered as box office failures despite technically making a profit above their production costs.

Also keep in mind that the box office is not the entirety of a movies profit making potential. Many movies are box office failures or flops but extremely successful in the digital or box media markets. The box office is a fickle mistress these days.

** Ive learned these days to go into every movie with low expectations. That way its harder for me to be disappointed. That said, I have higher expectations for this movie then most, if only because I feel like it was cast almost perfectly and its separated enough from the usual HP world to where it should feel fresh.

And to be fair to Johnny Depp... I think he could make quite a good Grindlewald despite the doubters. If folks can get past him as Captain Jack that is...

PS: for those comparing it to cursed child. Dont. Cursed child was always a money grab based upon a very minimalist story turned into a play. It was never even intended to be anything beyond a play but money blinds folks.
