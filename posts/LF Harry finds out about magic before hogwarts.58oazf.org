I'm looking for a fic where Harry somehow finds out about magic and the magic world before Hogwarts, and goes into it wanting to change it for the better. Preferably no Weasley bashing, and it would be great if it where either complete or is being updated regularly.


** You might be interested in The Accidental Animagus. linkffn(9863146)

It's a quite well written fic, complete with a sequel in progress; it starts with Harry accidentally turning himself into a cat to escape the Dursleys, and gravitating towards the Grangers. This leads to Hermione and Harry learning about the magical world early, and they do later get involved in politics.

Despite the warning signs (instant animagus ability, wandless magic, Lord Potter), there's no Super!Harry in it whatsoever, the characters are quite well balanced. And yes, it's free of Weasley bashing too.

If you're only interested in politics, chapter 41 has Harry speaking in favor of the Muggle Protection Act. With Sirius freed in book 1, book 3 is mostly about werewolf legislation (pro and anti) and Fenrir Greyback trying to break into Hogwarts.
