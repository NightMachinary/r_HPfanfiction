I find myself in the mood to read about Harry learning something other than Ancient Forgotten Super Secret Battle Magic (TM). I rarely see Harry going out of his way to get some training as a healer, so that's what I'm focusing on.

** Atonement on ff.net- Harry received some useful advice before the third task. The butterfly effect will be going full-speed. Not everyone is happy with the changes.
