** It really is. I thought for the longest time the story was abandoned due to writers block, but MurkyBlueMatter has been /killing/ it with the new chapters. Beyond excited for the next installment.

** The [TrTrTr] scene was diary voldemort, am I right? Because Jacob Owen was the muggleborn contestant who taken over by Barty Jr. and helped diary voldemort with the failed resurection ritual.

I probably need to reread the earlier chapters. Such a great story.

*** I don't think it is - he mentions the legislation, which diary Voldemort has no reason to care about, and Lucius as his follower. The TrTrTr one has been used in the past for Riddle, as well - see Ch. 13 for an example

*** Yes. I've always assumed it will be seven books. There have been four so far. However based on where we are in the current plot it's possible it won't go all seven and there will only be one or two more, but there will definitely be at least one.

**** I think it was mentioned in one of the author's notes there will be a fifth book. Yes, it's at the end of chapter 12. Sorry, but I can't copy the text from FFN.
