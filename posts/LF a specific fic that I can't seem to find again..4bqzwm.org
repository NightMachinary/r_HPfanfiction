*EDIT: [[/u/taketwotheyresmall]] found it! It's /Those Words, Alone No More/ by Mikee*

--------------

I don't remember much, but here is what I think I remember.

The Dursleys not only kick Harry out of Privet Drive, they do so loudly for all the neighborhood to see, saying how much of a freak he is and how unwanted etc. This messes up Harry emotionally.

Harry goes to live at Hogwarts during the summer, in exchange for cleaning the Entrance (or maybe Great?) Hall without magic. It eventually ends up sparkling. (I think it's the same fic)

During this time he becomes incredibly withdrawn, not speaking to anyone and avoiding interaction with other people as much as possible. He spends a lot of time in the library.

He ends up creating a spell (or maybe he just found it) which I /think/ is called Merlin's Shield, or something similar (not 100% sure on this) which is basically just a bunch of spells to make someone invisible woven together. Disillusion, silencing, etc all in one spell. This comes from a place within Harry that truly wants to become invisible and disappear.

Snape and Dumbledore are extremely worried about Harry, and at one point while eating in the Great Hall they ask what he wants to do with his life, and he accidentally lets slip that he just wants to die before fleeing the Great Hall.

I can't remember how it ends, but Snape ends up drawing him out of his shell and /maybe/ adopting him? I don't think it was a slash story, it was focused more on a supportive platonic relationship.

I first read it a couple years ago, no later than 2014 I don't think, so anything before that is fair game. Multi-chaptered, several thousand words, at least 30,000 I'd say. I originally read it on FFN.net.

If anyone has any idea what the fic could be that would be great!


** I have never heard of this fic but I now desperately want to read it! I'll attempt to hunt it down and let you know if I find anything.

** Found it:) I'm 99% sure it's Those Words, Alone No More by Mikee. Unfortunately, it's been removed from FF.net, but I found at least one PDF form by googling title & author.

*** Wow that's really impressive.

Do you have some secret way of finding old fics, or did this one just happen to be at the forefront of your mind? Because if it's the former I have a fic I can't find...

**** I've just been reading HP fanfic for a /very/ long time & have a lot of my own lists for fics :) If it's something I've read, I have a better than average shot of being able to find it again. I'm happy to help, but you should do a new post on the subreddit - if I can't help, there are a bunch of others here who may be able to.

***** I made a post here a couple days ago and no such luck. I even posted to [[/r/harrypotter]] and like a dozen livejournal communities and not a single comment :(

I know I'm not crazy, I definitely didn't make up the story it had to have existed!

***** Hahaha! Never mind! I forgot I posted to the FictionAlley forum as well and someone came through!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2192165/1/Better-Than-Dreams]]

The fic in question!

** Argh - I know this one, but I'm failing to find it. I'm still looking, but in case it helps anyone else who is looking, if it's the one I'm thinking of it's quite old - I'm thinking 2008 or possibly earlier...

*** You know, I'm like 100% sure I've read this one as well.

You're right I think too, I'm pretty sure it was a much older fic.

God it's times like these where I wish I was more diligent about bookmarking/saving/favouriting FanFiction when I first started reading all those years ago.

I just hope it wasn't deleted or anything, I think the story I was looking for the other day was removed for some reason or another. Makes me really sad knowing I'll never be able to reread them.

** Isn't "Snape adopts Harry" called Severitus? Or is Severitus "Snape is Harry's father"?
