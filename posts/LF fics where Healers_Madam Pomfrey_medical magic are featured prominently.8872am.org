I just recently realised how much I loved reading about the hospital wing/St Mungo's.

I'd like to get recommendations for fics that feature those two locations, Healers or Poppy Pomfrey.

For example, an OC healer dealing with the aftermath of the second war, or a field medic during it. Fics where Pomfrey offers classes in medical magic and mentors students.

I seem to recall one fic where Harry had some sort of coral snake and an aptitude for healing? Parseltongue was somehow used to heal. If any of ye recall that one fic, please link it :)


** Linkffn(The Assassin Wore White)

This fic features Poppy very prominently. This is almost head cannon for me.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

*** I love the darker tone to this: healers exacting justice based on their oaths and the agreement not to interfere in their work. Pomfrey is downright terrifying here.

** Linkffn(To Shape and Change)

I think that was the fic you are referring to. Not hard to find since it is one of the top fics in fanfiction.net.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
