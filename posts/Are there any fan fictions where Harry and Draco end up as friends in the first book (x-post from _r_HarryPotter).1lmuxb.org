** Can't say I can recommend [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2560219/Dethryl][Dethryl's]] fics as I've never read them (the author has come off as an arrogant toerag in one of the forums I used to haunt), but Bulwersator's recommendation is probably the classic one of this type.

One I do recommend is Mede's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4810036/1/On-a-Train-Switching-Tracks][On a Train, Switching Tracks]], one of the more surreal stories out there. 21k words, a series of self-contained snippets.

#+begin_quote
  First year: "Celebrities," Harry said. "Fame makes them mad. I take it the wizarding world doesn't really have them, then?" Draco and Ron exchanged glances. "No, not really." AU, assorted oneshots and snippets.

Another good one is Lulu42's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4438449/5/Path-of-Decision][Path of Decision]]. 250k words, complete. You don't really need to know Gaiman's /Sandman/ to enjoy it, but a quick peek at the wiki might help give a sense of things. I don't know why, but I just really enjoy the writing style.

  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Sandman Crossover

** This one has an eventual Harry/Draco first year friendship, though they're not besties. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3736151/1/Better-Be-Slytherin]]

Harry/Draco first year friendship; they're close-ish but not besties. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The_Best_Revenge]]

Link to the Switchverse, where Fred & George Confund the Sorting Hat in Harry's year with very interesting results. The one-shot sequels in the series span books 1-3. Features Hufflepuff!Harry and Draco as best buds, a Ravenclaw!Ron (who is my favourite thing ever), and multiple other interesting Sortings. [[http://corvidae9.livejournal.com/344634.html]]

** I just read one, when I get home I'll post the link. His dad wants him to hang out with Harry though, because of the influence. Here:

There are currently three in the series, with the fourth being released now, its already written

** Well, it isn't the main focus, it doesn't have that exact start (he doesn't get sorted into Slytherin...sort of), and it isn't a sappy friendship or romance fic, but [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Methods of Rationality]] does have them as uneasy friends and allies. That also happens really early on in the first year. It is a really, really huge fic though.

How anyone on the planet hasn't read that fic by now is beyond me, so that might not help you or anyone else much. But there is always a chance someone has managed to not read it by now.

******** Yes, past most of that. While there are many, many feels in HPMOR, I've been reading ff for 18 years. It takes bathtubs full of feels to touch me now. Which is a little sad, I'll admit.
