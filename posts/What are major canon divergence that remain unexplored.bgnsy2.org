I know that with "major" I give for subjective views, so use common sense when considering the scenarios. For simplicity, I'd consider any change that, by itself and directly, alters the plot of one of the books/all of the books if considering pre book 1 alterations.

Why do you think this divergence remains unexplored? How would it be the ideal execution of it?

Edit: "remains" on the title.


** Year 3, Lupin took his wolfbane potion and they brought Wormtail to Dumbledore, then:

- Sirius would be exonerated
- Bertha Jorkins would not be captured by Voldemort
- Barty Jr would remain under his father's control
- Moody would not be impersonated
- TWT would proceed normally
- Cedric would not be murdered
- Umbridge would not turn up at Hogwarts
- DA would not get formed
- Death Eaters would not break out of Azkaban
- They would not go to the Department of Mysteries
- Sirius would not fall through the Veil
- And Voldemort would be stuck in Albania for a very very long time

*** I really want to read a fic where Voldemort is resurrected in Harry's late-30. Harry'll be fully trained, perhaps a Senior Auror. He will have a political power in the ministry, but he doesn't have DA to support his back. How does he know which one truly believes him and the one that only close to him because he's the Boy-Who-Lived? Remember that adults are a lot subtler than children. I see a lot of potential for Lord Potter trope here.

The old death eater will be in their 50s-70s. Harry's generation will be on their prime, but without any war experience they will be less trained. How will this affect the war?

Harry's late 30 will be around late-2010s. Smartphone, internet, and security cameras are everywhere, I can't think how the wizard can hide the conflict from the muggle world. How will the muggles react? What will happen with the statute of secrecy? How did the other magical nation deals when the statue is broken in Britain?

There's so much potential here. I have no idea why the only Adult!Harry I've read is either romance or him dealing with a new threat.

***** It's hard to say. We get a sense that wizards can live longer, but in canon it seems like most of them (other than Dumbledore) seem to be like regular humans/muggles in their career trajectory.

Or at least, I don't remember many 50-70 year olds being the prime of their life, vs the 30-40 year olds of around Sirius' age.

****** We don't hear many ages for the adult wizards sadly which makes it more difficult to discuss, but i have a few counterpoints to make.

Hagrid was a contemporary with Voldemort, they were only 3 years apart in age, and while there may be some change because of his heritage you would think he would not be described with thick black hair if he was aging like a muggle.

There is also Slughorn who was already teaching and head of slytherin when Riddle was in school. He was retired in 81 which is almost 50 after we were told he started teaching but we are told in a pottermore Ebook that he retired because he though Dumbledore knew his secret, he also was still able to join the fight during the battle of Hogwarts.

Bathilda Bagshot, may not directly point to career trajectory, but she was a great aunt of Grindelwald who was a contemporary of Dumbledore and we are lead to believe she was murdered in '97 meaning not dying of old age.

Voldemort can of course return, but will do so many years in the future, when Harry is fully trained and Dumbledore has found a way to remove his scarcrux. This Harry then wins without any Deus Ex Machina, author fiats, plot armors, the "Lucky Hero" trope, and teenage power wank. It would actually make a better plot than canon.

In canon, Barty Jr broke free for a short moment during the Quidditch World Cup, but was recaptured by his dad. Then Voldemort and Wormtail showed up at Barty's place and freed him permanently.

So it's plausible that he escaped during the Quidditch World Cup for good, but it would still take him a long time to find Voldemort. They would have no time to sabotage TWT. In that case, Voldemort coming back in Year 5 or 6 would certainly be possible. Or he could spring the Lestranges from Azkaban first, and together they went looking for Voldemort.

Regardless, the plot for the last 4 Books will need complete rewrite.

** I haven't really read any fic that has these divergence:

- Ginny doesn't stole the diary back from Harry. Harry slowly falls into Riddle's charm, taken to the chamber, and died there. Riddle take control of his body and began to take control of Britain. Ron and Hermione notices something is wrong with Harry but have no idea what causes it. 'Harry' become more charming, intelligent, and loved by everyone in Hogwarts. He learns from his mistake and is more cautious around Dumbledore, taking his sweet time to learn as much as possible from the headmaster. He faced Voldemort of course, but rather than joining, he kills him and take the remaining Death Eater under his control.
- Arthur died on the ministry in OotP. Plot-wise won't change much, but we can see a more mature Ron and a more guilt-ridden Harry. Maybe Harry will fall into depression, meanwhile Ron become to take a more leadership role in the trio.

Shit, that's depressing.

1. Voldemort loses his temper when Fred and George hit him in the face with snowballs and AKs Fred before Dumbledore takes him down. He's then in custody during the Chamber of Secrets. This is very secret but Ginny's in on it because it was her brother. The shade uses her to get Voldemort a nicer possessed body and the events of book 5 basically start in book 3. Peter, fully incognito, captures Harry and brings him to the Dark Lord in return for protection? Idk man.
2. Barty Crouch Jr. stays back when Bellatrix goes after the Longbottoms. Crouch Sr. becomes Minister of Magic. Due process goes out the window, which ironically, in the wizarding world, means bribes don't help the likes of Lucius or Yaxley, whose assets are seized by the Ministry. Barty Jr. rapidly revives the dark lord and the war resumes within a year, but with much less funding, necessitating more dark magic, brutal tactics, and fear-mongering. Crouch Sr. liquidates Azkaban because he can't trust the dementors or spare hit-wizards for guarding it. The death eaters respond by fighting way harder against being captured, the aurors respond by always starting with lethal force. By the time Harry turns 11, safe behind the blood wards at Privet Drive, there are like six wizards left in the world and none of them have the time to go save him from the Dursleys. Harry eventually ends up in foster care after accidentally exploding the Dursleys when they go too far. Without obliviators around, accidental magic becomes known to the muggle government, eventually Harry is kidnapped and used as part of a military program.
3. Hermione forgets to give Rita air-holes when she captures her. Skeeter's replacement at the prophet isn't nearly as talented so when Voldemort comes back Fudge has no reason to think Harry is nuts and the ministry responds appropriately, including the mildest of investigation of Malfoy et al which confirms they're raging death eaters. They feed all the death eaters to dementors just in case. The dementors are fat and happy, Voldemort doesn't have the clout to give them the deal he gave them in canon, Azkaban's aight. Voldemort is apprehended and turned into a rock or something, which is locked in a steel ball which is locked in a mythril ball. There's no real need to force Harry into a situation where he dies to save his family so Dumbledore doesn't feel like risking it. 10,000 years later someone finds the ball and releases Voldemort, but magic has come a long way and he's kind of ordinary. "Oh yeah, we all have horcruxes. I think I have like 12? Wait you had to kill people? Gross, yeah, we just use this magic sand some guy found. Lemme introduce you to Professor Binns, he's gonna want to sic some grad students on you."

  What if Voldemort went after Harry and Neville, and gave no one a chance to die for them? What if both Chosen Ones died as children?--There was no prophesied boy, but there was still this--dozens of shadowed young faces refusing to run, even at the very end of the world. Dumbledore looked out at his chess pieces, pawns and queens; his children and his friends; his collateral damage. He had the beginnings of a plan swelling in his chest. It would take them decades to get their hands, quietly, on every Horcrux. Tom Riddle had to think they were secret. He had to think he was safe. It would take them almost decades, but one day he would be mortal again. These dozens of faces--they were mortal now. Alastor Moody could feel mortality in the aches of old broken bones; Andromeda rewrote her own last name. Remus and Sirius felt empty, gaping holes in the seats around them, and they made crude, expansive, joyous toasts to friends' memories.

  An extensive look at the character of Severus Snape through the means of an AU fanfic. Snape gets sorted into Gryffindor and lives a much different life that the one he was supposed to. But change comes at a cost as Snape learns that not all heroes can save the day. AU for the moment. Chapter 10 is in.

** How about DADA teachers coming in in a different order, resulting in different characters being able to contend with them?

E.g. The Ministry catches wind of Voldemort being im the school in PS/SS and as a result decides to send Umbridge in Harry's second year. Umbridge has a less experienced Fred and George to contend with, a very young Trio, and Percy Weasley as a ready made mole within Gryffindor. All the while in the background the Chamber may or may not be opened. If so, with Umbridge's prejudices, won't Hagrid be the prime suspect?

Or bring Lupin in in book 2 to help be ears on the ground to safeguard a reckless Harry. Lupin might notice Ginny with the diary and suspect it for what it is, nixing the existing main plot from the off.

Or let Snape have DADA in book 2 and bring Slughorn in early, making Lily the first parent Harry learns about & connects with, helping go some way to mend the Harry-Snape relationship and having him want to reach out to Lilys surviving old friends. Etc. Etc.

** Voldemort vision/link started earlier kick-started by the Quirrel Handshake.

Or Quirrel burns after the first Handshake and everyone believes that Harry is a Dark Lord or touching him harms people. Thus, it weighs on Harry's mind a lot and has a very stressful start.

Indescriminate Lily protection... Like a wrathful magic that harms anyone that "harms" Harry with the magic attacking with the same prejudice as Petunia since it was corrupted by her version of Love for Dudley.. E.G. Petunia punishes Harry for simple slights against Dudley, thus outside of pivet drive, Lily's protection took that as a template giving Harry's experience in Hogwarts a twisted turn.

** Lupin connects with Harry while growing up in Surrey. Because it's a really bad idea and Lupin doesn't have access to Wolfsbane potion, he ends up infecting Harry with Lycanthropy as well.

This could be an angst-fest or a real meditation on the tragedy of werewolf life, though I'd probably take it along the lines of 'Harry embraces the beast'. The major canon departure would be Voldemort's reluctance to use Harry's blood in his resurrection.

** There's a canon divergence I've personally wanted to explore that isn't really /unexplored/ but whose execution generally has a tendency to be much happier than I think it realistically should be: a stray spell (or similar) fucks with the completion of Snape's Worst Memory -- but close enough for him to realize what he was about to do (otherwise it'll merely delay the inevitable with a similar resolution as in canon in the end) and that he chooses to keep his friend rather than joining the Death Eaters.

The common way I've seen this explored goes something like this: Severus keeps Lily as a friend, which eventually becomes more, and Voldemort is eventually taken out during the 1st war.

What I'd like to see is a fic where this starts out similar to how some fics do this, but Voldemort winning in the end -- because events leading up to October 31 1981 no longer create circumstances where sacrificial love can render Voldemort dormant for over a decade (because whatever spy takes Severus' place wouldn't care for the Longbottoms or Lily's family with James or Severus), so the entire families die, and there's no Boy Who Lived. I'm not sure if I've heard wrong, but I've heard that it's canon that Voldemort, until October 31 1981, was actually winning the war (and while I can see Severus being on the other side delay this, he's just one person, and will not really affect things overall). So by fucking this event up, he'd likely win the entire war in the end.

I've wanted to explore this in 2 ways: directly, or as backstory where an Unspeakable (I usually think of Hermione Granger as taking this role) goes back in time to do something mundane and unwittingly fucks the event up, and when back into the present, returns to a much darker world. The latter is interesting because I like to consider what Hermione would want to do -- restore everything the way it was, meaning reverting Snape to the unhappy way he was before, and dead James, Lily, Marauders, etc, or try to do something else and create a better world overall where she doesn't sacrifice them in the process.
