Just read a couple of stories loosely based on the idea of a marriage law. Unlike most humour, they actually made me laugh. Here's a couple of quotes.

#+begin_quote
  "The girl bursts into tears whenever I talk to her!"

  "So does Neville Longbottom!"

  "Well, he did, Remus." Snape's eyes were twinking again, the eyebrow soaring. "Until you helped him to visualize me in the party frock."

  "Now Severus. It wasn't a party frock. And you did look awfully pretty."

  "I'm sure you recall it in detail late at night when you're alone," Snape drawled, motioning for a refill. Lupin batted his eyelashes. "Darling, how'd you know?"

  "Pervert."

  "Ah, yes, Severus, I'm the pervert... tell me, when you imagine your wife naked, does she keep the knee socks on?"
#+end_quote

And...

#+begin_quote
  And so it was that, as the strains of Beethoven's Fifth playing on a ghostly harpsichord filtered through the air, Severus Snape stood at the altar watching his future careen towards him like a zeppelin piloted by a drunkard. The bride wore white satin in a curiously Muggle design that made her look like an exotic pudding. Given her eye-wateringly blue hair and flamingo-shaped hat, he hazarded it would be a very exotic confection indeed.

  She was preceded by three bridesmaids in salmon and olive gowns. Ms. Higgins, he noted briefly, was grinning like a madwoman. Luna Lovegood smiled mistily and the third woman appeared to be sleepwalking. The mysterious Ms. Pepys, he supposed.

  Nor were his own groomsmen any more presentable. Remus Lupin could look disreputable in any attire, but the canary yellow robes did him no favors whatsoever. Snape was particularly proud of that touch. As for Filius Flitwick and Rubeus Hagrid, the less said of the mismatched pair, the better. All in all, he congratulated himself that they were all wholly unsuitable.

#+begin_quote
  An irreverent but in-character parody of the MLC where Snape and Tonks show the Wizarding World what they really think about arranged marriages. Nominated for the Multifaceted Awards Round Four in the Laughter and Pride categories. Gloriously AU since HBP.

  With the Order's safety hanging on the whim of a lovesick Ron, Snape calls his bluff... and Hermione calls his. Loosely based on the WIKTT Marriage Law Challenge.
