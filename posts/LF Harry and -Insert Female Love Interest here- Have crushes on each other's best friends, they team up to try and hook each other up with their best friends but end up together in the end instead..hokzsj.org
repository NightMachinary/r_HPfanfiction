Basically I'm looking for fanfics with the basic plot of Toradora!


** I feel like the typical fanon portrayal of Daphne and Tracey is kinda perfect for this: Harry has a crush on Daphne but can't approach her because Ice Princessâ„¢, and Tracey has a crush on Ron but doesn't have the confidence to pursue it after years of being seen as "Daphne's best friend." They somehow learn of each other's respective crushes and agree to help each other out, Tracey 100% jokingly tells Harry not to fall for her, he replies very sarcastically that he'll see what he can do, hijinks ensue, and bam, ya got a lowkey Toradora crossover!

But who's gonna be Kawashima . . .
