Anyone knows of any similar fics where Voldemort and Harry have to team up. Hate each other still and no romances? If anyone knows of something similar can you PM me or reply here.

Thanks

  Sequel to 'To Play the Devil'. Harry and Tom left our world behind, but the new world is far more dangerous. The washerwomen guard the fords; reapers walk the noon-day fields; the Gentry are riding, and Death moves against them. Enter a land of fairies, enchantment and fear. When they face foes they never imagined can they stay true to themselves? No relationships.

#+begin_example
  It is the age of two Immortals.
#+end_example

/Harry and Tom pass through the veil/

--------------

#+begin_example
  The world has passed into the age of humans.

#+end_example

(this is a dwarf fortress reference btw. 100% off topic but I had to share for some reason)

If you've found any in the 5 days that this has been here though, tell me please because I really liked To Play the Devil.
