have searched online for this story, apparently Harry's personality, behavior he is able to make friends with girls at school, many girls, so many that Dudley & his gain leave Harry alone and Petunia also moderates her behavior towards him. Harry then takes all of these girls to Diagon Alley for shopping trip, because he has friends and confidence he asks the Goblins questions. the story was never finished but would like to read it again. thanks.
