** Ginny Weasley 75% WHADDUP. Runner up was Remus, RIP.

For All it was a tie between Jim from the Office and Glenn from WD. 82%.

And yeah, Dumbledore fits her. Writing a franchise she loves, and putting the protagonist through hell and killing his loved ones, but knowing that in the end, he'll come out stronger and ready to save everyone in spite of it, or because of it. I see the similarities.

Although for all I got an 84% match for April fron Parks + Rec. Never seen the show but I've seen enough memes to know that's fairly accurate.

EDIT: Fuckin' hell I got a 70% match with Gollum for LotR what is this shite lol.

If you still don't understand, think about book6.

Even if it's /only/ Harry Potter characters, that's still a fair few she could have landed on.
