**** I see 2 possibility from his education, both as likely as the other:

1. Neville is a scared (and scarred?) kid, that has not only to deal with people insane expectations of him (because of his parents), but also with his mother that decided that shock therapy was the best therapy. Falling from the 2nd floor made him use magic? Let's try abandoning put a boggart under his bed. Maybe attach him to an anchor and send him in a lake? What about making him pass a night in the middle of a foret, next to a nest of lethifolds? Because of it, Neville is afraid of his own shadows and his convinced that everything is a new dangerous test of his mother.
2. Because of the same education, Neville is a certified badass that just don't care about any crazy things that happen anymore. Troll in the dungeon? No problem, learnt to deal with it when I was 5. Basilisk? Bit tricky but mom made me fight a lot of snakes, can't be that different . . .

***** I can just kind of picture 11-year-old Neville and Harry Just shrugging off the craziness of their first year a Trolls, Quidditch, Lord Voldemort coming back to life, sure this shit is easy. You haven't met the woman that raised me, With Neville being a badass and Harry well being Harry.

***** "Troll, troll in the Dungeon!"

A moment of silence followed the collapse of Professor Quirrel before the emotions spiked. However, before a general panic could break out, Neville jumped on the Gryffindor table, ripped off his shirt and drew a Dagger with his left.

"Finally, a worthy challenger."

**** Well that depends is Frank still mentally incapacitated or is he Present in his sons life because he's married to Bellatrix instead of having been tortured by her. And Bellatrix while crazy was insanely loyal to her family and Voldemort , If she is married to a longbottom, Then she doesn't have that loyalty to Voldemort, So she might be bat shit crazy, but bat shit crazy where she teaches Neville to fight and be loyal to the Family. I feel like in this scenario Augusta and Bellatrix would kind of balance each other out, Neville might be a bit skittish, But for some odd reason I think he would fall in love with Hermione If he had to grow up in house with his grandmother and Bellatrix constantly at war, he would probably go for the bossy, Know it all , with insane amounts of loyalty , intelligence and a habit of breaking rules to keep people she cares about alive. But Neville would probably Have like Scares or something From Bellatrix going overboard or maybe abusing / Torturing him if he didn't live up to her expectations.
