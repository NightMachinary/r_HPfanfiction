I want to mention first that the fic I'm writing is based on an 18 year old 'darker' Harry. He had a different upbringing and is placed in Slytherin in his first year. So, right off the bat there are some major character modifications for him to fit the criteria of the plot.

Aside from Harry, characters such as Ron are lightly different as well. For example, I have Ron as more boisterous and an outgoing extrovert who takes Harry under his wing. I also have Draco as Harry's comrade which adds a softness and a bit of humility to his character.

My fear is that altering the other main characters aside from Harry (who the reader is still getting used to as 'darker' and in Slytherin) is risky.

Readers: Do minor character modifications bother you/take you away from the story?


** I think it's fine. There are a million ways to interpret canon, and I'm happy to read different fics where the same character goes from being a crazy psychopath to a doting parental figure. Part of it is tone -- a fic without age restrictions can make everyone nice, but if you have a dark fic and a "dark" character becomes an angel, you need an in-person explanation. What you've explained seems fine.

** Generally I don't mind character modifications but if there's a reason explained in the story, that's better. Most people don't like them if there's no reason for the change at all.

â€‹

For example, it's a fact that Ron hates and doesn't trust Slytherins. However, if he is friends with a Slytherin in your fic, showing a good reason for the change in personality is better. You can show the reason as a flashback, the character telling it to someone or modifying the personality slowly throughout the story.

*** Perfect, thanks for the advice. I think it's okay when there are modifications, but as you said; it needs to have merit to it and explained well.

** Minor character modifications are fine, and often refreshing, provided that they make sense, and are consistent within your own story.

** Well, you kind of have to!

I mean Harry and Ron's influence changed Hermione (who'd have turned more into a recluse if she survives the troll without them or never encounters it in the first place), too and others as well.

If you change Harry, then you kind of have to change other characters, too (even if it is only minor changes!)

*** Touche! The domino effect would naturally modify several aspects to the story. Thanks. :)
