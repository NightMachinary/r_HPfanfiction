:END:
I am looking for a fanfic in which Harry ended up in a parallel universe where Tom Riddle never became Lord Voldemort. He was either a healer or the DADA teacher. I can't remember anything else. Anyone can help?


** It might be linkffn(A Riddled Universe)? Tom Riddle was a Healer who came up with a cure for Wolfsbane.

The bot doesn't seem to be working so here's the direct link: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe]]
