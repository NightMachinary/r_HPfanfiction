** I haven't come across any that I can share straight away, but it always irked me that the last film didn't show Bellatrix vs. Hermione, Ginny, and Luna and especially Voldemort vs. McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn. I understand that portraying those specific duels would've been incredibly hard to craft in a pleasurable way, but those two final battles were awesome to just imagine.
