/Friends/ by the psychotic house-elf qualifies best in my opinion. Not nearly as lengthy as BIRR, but I found it more disturbing. Author's page is here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3164869/The-Psychotic-House-Elf]]

The first half to two thirds of The Art of Self-Fashioning had a similar creepy/depressing vibe to me. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11585823/1/The-Art-of-Self-Fashioning]])

Voice of the Nephilium wrote some good dark stuff as well. I liked linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7062230/1/Concentric-Wavelengths]]) as well as linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls]])

** Ginny was quite sane in this fic until Voldemort was killed by Harry. She truly lost her sanity after seeing her Lord and SO killed in front of her eyes.

*** Thats debatable. She has a voice in her head that she fights with constantly, she killed a fuckton of people before that, her relationship with Bellatrix is so toxic that its not even funny and her cutting while not insane is not really that good for her mental health.

After Voldemort and Bella die she just becomes even more lost in her thoughts, because she is in Azkaban.
