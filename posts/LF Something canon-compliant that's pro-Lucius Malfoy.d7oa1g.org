I just realized I really hate Lucius, and before I become too entrenched in this view, I would love to know if anybody has differing opinions, preferably in the form of a well-written fic!

Thanks!


** I'm just gonna throw this out there and you can do with it what you will: I think it's perfectly reasonable to hate a racist, classist, adult who willingly and with full understanding of what he was committing to joined a terrorist organisation.

I've read some fics that place Lucius and Narcissa at about the same age as Harry's parents when Voldemort's first campaign kicked into high gear. That would make them teenagers at the time they joined Voldemort, so some fic authors run with the idea that Lucius was swept up in a bad group with a charismatic leader at an impressionable age. Young people with poor role models tend to make horrible mistakes before they gain a more adult perspective.

Those fics usually show that once Voldemort was gone and Lucius was older, he realized what a terrible idea it had been, how his connection to a madman could ruin his life and the lives of his family, so he wasn't pleased when the dark lord came back.

**** According to the canon though, he is at least 4 years older than Harry's parents. Lucius welcomes Snape to the Slytherin table wearing a prefect badge.

Becoming a death eater was a very obvious choice for him, but it was not the only choice, privileged as he was. Unless you believe that being a Malfoy, he was placed under undue pressure, which is exactly the idea I want to see if anyone explored. However, since Malfoy was not a true believer like Bellatrix, did not do time for the cause, I believe he was less fanatical and pursued the Dark path because it simply suited him best, and abandoned it when it didn't. Do I necessarily fault him for preferring to raise his 1 year old and not rotting in Azkaban? No. But there was no conversation about it, no nothing. I don't know.

***** You can be a true believer without being an axe-crazy wackaloon like Bellatrix.

Lucius left not after seeing the light, he left after several (major) fuckups (losing a horcrux, losing the prophesy) put him on Voldemort's shitlist. He left after Harry survived yet another Killing Curse and rejoined the fight, he realized they were about to lose.

** I quite like Lucius (and Draco) in linkffn(Runaway Wizard) I think it shows a way in which they're assholes but not at the same time. The fic is very minor slash (pretty much blink and you'll miss it) and for the most part is canon (sort of but maybe not really....) I love Lucius as a character, I feel like there is so much that can be done with him, and I feel that this fic does him justice. Or maybe that's just because I'm currently sick and think it's a great fic /shrugs/

** I always thought of Lucius as an older Draco who didn't have the chance of making his own choices and ended up leaning into it.

His dad was probably worse than him, and he grew up hating everything that was different, and just ended up *really* believing what he was taught was true.

Something like that :) No fic to back me up tho

*** You must be right, but the thing is that I don't ascribe to the view that Draco was redeemed either. I mean, we see him making the first step in the right direction, and we see that he is not inherently evil when he fails to kill Dumbledore, right? I hope he did the work off-page, after the war, and I hope Lucius did too, for that matter, but we don't know.

The reasons I hate Lucius: 1) Unprecedented cruelty to his elf, to a degree that caused the first and only known elf rebellion. 2) He had everything going for him his whole life (wealth, looks, blood status, probably considerable talent) but chose to use his privilege to further the darkest, darkest causes. 3) He was way too strict with Draco, being angry with him for not beating Hermione at any test. Dude, it's an impossible standard, and Draco deserves recognition for the accomplishments he has (say what you will, Draco is smart and probably did well enough. Not Hermione-level, but well enough). The only love he showed Draco (that we see) was in the form of pulling strings and buying him a seeker position. 4) He is Teflon. Nothing sticks to him. Bellatrix did time and then also died. Umbridge? Azkaban. Lucius? As bad as the rest of them, and he got no comeuppance except for a very brief period when Voldemort lived in his house. I recognize that it was traumatic, but less than what he deserved. At the end of the day, Harry was saved thanks for Narcissa and Malfoy to a degree, so I guess he just returned to business as usual and never paid the price. In the meanwhile, the last thing we know he did was summon Snape to the Shrieking Shack on Voldy's orders - so he never stopped being a lackey. I hate Teflon people, hate them, and I just realized Lucius is one of them, and now I really just want to see some remorse on his part, even if Draco did survive.

Why do I feel so strongly about this? Probably because I have the hots for the guy who plays him.

** This is far out of canon, but there is an unfinished HP-SG1 crossover that shows Lucius as a decent-ish sort of guy. It also made me like Argus Filch(!). Plenty of OOC, but I still like it.
