A while back I read a really good Severus and Hermione fanfiction, but I cannot for the life of me remember the name!!! However, the plot basically (or so I think) is of Severus and Hermione married due to a marriage law, but unhappily so, however on a trip to diagon alley Hermione received an enchanted brooch from an elderly witch, possibly called elladora, anyway the brooch gives hermione the ability to take away people's magic, she discovers this after she gets angry at Ginny. Voldemort hears about this and seeks to use Hermione's powers for himself, he had previously been searching for the brooch. But I cannot remember what this fic was called or where I even read it so any help finding it would be appreciated!! Plus any other snamione fanfic recs xx
