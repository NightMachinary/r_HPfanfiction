Does anyone know where I can find Anise's full fics? Or a working mirror for FA's NC-17 fics?

​

Schnoogle seems like it's permanently down and the Archive of Our Own fictionalley import doesn't seem like it's complete. I signed up for their invite waitlist in case I need to be logged in, but it'll take a while for them to get to me.

​

I was able to find some of her fics on [[https://dracoandginny.com][dracoandginny.com]], but they're not complete ---- and I'm on a cliffhanger.

​

Thanks. :-)


** Yea I just checked with AO3 and I don't think the import is complete yet

Which specific fics are you looking for?

If you still have the urls you might be able to try the waybackmachine

She's still active in the community so you could also just try messaging her on FAI

Edit: Found the waybackmachine [[https://web.archive.org/web/20170717122824/http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/anise/][link to her profile]]

*** Thanks for getting back to me.

I'm looking for Heavenly Creatures. I tried the wayback machine, but it turns out that they couldn't run java at the time when the site was crawled. All of FA's R rated fics aren't viewable through them ---- folks get stuck at the page where FA verifies age.

There was an error message when I tried to send Anise a message on FAI, but I just submitted a ticket. I didn't realize she was still active there.

**** Folks at fire and ice just got back to me. Their PM function's broken, so they recommended hitting her up on the D&G fb page since I don't have her email. Did the AO3 folks say when they thought the import might be complete? I know it's probably a huge project.
