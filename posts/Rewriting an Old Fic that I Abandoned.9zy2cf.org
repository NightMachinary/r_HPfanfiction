Around a week ago I posted asking how everyone else went about finishing their old, abandoned works. The answers seemed to all be in line with rewriting it to make the writing styles match up. I started the rewrite, and felt that I would share it. It's only the first seven chapters so far, but I feel now would be the time to share it. I'm not sure if sharing your own work is against the rules, but I don't see anything about it in my quick check on the rules from the sidebar.

** Awesome. I still need to start mine...
