Just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/50/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB][Harry Potter and the Forests of ValbonÃ«]] it's a pretty good fanfic are there anymore story's with the sorting hat playing as large a role as it did in this one?


** The obvious example would be linkffn(The Lie I've Lived), though the Sorting Hat is certainly the most original version I've ever heard.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

*** Jbern has some issues, but he also has original takes on quite a few things.

** The Sorting Hat plays an important role in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2006636/1/Catechism][Catechism]] linkffn(Catechism), but do be aware that it's quite a dark fic (and unfinished).

  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP
