I have an itch that could do with being scratched.

​

Unfortunately, all the fics I can find which are tagged Molly/Arthur either have it as a background ship that's barely mentioned, or turn into Weasley-bashing parties.

​

I just want a nice, simple fic with Ron's parents at the forefront where neither of them is Satan Incarnate. Am I asking too much?


** linkao3(The Unsinkable Molly Prewett by startwearingpurple)

This author was formerly momotwins/WeasleyTwinMom at HPFF. She has a whole series of Molly/Arthur fics beginning with Unsinkable, which is set when they are both attending Hogwarts. She's fabulous and I basically accept her Molly/Arthur as canon.

All her other stuff is fantastic, too. Highly recommend anything on her author page.

Edit: I feel like the bot hasn't been working whenever I try to link to AO3. Here's a link!: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14747585/chapters/34096946]]

** Not exactly happy Arthur/Molly and their relationship is more in the background, but no bashing, and I really like the story, is linkao3(11676102;12305793;13682133).

** Have you read Weasley Family Fallout by WeasleyObsession on FFN? It's not simple and it's long, but it is about a pretty realistic post-war Weasley family. Interesting read.

It's a oneshot. Not really much of a story to it but I found it to be rather sweet.
