How do you think it would go over if I wrote a fanfiction where Harry isn't white, and not just because of cultural diversity, but it's the only way to write this certain story?


** I've seen Indian!Harry a few times. It's personally a bit jarring for me, but if it adds to the story I'm interested, and if someone wants to write it then that's their prerogative.

**** Write what you want, homie. People are just pointing out that some of the more popular race-changed Harry stories have him as Indian. Kinda like black Hermione.

****** A very popular Drarry author.

I don't normally read the ship either (lot of Slytherin glorifying and Gryffindor bashing)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022]] is another good plot driven Drarry (what if Harry never went to Hogwarts?)

** I think I just had my most profoundly stupid idea ever. Make him Jamaican. His scar isn't shaped like a lightning bolt, it's shaped like Usain Bolt. The power Voldemort knows not? He can sprint faster than any wizard can apparate.

I'll go now...

** I'm not really a fan of people making changes* just for the heck of it. But when a story makes changes, and then addresses how canon changes as a result or otherwise does something interesting with them, I'm all for it.

** I tend to dislike changing the race of characters. If a character is black, the have them stay that way. Likewise, if someone is white.

Racial diversity is perfectly fine, but changing the race of established characters is silly to me.

*** most characters' race arent mentioned in the books though. i mean we know seamus Finnegan is irish and the patil twins are indian and the malfoys are french from their names, and i suppose a few others have skin described as pale her and there, but for the most part it isnt really mentioned. in one of the earlier movies, lavender brown was played by a black actress, but that was changed in 6 when lavender was suddenly relevant...

** Britain has had a variety of non-white people for pretty much its entire existence, from the darker-skinned native tribes to the various sailors/slaves/raiders that visited and stayed. I don't recall the skin colours of any of the potters or dursleys being described in the text, so go nuts.

** If it is absolutely necessary, then sure, but otherwise, no. While there is nothing wrong with adding cultural diversity, I dislike changing canon character's race. I'm not sure if it ever says specifically that Harry's white? Prpbably, I don't know, but it is very heavily implied. Making Hermione black is okay because it never implies anything about her race, but Harry is definitely white so unless if it is very absolutely necessary, no.

** Well, now if the race change wasn't necessary then everyone will hate you. But really it's not that big a deal to change something like race. Unless someone has a problem with changes to any aspect of the story that is.

** No one cares, it's all over the place. Most have them make no attempt to have it be significant or do any research into the various cultures he's dumped into, any more than most people do any research on how to be British.

** It's fanfiction, you can change anything you want, no matter the reason. I've read a story with Indian Harry once, where his skin colour was mentioned, but that was all. Technically it didn't add anything significant to the story, but that was author vision, so I didn't care much. It certainly didn't stop me from enjoying that story.
