I mean, if Harry was born female. Not where he becomes one in the story. I have very rarely seen any where things change because Harry was born a girl. I mean, surely he (or rather, she) would be treated differently and act towards things/people differently. Maybe she would have to deal with sexism. Maybe Petunia would be a /bit/ nicer to Lily's daughter than a son. Same with Snape and a Fem!Harry. Who knows?

Most Fem!Harry fics I see seem to be done just to accommodate shipping, so I would prefer ones that don't focus on that.


** Following major characters would treat female Harry very differently:

The Dursleys, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Draco, Snape, and Remus.

Even if the female Harry had the same core personality as canon Harry, she would have very different childhood experiences and later different reactions from other people. These factors would in turn significantly affect her decision making process and choices. I don't expect canon stations to repeat at all, for better or worse.

*** That is exactly what I mean. Most stories I read treat things almost the same and I want to see a story where things are shaken up.

Even if you do revisit Canon events, there is no way they would play out the EXACT SAME WAY as I often see.

Goodness knows, if I had the time, I would try writing one myself.

**** I think the Dursleys would be just as horrid, but it's possible they'd treat fem!Harry a little better simply because she's a girl. Sure, she'd be locked in the cupboard, but the physical violence and hostility could be toned down simply because as a girl, she wouldn't be seen as direct competition to Dudley. So no frying pans to the head and possibly no fanon making Harry get worse grades. Or, if you wanted Petunia to actually love her sister, she could try and make amends through a fem!Harry and not be abusive.

As for Draco, young boys are generally taught never to hit girls. Their rivalry would be toned down a lot, while fem!Harry's rivalry with other girls would be a problem. Social pecking order and all. Girls fight viciously with words, not fists. Playing up canon Harry's snark could be a lot of fun.

As for Hermione, I can see them being closer friends as both would have grown up female outcasts. With Hermione as her primary best friend, would fem!Harry then be more studious? Would she have grown up in a Dursley household where it was pounded into her that girls can't be tomboys, so she had to learn to sit still and be lady-like? Meaning potentially less of a sense of adventure and no Quidditch because she was taught those things were unnatural for girls?

With Hermione as her closer friend, Ron would then become closer to Seamus and Dean. Not to say he wouldn't be friends with a fem!Harry, but without sharing a dorm, they wouldn't bond as much. Or maybe he has a crush on Harry after growing up listening to all those stories, so gets a little tongue tied, so they don't become friends right away or at all (in a non-bashy way like JKR depicted Ginny in CoS- love potions need not be involved).

***** Eh, Draco picks on Hermione a lot. Does Draco ever even hit /Harry/ in the books? I don't think so. With girls being able to carry wands, I've always felt that the whole "Oh, don't pick fights with girls" thing wasn't as common in the magical world.

***** You said very well. Dudley was definitely not going to organize 'Harry hunting' games.

While Draco might be less mean, her rivalry with Pansy and Lavender would pick up.

Snape's reactions could range from nice to much meaner. He could also get into that creepy Littlefinger mode, especially if she looked like Lily.

******* I really don't see Snape as being a creepy littlefinger type character to fem!Harry, although maybe its because that would just make me sad for his character. I like the way he is written in the never ending road (even though the author says that they end up together eventually). In the fic he starts out completely ignoring fem!Harry in her first year. When they end up interacting he doesn't hate her and is nicer in a more distant kind of way, but mostly he just gets worked up about keeping her out of danger, and when she is no longer in danger he attempts to go back to ignoring her.

Dursley abuse can now include a more sexual tinge to it for Vernon and Dudley (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo helloooo???), Harri and Hermione go from being close to super close, Draco can get creepy as fuck, and Remus gets another dynamic entirely, given that he was used to treating Harry as a "New James".

** linkffn(The never ending road) mostly does this fairly well, at least in terms of interactions with others. I thought it did a good job of making slight but plausable changes to her personality and her relationships with others to account for her being female. It does sadly suffer from some canon rehash moments but it has enough original content and good writing that I can ignore it in this case. It is supposed to be future Harriet/Snape but it's gen at the moment with nothing creepy or unbelievable about their interactions thankfully.

Some things I liked is that Harriet is more subdued and more feminine (although in an a bit awkward, more tomboyish way), but still has a lot of qualities that canon Harry does. She also has a much stronger friendship with Hermione which is well portrayed. Ron is still a friend, but he also has his guy friends that he hangs out with. Pansy is more of a rival than Malfoy who mostly ignores Harry. The Dursleys do treat her similarly though. Snape is well written too, he starts out completely ignoring the fact that she exists which I can definitely believe. He does treat her decently when they do end up interacting and gets a little obsessed with keeping her from danger, but still keeps enough of his canon personality that I am okay with his character and how he is written.

Taure wrote 4 chapters of linkffn(Victoria Potter) which seems promising in terms of a good fem!Harry fic. Unfortunately, I really don't have any high hopes for lots of updates soon considering how many other fics he has unfinished on his profile. The beginning is really good though.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF.

*** I second this. TNER is incredibly well-written with astonishing characterisation and worldbuilding. The worldbuilding is actually not what I imagine the wizarding world to be like, since in my headcanon there's very little sexism in the ww due to the parity in magical power and equal opportunity education since the beginning, but I think this is exactly the kind of thing the OP is looking for.

I hope whoever's considering reading it doesn't get scared off by the future Snape/Harriet. It's not that kind of dark!fic underage sort of thing. Right now, it's Harriet's fifth year and there's still no romantic relationship between them, although you can see there's an arc that signifies how it could develop in the future. As it is, there isn't anything exploitative or inappropriate going on. I highly doubt anything going to happen before Harriet reaches the age of majority.

  Hermione gives a lecture on "gender flip fanfiction"; i.e. fanfiction depicting an AU where one or more characters has been born the opposite sex. Of course, when the ones attending the lecture are Harry and Ron... or should that perhaps be "Holly" and "Ronnie"?... it might get a little difficult to stay on track. A very meta story.

** Have you read Girl in the War? The fem!Harry in this fic is very girly and participates in pageants and stuff. Petunia as a pageant mom makes a lot of sense to me...she seems the type to mold a female Harry into being the person she wanted to be or the daughter she would want. She's still an asshole, but it's an interesting take on how she would treat Harry if he were a girl. This fic has Harry paired up with a few different & she's very much a fun-loving, normal teenage girl who likes to party and date. The ultimate pairing seems to be fem!Harry/Draco though, but the fact that Harry is female also changes their relationship a lot. It's interesting to see her dynamic with the female characters. She and Hermione clash a bit at the beginning due to Hermione being condescending and judgmental about Harry like ~girly things, but ultimately end up close friends. Ginny is also her best friend. And it also shows how overprotective Remus/Sirius are towards her. Linkffn(7793520)
