I was just curious if anyone would be interested in reading through my fic and telling me what they think.its received fairly consistent views and hits, but no one has mentioned how they feel about the entire thing just bits and pieces. Its Harry Potter(obviously), rated M(for the one lime scene and to set the theme for the rest of the series) and is coming up on the end of the first year.

If anyone is interested feel free to leave whatever you think of the story as either a PM or as a reply here or even on the story itself

Also, the request flair is just for fic requests I think. You might want to change that to self-promotion :)

Edit: Can't find you on ffn though ðŸ¤” Not on AO3 either. Could you just put a proper link of your fic in this post?
