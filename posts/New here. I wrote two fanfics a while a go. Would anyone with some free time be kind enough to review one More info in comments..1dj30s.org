** Hello. I wrote these two fanfics a while ago. I've come a long way as a writer but I've always had a soft spot for fanfiction and these fanfics in particular (I had another quite popular one but it was garbage). They both have very lofty, epic goals in mind. And even though they are both incomplete, believe me when I say I have them completely outlined from beginning to end in a black and white composition book I've had since freshman year.

Bastion was supposed to be my attempt at creating a powerful and truly tragic OC character in my favorite era to spite the whole Gary Sue genre. I think if I finished it, it could actually be quite entertaining and not at all what one would expect.

Dogmatic Pigs is... different. I had just read nonjon's Black Comedy and felt inspired to do something different and very AU.

TL;DR - I'm very self-conscious and defensive about my writing. Please don't hurt my feelings. :)
