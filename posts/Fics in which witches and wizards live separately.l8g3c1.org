Are there any Harry-centric fics in which witches and wizards live in their own place? A city, country, planet, pocket dimension, etc. I'm not looking for ones in which they are just moving there, rather, I'm searching for fics in which they are living there already.


** Linkffn(The Lords of Magic I by Taure) is the only one that comes immediately to mind, probably there are more that I can't remember.

  Massively AU. Assume nothing. Harry Potter is born into a very different world than the one in canon. A world where the Greats of history walk among mere men. A world where power is all that matters, and young Harry Potter is a commodity desired by many.
