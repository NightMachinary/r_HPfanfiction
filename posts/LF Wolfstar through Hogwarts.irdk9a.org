I'm looking for a Sirius/Remus fic similar to linkao3([[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387?view_adult=true]]) BUT non-canon compliant, as in little angst, maybe no Voldemort, definitely no Azkaban. It doesn't have to start in First Year but I would like to read about their Hogwarts time. Do recommend, thank you!!

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!

** It's a WIP, but will have a happy ending. The war will happen, but the events after Oct 1981 will diverge from canon.
