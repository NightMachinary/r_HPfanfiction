I once read a fic where Dumbledore magically bound students from telling their parents what happened at Hogwarts so the Pureblood parents would not get angry at their children being in danger and so MuggleBorn parents would not withdraw their children from Hogwarts due to the same reason.

I can't remember what fic it was but recently I had an idea: What if it wasn't Dumbledore? What if it was the Founders or some other ancient headmaster/mistress? I love reading fics where wizards have a completely different culture than muggles or at least used to centuries ago. What if the older headmasters/mistresses (maybe even the founder) created a magical binding that stops kids from mentioning too much magical stuff to their parents? And then placed the spell on the Sorting Hat who interpreted it as stopping ALL students from mentioning things to their parents that might get them taken out of Hogwarts? Now because of all this dangerous stuff happening NO ONE can mention Hogwarts events to their parents and it's not even Dumbledore's fault.


** The first rule of Hogwarts is: You do not talk about Hogwarts

** My favourite spin on that trope is that the reason parents don't care about what happens at Hogwarts is because all the other schools are /so much worse/. This was used in New Blood, where Hermione begs her parents not to remove her by telling them that “Durmstrang is known for its potions accidents and in Beauxbatons a horde of Abraham's got free and trampled several first years just last month!” It wouldn't work on all Muggleborn parents of course and one or two get pulled from Hogwarts every generation- like Sally Ann-Perks, for example- but magical children are required by law to get an education and most parents can't afford to send their kid to another school or hire a tutor.

It fits with the Wizarding world's apparent disregard for their ‘unworthy' children. Neville was dropped out the window by Uncle Algie because it seems a dead child is preferred to a Squib child. I feel like if they encounter things like a Troll then the parents would just expect accidental magic to kick in, saving them from death, and if it doesn't then they must not have been a very good wizard. Wizards seem very laissez faire in general, especially with death sports like Quidditch and their ability to heal almost any non-fatal injury.

*** I've read a fic once where there was a dialogue between Harry and his Dark Wizard mentor. It went something like this.

Mentor: Go get me these potions ingredients from Knockturn Alley.

Harry: I head there are hags and whatnot. What if I meet one?

Mentor /exasperated/ : Are you a mudblood?

Harry: ...No.

Mentor: Then your own magic will protect you. Go!

Harry was like eleven in this scene.

** That doesn't necessarily mean than Dumbledore can't be bashed, just that he isn't keeping kids from telling their parents stuff. He might even be delusional and think that the parents are okay with what's going on at Hogwarts (except Lucius Malfoy & the Death Eater's).

** How about instead of magically binding students there's an enchantment on the outgoing mail? That seems simpler- owls don't deliver information that denigrates Hogwarts? Most people use school owls anyway, and there's precedent from OOTP when Umbridge is having the mail searched and restricting communication

*** Wouldn't really stop kids from mentioning it to their parents when they're on holiday. After which, the fact that they're monitoring the mail would become very obvious.

*** Oh! I once read a Harry Time Traveler fanfic in which Dumbledore explained that he changed the halls of Hogwarts so that Muggle-borns wouldn't tell them about the First Wizarding War or something like that and that's why in Harry's years kids couldn't tell their parents what was happening.
