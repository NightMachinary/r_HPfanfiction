I'm looking for a fanfic that was on hpff with James Sirius Potter. In it he has this really angsty relationship with this girl (I think her name was Aggie) in Slytherin. I'm pretty sure his best friend was her brother. I just can't remember the name of it and I can't find it on the website!! GAH.

Thanks!
