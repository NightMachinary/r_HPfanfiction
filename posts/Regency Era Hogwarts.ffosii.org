Hi so I'm writing a fanfic that's just basically the same plot of Harry Potter but in the Regency era. Their first year will start in 1816. I'd like to know what sort of things you'd think the magical world would be like during that time, as well as the main characters and Hogwarts life.

Things like what characters would be considered aristocrats, upper gentry, lower gentry, and so on. And if there's anything you'd like to be included in my AU, let me know and I'll do my best. Thanks in advance!!
