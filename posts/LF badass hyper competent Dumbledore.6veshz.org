I'm looking for a Dumbledore who is hyper competent and does not put all of his hopes on the prophecy. Or at all. What I'm looking is a Dumbledore who trashed Voldemort to a paste. A fic where he says screw prophecy and fixes everything before even Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Dumbledore who literally steals Harry's main character plot importance enough that Harry is just a rich orphan boy who goes to Hogwarts and graduates with no adventures. Crossovers are welcome and please no slash. I have nothing against people who like that stuff but in my opinion, it has no place in a children's book.


** linkffn(9824342) Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure. The Dumbledore here stood guard at Godric's Hollow and destroyed Voldemort, and the story is him cleaning up canon where his manipulative counterpart had loused things up.

*** Just to provide a counter-point to the other comments, I was /not/ a fan of this story and I think I made it through about 10 chapters or so before giving up. I found it frustrating how EVERYTHING was being fixed all at once, before Harry even makes it to Hogwarts. But that is exactly what the OP asked for :P

I also found the little viewing from hell asides at the end of the chapter really silly.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

** If Dumbledore was hyper competent, you'd get something like this...

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore knew that Voldemort wasn't dead. The prophecy was real enough, meaning that Harry and Voldemort could only truly be killed by each other. But, that didn't mean that he couldn't help it along.

  It had taken a week to refresh his memory of all the components he needed for this (really rather dark) ritual. Sure, it was a foul thing, but on balance, it was a net good for the country and the world. The ends justified the means.

  Besides, so long as he didn't use dark magic directly on Harry, he could use healing potions to get the boy back to normal in no time. A little memory modification would aid in his recovery by removing the trauma.

  The infant sat before him, one arm trapped in a miniature guillotine. Below, where his severed hand would fall, was a blood-activated ritual that would destroy Voldemort's soul. In Harry's other hand was a cord that, when pulled even the slightest bit, would trigger the mechanical blade.

  Harry would, by his own hand, trigger the death of Voldemort. Problem solved.

  He'd be back with Sirius, healthy and whole, before the sun set.

****** Harry pulled the string that triggered the mechanism that severed the hand that triggered the ritual that killed Voldemort. Ergo, Voldemort died by Harry's hand.

Besides, I was poking fun at the Dark!Dumbledore thing too. Maybe. Or maybe I'm just a scary sort of person.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
