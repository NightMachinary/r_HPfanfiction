I've read a few fics with Remus bashing...like why is it a thing?? He's always been one of my favourite characters but I'm actually wondering why many people bash.

EDIT: I was not expecting this response. I just wanted a couple of quick answers to my question and now it's turned into a fully fledged debate.


** The common thread I've noticed is that despite knowing Harry's parents and generally grieving their deaths, he made absolutely no attempt to get in contact with Harry himself or form any sort of personal connection once he was a teacher.

Personally, I think these portrayals conveniently forget that Lupin has almost cripplingly low self-esteem, especially as regards anything related to him being a werewolf -- recall how he ran out on Tonks and her unborn child in book 7 until Harry yelled some sense into him.

I don't think they forget it, they just hold Lupin responsible regardless. His mentality is part of his character, not some external force. So if you're judging who he is as a person, that's part and parcel of the judgement.

**** Many people don't understand the prejudice that comes with being a werewolf. So 99% of the wizarding world thinks you're dark and evil. No one wants to be your friend. You have to hide who you are. If someone finds out you'd probably go to Azkaban. The transformation are extremely painful and leave you with lots of scars. You can't get employment. You're in a constant state of poverty. Voldemort used werewolves so everyone thinks that you work for him.

So, 3 people finally become your friends and support you but then 2 die and one goes in Azkaban.\\
You can't get guardianship of Harry. You can't support him even if you do. You're scared he won't like you if he finds out. You think you might infect more people.

So it's hard being a werewolf.

***** Ultimately this comes down to a much broader question of principle: can a person's background, experiences, material circumstances, mental health etc. /excuse/ bad behaviour, or is a person always responsible for their own actions?

Generally speaking, society has answered that question with the following: your personal circumstances may /explain/ your behaviour, but they do not /excuse/ it. Ultimately it is everyone's responsibility to act morally regardless of how difficult it may be.

Sometimes, we even punish those who had no other choice. The famous example being the group of shipwrecked sailors who would all die unless they kill one of their number and eat him; the survivors are guilty of murder, even though they would have all died otherwise.

****** I think the real question is whether - from Lupin's perspective - Harry would be better off with Lupin in his life or not. For all Lupin knows, Harry is having a happy life, living among Muggles (which Lupin can't do), and attending Hogwarts with his friends (where Harry would face stigma if it got out that his friend/guardian was a werewolf).

He might have contacted Harry if Harry's public approval had turned on him before they wound up meeting anyway, but it never happened.

Why saddle Harry with your presence when he's doubtlessly having a perfectly happy life?

****** When bashing characters it is important to remember whether or not they're really guilty of something horrible that we wouldn't do or if they're, like us, humans, and make similar mistakes to ours. Sure, a lot of people want flawless heros that always prevail because of their shining kindness, but a lot of people want characters they can relate to, with flaws and qualities. Someone that feels real rather than the personification of all that is good (or even all that is bad).

****** Maybe in the real world this is a question, but in HP it doesn't matter. Whether Lupin's circumstances and mental health excuse bad behavior (and not visiting a friend's child isn't bad behavior, it's lack of any behavior and that is more Lupin's issue/problem, anyways) has no stake in it. The ministry locks up werewolves if they even lift a toe out of line and society sees them as dangerous beasts. There's no fricking way he'd be allowed guardianship of Harry even IF he had the funds, which he doesnt -- werewolf problem again, hell I don't think theyd even let him see Harry. I mean there's a reason he left hogwarts after snape outed him.

***** From what I understand, the prejudice against werewolves was supposed to be an analogue for the way people (specifically gay men) with HIV/AIDS were treated in the 1980s and 1990s.

People (not all people, obvs) already thought all gay men were essentially predatory pedophiles, now add to that a brand-new, absolutely terrifying disease that seemed to only affect people in that community, but could easily be transferred to "normal" people if they were "targeted."

The '80s and '90s were not a good time to be gay (despite what some groups are trying to say), and doubly so to be HIV/AIDS positive. They were shunned, physically beaten, and if their diagnosis became common knowledge at work, they could very easily lose their jobs, and that information would likely follow them for a very long time.

I think as the fandom grows younger, more people are coming to it with a world view that has always included the modern LGBTQ Rights movement. The Netherlands first legalized same-sex marriage in 2001, Belgium in 2003, and Massachusetts in 2004. California's Prop 8, which was a very-well-publicized effort to legalize gay marriage was only 12 years ago. That means the youngest Redditors/HP fans have really only known a world where it's okay (and becoming more okay) to be gay and/or HIV positive, so even if they know about the werewolf connection, it probably doesn't evoke quite the same sense of fear and sadness that it would for older fans.

**** Judging Lupin for not having the ability to break out of his own mind and become a part of Harry's life seems eerily similar to judging a depressed person for not smiling enough. It's part of who he is, yes, but anything more than that seems kind of skeevy to me.

What he really needed was a group of friends to help get his head on straight, but one got killed, one got supposedly killed, and the last ended up in prison for the first two, so it's not like he had a great support network going on there.

My point is that Lupin's response to the whole thing, while not necessarily ideal, is nonetheless quite understandable to me based on what we know of him as a character and I find it difficult to be mad at him for it.

We know that Remus is self loathing, of low self esteem and probably believes them right for not being around them. Ge sees himself as a burden. Also newsflash: people aren't close with their best friends kids and they certainly aren't expected to act like guardians for them. That's without even getting into rewarding law speculation. The Sirius/Godfather thing alone is a stretch.

With that in mind, having said she would do "Whatever it took." To help Harry achieve his dream of being an auror she did NOTHING. Harry got an E in potions. Had Snape still been teacher this would have stopped him taking his NEWT and he would have failed his dream. She showed she could talk the talk but when it came to Harry she never walked the walk.

She saw his talent and knew, as a teacher, to nurture it early.

Just because she doesn't fawn over her students doesn't mean she doesn't care. She's of the stiff upper lip generation.

But you're saying that if the Holocause survivor had a sister or abest friend who had an infant that was the only survivor of the family, that she would have never reached out to this child who was put in an abusive household with people who hated her or his family and a huge part of what made her or him her or him, for instance placing a Jewish child with anti Semitic people who harassed and abused their friend or family members orphan child daily.

Just to be sympathetic to your claim I'll give you that the Holocause survivor wasn't allowed to speak with this child the first 10 years they were away because of biased laws. But once the child was at school, former Jewish teachers and not close friends of their Jewish parents told them whatever the could about their parents. Even the former Nazi who hated their parents told them horrible things. But this former best friend practically family was just too depressed to make their best friends child feel any better or know anything close about their dead parents.

If that had been the case I highly doubt the Holocaust victim would have been like "sorry my best friends orphan child I am just too sensitive and depressed to support you or tell you anything about your parents woe is me. Feel bad for me please?"

Hell no. I've personally sucked it up and supported my friend who was murdered in front of me's wife who found out her husband was killed the day of the first year wedding anniversary while out at a midnight movie the night before with his co workers for his birthday. My sister has been through hell with her best friend a fellow junior at Columbine High murdefed and her body was left to be dragged around in the mud on national TV, to talk about who she was and stories of her life.

This is because if he survived and her friend didn't and the least she could do is keep her memory alive, and be strong for her mother because if the roles were reversed and my sister was shot outside the cafeteria instead of her best friend, Rachel would have been strong for our mom and told me her baby sister stories about all the good times in her life. Because that's what you do for the family of those who you call best friends who are left behind after their deaths. Because that's what you do for close friends who lost their lives and their family remaining behind.

The fact Harry was an orphan, abused and with not q single family member or friend left to care for him after he went through hell makes this a million times more so.

If Remus was that much of a whinger he didn't deserve friendsike Lily and James. Because if the roles had been reversed they would have done everythimg for Remus's orpgamed and abandoned child. Telling the kid a few stories when he finally had regular contact as his teacher after ignoring him for 13 years is the VERY LEAST they would have done.

I just can't fathom why anyone would defend Remus on this. It's pathetic. If he cares so much about his hurt feelings and not about the life of an innocent orphan of his supposed best friends, he doesn't deserve friends like James and Lily.

******** And I have a nice waffle recipe, which is about as relevant to the discussion as your anecdotes about the death of some random classmate of yours and your ex-coworker. The death of someone you vaguely know is different from the betrayal and murder of all your closest friends. The Holocaust survivor I mentioned seems like the closest parallel, but you're ignoring that.

We know that James and Sirius were best friends in life. Therefore, there are probably very few amusing anecdotes about James that don't involve Sirius. What was Lupin supposed to do, tell fun stories about the murder victim and his betrayer?

********* My sister survived the Columbine shooting lost her best friend and was good friends with many of those killed or injured.

I lost a number of friends qt the Aurora theater shooting in 2012 and had many coworkers who were badly maimed and injured. A large group of kost of my coworkers was there for a friends birthday, he was one of those killed.

Both me and my sister, and many other survivors of Columbine and Aurora love telling stories about our friends. It keeps them alive. We dont focus on why or how they were killed, they were so much more than that. Some of those kied and hurt had surviving family members and especially im the case of children we bucked up and didBehar was best for them, even if ir was difficult.

People react in different ways but with the number of those dead, the First war seems like it was mostly guerilla groups who were fighting who were killed. It wasn't the full scale systemic slaughter of millions "legally". May that have continued if Voldermort was stopped for over a decade by Harry and Lily? Perhaps. But it hadn't gotten that far.

It sucks to be aroujd mass violence and witness the deaths of your closest friends and community, family in some cases. But that doesn't mean you ignore one of your best friend's surviving children for 12 years. Even if there was hypothetically laws prohibiting Lupin's contact with Harry by his third year that excuse is gone. Hagrid, McGonagall, Flitwick all told Harry stories about his parents. He Snape talked about James more than Lupin did (not in a positive way of course but at least he brought it up)

That's cowardly. I judge Lupim for that and when he ran from Tonks. As someone who has survived mass violence and lost close friends with family who have been through the same or even worse, I don't give Lupin an excuse. I don't rhino the Holocaust victim.is a good analogy for Lupin either, the second war was closer to than than the first and both ended before the full extent of what the Holocaust destroyed could occur for the equivalent in Magical Britain.

Getting back to fiction, there's a difference between being best friends with people who were murdered, and being best friends with people who were murdered, AND the person responsible for their deaths. That's extra-awkward.

Yeah, the Holocaust survivor comparison isn't perfect of course, but she was the only person I've met who lost everyone close to her to violence.

*********** Mahalo, I really appreciate it.. It's been hard,, some ofy earliest memories were April 20 1999, I was in third grade ♡

But back to the topic, I would never call that woman cowardly or anything the least bit negative for her choice there.

The difference is its not that Lupin doesn't want to talk about Lily and Jamea to a group of strangers. That's his call if that was the case.vHe was refusing to talk to his best friends child, who was oprhaned with no family or friends of his parents around at all.

My sister took being an alcoholic from right after the shooting until after college, moving out if state, sobering up when she met her husband and having her first child a little giro, before she opened up about the shooting and her best friend, whose parents didn't know her well and have spent the past 20 years turning her into this ideal Christian martyr. Still my sister only spoke to me at first it brought us closer together because I knew Rachel well too, she wss Ine of my baby sitters and did fun things with me when my teen sister and her other friends thought they were too cool to play with little kids. I got involved in some online forums and shared things my sister had told me with her permission and after being hesitant at first she has since really taken a liking to sharing these amazing stories of how wonderful her friend was, stories that defy the traditional narrative and show she was even better than the Saint her deadbeat dad turned her Into. Its become how she honors Rach.

With my friends, some left behind chuldren and or spouses. That's the difference with Lupin. No matter how hard it was, we put on a strong face for their loved ones and did whatever we could to help them.

At least our friends who were killed loved ones had surviving family and friends. Harry had none of that. At that point as the only free survivor it becomes his duty to help this child. He put his pain above helping his best friends child, who was subject to a worse life because of it. Like I said I can buy Dumblrdore and the Ministry not letting Lupin near him before. But once he was at Hogwarts he had no excuse whatsoever to leave Harry in the dark, especially knowing what awful things Snape was telling him about James.

With my close friend who was killed in the theater shooting it's been hard, but I've always done everything I can to stay strong and help her mother out even when it hurts. A child, orphaned, manipulated, friendsless... Lupin should have done whatever he could to make sure Harry was okay. Yes it would hurt like hell but a friend would never leave their murdered friend's only orphaned child to suffer. Excuses me damned, try another way. At the very least, once he was at Hogwarts he should have spoken to Harry. There is no excuse for that in my mind.

The Holocaust survivor is completely unrelated. There's a big difference between government sanctioned ethnic cleansing and a series of skirmishes and terrorist actions that lasted for 11 years! There were what, 20 or 30 people in the Order? About 7 or 8 survived so you're looking at one or two deaths a year on average. There's no way that compares to the Holocaust.

And on top of that, do you think Holocaust survivors never told their descendants happy stories about their ancestors? I can't imagine that to be the case.

I also honestly would expect your holocaust survivor to be able to talk about those people without crying after a decade. Not about the circumstances of their deaths or the related ordeals.

Or perhaps more obviously, your pity for him ends at the moment his "self-loathing" harms others.

Does he fear fathering an infected child? Vasectomies are no rocket science, and neither is adoption. I mean, unless you want to argue that Tonks trapped him with a child via sabotaged birth control, he should have been aware of the consequences of putting his dick into a woman of the child-bearing age.

He had no relationship with Harry, both because Harry was a baby and because Harry's family was in hiding when James/Lily died. He wasn't godfather-guardian the way Sirius was, so he had no rights (legal or honorary) to Harry. Harry went to live with people who didn‘t want him to know about magic or to interact with wizards. This leaves Lupin with three options.

1. Obey the wishes of the child's family and stay away.
2. Ask the child's family “can I be involved with this kid who doesn't know me even though I'm the kind of person you hate” and be told no. (We don't actually know for a fact that he didn't do this, or that Dumbledore or the Ministry wouldn't have come down on him for trying.)
3. Sneak around to develop a secret relationship with a child who doesn't know him. Because “don't tell your family or teachers that a shabby, sickly grown man has taken an interest in you” sets a great precedent.

I have relationships with my friends' very young children because my friends facilitate those relationships. If my friends died and the kids were adopted out as toddlers, I would not consider myself to have standing to insert myself into their lives over the objections of the people who feed, clothe, and shelter them.

************* In OotP, Remus is the one who chooses all the books for Harry that Sirius gets him. He's there with him at Grimmauld Place. He helps pick him up from The Dursley's twice.

I think the main issue here is not that his character is bad for not having an emotional connection with a fourteen year old boy, but that JK had decided Sirius would be his connection to his parents (ultimately making his death even sadder) and she left Remus in the background to not lessen that emotional impact.

************** this. GoF was pretty much Sirius's book. Then in OOTP Sirius is there, but Harry doesn't have many interactions with him and actually comes across as the mature one a couple of times. But Harrydoes write him asking for advice. Then the next book is for Dumbledore. PoA was for Remus, but it doesn't seem like Rowling had any intentions to simultaneously have two adults in Harry's life. She actually could have kept Remus's presense in GoF through letters maybe, but then all those people who talk about how sorry they are Sirius is dead wouldn't have felt he was such a great loss. After all, she makes him the only adult who looks after Harry in that book. So sharing the spotlight isn't her favourite thing.

*** I explain this in one of my stories that heavily features Remus. I had him explain that he was fearful that if he tried to visit Harry before Hogwarts, somehow his aunt and uncle would prevent him from being allowed to attend because of the stigma against werewolves and their hatred of magic.

Since Lily spend at least some time with the marauders, it's likely that she mentioned being frustrated with her sister's attitude towards magic. In my story, Remus says that he would never have forgiven himself if James's son never knew what it was like to fly on a broomstick because Remus couldn't be patient.

He explains that it took him more time to contact Harry after he turned 11 because he had pushed thinking about Harry back so that it didn't make him sad and so he didn't realize Harry's age until he was 12, almost 13. And that he went to find Albus Dumbledore to request that he help Remus visit Harry---and that was how he ended up with the DADA job.

** I am not a Remus basher, but I can see why he gets bashed.

Canon Remus is a /weak/ person. Possibly the weakest person in the entire series.

I'm not talking about him not visiting Harry as a child. Dumbledore hid Harry from everybody for those ten years. Even once Harry started going to Hogwarts, I can see him not getting in touch, since he was essentially a stranger.

In Harry's third year, when he's a teacher, he has the opportunity to get to know him and vice-versa, and /doesn't take it/. He doesn't tell Harry he was a friend of his father (at the patronus lesson, he only says he "knew" James). Thus he doesn't have to tell Harry any stories about his parents... he's protecting /himself/ at the cost of a child's grief. He doesn't try to get to know Harry outside the classroom, which can be done even within the student/teacher dynamic. (Harry has to /beg/ for the patronus lessons.)

But the real nail in the coffin is that he believes Sirius is guilty of betraying the Potters, but he still /doesn't reveal his Padfoot form/ --- even after Sirius gets into the castle and right into the Gryffindor dorms. Nor does he reveal that Sirius is aware of the secret tunnel to and from the Shrieking Shack, and the trick of using it. Whether it's to hide the knowledge of rule-breaking that went on back when he himself was in school, or if his loyalty to Sirius is greater than his protection of /the entire student body/, it's unforgiveable that he kept that secret.

And once his secret is out and he leaves (running away, /assuming/ that there will be outcry but it hasn't happened yet and he's too weak to face it), he makes no effort to keep in touch, even now that he's no longer a stranger. This tells me that he essentially has no interest in Harry as a person. Not necessarily a bashable offense, but also no reason to like him. Sirius is on the run from the law, and he still manages to stay in touch with Harry (at the risk of his /life/), but Lupin can't be bothered.

In Snape's memories, we later learn that Remus was a prefect, and yet did absolutely nothing to stop their bullying of Snape, even when it was happening right in front of him. So we learn that he was /always/ a weak person, who wouldn't stand up to his friends.

Then, of course, he runs away from the responsibilities of a wife a child.

** I like Remus, and him not visiting Harry pre-Hogwarts is not weird to me. Petunia likely made it clear that she wanted no contact with the magical world, and Remus would respect those wishes if only to make sure his presence did not cause any problems in Harry's home life. It's not like he knew how Dursleys treated him, after all.

But here is the thing. I don't think the Marauders were simply good friends, that feels like an understatement. Sirius and Remus made it clear that they believed death to be preferable to betraying each other. And then there is the whole animagus thing, which was insanely risky, but they did it just so Remus could feel better. We know that James has no siblings, and Remus either doesn't or they died, same with Peter. Sirius had one, but they were estranged. I think their relationship was more like brothers than just good mates from school, and I doubt anyone would disagree with my assumption.

Which is why it's so fucking shitty of Remus to not mention anything to Harry, and pretend like James was just someone he occasionaly chatted in the Common Room, throughout the entire year when he was teaching at Hogwarts. It took an unintended confrontation with the man who betrayed Harry's parents to their deaths, and the one who everyone thought did it, for him to admit it for fuck's sake. That's just an asshole move.

I know he has self-worth issues and all, sure, but he is also an adult. While his personal problems make his actions understandable, they don't mean he shouldn't be held accountable.

** I'll be honest. I quite dislike Lupin. In addition trying to abandon Tonks and his unborn child, I dislike his actions in POA. Specifically, he didn't tell anyone about Sirius's animagus form because doing so would have meant admitting he betrayed Dumbledore's trust by gallivanting around the grounds in his school days. Since no one knew of Sirius's animagus form, it would have been pretty easy for him to kill Harry.

There's also the more minor issue of him being prefect and doing nothing about the Maruders. Whether Snape gave as good as he got or not, as a prefect Lupin should have stepped in.

He was certainly a great teacher to Harry, but he never seemed like much more than that to me. Sirius while on the run sent Harry more letters than Lupin ever did.

I find him a bit of a weak willed person, unwilling to face conflict with his friends or people he respects. He certainly has a reasonably tragic backstory to allow for major character flaws, and I'm sure some writers choose to explore the complexities of his character. I just find him too boring to read something too focused on him.

*** I tend to agree with you. I dislike his character, but feel bashing is a bit overboard for his actions.

I can understand why Remus wouldn't have contact with Harry as an infant living with magic-hating muggles. But when he finally has a chance to connect with Harry in PoA, he hides the close friendship he had with James for a good chunk of the school year. Again - a bit understandable considering the odd teacher/student dynamic he needed to navigate as well. But it also shows his reluctance to have any sort of contact with Harry.

What bothered me about his character in PoA, and serves as the center of my dislike for him, was how he doesn't tell anyone about Sirius' animagus ability, then hypocritically chastises Harry for wandering the grounds/going to Hogsmeade and putting his life at risk - that comment he made about his parents sacrifice was just pure emotional manipulation. He has no right to say such things when he hid his relationship with James and kept important information about an escaped (alleged) mass murderer from the authorities.

He constantly punished himself for being a danger around students because of his condition, then neglects to take the potion that actually keeps him from being a danger.

What I've never been able to forgive is how he basically disappeared after finally getting a connection with Harry. It makes it seem like his disappearance from Harry's early life wasn't just circumstantial, but intentional to some degree. For whatever reason, he obviously didn't want to connect with Harry and be part of his life, despite the massive good he could have done for the orphaned infant of his best friend.

He isn't around at all during the entire tournament fiasco in GoF and we only see him again at the beginning of OotP.

I don't think he deserves to be bashed, no matter how much I dislike his character and his choices. What bothers me is the illusion that he's someone close to Harry and has emotional ties to him when they barely have any contact at all. It's kind of hard to have a relationship with someone if you're not in their life at all, barely write, and don't support them when shit like the tournament happen.

When Remus asked Harry to be godfather, I felt it came totally out of the blue - it seemed like a way for Rowling to force a connection that wasn't there. I was surprised when Harry actually agreed, since it didn't make sense to have been asked for such a huge thing in the first place from someone who's basically just an acquaintance.

So bashing makes sense, even if it's not deserved - Rowling forced a nonexistent relationship and did nothing to build it up. It leaves Remus' character to be overly criticized because of it.

TLDR - Remus isn't the most likable character and obviously made it clear he wasn't all that interested in having a relationship with Harry. But bashing Remus for that is unreasonable. It's also unreasonable to see a relationship between the two that was never there in the first place.

This turns them into a very 1-d character which can be useful to the plot, but isn't great for much else. No character really deserves bashing, but I wanted to point out the canon character traits that could be turned into bashing. He's also a minor enough character (particularly in the early books) that it's easy enough to change his motivations and good points.

Your comments about Remus and Harry's relationship being forced are very insightful. It's funny because so often I read fics where Remus is super involved in Harry's life and they feel just as odd to me as when Remus is randomly bashed.

** It is mostly because of his low self-esteem which makes him act rather cowardly, such as never contacting Harry or running from his unborn child, a behavior that makes readers unconsciously think of Pettigrew.

Also, in fanfiction, he is often portrayed as too passive and willing to allow others (Dumbledore) to dictate his actions or self-image, or he is too strict in his moral compass, believing that any sort of Dark Arts or illegal activity is wrong and something that he is willing to abandon a friend over (usually Harry).

The portrayal as willing to let others dictate his actions and self-image has some backing, as he was all too willing to believe that Sirius sold out the Potters, as well as never contacting Harry. He also never seemed to go against Dumbledore for Harry's sake, specifically Harry's isolation during the summer before Harry's fifth year where Harry had witnessed a student's death, was tortured and fought against the serial killer that murdered his parents and tried to kill him multiple times, or even the fact that Remus went back to support Nymphadora only after Harry was openly against Remus's abandonment of her.

The one thing I never understood about his portrayal was his overly strict moral code. If I'm not mistaken, Remus was perfectly willing to help murder Pettigrew at the end of Harry's third year, as well as never revealing to anyone that he saw Pettigrew's name on the Marauder's Map, which would have made Pettigrew's murder premeditated if Harry had actually allowed it. The man was clearly willing to break the law or his own moral code if he felt it was necessary in any way.

** I am very much in the pro-Lupin camp.

He was a fantastic teacher who always went out of his way to ensure all of his pupils made progress/enjoyed his subject. He never let anyone sit back, but found ways for them to take part - I don't think Neville's experience with the Boggart would have been quite as successful with just any teacher. He worked hard to provide them with real hands on learning ( we only saw what they got up to in third year classes - imagine the opportunities the older pupils got!). Not only that but he made time for pupils outside of lesson time. His tutoring of Harry would have been in his own time. You may say he had ulterior motives there (i.e. getting to know Harry better) but I think it is safe to say he would have given that time for any of his pupils if they needed/asked for it. He was so passionate about his job, and I think also so thankful to have it, that he bent over backwards for everyone in that school.

With regard to his lack of communication with Harry pre-Hogwarts, I always found that heartbreaking but understandable. He was a secret werewolf, living on the cusp of magical society. His friends, the only ones who truly knew him were all either dead or imprisoned. He was alone with no/little income - how was he supposed to care for an infant? Add to that the fact his emotional state would have been a mess! He'd have been grieving for all of the Maurauders and Lily and the future they had planned and fought for together. Then add all that to his deep rooted self loathing and you have a perfect storm of 'I'm not good enough/he'd be better off without me'. Even Dumbledore, the smartest man in the wizarding world thought it was a good plan leaving Harry with the Dursleys. I don't think anyone foresaw how terribly they'd treat Harry. Blaming Remus for not being involved then feels awfully callous and unempathetic to me.

Fast forward to POA and the question, why didn't he tell Harry who he was? I can only guess that being back at Hogwarts, seeing this kid who is the spitting image of your best friend, might have been difficult. Maybe he was scared to tell Harry for fear of having to explain why he had been absent from his life. He was still a closeted werewolf at the time after all. Maybe he was terrified of Harry being scared of him and feared the rejection. Maybe he didn't feel worthy of having a personal relationship with Harry. Yes, he should have told Dumbledore about Sirius but it always felt to me that Lupin's morals often clashed with his loyalty to his mates. He felt indebted to them for not rejecting him which possibly led to him letting a lot of things slide as prefect too. Also, he was a teenager. Peer pressure is a strong force that often makes people do things they usually wouldn't.

His 'too old, too poor, too dangerous' mantra is something he has repeated to himself his entire life to dissuade himself from anything/anyone who could bring him happiness. But then Tonks crashed (possibly literally!) into his life and this vibrant woman has seen something in him. She sees beyond his shabbily patched clothes and his lycanthropy cto who he truly is - a brave, kind, witty, intelligent, dignified gentleman who also knows what it means to be 'other' in the magical community. When he leaves her to help Harry, he genuinely believes he is doing the right thing. It was cowardly and a total douche move but it was a blip. He went back to Tonks after his 'conversation' with Harry and then was ecstatic when announcing Teddy's birth at Shell Cottage. One bad decision/reaction doesn't make you a terrible person. I think he is a very human character - flawed, granted but at his heart he is good.

In comparison, I don't understand why Snape, who's behaviour as a teacher was utterly abhorrent, who nastily bullied so many of his pupils and was literally a deatheater, gets such a positive spin in the fandom when, arguibly, Lupin was a kinder, braver man.

​

#+begin_quote
  My problem with Remus is that there is "Canon" Remus- who is honestly just not that great a character at all and then "Fanon" Remus- who is wonderful in every way, which I honestly just find annoying at this point.

  I find Remus to be the most wildly re-imagined fanon character because in all honesty he's kind of the worst in canon. He never writes to Harry, never goes out of his way to do anything for anyone, he literally allowed a would-be serial murderer into Hogwarts because he refused to say where all the secret passages he knew were or that Sirius was an animagus because he /didn't want the Headmaster disapppointed him/.

  I don't think Remus is evil or a DE or even an absolutely horrible person. I think he's a coward. He's a guy who has defined his entire existence by being a werewolf and then is confused when others do it as well.

  The fact that fanon invented the idea that werewolves can't take custody of children just to give Remus an excuse for ignoring Harry for 12 years is another annoying trait. Remus ran away from his pregnant wife /during a war in which he had just made her a public target/ because he didn't want kids, the fact that he would have fought for custody of Harry is laughable.

So yeah, these are her views. And while some of them, like the not writing to Harry ever is I think a case of author simply forgetting about him, I agree with most of it. I love Remus, but the simple fact is that he isn't a great guy. He is flawed and that's what makes him a great character.

Of course, the fandom doesn't give a shit about that. People are bashed for having negative personality traits (coughronbashingcoughsnapebashingcough).

That's a satisfactory answer to your question I hope.

Bashing can be done well, but it is a very fine line and it has to be handled very delicately. Unfortunately. most times it's just angry people writing angry stuff and getting angrier and making everyone else wanna die.

** I've never liked the fact that he failed to help Harry, the child of his best friend. Even when he taught at Hogwarts, he chose not to make much of a personal connection at all. I would say that he let Harry down by not being there for him.

Also on the subject of Sirius Black in PoA, I've always thought that if the Ministry found out he was concealing vital information about Black then he could have been sent to Azkaban himself for aiding and abetting a criminal. At the very least, he betrayed Dumbledore's trust in him and deserved to lose his job for indirectly putting the students in jeopardy.

And also, there's the fact that when at school himself, he failed to use his authority as a prefect to prevent James and Sirius from attacking Snape.

Though he may have been a good DADA teacher, as a person I thought him weak, lacking in any Gryffindor courage and failing to do what was right on various occasions.

** I don't care that he didn't contact Harry, whatever. Dumbledore probably didn't allow it, for all we know Lupin tried.

What always gets me is that he abandoned his pregnant wife. That's unforgivable, even if he did go back to her. It took Harry calling him out as the coward he was to get him to go back.

In fanfiction, we talk about redemption a lot. A character has to deserve redemption, IMHO. Remus Lupin was a coward. Oh, he fought and died in the war, but when it came to his own family, he wanted to run simply because he was a werewolf. The man could never get over the fact that he was a werewolf, and he let it affect everything in his life.

The best Remus Lupin fics out there are ones where Remus is actually the smart man he was supposed to be and lives his life in spite of his disability. He goes into the Muggle world and starts his own business, he doesn't abandon Harry after third year like he does in canon, and he doesn't turn away from responsibility like he does in canon.

People make mistakes. He made a mistake leaving Tonks but he returned, apologised and began to make amends.

**** Maybe as someone who was abandoned by a biological father, I take it differently. IDK. If Remus had lived, would he have done it again? Because he might have. Who knows how his self-esteem issues which plagued him his entire life would continue to manifest post war, especially if say, Tonks died and he lived. Lupin didn't show the best mental stability or emotional maturity during canon. Being a widower might have driven him to run completely.

My point is that I just don't think he can be trusted due to having done it once. Is it bravery to go back when you've made a mistake? Sure, I guess, but even cowards show bravery once in a while. It doesn't erase the fact that he was capable of leaving his child and wife behind, and that he was prone to do so whenever for whatever made up reasons he could come up with.

** I'm in the anti-Lupin camp. When he was introduced in PoA I loved him - the quintessential "cool teacher", a man of action and wisdom - but I think later books made him much more of a whiner and general moper around. Far too self-pitying, which is never an appealing trait in a person.

However, one area where I depart from the fandom consensus on Lupin is his decision to "abandon" Tonks in DH. This was actually one of the few moments where I recovered some modicum of interest in the character. It's a peculiarly "comfortable 21st century Western liberal" mindset that going to war to fight for your country and to defeat an evil tyranny is tantamount to abandoning your family. I dare say Brits would all be speaking German today if we'd had that view in the 1940s.

If you go to fight because it is the right thing to do, well that is the right thing to do. If you want to fight because it takes you from home, that is very much a case of doing the right thing for the wrong reasons. And it that scene, Lupin comes across as desperately trying to avoid his wife.

There was no way the Germans could have overcome the Royal Navy, even if Dunkirk had failed and the British had lost the Battle for Britain. The plan for Sea Lion involved unpowered barges (doomed to fail anyway), which HMS Revenge blasted to pieces on October 13th. And even if an invasion was successful, there was no way the Germans could have sustained a supply route across the channel against the RAF and RN for more than a day, nevermind that the Third Reich did not have the necessary naval capacity to either close the channel permanently or supply an invasion force on the British shore.

And that's not to mention that again, the German cupboard was pretty bare. You could put enough ships at sea manned by "single sailors only" to stop the Kriegsmarine twice over.

Not once checking if Harry was okay even if he didn't want to adopt him. If Sirius hasn't been arrested and agreed that Harry could go to the Dursley's (ha!) a lot of people would bet he'd still break (Dumbledore's) rule and see Harry and probably realize he was abused. Also they like to spin werewolf trope on its head and have werewolves be not sickly/a curse basically if one /accepts/ their wolf meaning that Remus who doesn't accept his wolf practically drives his wolf crazy and that's why it's deformed and kills humans.

1. Part of the mauraders. He sometimes participated in ganging up on Snape and certainly never interfered or stopped the bullying. Nobody supports bullies but bullies themselves.

I don't blame him, because he was just a kid and it would have been so hard to stop James and Sirius from being bullies.

1. He was super old and yet eventually gave in to Tonks. Depriving her of a full life. This one he could have prevented. If he truly loved her, he would have stayed a mentor and not crossed the line.

2. His personality itself was so gloomy and whiny, it probably rubbed some people the wrong way.

The same goes for Remus, who has a lot of issues. Those who don't bash him are the ones who have had similar experiences, such as depression or chronic illness. I think it's a bigger reflection on how people expect others to cope with their problems. You're just supposed to be fine and be practically unaffected. Then everyone will patronisingly praise you for how great you are.People really can't cope with depressing stuff. That is why, for instance, Remus's condition is often turned into something beneficial as well.
