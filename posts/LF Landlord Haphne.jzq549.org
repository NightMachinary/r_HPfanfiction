:END:
Harry and Daphne enter an arranged marriage, I don't recall why. They live in Grimmauld Place, and spend considerable effort to clean it up, including battling a sludge-monster from the stairs to the backyard.

Harry and Daphne manage several rental buildings, and Harry fancies himself a handyman with Daphne managing the books, and even opening up a bookkeeping business in Diagon Alley.

If anyone knows the name of this one I'll be super-thankful!
