  Some may consider him useless, but Ludo Bagman has been absolutely inspired by muggle sports channels. As a result, a camera charm has been created. It is ready to catch all the action of the Triwizard Tournament and broadcast it into every home over Wizarding Europe. Now Harriet is on the big screen, and the crowd is going to see a lot more than they bargained for. FEM/Harry.

** One of my dreams in the fanfiction world (and surprisingly fanfiction on FBaWtFT, which I usually don't read) is somebody takes linkffn(12278819) and runs with it ... cross-over between FBaWtFT and Oliver Twist with Modesty Barebone growing up on streets as a forgotten witch. Just a pure gold.

** Sounds good! I always thought it'd be cool if you were a wizard to wow muggles with really basic magic! It'd be so much fun watching them trying to work out how you did it! ðŸ˜‚
