Most Petunia centered fics I find have her be good to Harry(and apparently Vernon is the one who started the abuse?) , but I want to see interactions between her and Snape where they are exactly as bitter as Canon. Petunia still is hates/starts out hating the wizarding world after finding out she is a muggle and she continues being jealous of Lily. Snape also has the same drives as in canon, bitter, child-bully-er, etc.


** linkffn(My Nephew Harry) reverses it and puts most of the blame on Petunia - although the primary point of view is a mostly-redeemed Marge, who may very well be biased.

Basically, there's a car accident and Marge has to look after Dudley and Harry for a few weeks, leading her to realise what they're actually like.

  During the two months she had watched her eight year-old nephews, Marge Dursley discovered that Petunia was a pathological liar, Vernon had somehow been brainwashed by that no good b***h, Dudley was the spawn of Satan, and Harry was actually a good kid.
