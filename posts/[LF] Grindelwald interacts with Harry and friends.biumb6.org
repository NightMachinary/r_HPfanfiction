I've already read a few like the Parselmouth of Gryffindor or Defence Professor Wohl, but frankly those are too Hermione centric for my tastes. I have also read Hail Odysseus, but that is a bit heavy-handed in the bashing. Are there any other fics where he teaches at Hogwarts or tutors Harry? Frankly, a wizard of Dumbledore's and Voldemort's caliber being locked away, who apparently is remorseful, just seems like a waste of a character. I've also read the Mind Arts.


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying]]) is not him teaching, but I guess he's a mentor of sorts. rereading your request, I realize it's not a good match since he is not at Hogwarts, but maybe you would still enjoy it

*** I've read it before, and it is still hilarious. Although, I think that Harry is probably the best Harry from Starfox5's fics. But I was looking for a bit more serious of a fic.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
