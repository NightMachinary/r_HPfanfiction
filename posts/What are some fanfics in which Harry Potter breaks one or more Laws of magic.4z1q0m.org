** Do you mean fundamental laws of how magic works, like Gamp's law, or are you referring to the laws created by the Ministry or the ICW, like the Statute of Secrecy?

*** Considering the wording “laws of magic”, I presume it is the former.

** Gamp's laws. Like in HPMOR with partial transfiguration.

** linkffn(12026631) 's premise is basically that Harry decides 'laws' of magic sounds really very silly, and arbitrary and declares them nonsense. In particular so he can live his dream of being a pokemon trainer.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.
