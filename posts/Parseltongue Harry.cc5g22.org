I'm looking for fics that have Harry using parseltongue heavily, can have romance (no slash or genderbending please) and be any type of Harry (Dark, Evil, Good). It would be even better if he was extremely talented at magic.

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

** I don't remember where but a story I think is called pendant of Slytherin has this. When I read it there was no slash but Harry and Draco were really close sorta friends so idk if the end had it or not.
