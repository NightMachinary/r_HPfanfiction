  Being the son of Harry Potter is exhausting, aggravating, and pressuring, so naturally it would be difficult to do a simple thing like smiling, but once your best friend is Scorpius Malfoy, such a thing as smiling goes from being difficult to easy very quick. (Each chapter consists of plenty of small events from each of their years in Hogwarts.)

** You might enjoy [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613][Ignite]]. There is no time travel and the characters are in the same houses. Their personalities are different, Rose is along the same lines as Rose in the play, Albus is a lot more like Scorpius from the play, whilst Scorpius is fun but I wouldn't say he's at all like Scorpius from the play.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy

The struggles of living up to their parents is a part of it, as is being in Slytherin but a Potter. There's a plot-no time travel and more in lines with the original series.
