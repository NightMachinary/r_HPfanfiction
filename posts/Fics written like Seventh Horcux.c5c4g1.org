I really enjoyed the style of writing and humour in Seventh Horcux. Are there any other fics written like that? Thanks!


** Grindelwald feels very much like Harrymort in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929). He is insane, has bad memory, and is overall an unreliable narrator.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

** Linkffn(An Old And New World) is probably the fic it most reminded me of. That version is a cleaned up reupload from when it was first completed yonks ago, but you can find the original online.

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane. Still, it's the only game in town...

  In order to increase 'the power the Dark Lord knows not,' Dumbledore gives baby Harry a powerful love potion. This bold move results in...unusual consequences. Witness Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, Boy-Who-Caught-the-Snitch-Two-Times, and Boy-Who-Conquered-Voldemort-But-Did-Not-Kill-Him at his very best...which is considerably less impressive than everyone expects. AU.

** If you're a Naruto fan, Emerald Ashes wrote another great fic [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sasuke-uchiha-and-the-power-of-lies-naruto-comedy-au.472801/][Sasuke Uchiha and the Power of Lies]] on Space Battles. It has the same tone and a completely off the walls plot. One of my favorite Naruto fics.

​

There's also Itachi, is that a baby? linkffn(11634921) which is a HP/Naruto crossover with a similar absurdist tone and one of the best, if not the absolute best, Dumbledores in fanfiction.

​

Another Naruto/HP crossover with a similar tone would be A Sage Among Wizards, linkffn(7648998), which is Godlike Naruto reincarnating as Harry and using his powers to do petty things like tie Snape's shoes together when they didn't have shoelaces in the first place. It's the farthest in tone from Seventh Horcrux of the three, but still real funny.

​

For pure HP, the Harry the Hufflepuff series (book 1 linkffn(6466185)) has a Harry that makes it his goal to be as lazy as possible, and works insanely hard to do so.

​

That's all I got on my favorites list with a similar style.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
