** I was going to suggest that you read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality), which is not at all what you describe, but has a protagonist who would understand your point of view.

However, I actually think that you should read [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HawFh7RvDM4RyoJ2d/three-worlds-collide-0-8][Three Worlds Collide]].

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

**** It explores a first contact between humanity (in the distant future) and two other races.

The first race is less technologically advanced than humans (but still spacefaring), and has a culture centered around adults hunting and eating their own terrified children. They're not sadistic, though; their distant ancestors produced lots of babies with the expectation that only a few would survive, like fish, and when they first developed agriculture, with about the intelligence of apes, they found that by only allowing a few to survive, those few could be better cared for, producing overall better outcomes. That winnowing, For the Greater Good, gradually came to define their society, their language, their entire view of the universe.

Of course, the humans are horrified by this, especially when they learn that the children's brains survive for weeks, in sensory deprivation and great pain, after being swallowed. Some of them want to gather military forces and go to war against the baby eaters, but although they can all see problems with that, no one can see an actually good and acceptable solution.

Then the second race appears. They're much more advanced than humans. Their brain chemistry is quite different, allowing them to think at much higher speeds. They have eliminated pain and suffering and engineered their bodies to continually feel pleasure, and they are horrified by humanity's failure to protect its own children from pain, injury, and death. /To them, we are the baby eaters/, and they want to intervene.

I recommend reading it as a test of how open minded you really are, whether you really take people as you find them or whether, when all is said and done, you think everyone else should share your values.

***** It was too hard to even read the first few paragraphs. I cannot read this story. But from your description it sounds like it has interesting alien worldbuilding. And I do love worldbuilding!

  Centaurs and mermaids getting accommodations to attend Hogwarts
#+end_quote

I see this idea a lot from authors who espouse equality and I don't get it at all. Would centaurs or mermaids /want/ to go to Hogwarts and learn from people whose magical tradition is so different from theirs?

Even funnier is giving them representation in Wizengamot (a wizarding group for governing wizards) like some fics do, and pretending they're all one big happy community. Being a part of the government would mean they have to obey its laws, and I don't see centaur tribes ever paying any heed to wizarding law as they gallop around their forests. Same with goblins, whose culture is in some ways diametrically opposed to wizards'.

Even if you come up with a set of laws that would be somehow accepted and adhered by every species, and merge everyone into a single community with a single schooling system and government, that seems to go counter the lofty idea of diversity you were going for in the first place.

*** I was not proposing a total merging into a single community, just allowing them the opportunity if they wish to. Just like we allow gay people, black people, or disabled children to go to a school with all the majority white kids if they want to. Just like we have china and japan and canada, but people are still free to come and go and live in all these places if they wish to. We have american asians, we have japanese canadians, british africans. I do not mean throw everyone into a huge merging, I mean let them stay separate but give them the opportunity and the freedom to come together and cross if they want to. They would be a minority student population of Hogwarts, but you would still see them.

** To quote the fanfiction I am beta-reading for a friend:

#+begin_quote
  The idea of utopia certainly breeds a particular type of tyranny, for it is the rule of the idea that must be enforced.

*** But I did say it would NOT be "enforced" in my fanfic. :) The WORLD is free and accessible to all, but everyone still has the CHOICE to accept it or not. So no it is not tyranny, it's just offering them the choice of good living standards in the society. Yes it is not different anyway from living in America having good schools and also vaccinations even though those are mandated because it would cause harm if they were not. Yes my utopia magic world would not enforce anything more than normal societies do! :) Unless it was to explicitly not allow harm of others like vaccination refusing.

**** Cheers. Idealistic but surreal. Utopia is a concept of Greater Good. Not everyone will share the idealistic ideas, not everyone will want to adhere to the laws and ideas that govern your Utopia. They could easily throw the world into chaos by chosing to change the existing system through 'Propaganda of the deed', the foremost tool for changes in a (to them) tyrannic system. Those believing into the idea of your Utopia would call their acts terrorism. To them it is the fight for freedom.

Utopia is not universal. It cannot exist without the tyranny of enforcing its rules.

Idealism has yet to survive contact with reality.
