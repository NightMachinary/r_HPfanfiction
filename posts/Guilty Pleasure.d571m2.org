*** Sometimes I'll try to write fanfiction and I'll get this oddly strong feeling of shame coming over me, especially if anybody else is in the room.

**** Oh, this happens to me plenty when I am about to do something I consider shameful. I just try to... quietly... do it really fast and then pretend as if I never did it, constantly looking over my shoulder and doing it in steps, utterly paranoid that someone is watching me when I rationally know that nobody is, or would care if they did.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List]]) where an OC 'Jerry' lives in Tom's head, and seems to know the HP universe and the canon plot line from a reader's pov (so basically he knows everything). Half the fic is a thought conversation between the two with the use of bold/italics to differentiate and it's really a self-insert fic. But for some reason, I still liked it

** The very first time I utilized the FFN filtering system, I felt an irrational shame over what I was about to filter on, feeling utterly mortified over the entire situation, as if someone was watching and would mock me for my tastes. This actually delayed my use of the filtering in favour of just piggybacking on [[/u/FanfictionBot][u/FanfictionBot]] recommendations for a week or two -- it felt as if using the search filters would mean acknowledging something shameful.

Over time I just stopped caring about hiding my fanfic preferences -- era, setting, ships, etc. To each their own and all that. Some will consider my tastes absurd and I'll do the same with them. So I don't really have any guilty pleasure anymore.

I still keep silent on the Discord though, mostly because I was mocked by several people there for my tastes the one time I mentioned them. I wasn't offended, but see no point in repeating a pointless talk about it.

** An obvious example would be something like linkffn(Ad Infinitum by Speechwriter). Or any other fic I read with a Tom Riddle ship.

Also, fics with bad spelling or grammar because I honestly care more about characterization, adherence to canon world building, personal enjoyment, and story. I save being hyper critical of prose, including typos for published fiction. Or next gen fics where Albus Potter basically retreads his father's school years as hero who solves yearly mysteries and fights the big bad in the seventh book, sometimes making the same idiotic mistakes Harry did, especially if it's blatantly paralleling Harry's different experiences. Not all those Albus ones are bad as stories, but not likely as the post-epilogue future for the children to pretty much perfectly parallel the previous generation. But I still prefer those to essentially any retelling of Harry's generation in school these days.

Edited to Add: Stuff with tons of cliches, among other problems, if they center on a character I like. Like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7467796/1/Choices][this]].
