I'm almost to the end of [[http://hpalternity.com][Alternity]] (currently in May of the seventh year), and I'm wondering if anyone here has read it before. There is a lot to read, since the project has been going on in real time for the past seven years, and I would almost hesitate to call it 'fanfiction' (but that's just because I usually read them in story form, of course, and it's written in journal entry form), but I absolutely love it. I can't see some of the characters any other way, now.


** This sounds interesting.

** Am I the only one who finds it hilarious that Justin Finch-Fletchley is Jay from The Inbetweeners?

*** I haven't seen The Inbetweeners, but after seeing him as F-F for so long, when I saw a trailer for the second movie and recognized him, it made me want to watch it.

(I do love Saoirse Ronan as the OC Hydra, though)

Oh my god, I just did an image search for 'jay the inbetweeners' and reading the quotes and thinking of F-F, lmao.
