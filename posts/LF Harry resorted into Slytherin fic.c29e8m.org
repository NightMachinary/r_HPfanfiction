I read this give a few years ago but here's what I remember. (TW for abuse mention)

So Dumbldore goes to check on Harry at the Dursley's and sees that he is terribly physically abused (maybe sexually as well ??? I forgot) and then gives him a whole new identity. For some reason. Then he is introduced as a new student and is resorted into Slytherin.

Details get fuzzy here so bare with me.

So he's in Slytherin and he's learning the ins and outs of being a Slytherin. Snape puts him in a dorm with Draco, Blaise, and Theodore because they don't want to become death eaters and Snape separated them from the students who do.

Those are the most coherent details I remember, I also remember the Theodore Nott carved a wooden dragon over the summer and gave it as a present to Snape.

Also in the evenings in the Slytherin common room Snape sits in an armchair and that means students can come to him about personal problems and when he moves to the desk that means they can go to him about school issues/ help. (??????)

The last thing I remember is that Snape gives Harry like a career/future plans check. And he fills out a form and crosses things out and Snape asks him about it.

This is a jumbled mess and I apologize lol. I read this a couple years ago and could never find it again. I found this sub Reddit so I have some hope. Will appreciate all help/suggestions to other fics. Thank you :)


** Ooh I think I might've read this one too! I cant remember the name though, sorry
