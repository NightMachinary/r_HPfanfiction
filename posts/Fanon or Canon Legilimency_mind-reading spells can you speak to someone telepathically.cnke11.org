Just wondering is it possible for someone to hear the voice of someone attacking them with Legilimency in their mind? I vaguely recall voldermort speaking to everyone inside their minds at the battle of Hogwarts... but was that a thing only he could do or is there basis in canon for anyone using Legilimency or any other spell to speak to someone telepathically? Just ran into it a few times in fics and wondered if it was an actual thing or just Fanon.


** As far as I know, a master occlumens is able to show the intruding legilimens whatever they want, so some kind of communication should definitely possible, but I do not think it is as easy as "speaking", more like transmitting a picture or an emotion.

And didnt Voldemort speak and just used an extremely overpowered voice amplification spell?

*** This. Two people skilled in both arts could establish silent communication with each other, sharing mental pictures of what they want without the need to speak. Not telepathy in the sense we usually think of, but fulfills a similar use case. This is also how Snape<->Voldemort communication is usually presented -- with Snape, instead of talking about what he has "discovered", simply opens his mind to the Dark Lord to allow him to see his report directly from his mind.

** One of the points Snape makes about Legilimency is that "Time and space matters." It seems that Legilimency generally necessitates some form of mental contact between individuals for it to actually work.

Its often said that eyes are windows to the soul (soul being a poetic term for mind/personality in modern syntax). Eye contact appears to be necessary outside of extreme cases like Harry-Voldemort, and even then he is arguably the most accomplished/experienced user in the world at the time. So I doubt the Hogwarts battle case fits what you describe - its more likely some sort of broadcasting spell in the vein of 'Sonorus' or something attached to school itself.

As for mind speech, legilimency traces roots to 'read' and 'mind' (i.e. legil and mens from latin) and doesn't itself account for sending information as much as receiving or taking it from the other. If speech is possible, its likely an entirely different branch of magic or spell.

** It's not altogether clear that Voldemort's "speak to everyone" trick was done through speaking in their minds; the voice is described as coming "from the very walls of Hogwarts", so more likely, I think it's an Heir of Slytherin thing.

But I see no reason one couldn't abuse Legilimency to send speech through.
