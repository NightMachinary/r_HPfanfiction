** In a crack scenario, I can see her writing smut fics about it. She begins to obsess over her steamy yaoi lemons between her two favorite guys. Eventually, she starts to push them together in hopes of watching their boy love in action. Then, the she starts directing their movements until they master the art of lovemaking. It's so perfect she absolutely /must/ record it.

She shares it with other hogwarts girls who love to see gayness come to life onscreen and later branches out to muggle friends and relatives. One of them tells her to post the videos on the internet. The internet blows up with their perfect lovemaking techniques and suddenly the trio are the most famous pornstars on the planet. Their best videos are titled "Two wizards work their magic on each others wands" and "I ride my friends broom while he plays with mine."

It all ends with Hermione becoming the CEO of pornhub.

** I think it would surprise her initially, and depending on when they get together it could also cause something of a rift, due to Hermiones own feelings for Ron.

But once she she's past that, I think she would be very supportive of their relationship.

*** It could probably work alongside a Hermione/Viktor or Ginny scenario. But even without a love interest for her, I think she loves them both too much to do anything /but/ support them. I'd just really want her to have a friend to talk to about any conflicting feelings that gives her so she's not just shoving it all down.

**** Yeah, I didn't mean to imply that she wouldn't support them, just that it might be a bit of a shock. Ginny would probably be the most likely person she would talk to about it, considering she is her closest friend outside of Harry and Ron as well as being Ron's sister.

** I think she would be aggressively accepting and supportive of them, eager to defend them from any homophobes. She'd be disappointed if she couldn't find any homophobes to defend them from.

** So I posted a prompt a bit back that this reminds me of. However, it doesn't fit what you are asking. Actually, it is exactly against what you are asking: It was "What if Hermione misunderstood the situation and thought Ron/Harry were a couple when they were not".

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c4zz30/hermione_misunderstanding_harryrons_relationship/]]

Sadly, no-one has written it. I did put a few short ficlet posts on the thread though.

(This would be relevant to this post as "Over the top supportive, even when not needed/welcome)

** Hermione would go for Ginny and we would've still ended up with both Harry and Hermione a part of the Weasley family, just with different partners.

** I think it would break apart the trio. Harry doesn't particularly like Hermione, and Hermione spends most of her private time with Ron, so Ron is really their only link. If Ron ended up with Harry, Hermione would probably be more nasty, Harry would have less reason to talk to Hermione, and Ron would be angry at Hermione. It would turn into a duo, and since Hermione has no other friends besides Neville, Ginny, and Luna (she comforted Hermione in HBP, and Hermione was distressed when she thought she may have died), she would just become apart of that group.
