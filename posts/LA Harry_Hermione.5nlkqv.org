I'm on the hunt for the best of Harmony. I prefer post hogwarts. I enjoyed Vox Coporis and my all time favorite is probably Bearings, even though it was rushed to completion.

I would like to see the best that is out there.


** "Hermione Granger and Marriage Law Revolution", linkffn(10595005): the old establishment was insane enough to push through a tyrannical marriage law after Voldemort's fall. Harry and Hermione basically went over the edge and became radical revolutionaries. They organized a huge mob, overthrew the Ministry, and executed anyone who supported Voldemort and the marriage law. They also broke up with Ron and Ginny as the Weasleys disagreed with their politics. But foreign pureblood regimes were not happy about their revolution, and real war was about to begin. [[/spoiler][Ron and Ginny would later join them again and became great war heroes]]

*** This is a good one. I strongly recommend reading linkffn(Prologue to a Revolution by Starfox5) first. (hey, [[/u/Starfox5]], how about just folding these together into one story?)

**** I thought about it, but decided against it. I like the opening line of the main story very much, and the prologue would mess up the chapter numbers.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.
