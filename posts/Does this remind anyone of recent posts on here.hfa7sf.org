The headline, rather than the article itself.

So, I can't find the emojis on facebook but imagine several teary laughing faces.


** Reminds me of linkao3(Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce) but without the sudden and shocking twist halfway through to be a story about war crimes.

Ah well. Still half of 2020 to go.

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

** I can't remember the title, but there's one post-Hogwarts story that has Harry going to a diner in NYC with a young woman (Gabrielle, maybe?) for breakfast. He orders coffee for both of them, and explains that, since the Boston Tea Party, the Americans have been prevented from acquiring any of the really good tea.
