So I'm mainly looking for either dimensional travel/reincarnation were Harry goes wherever or where the wizarding world has as little to do in the grand scheme of things as possible. Books, manga, movies etc, everything goes as long as it's not slash. I will repeat myself and say please don't suggest any slash, preferably not even on the side characters part and no HP girls if possible. If you believe the fic is really good then at least not Hermione or Ginny anywhere in the fic other than a mention here or there, also no super weird Luna please. I'm fine with harem and even looking for harem fics as long as there's no Hermione/Ginny in it.

Edit: Bashing is fine and OP Harry is wanted. As loath as I am to admit it I like startgatesg1fan's work even if it was a massive wank. I couldn't read it again now but I do read his spider man crossover whenever it gets updated. It's a guilty pleasure but it's a good example at how far my preference goes.

**** Pairing really was a tossup, when I started writing it. But As it progressed, I really just thought that femshep was just so much more dynamic. I figured that the less OCs the better (so no random asari bedmate) and Liara was far too young when Harry arrived in the Mass Effect setting.

I also didn't particularly want to use other existing asari partners. Samara is entirely too moral for all the shenanigans Harry pulls, and Morinth is a skeevy bastard-ette. I'm also not using Benezia, nor Aethyta. That would be a bit... awkward. And Aria is straight out-- She's pretty, and Harry tends to skirt the line when it comes to morality, but I don't think he'd go for a literal pirate queen.

I guess I figured that Harry would mesh the most with another sort of 'chosen-one' archetype. Somebody who /gets/ all the stress of having such an incredible burden on their shoulders.

FemShep simply seemed to be the best option.

***** Oh I understand, I never said it was a bad fic and I can see your point sort of but I, personally, am tired of femshep pairings and it kinda ruined the experience for me. I stopped reading when I saw the pairing confirmed.

It's nothing against you, I truly believe you wrote an amazing fic I'm just really particular sometimes when it comes to pairings and I simply cannot enjoy the fic if it is not to my liking, even if I think the fic is amazing. I can't even remember the number of amazing fics I stopped reading because the pairing had Hermione, Ginny or sometimes Tonks.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

*** This one is very good and I definitely agree with this suggestion. The author definitely did some series Tolkien research before he started out on this. That's not to say it reads like LoTR, but he really likes throwing stuff in there in a way that does not feel gratuitous.

As far as Harry being very powerful like OP asked, it kinda fits but not really. He has his magic from home, or most of it and nobody from Middle Earth can replicate it. He's probably a little bit less powerful than you see Gandalf the Grey to be, but in the same sort of way there is magic in LoTR, you rarely see it in this fic. Well you see it a bit more than that.
