I remember reading a fic set after OoTP that was a H/Hr pairing with some well written magic usage. There is a particular scene where they turn Hermione's parents into wizards with a ritual by imparting their magic into the parents. It was novel length for sure. Any help would be very appreciated


** Should be a ff from bobmin, if my memory serves me right it's The Power Of The Press
