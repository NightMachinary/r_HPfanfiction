Single point of divergence.

It starts with a big fight between Lavender and Hermione. Lavender is mad that Ron is still looking with puppy eyes at Hermione, and Hermione pretends she doesn't care. So Lavender plans to make something that pulls Ron away from her for good.

A day before Ron's birthday, as they tried to make a Euphoria-Inducing potion in class, Lavender spikes Hermione's cauldron and, when Hermione takes a sip from it to test it, she gets an odd feeling. After being altered by Lavender, the potion gives Hermione massive diarrhea. Like smell and amount magically enhanced. Hermione shits all over Ron. Because of it, Ron has to go clean up himself and skips the whole Romilda's chocolate thingy. Harry doesn't take Ron to Slughorn. Slughorn takes poisoned mead. Slughorn dies. Hermione wants to stay low-key for the rest of the term.

*** ‚ÄúLoses her shit‚Äù tends to be a metaphor for losing one's temper and going crazy.

It doesn't tend to used as a literal expression.
