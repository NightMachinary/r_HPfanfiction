:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
hey everyone! I'mm looking for fics where harry goes off the radar in some way and then has different adventures involving magic

A few examples of when/how he runs away: - Harry runs away from the dursleys - harry doesn't go back to hogwarts after a certain year and instead goes to another place where people that want him at hogwarts cant reach him - harry vanishes straight after the final battle

stuff harry can do after vanishing: - learn magic at a different school / group / whatever - travel the world either on his own or with a companion - assume a new identity and live right under their noses - join a muggle group of some type (super heros, mafia, muggle school, anything really)

note that these examples are only examples not the only options! if a fic has a different way of doing thing but goes in the same direction thats fine too!

if a fic has a pairing, smut or different triggers please let me know in advance!

Thanks in advance everyone!

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8257400/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Power-of-Paranoia][The Power Of Paranoia]] is a 5th year divergence where Harry, upon receiving precisely 0 communication from his friends, hearing someone aparating outside his house and the whole dementor assassination attempt combined with the court appearance letter, puts 2+2=5 and comes up with the conclusions: his friends didn't contact him because they are dead, assassination attempt plus letter equals ministry taken over. He promptly flees the country and puts his name and his being the bwl under the fidelius and disappears out of everybodys lives, causing chaos back in the UK for those he left behind.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry Potter put paid to Voldemort at Hogwarts; now it's nineteen years later and, as the diesels hammer on, a bushy-haired girl is still searching for The-Boy-Who-Walked-Away... Oneshot, Deadliest Catch crossover.

** One of my most favorite "Harry leaves canon" stories are the crossovers with StarGate. I recommend this set of stories:

They are written in the order you see here, so you should read them in that same order

In short, Harry gets kidnapped from Earth by fleeing Goa'Uld before he even attends Hogwarts, and returns only by the 3rd story, where Harry's name coming out of the goblet of fire forces him back to Earth ...

Summary: Year 2937 Hello to whoever found this journal. If you read this piece of garbage in it's entirety, I hope that you will learn from humanity's mistakes and not mess up like it did a few centuries ago---who am I kidding? Nobody's ever going to read this, I'm the last person alive on Earth.

** There is an ongoing fix called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13722277/1/][I see no difference]] . After being insulted by Snape, Hermione decides “screw this place” and convinces Harry to run away rather than try to complete in a tournament that he has no business being in. They are still escaping as of the latest update so we will see what happens after that.

Also [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6755363/1/No-Hurry-At-All][No Hurry at All]] by robst. After the battle at the DoM Harry decides he is done with the Wizarding World. It's robst so H/Hr and Dumbledore bashing (mild Ron bashing as well).
