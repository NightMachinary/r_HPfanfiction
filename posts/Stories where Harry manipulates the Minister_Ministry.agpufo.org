Stories like "Insidious Inquisitor", where Harry tricks the Minister into doing what is right. I am also partial to stories where Fudge has a change of heart and ends up being helpful as long as he is helping Harry first and not Dumbledore.

Dumbledore does not have to be the antagonist, but I really don't see how Harry working with the Ministry would go over well with Dumbledore. Some sort of conflict would be appreciated, even if they have the same goal and clash over methods (like Dumbledore allowing Malfoy to stay at Hogwarts).

No Death Eater whitewashing, preferably no Hermione bashing, preferably as little of the Weasleys and Lupin as possible and no m/m.

** linkffn(Salvation in Shadow) has the Harry appealing to the Minister's more human desire for vengeance in a scene. It's also a very good indy!Harry too.

  In a world where twisting the very fabric of space and time is commonplace, Harry Potter is considered something extraordinary. Yet when he finally arrives at Hogwarts after being missing for seven years, no one can quite figure out what kind of person he is. Himself included. Darkish themes, no slash, no pairings, some lemons mixed in.

** My linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) has a large subplot of /Hermione/ shamelessly manipulating Cornelius Fudge into doing her bidding, with full support of Dumbledore. The latter part may sound odd, but remember that /Parselmouth/ is a whole 7-year AU; the whole Voldemort-denial thing never happened there, nor even Hagrid's arrest in /CoS/; so Dumbledore has fewer reasons to distrust the Ministry, and every reason to approve of giving Cornelius Fudge good tips in the hope that he does the right thing (remember that in the early books, we hear of Dumbledore being flooded with letters from Fudge asking him for advice, which grow scarcer and scarcer as Malfoy's hold over Fudge increases).

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

** Here's and H/Hr time travel fic with Molly/Percy/Ron bashing. It gets a bit dark and they kill some people who did them wrong. But it's still pretty good and they play the minister masterfully until he is actually a good one and pretty popular.
