Why doesn't Harry Potter use Hermione's time turner to go back in time and stop Voldemort from killing James and Lilly?


** Because it is impossible for him to change the past that way without breaking the temporal line . He would have needed to create a time loop .

** Time Turners are not safe, they can only be used to safely travel up to five hours into the past , more and there can be serious consequences. And not just things like changing the past and stopping people form being born, but serious damage to time itself like days only lasting a couple hours or even twice as long.

#+begin_quote
  All attempts to travel back further than a few hours have resulted in catastrophic harm to the witch or wizard involved. It was not realised for many years why time travellers over great distances never survived their journeys. All such experiments have been abandoned since 1899, when Eloise Mintumble became trapped, for a period of five days, in the year 1402. Now we understand that her body had aged five centuries in its return to the present and, irreparably damaged, she died in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries shortly after we managed to retrieve her. What is more, her five days in the distant past caused great disturbance to the life paths of all those she met, changing the course of their lives so dramatically that no fewer than twenty-five of their descendants vanished in the present, having been “un-born”.

  ‘Finally, there were alarming signs, during the days following Madam Mintumble's recovery, that time itself had been disturbed by such a serious breach of its laws. Tuesday following her reappearance lasted two and a half full days, whereas Thursday shot by in the space of four hours. The Ministry of Magic had a great deal of trouble in covering this up and since that time, the most stringent laws and penalties have been placed around those studying time travel.'

** Hermione's time turner can only go back a few hours. Also, it would probably cause a paradox.

** That's actually answered in the Cursed Child play.

In the play, Harry and his son go back in time and watch James and Lily in Godric's Hollow before they die, but decides not to save them in order to keep the timeline the same.

*GODRIC'S HOLLOW, 1981*

#+begin_quote
  VOLDEMORT comes through the back of the stage, and across it, and walks down into the auditorium. And the air fills with the hatred and fear he spreads. He brings death with him. And everyone knows it.

  *HARRY looks after VOLDEMORT helplessly.*

  *HARRY:* Voldemort is going to kill my mum and dad --- and there's nothing I can do to stop him.

  *DRACO:* That's not true.

  *SCORPIUS:* Dad, now is not the time . . .

  *ALBUS:* There is something you could do --- to stop him. But you won't.

  *DRACO:* That's heroic.

  *GINNY takes HARRY's hand.*

  *GINNY:* You don't have to watch, Harry. We can go home.

  *HARRY:* I'm letting it happen . . . Of course I have to watch.

  *HERMIONE:* Then we'll all witness it.

  *RON:* We'll all watch.

  *We hear unfamiliar voices . . .*

  *JAMES (from off):* Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off . . .

** This is always the fic I think of when I think of paradoxes. This, and MoR...

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4726291/1/]])

You have six kinds of time travel.

1. The Immutable Past: the future is already set in stone and nothing you do will change it. The first time through, there were already two of you, the past one and the future one, and when you're the future one you do only what you already did. This is the Harry Potter canon time travel, barring Cursed Child, (which I pretend doesn't exist.)

2. The Recurring Loop: You can repeat the day/week/month/year over again until you're happy with it, and you can change stuff each time. Think Groundhog Day.

3. Multiverse Machine: you can go to the past and change the future, and then go a bit farther into the past and change it again, and again, and again. You aren't destroying the future, you're just going to a different universe. Think Primer.

4. Do-Over: You can change the future but you've only got one shot at it; the trip was an accident or required very exacting circumstances.

5. The Past Is Breakable: you kill you're grandad before he has any kids and you're never born, so you begin to fade away. No paradox here, you just don't exist anymore, and your grandad stays dead. The universe deleted you to fix the problem. Think Back To The Future.

6. Paradox: you can create a paradox. Think the Marvel Universe.

*** Don't forget 3b: One mulitverse jump. Where the traveller just gets one shot at changing things (the trip was accidental or relied on very unique circumstances).

**** Thankyou, I'd forgotten that one, it's been added to the list. (I couldn't make it look nice as “3b” though, so sadly it's just #4, and there are now six options.)

** They can't. Regular time-turners can't go that far back.

If they could, why stop there? Why not save more people? Kill Tom in his crib, or at right after his first murder if that bothers you. Why set that as the limit? Plenty of dark lords existed that are just waiting for a time traveler to retcon out of existence.
