Any ffs where Voldemort is more of a communist wizard as in instead of.going with purebloods he goes with half-bloods and Muggle born wizards so he is kinda the first communist wizard but instead of it being workers rights is Muggle born rights, half-blood rights and magical creatures right and so on


** This is your lucky day!

That Glorious Strength Lomonaaeren

Summary: Instead of becoming Voldemort, Tom Riddle established a school of “secondary importance” for Muggleborns, half-bloods, and Squibs. Since the school frees Hogwarts to continue drifting more towards the purebloods' whims and wishes, they haven't raised any large fuss. Besides, everyone knows that half-bloods and Muggleborns don't have any real power. Just look at Riddle, who had ambitions that outpaced his magical strength. They don't see the revolution coalescing under the surface.
