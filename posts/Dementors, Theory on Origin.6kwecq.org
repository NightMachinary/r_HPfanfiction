Expecto Patronum summons a guardian, an advocate, from happiness and joy.

Inverse spell:

Expecto Accusator summons an adversary, a prosecutor (sounds familiar because [at least Judaic] Satan). Cast from despair and sorrow. Perhaps has requirement of having seen death, like with Thestrals. Just as presence of a Patronus brings an aura of peace and happiness and safety, the presence of an Accusator brings an aura of loss and sorrow and danger.

Like Fiendfyre, it fights against the control of its caster. If it escapes, it sustains itself by feeding off the magic of other magical beings, and reproduces by eating souls. This is how Dementors are born. As such, highly restricted knowledge. Consider to be evil on par with Horcruxes because both involve destroying a soul.

If one prefers the HPMOR formulation (spoilers follow if that is not yet read):

[[/spoiler][Level 1 Accusator is cast from accepting Death (so Dumbledore could cast it) has the emotional effects, and especially if corporeal is an effective weapon in battle, as it drains moral of foes if among only them. Level 2 is cast from wanting to bring Death to others, wanting to spread your own sorrow to others, etc. Self-sustains by draining magical energy from targets. This is the form that can become a Dementor. Knowledge of even level 1 is highly proscribed nonetheless]]


** I always just figured that Dementors were a natural phenomenon, and as such are not born and can't be killed, but wax and wane like the tide and can be held back if necessary.

** I always assumed that Dementors were as old as Magic (aka Eternal and Primordial). Saying that the Dementor has a beginning kind of cheapens what made it so scary in canon, to begin with. You also have to remember that if Expecto Patronum is truly one of the counter spells, the Dementors should lose form and die whenever one is cast directly at them, but they don't.

** Huh. I never thought about dementors just being out-of-control summoned monsters.

Personally, a theory I was sitting on recently; you know how apparently Azkaban used to belong to some dark wizard called Ekrizdis, and after he died the Dementors were discovered in Azkaban?

My idea was, Ekrizdis experimented on muggle sailors (and the occasional witch/wizard/magical creature) that he caught, exploring how to transfer magic from one being to another, how to transform people into monsters and so forth.

The Dementors are the result of a refined experiment into creating Obscurials from the bodies of magic-infused muggles; lacking the ability to generate their own magic, these neo-obscuri instead try to drain it from others, sucking out their emotions, their magic, and ultimately their souls to try and fill that 'gap' in their biology.

*** From Rising From The Shadows- "...Dementors were the result of the Blood-Wizard Ekrizdis trying to make Inferi more dangerous by giving them the ability to use magic and the intelligence to use it. He succeeded, sort of, but didn't survive and we've been stuck with them ever since." Fanfic, but makes sense.

** I prefer the idea that dementors are the results of a Dark Lords attempt at perfectingthe Horcrux spell. He would try and rip the soul from a body and place it somewhere else and try and keep the body animated and thinking. The results are the cloaked monsters that feast on souls to try and replace what was stolen from them but can never get back due to the damage done to them. They can't remorse their way whole as they personally did nothing to feel remorse over and now as Dementors feasting on emotions they can'take understand remorse anymore

** A theory I have, which isn't supported in any way, is that Dementors could be the magical equivalent of entropy. They would appear through means unknown and consume magic until there's nothing left at the end of times.

***** [[/spoiler][They are the embodiment of Death in the world by some rule of magic. HPJEV conflates the symbolisms of death (of people) with death (of the universe). IIRC, he never explicitly calls out as being avatars of entropy...]]

In any event, as my creative writing professors told us every class "Good writers borrow, good writers steal." I call that true in the sense that any story one writes tends to be, in part, a linear combination of what one has read and lived....

Yes. There's so much already written, It's difficult not to borrow from something else. Moreover, it's how creativity works, interpreting what we already know to make something new.

** I rather liked the theory used in the Sacrifics Arc. They are creatures from the edges of nightmares. They came to exist in the world by a dark wizard that summoned and bound them to the physical plane.

The theory from HPmor was fine but it didn't speak to me like the one from Sacrifices which is ironic because I liked HPmor more than Sacrifices.

*** Indeed.

In retrospect I think I took a modicum of inspiration from those two in crafting this theory, which is intended for the backstory of my own.

:)

The Sacrifices Arc was amazing, but there was a poignant cloak of melancholy and loss hanging off it, which, while making it an even more exquisite work, left a poor aftertaste in my bookmouth.

ending spoilers

[[/spoiler][I think that was because the death of the brother, especially that horrible moment when I finally understood the text of the prophecy at the moment Harry did, then raising the hope of a son or daughter, then crushing that hope, then passing it on to some random person who's magic matched felt ridiculously sad. Especially because it felt almost... dismissive of it, somehow? Because all there was about that heir was a one-sentence aside. Even a paragraph of her coming into her inheritance, and having some kind of moment of closure through a scene there... That was even more solid brick of sad to the face than when the mind-snake gave her life to save his mind.]]

**** You have expressed perfectly why I haven't been able to finish the sacrifices arc yet, in part, because I feel so very fatalistic when reading it. Harry does amazing things yet always, always left so broken with no effective healing in sight. Some day I will finish it as the world building is awesome; but it won't be until I am in a happier place cuz, damn, it's depressing.

** The thread reminded me of a fic I've read a long time ago that included a Dementor well from which dementors were leaving at will, that had to be closed by moving an essentially enormous piece of stone with maybe runes on it, because people living nearby were terrorized by them. The people were wizards, but weak ones who were never even accepted to Hogwarts (the school was only for the elite strong wizards and for the rest it was tough shit). It was a typical "Harry Potter and.." alternative and probably badly written but I'm feeling sentimental.

** Detectors cause frost on the windows etc and a supernatural chill to the air, their presence brings misery. A phoenix is a being or warmth that brings joy where kit goes. All things have duality, Dementors are the inverse, equal and opposite of the phoenix. If phoenix were born from the first fires in the universe then dementors were born from the shadows cast by that light.
