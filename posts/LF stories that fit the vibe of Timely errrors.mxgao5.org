One of the reasons why I love Timely Errors by Worfe so much is that they are just teenagers doing magical boarding school things.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4198643/1/Timely-Errors]]

Spoilers:

Harry time travels to his parents 6 years. Voldemort is in a coma, so he is at that moment not very worried about voldy. And in the story you see Harry going to classes, enjoying exploding snap, be chill and friendly with his classmates, he is having fun conversations with dumbledore. Everything is just kinda slice of life (in a different settings with some action moments)

And I was wondering if there are stories with the same vibe. It does not need to be time travel or something. It is more the feeling I'm trying to find.


** Not to plug my own slice of life fic but if you want some just friendship, nothing happens and everyone is happy and chatty then there's this...

  Harry accidently gets good at chess after playing Ron for 6 years. Pity he doesn't even notice.All the chess matches are real and linked in the fic for you to follow along for context since, as it turns out, writing chess is bloody difficult!

*** Well that's a coincidence ! I just found this story an hour a go. Already saved and downloaded it

I frigging loved the part where they were just screaming at each other. Reminds me of queens gambit when they were in the car playing a game. But like less chill and more yelling haha

Also the part where Harry finally realizes. It is his second favorite game !

**** Haha oh I'm glad! Yeah two people asked for SoL stories today and I'm like "Hey I have one!"... I shouldn't do that.

I'm glad you liked it! I liked writing that chapter too üòä. It was fun trying to make something boring feel kinda dramatic. Thank you for your lovely feedback!

** LullabyKnell has at least two stories that are in Hogwarts and they get really into descriptions of the school and some lovely scenes about Hogwarts and just Harry's interactions with the quidditch team and teachers and stuff

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8517286/chapters/19522336]]) has a great description of the Hogwarts kitchens and one training session in particular with the quidditch team that made me feel so happy

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15863055/chapters/36953667]]) the author admits to getting positively self indulgent in how deeply they thought about classes and professors and everything. It's definitely slice of life and really nice

  Prisoner of Azkaban AU: After the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff Quidditch match, Harry finds himself striking up two unlikely friendships. The first is with Hufflepuff's captain, Cedric Diggory. The second is with the Grim. You know, that canine specter of Death that's been trying to kill him. Between that and learning the Patronus Charm, surviving Sirius Black, passing his classes, training for the Quidditch House Cup, trying to figure out why Professor Lupin treats him so strangely, helping Hermione fight for werewolf rights, and more, Harry seems to be in for yet another busy year at Hogwarts. (Tl;dr: an alternate canon for POA, featuring crushes on handsome Hufflepuffs and canine Marauder dads.)
