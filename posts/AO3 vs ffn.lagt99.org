Until recently I was an avid supporter of ffn since it was forcing writers to be more sparse with tags but recently I actually learned to use AO3 and now ffn seems clunky and ugly to look at.

What is your preferred site and what are it's pros and cons


** They both have their strengths, they both have their weaknesses. I always post on both because they complement each other - they may both be for fanfiction, but they both offer different things around those stories and I like to embrace that. :)

*** Exactly this.

Some of my favorite fanfic authors are only on ffn, but the people running it lack responsiveness, transparency, and consistency. Random unexplained site outages, removal of some fics without warning or explanation, inconsistent application of site rules, all of these are problems. It also has barely anything in terms of search functionality and no way to filter a Favorites list you're looking at, which makes finding new fics to read a PITA. The reader community can also get pretty toxic, especially anonymous troll reviewers.

AO3 solves a lot of the above problems, but has a few of its own. Overtagging and inconsistent tagging are probably two of the biggest issues, as others have pointed out. I also agree that at times the community swings the pendulum too far in the direction of permissiveness, leaving a not-insubstantial chunk of the site's content as niche fetish-bait - not trying to kink-shame, but I've seen plenty of fics whose main ship would be very illegal IRL for very good reason. Even the stuff that's not hideously unethical can drown out more "mainstream" content to the point where I sometimes wish the fetish-pandering would be spun off into a separate site.

It was in a different fandom than HP, but I remember finding a fic that was pure pedophilia (and damn the summary was not really clear on the point). It's one thing to be open minded, but I'm pretty sure it's illegal to write (or at least share) this kind of story.

Also, the fact that the story had absolutely NOTHING to do with the fandom outside of the characters name made me wonder why the hell would someone write it as a fanfic.

***** I can't speak to everywhere, but there are some places where written content doesn't fall foul of those kinds of laws, specifically because the definitions of 'child pornography' in their legal codes don't include written material, just visuals. The protection of children act in the UK only really makes reference to 'images' in that regard, for example.

I can't find the comment I made the last time someone brought this up to get the name of the specific legislation, but there's even one piece of legal work that actually uses the word 'photo' in its definitions. Law is weird.

** A /very/ important part of this conversation is the ownership of these two sites and their philosophies and mission.

FFN is a profit-driven company. That's why they have ads and strict content policies. They are beholden to their advertisers, and they need to prioritize their bottom line as a business. I remember the First Great Purge of 2003, and how SO MANY fics were lost due to the new content policies. When FFN receives a cease and desist or a DMCA takedown request, they comply, because they are more liable for damages from copyright infringement due to making money off the ads.

AO3 is run by a non-profit whose mission is to support "transformative" works. Everything from the extensible software system to the content archived is approached in the "free as in freedom" spirit of openness. Just about the only things you cannot do on AO3 are straight-up plagiarism and profit-seeking. When they receive a DMCA takedown request, their team of lawyers makes sure it's legit, and they also have political lobbyists to protect creators of transformative works.

Due to this philosophy and mission, I publish exclusively at AO3, and when someone rec's a fic at FFN, I check to see if I can read it at AO3 instead.

I prefer the commenting system and being able to block anonymous reviews. Commenters are generally nicer to me on AO3 than they are on ffn. The support teams is very responsive - when someone copied and pasted entire sections from my fic, I reported them and the fic was taken down within days. On ffn it takes months to get a response from the staff, if you get one at all.

That being said, excluding tags, especially content tags, will help you to keep the worst out of your search results.

******* If you go back and read my comment again, you can see that I did not say to remove the current tag system. Simply to have a prioritized system that would go on top of it to let there be a distinction between major tags and minor ones.

I've used AO3 and FF both, and AO3's tag system varies from good to poor depending on the author in my experience. It makes searches in AO3 often fruitless, because it gives the same tag priority to something where it's the focus of the story and where it's tagged but only mentioned offhand in one chapter.

As it stands, I just use the two platforms for reading fics that I find recommended elsewhere, because the search features in both are quite meh.

Edit - this is also in response to someone who /liked/ Ao3's tag system and was unhappy about the tagging system with background relationships... so it's not just people who don't use Ao3

******** Ao3 is set up to allow searches to both include and exclude tags. That's why it's normal to tag minor pairings. Its ragging system is pretty fucking impressive for a nonprofit website and I cant think of any site that could match it, but I don't think coding wise what you're suggesting is actually that feasible.

********* So, tagging minor pairings is not something that I think is /bad/ in a vacuum - but it's that there's no way to tag them as minor pairings, or to show as such in a search.

The tagging system is something that's a positive for sure, but as it currently stands it does make searches harder when you're looking for something in particular as the focus of a story (whereas it's much better for excluding stuff - though still not perfect).

Coding wise, it doesn't strike me as impossible to add in essentially a secondary tagging system with a limited quantity of tags per fic allowed. The larger difficulty at this point would be all the old fics having tagging issues because of that, but improving features shouldn't be limited just by that. This is a flaw with Ao3's tagging system that is fairly often brought up and for good reason.

I will remove Draco as a character, along with any tag that mentions draco being with any main character or side character, and he still shows up in the fic wanting to fuck Harry's ass.

Because it could be tagged for a character who is a pedophile victim in their past, for a villain who is also a pedophile, or, for what you're concerned about, text sexualizing prepubescent kids. Ao3 has a zero censorship policy. Period. And they adhere to the laws of the state of New York, which is where they're based out of. It's text in NY, so it is not a crime so they will not censor. It exists. So do horror movies sensationalizing and glorifying horrible harm done to people. Censorship of literature has never lead to anything good. Don't like; don't read. I don't and will never understand this attitude of holding /fanfiction/ to some illusory higher standard than mainstream media, including published works that don't give us the courtesy of tags. It's fiction, it is not hurting real people, but this attitude does when people are targeted over their content---especially since the term has been expanded to include “any underage activity I object to.”

**** Pedophilia is a tag that is needed. Tags are there as a warning to the readers. If a fic ISN'T tagged when it has pedophilia in it, it is possible for a reader who might be triggered to read it without prior knowledge. You can't complain about such tags. The same is possible for the tags "murder, torture, rape". While all the tags can be used as a searching tool, which is completely up to the reader to decide which tag to search and therefore not the responsibility of the site, their main purpose is to tell people what they're getting into.

Game of Thrones/ASOIAF is what got me started on fanfic. I noticed some of the fics on FFN were super stilted, but I just assumed it was that fandom because ✨neckbeards ✨. But when I started reading HP fanfic, I found that the writing styles were similar. Like too formal to be read smoothly. Jilted, maybe. Like they're trying to sound like published authors, but end up sounding like wannabe Jane Austens.

That being said, I've found that Ao3 fics have young writers, but they are soooo much easier to exclude with the right tags.

*** There is an ffn app but when you use the search function it doesn't always come up with all the stories with that name which can be frustrating if you're looking for a fic with a popular name eg Love Conquers All or stuff like that.

It is easier to read chapter by chapter though as you can swipe right for the next chapter or left for the previous one. I do like the app.

** AO3 no doubt at all. Way better sorting system, although can get really messy when the writer spams every tag known to man, and wish it had some other features like sort by main characters/pairings, it still absolutely destroys the very limited ffn tags. It's also way easier for users to upload their stuff, seriously ffn uploading system is totally outdated and unnecessary. And while I have a hard time choosing which site's layout I prefer, that just comes down to personal preference. If AO3 has one bad thing going against its the annoying verification process, but I understand why its there and once you have the account its obviously not a problem anymore.

** *FFN Yes! :*

- There is everything there.
- It's big!
- It's simple!
- You can recognize a low-effort spam right from summary!

*FFN No! :*

- The Great Purge (works deleted for wonky reasons, happens regularly)
- plagiarism-friendly, don't expect help this year
- non-responsive, non-adaptive
- don't expect much good stuff from NC-17

​

*AO3 Yes! :*

- Detailed search engine
- People are generally nicer *
- Some fandoms and preferences are very distinctly represented - if that's your thing, go there
- Chapter summaries are a godsend

*AO3 No! :*

- The tags are an unholy mess. This decreases the effectiveness of search engine.
- People are less specifically nice (on FFN you're more likely to get flamed on 'hello', but on AO3 you have to watch what you say because people hold grudges - and that's not even personal experience! I just browse a lot)
- Slash is king. Nothing against it, exactly, but I've read too many AO3 stories that got ruined by forced pairings, excessive agenda pushing and venomous comment replies. It's also worth noting that most stories there contain romance subplot, usually M/M, so it's hard to find a goodly-sized gen fic for the evening.

** As a writer, I prefer FFN, because although it is clunky and the ads are annoying, I get a lot more reader engagement.

I post the same content on FFN and AO3, and the comment rate on FFN is substantially higher. Haven't had an issue with trolls yet since I started writing again this year. FFN seems to have put more thought into their writer community: you can PM people and use forums, there's a better stat breakdown.

Genfic (aka all my multi-chapter stuff, I only really do ship-based oneshots) tends to sink on AO3. Doubly so if your characters are unpopular or you're writing an OC in the main cast.

Even so, on FFN, there's no way 300 people would read a one shot and not leave a single review. In fact, on FFN it has 200 views and 5 reviews. Reader engagement is really important to writers, and the way AO3 is set up promotes a kind of consumer culture where readers scroll, hit the kudos button maybe, and move on.

I also have found more fics that I like reading from FFN, possibly because I'm not too picky, so I just search a character I want to read about or by update date. Yeah, there's brilliant stuff on AO3, too, but a lot of it is cross-posted anyway.

But I can see how most readers would like AO3. But as a writer, I feel very lonely on there.

Clearer layout, more consistent use of tags (though some like to write paragraphs in them), better search functionality, and isn't purged every two seconds because of pressure (though that does have the downside of "Original Works" section being basically little but paedophilic content).

FFN

Larger archive of works going back longer but is very basic in terms of what it can and can't do, with working out pairings being a real nightmare via search.

** Depends...

FFN has much more in the outsiders fandom which I read in for years. Ao3 outsiders content is fairly minimal.

In HP, ffn has a lot more fics (tho ao3 has plenty) and it's easier to search rare pairs and easier to search if you just want a fic centered on a certain character (esp if it's a smaller character). But you can only search genre and can't search specific tropes.

Ao3 allows you to search very specific tags which I love when I'm looking for something very specific “Voldemort wins AU” or “Fred weasley lives” I think reading on ao3 on a phone is bit nicer for the dark mode. And I really like being able to see lots of tags upfront because it gives me better scope of story before I start like on FFN I hate a vague summary. And you can exclude certain tags!

But ao3 is awful for searching minor characters like I want so badly to read stories where Parvati or Blaise are major characters but unless I search them in a ship it's impossible and even then it's hard.

I think tags are great but they should limit how many characters/pairings can be tagged. Or have a way to structure...the story is about Harry/draco and Ron/Pansy...but in this world it's Sirius/Remus and Tonks/Charlie in the background ya know?

FFN is a bit annoying to upload to, but I never got the hate for that. Copy-paste from GDrive works fine, so really it's just an unnecessary intermediate step. Having to confirm their guidelines every week is more annoying. And getting the right tag order on Archive isn't any easier.

** When it comes to reading practicality I prefer FFN. Ao3 doesn't allow unofficial apps to run on IOS and doesn't seem like they are making one themselves. I hate reading AO3 through a browser.

When it comes to filter options, of course it's Ao3. They offer much more comprehensible filter searches than FFN.

When it comes to amount of content, it has to be FFN. FFN absolutely dwarfs Ao3 is the amount of stories on their site.

When it comes to censorship issues, then it's Ao3 again. FFN's nsfw purges are the most annoying thing when it comes to fics. I don't necessarily read for NSFW content but a lot of stories that are amazing has that content and when FFN comes around for another purge that story is lost forever unless the author backs it up or changes things.

All in all it's really a tossup. I mostly read FFN because Ao3 doesn't have an app that fits their stories on my phone screen nice and easy. If Ao3 offered one up on IOS then i'd likely be using it more than FFN.

So I find myself most often on ao3, while missing ffn's dark/light button.

I wouldn't mind a upper limit on ao3 for X tags on X posted words. Or tags per individual chapter.

Edit: downside of ao3: The 0-word fics that aren't written stories but comics, or entire WhatsApp conversations between characters or the podfics. They really ought to have their own search engine.

ffn is the opposite, missing obvious tagging functions, to the point where authors have been shoving tags into the description of all things.

In terms of story quality both sites are pretty trash; with over 99% of stories being essentially unreadable. Overall both sites need some ways for readers to filter story by quality; that isnt favorites(Since most of the community has no taste, nor standards when it comes to literature).

**** The app is amazing and one of the reasons why I vastly prefer ffn. I only read on my phone and Ao3 on a phone browser is an awful experience in my opinion. If it just had a tab that had all your favorites fics sorted by update, and a better tagging system, I'd actually use Ao3.

*** A couple things to note.

Ao3 does actually send u emails for any fics you are subscribed to when they update. Idk where you got the idea they dont but okay.

Also ao3 does have dark modes. I say modes because there are a lot of different colour schemes you can change the site to if you have an account. I dont remember exactly how but iirc it was rlly rlly easy.

Also your main complaint seems to be that you dont want to see any slash fics. And yeah if u exclude harry/draco it wont exclude other pairings that have the both of them... because that's a different pairing. The ability to exclude things is literally so simple to use I dont rlly understand most of the complaints about that.

Like I have legit never had a problem with the search function for ao3 so I guess I just dont understand where you are coming from. And while tags are sometimes abused it's not rlly overcomplicated at all. You see a tag u like you can click on it for other fics with that tag or you can exclude that tag so u dont get those fics.

Also u only ever need to keep 1 tab open for ao3 if u want to cuz u can add fics to a mark for later list u can go through whenever.

Literally all of your complaints are just you not understanding how to use the site. If it's so confusing just Google your question because likely someone has had the same problem and it's easily solved.

**** See thats the issue, its not easy, i shouldnt have to google how to use it because its so counterintuitive.

And ffn search function takes max 30 seconds. On ao3 you need to spend 10 minutes just to set up exceptions to what you dont want. Its so stupid! I rarely use emails, so bookmarking and then checking my email constantly to see if a fic has updated, when i can use ffn app where i just get a notification when something has updated?

There just isnt any way i would use something as clunky and complicated as ao3 when ffn makes it so easy and fast to use.

***** A couple things to note. Ao3 is rlly rlly easy to use.

Subscription to a fic or author literally just sends u an email. If u want a notification set up your email to notify your phone or something that's also fairly easy.

Idk what type of fics u are looking for that need to take 10 minutes to go through tags to find tbh. It's literally so simple like there are already categories for which characters are most common among a tag or relationships. U can either select these only or exclude them. If u dont see a tag u want to find or exclude theres a handy search function to find the tag to exclude or include. Then u can modify search to complete or not, crossovers or not, exact word parameters, exact date parameters plus theres a couple different ways to sort the search.

Literally I have never found ao3 hard to use at all. Also if u want an example of how easy it is to change to a dark mode u legit just go to ao3 then your account then to your preferences and just pick literally any skin at all that's there. That took me literally 20 seconds to find only because my internet wasnt super fast.

And a major problem with ffn is that there are basically no tags at all. U can essentially only look for specific relationships whereas on ao3 u can look for anything from like severitus to obscurial harry there is so much variety. Ffn may not be in your own words as clunky as ao3 but that's mostly because of how much it just doesnt have at all.

****** Sorry but the Ao3 tagging system is a royal PITA. If I don't like Harry/Voldemort fics, I specifically exclude that type of fic from the available tags, then I have to tell it to exclude the Harry/Voldemort/Lucius that all of a sudden was available, then I have to tell it to exclude Harry/Voldemort/Wormtail that just showed up. If I don't want Harry/Voldemort, I shouldn't have to spend 10 minutes excluding every permutation of that pairing that keeps showing up.

** DAVIES I have BOTH! :) :) I upload first to AO3 and then copy paste into Fanfics doc manager because Ao3 is so much easier to use! :) Saving drafts and clicking through the menu is so much better than doing the stupid side bar stuff in FFN.net! Ao3 is super more streamlined and easier to use. :) :)

** I prefer AO3, with some very big caveats regarding tags and a little bit regarding that I've found less people bookmarking than favouriting/following on FFN. Favourites and follows are my quick way to find fics, and even with tags I find that's it's still often more reliable to see what people who have similar tastes like rather than spend an hour trying to find a fic.

** Generally, FFN has a lot more fics, but on the other hand in my experience AO3 has more fics for slash, fem slash, and rair pairs. It's also much easier to find fics that have a specific concept on AO3 due to the tags and filtering system. I perfer AO3 but I end up using FFN quite freqently due to how many fics exist there.

** AO3. It´s much easier to find super-specific fics on it than on ffn where the tags are very vague. But I do like both, I usually use ao3 for smaller fics and ffn for longer ones. Also, there are fandoms that are more prominent on aor3 and vice versa.

** I mostly use "ffn" for reading(although the search is shit). For writing I mostly use "ffde". But thats only because I prefer to write in my native language. My english is good but my german is excellent and I want to give my best.

Sometimes I search on "siye" but that site is just old. It got some gems though.

** I prefer Ao3 but still like and use ffn, if less frequently.\\
I like ao3's layout and tag system more, and I prefer the 'entire work' option. Ffn is still good, with the app layout better than the website itself. In the app you can download your favourite works and use Folders. Ao3 has collections and bookmarks to Categorize your favorites better in my opinion.

** As a reader that prefers gen fics, I like FFN better since there are a lot more there. This varies a bit by fandom, but is largely true from my experience.

AO3 is probably the better designed website though. But it's also too complicated at times.

** As a writer, Ao3 hands down, though I use both. It's so much easier to publish stories, add/edit chapters and sometimes I'll catch a typo when giving it a casual read-through after posting and cringe cause editing on ff is a pain, whereas I could change it in a second on Ao3.

I also find people comment more on Ao3 than ff.net, and that the comments are more in depth? Sometimes? While on ff.net more people tend to favourite and follow stories instead of commenting (though I can't say if that's something that happens across the board with everyone).

** AO3 all the way

Both as writer and reader I prefer AO3 is just better, most of the complains I read about ao3 are about the tagging system and diverse content (too much kink) but both are problems you can be addressed by getting use to the tag system which is actually pretty awesome.

Also the quality of the average work is higher on AO3.

I only use ffn because the HP fandom is huge there and it has some great fics but I have yet to find good writing in any of the other fandoms that I follow.
