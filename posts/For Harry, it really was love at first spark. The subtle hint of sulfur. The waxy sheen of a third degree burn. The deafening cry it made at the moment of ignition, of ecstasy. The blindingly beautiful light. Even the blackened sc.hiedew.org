#+TITLE: For Harry, it really was love at first spark. The subtle hint of sulfur. The waxy sheen of a third degree burn. The deafening cry it made at the moment of ignition, of ecstasy. The blindingly beautiful light. Even the blackened scorch marks it left like a delicate kiss. He knew his purpose in life.

** A Harry obsessed with the glory of explosions? I'd read that.

"Mister Potter, what are you doing?" McGonagall pinched the bridge of her nose as her (arguably) most wayward student seemed to carefully motion with his wand and murmur arithmatic equasions under his breath. He stopped suddenly, seemingly satisfied if his nod was anything to go by and cracked a smile at his head of house.

"I just transfigured Mayonnaise into Potassium Nitrate Professor." He said it with the faintest hint of pride

Minerva sighed. There he went again, naming these confounded muggle elements.

"And what would a nitrous potato do then?"

"Potassium. Nitrate." He said, slightly put out by her mangling of the substance's name "And by itself? Not much. But when interacting with the sulfur I just made from salt and the Glycerin I just made from Salad dressing..."

A huge bang could be heard coming from the Slytherin table as Draco Malfoy was covered in the remains of his sandwich.

"I just became the first person to effectively turn a Sandwich into a Detpack!"

"Twenty points from Gryffindor and a week's detention Mister Potter."

** "Seamus transfigured his water into rum. Not bad: ethanol does burn, but I like something with a bit of a bang."

Katie leaned over, curious.

"That's why I transfigured mine into nitroglycerine!"

Many a head turned to stare at Katie as she suddenly dived under the table, dragging Alicia and Angelina with her.

"You're nuts!" came from under the table.

  It was supposed to be a joke letter, but it ended up so much more. Who would have guessed that the 'poster child' of the Light side was a closet Pyromaniac with a distinct inability to care about the trauma he causes? Now there's a warlock teaching DADA, there's Death Eaters on fire, and the mediwitch is hexing everyone! Who knew being a minder for Richard could be so fun? CRACK

** The crowd opened as Harry walked through the Hall to the Gryffindor table, people were already opening a spot for him, next to Ron and Hermione, the latter which was already casting flame freezing charms on their clothes and on their part of the table.

"Morning guys!" Harry saluted, his singed sleeves following the movement.

"Morning, Harry" his friends chorused, Ron trying to subtly drag his plate just a little away from his best mate.

Harry sat down, immediately going for the steaks and potatoes, he was about to eat, before grinning and turning to Hermione who had just cast the strongest antiflame charm she knew on her hair.

"Hey, Hermione, I perfected a new spell today," he said, not noticing the people right across him pulling their wands, ready to cast shields, or the people on his other side pushing away, even if half the table was now looking at him, say what you will about Harry, but when he talked that way about a spell it was always impressive, and more often than not, dangerous.

"Really, Harry? You could show us near the lake later."

"Nah, I can show it now," before she could object(but not before Fred could cast Protego Igni) Harry took a deep breath and blew over his plate, an orange-red flame leaving his lips and turning a medium-rare steak into an overcooked one, and the potatoes into a golden/brown color.

Around him, the student's reactions where varied.

"Bloody Hell!"

"He can do it without a wand, now!?"

"Bollocks!"

"This can't be legal."

When he finished, he turned to Hermione whose mouth was open, and Ron who had forgotten about his food.

"Blimey, Harry! You can breathe fire like a dragon? You must show that to Charlie," he thought for a second "Better not to show Mum, I reckon."

No one noticed Draco Malfoy paling considerably, or Snape, who was both delighted over having a new excuse to accuse Potter of messing with his potions and concerned of riling the boy enough he would end up exploding the classroom.

Albus Dumbledore was shaking his head, who knew Fawkes' tears would have such an effect on the boy, his familiar was certainly proud, the bastard.

But the truth was that after Second Year, Harry loved fire, he got extremely good at all kinds of Fire Spells, so good he could hold a flame in his hand without a wand, and throw small fireballs, his relatives certainly left him alone since he proved that trick didn't get a letter.

Harry understood fire now, he felt he was the fire. Almost all his failed spells put things on fire, his flame charms were strong enough Flitwick had Aguamenti taught to his class two years early.

By the beginning of this year, his fourth, Harry could cast Confrigo silently, and his flame whip could burn through wood like butter.

-------

A few weeks later, Harry met someone who seemed to love fire as much as he did.

The first thing he noticed was the smell, like a burning holly log, and ashes, the second thing was the grace, like a dancing flame. Others felt drawn for other reasons, and while he certainly noticed and liked those, it was the spark that drew him in.

He was thinking of an approach, when she came and asked for the Bouillabaisse, he quickly got it and when he turned to give it to her, their hands touched, and their eyes met.

Her eyes too were fire, blue fire to his green one, the most beautiful fire he had ever seen, it burned so well, the smell of burning holly wafted to his nose, while the burning rosewood's went into hers.

They both smiled at each other and didn't notice the purple flame that came out of the bowl, bathing their smiles in eerie, violet light.

Dumbledore and Maxine looked at each other and nodded somberly, both their eyes showing compassion for the other in their plight.

Hermione huffed goodnaturedly, Ginny deflated, and Ron just shrugged.

"Eh, no big loss, it smelled funny anyway."
