My mom has been writing young-adult books for years but they never get published. Although the whole publishing industry is what it is, the reason why is because she never actually sends her stories to the publishers. I thought that writing a little fan fiction with all the instant gratification of comments and fans might be what she needs to not fear the publishers. Are there works out there that really made you want to write? What about works that really show the power of a happy story community?


** There is no guarantee of getting comments and 'fans' and there is always a risk of flames as well. Will your mum be all right with those? It does require the growth of a thick skin! Writing for that sort of validation is a risky strategy and can backfire. That said, it probably is possible to set out to write something to a popular formula that might do quite well.

But most people go from fanfic to original fiction rather than the other way round. If I was her, I'd be looking to polish and get critique on what I already had, then if the feedback was good, consider moving to the next stage for publication or self-publishing.

*** She runs two critique groups and has been for over a decade. She is 92. She's been polishing her main book for over a year, maybe two. Hell, maybe three! Generally good advice, but it can paralyze somebody as well. I hear you about backfiring though. I think maybe she doesn't want to publish it, not really, and that is fine with me if that is what she wants. But I thought a taste of publishing, and then surviving the good and the bad in something as ultimately meaningless in the scheme of things as free fanfiction might open up other roads in her head.

**** Wow. She's even older than me! She's even older than my mother! At 92 she could even be the oldest HP fanfiction writer in the world. She'd probably get a following just for that. I'd love to read HP fanfiction by someone of that age. I think it would be really good.

**** If she does dip her toe in the HP fanfiction scene, I would love to read it! I feel like she'd offer a unique view on it.

***** Thanks! It hit me that she is approximately the same age as Voldemort would be. I wonder how she would describe his daily teenage life.

**** - I said fanfiction was "ultimately meaningless" and I meant in the whole scheme of the publishing world. I myself spend enough hours in fan fiction world that it isn't meaningless at all in my world. Publishers are all sorts of confused about self-publishing options and some will punish you if you've gone down that road, but a fan fic under a pseudonym has got to be safe.\\

***** That said, publishing what she has under a pseudonym is also an option. For as long as it is taxed properly it really doesn't matter much what penname she uses to sell her writing to people, and if she doesn't care about income from writing then it matters even less.

** You should update us or post something if she does write fanfiction.
