We've all seen them. The classic wand-holsters; Indy/Dark!Harry's best friend. We can even spot them in a few AUs.

Yet explain to me how an eleven year old child can carry a wand between 9 to 14 inches (23 - 35 cm) long wand on their forearm?

It's even more improbable than carrying a wand in your back pocket and even less useful considering how much it hinders your movement.

I only noticed this when I tried to replicate a holster for my newly acquired wand (and failed) but shouldn't it be more noticeable? Perhaps that's why JK Rowling never included them: not because she didn't have the clairvoyance to think about wand-holsters but she knew they wouldn't work.

Happy New Year and thank you for listening to me rant.


** I think the simple solution would be that the holster has an expansion charm - perhaps tailored/enchanted for your wand accurately, so that the wand doesn't run the entire length of your inner arm. I always thought the flick-your-wrist ones would be cool - like Assassin's Creed wrist knives.

*** It's this. It's Hermione's beaded bag with undetectable expansion charms except smaller with a bit of handle sticking out.

Gesture-based ejection would be tricky and I would avoid it for student-grade holsters.

Edit: or it's just an arm-worn mokeskin pouch.

** If you buy a pair of dragonhide boots or a set of acromantula silk robes, you get a free wand holster to complete your summer Mary Sue ensemble.

Buy now and we'll throw in a magically expanded trunk/apartment and a ring that prevents the Weasleys from drugging you with love potions!

*** I got a good laugh at this, though Fantastic Beasts practically canonized the legendary "travelling manor trunk."

Shrinking charms exist in canon. A holster that's enchanted to shrink itself and the object its holding is quite tame compared to some of the other magic we see. The wand holsters can be cliche, but I like to think that the wizards and witches who are capable have such incredible draw times in canon are because of holsters.

Canon HP is terrible at draw speed compared to the likes of Lupin, Snape, McGonagall etc.

** I agree with a lot of the points, on the other side is you can just use space enlargement charm so the smaller holster holds the whole wand.

I personally would like to see more waist holsters maybe something similar to a gun holster, which I don't think I've seen in any fics. Now I know that sounds really stupid but imo it's really the best not magical way to store a wand. Up your sleeve? It can just fall out easily. Back pocket? Really your foot long wand in a 4 inch pocket. Your front pocket? Basically the same as your back pocket. A pocket inside your robe. Works well but it's hard to access. Hence the waist holster.

*** To be fair some of my pants' front pockets are easily 8-10 inches deep, so big enough for just the handle of a wand to stick out for an easy grab.

But I'm a big dude, that ain't gunna work with a school kid's pants pocket. Although somehow Harry was carrying his around in his back pocket for what? 4-5 years? I think Moody tells him it's a bad idea in OotP.

** If Harry's going to let off a big Expelliarmus, he needs to look cool doing it.

Bad move, Joanne. Bad move.

** I dislike these wandholsters that supposedly allow your wand to appear in your hand by merely willing it to happen. The Harry in my recent story has a pocket in his trousers that allows the wand to be stored. Others carry a sling at their belt where it is stowed in. Or - in case of Hagrid, he sometimes stuffs it into his beard when he's too lazy to put it away.

** Wouldn't the best solution be waist holsters? I have a quiver, and it doesn't seriously hinder movement. If it was strapped to your leg, it wouldn't hinder movement that much. Also, how the hell do they fit a foot long stick in their back pockets! At least have the pockets in the robes.

** just use a couple hair bands or string on your non-dominant arm and pull it out when you need it
