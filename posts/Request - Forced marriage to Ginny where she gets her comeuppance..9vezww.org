Looking for fics where Harry is forced to marry Ginny and it isn't the bed of roses she (and her family)thinks it is going to be.


** There's /Conspiracy./ Bashing involved, of course, preslash (though it's barely there). linkffn(7558470).\\

*** I wan't really looking for smut, but one that Ginny doesn't get the happy ever after she dreamed about since she was little. Loved Conspiracy, one of my favorites which is kind of what set me off on this hunt. I remember another one where she became Harry's second wife, but he only slept with her on her wedding night and she rarely ever saw him. I think that was a Harry/Hermione one.

** Well Greater Than, Lesser Be has all of those elements you requested, but it's not the main focus of the story. Still a fun read though.
