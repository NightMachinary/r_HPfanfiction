And, whether he is a genius, or a self-insert, or something else altogether, Harry does a good job of enriching the British wizarding society from his office. I dunno, maybe he gives out full scholarships around the world for gifted students to attend Hogwarts.

Remember, Harry becomes the minister at the height of his popularity before he evens attends Hogwarts.


** Or do it in fourth year.

"Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fyaah?"

"No, but I did put it in the running to be Minister."

"...What?"

It'd be one hell of a blackballing tool - "Look what the Ministry did to me, putting me in a competition I didn't want to be in! Elect me, and when I survive this tournament, I'll make sure things like this don't happen again."

**** It'd also kinda be in character. He's sassy, morally self-righteous, and rigidly uncompromising. After the shit with Fudge in years two and three, he'd probably leap at the chance to get the dude out of office (and could even be manipulated into it, if that's your narrative preference).

I'd do it, but I already have a hundred and forty-ish other ideas on my list to write and I really don't need more. :D
