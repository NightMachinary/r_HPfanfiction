Linkffn(don't be a dobby downer), an abandoned fic, spawned by [[https://reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5gzk1j/if_dobby_worked_smarter_not_harder/][this prompt]]


** I love that Dumbledore in this fic isn't some bashed, incompetent, asshole who lives to make Harry's life miserable, but he also isn't a loving grandfather figure who wants to fulfill Harry's every whim (although I love those fics too!).

  What if in Book 2 Dobby worked smarter and not harder? Inspired by a reddit prompt. Many thanks to my beta ekb1circloud, who has also contributed a few passages of content as well, I believe that makes him a co-author. I read an entertaining guest review, that made me realize that I have to specify this is an AU.
