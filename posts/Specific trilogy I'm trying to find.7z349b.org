I read it at least 4 years ago and just can't remember much about it. Its called something like "hero's sword" or "hero's destiny" or some such thing. The title shifts after each book to "Hero Something" I think.

So basically the first book is Harry fights and defeats Voldemort (can't remember how) then the second book is him in an alternate reality, then the third is a different universe? Maybe? It escalates after each book. Harry is pretty op after a while...

I really don't remember anything about them :/

At one point in the 3rd (end of 2nd?) book he is in some sort of space river where someone talks to him about his destiny..... Lord I have no idea. Im sorry this is so vague and weird! I've been rereading a lot of my old favorites recently and sort of remembered this series and now it really bugs me that I can't remember ANYTHING except vague discriptions...


** That is by Joe, author of Wastelands of Time, and I believe the first is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero).
