Okay, I have an OC who's Animagus form is a raven colored Thunderbird named Nimbus (wow, I'm sooo imaginitive... if you got a better name I'd love to hear it)

My question is, what color should their lightning be?

My ideas are:

Yellow- because the contrast would he nice as Frank's lightning in Fantastic Beasts was blue/white while he was yellow/gold.

Bronze- because he's a Ravenclaw so he'd be kinda representing the House colors, plus it would still be a nice contrast like with yellow.

And that's pretty much it. If you have any ideas, please comment!

Thor. That way whenever you strike someone with lightning, you can say they weren't worthy.

As for the color, why not red? This way you can potentially work it into a unique spell for your OC

***** Again, too basic. I'd like it to be weird and oddly fitting like the Marauder's names, ya know?

****** Then perhaps you should look into what cultures use Thunderbirds and what they mean. This way you'll get both a weird name that fits, or a combination

** Why not use multiple colors example in the beginning its yellow but the lightning manifests more as sparks, later on, it shifts color depending on the energy put into the lightning lower power yellow low to whatever color you prefer, I would suggest some metallic blue-purple mixture as it is often used to represent powerful lightning in fiction. If you want to use more colors remember that you are in a wizarding environment maybe intermixing certain spells with the lightning is possible. Red lighting if it also uses a Stupify for example.

** Link to fic of possible? The lightning should be emotion based, if they are angry - red, happy - yellow, sad - blue that way you could mix colours, say someone they knows dies it could be a blue red (purple?) Bolt of ligtning
