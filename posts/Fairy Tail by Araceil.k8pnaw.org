Does any one know where to find a copy of /Fairy Tail/ by Araceil ?

Apparently Araceil quit [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and this story is not on the AO3 account.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/iekzjj/looks_like_the_jerks_win_again_araceil_ragequit/]]

wayback machine only has the first 2 chapters:

** I'm the one who posted the reddit topic you linked. Somebody was kind enough to give me [[http://ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=araceil&sort=title][this link]] that contains ebooks for many of Araciel's works, including the original Niffleheim Academy (it's being rewritten and posted on AO3). Make sure you click on either epub or mobi, not on the fic name---that will give you ffn's "story not found" error.

I have a downloaded copy of Fairy Tale in MSWord format. I'll PM you the link.

** Are you sure there were more than two chapters? I don't remember them ever actually finishing a fic.

But to piggyback off of this post, anyone know where to get the rest of Niflheim?

*** The wayback machine says there are fifteen chapters in fairy tail. You can find (most?) of Niflheim Academy [[http://ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=araceil&sort=title][HERE]] however - that edition has 14 chapters at any rate.

You might try their facebook for fairy tail tho.
