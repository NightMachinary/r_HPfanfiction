I have seen many fanfictions where halfbloods are considered as bad as muggleborns by pureblood supremacist. I don't think Purebloods hate halfbloods as much as muggleborns because Snape was a halfblood in slytherin and he seemed to manage well enough there and dumbledore was also a halfblood and highly respected. I think halfbloods must be the most populous group because a pureblood is a witch or wizard with no muggle ancestry, a muggleborn has two muggle parents and halfbloods are basically the rest. When in canon has someones halfblood status been brought up in a negative way except when Bellatrix calls Harry a filthy halblood and she is one of the most fanatic blood purists, please refresh my canon knowledge. In my opinion halfboods can be tolerated or even accepted if they pretend their muggle side doesn't exist. In pureblood circles if you pretend something doesn't exist it doesn't exist that is my headcanon. Lastly I think halfbloods are not a homogenous group a halfblood with one pureblood and one halfblood parent is probably treated differently than one with two muggleborn parents. What are your thoughts?


** To be honest, though I am aware that JKR has said that half-bloods make up the majority of the wizarding population, I think this may be another example of JKR being not great with numbers.

In truth, the magical population should trend towards being pureblood, because even where a Muggle or Muggleborn marries into a magical family, while their kids will be considered half-blood, their grandkids will be pure-blood. So any "dilution" of blood is self-correcting within 2 generations. For a large part of the magical population to be half-blood, there would need to be many more magical-Muggle marriages or many more Muggleborns than we see in canon.

*** It depends on what definition you are using many only accept those of no muggle heritage as purebloods.

** I think while halfbloods are not considered as great a pure bloods: if they have the skills it helps thier position in society.

Snape was a master at potions and even Volde accepted Snape enough to trust him at least slightly.

It would also depend on the magical parent. If they came from a high rank family, they would probably be better regarded then a no name or low rank family. The family name would command some respect.

*** Voldy trusted Snape a startling amount for such a paranoid person.

**** My suspicion is he probably saw a lot of his own traits in Snape and recognized them. As much as fanon likes to /claim/ he's an idiot and self absorbed lunatic he shows a pretty strong and cohesive level of self awareness and how people tick in the books.

Voldemort, Snape, and Harry all have relatively similar backgrounds and traits and he repeatedly sets his plans in action based on that.

***** I definitely agree that he is not an idiot. He's intelligent, but still misguided, something that was pretty unavoidable after his upbringing, if you could even call it that. I think you're right that him seeing so many of his own characteristics in Snape, as well as the similar backgrounds they had, was a major contributing factor in his trust of the man. Another would have to be Snape's apparently magnificent skill in occlumency and his ability to project nothing but trust and loyalty towards Voldemort in a believable way. Still, he's so paranoid in other areas that I wonder whether Snape was manipulating him in some other sneaky, underhanded way to maintain that level of trust.

**** I thought he trusted Snape that much because Snape was an excellent Occlumens and Voldemort didn't see anything other than loyalty in Snape. I'm sure many other Death Eaters at least had SOME doubt, or fear, or greater loyalty than to Voldemort in them, and Voldemort could see that.

So, his trust was maybe nothing more than misplaced confidence in his own Legilimency skills.

***** I reckon you're fairly on the money there. It is at least a great contributing factor.

** Would Hagrid and Flitwick be considered half-bloods? Or Fleur?
