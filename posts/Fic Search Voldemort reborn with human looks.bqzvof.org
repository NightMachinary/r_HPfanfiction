:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Additional stuff I remember:

- Riddle's side of the war isn't evil - I think it was more of a "don't keep secret/keep secret from the muggles" thing
- Harry is not sure which side to take
- In the first war, Lily Evans was involved in torching a village
- McGonnagal convinces Riddle/DE to stop killing Muggles

Maybe Regulus is alive & openly displays his Dark Mark in one scene within the Death Eater village.

Thanks for the help, I searched all my archives but I cannot find it anywhere.

Also: yay, first post.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
