:END:
For Voldemort, it would be killing purebloods, then crying for lost blood.\\
For Harry, it will be moral panic from taking a life.\\
For Dumbledore, it would be cutting off opportunities for redemption.\\
In case of time travel, foreknowledge of lifes that will have to be lost.\\
For example, Harry crying (blood) during sorting because the hat tells him that he will have to kill again.\\
Hit me with over the top drama!
