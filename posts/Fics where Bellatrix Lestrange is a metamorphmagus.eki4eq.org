Imagine that you are Alice Longbottom babysitting Neville when Bellatrix Lestrange ( who assumed the appearance of Frank Longbottom) lures her to a Death-Eater safe house where she sees the real Frank Longbottom was being cruciated by the Lestranges and Barty Crouch Jr. It will be quite terrifying, I must admit and I like the idea of the Death-Eaters having their own metamorphmagus.


** Or they ended up swapping entirely and the real Bellatrix is insane in Saint Mungos as a Longbottom while the crazy-Azkaban-Bellatrix is really a Longbottom that went mad too.
