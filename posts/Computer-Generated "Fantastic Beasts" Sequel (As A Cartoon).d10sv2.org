Episode 3 of my webseries /Robot News/ (wherein I use the Grover neural network to generate false news articles based on outlandish titles) ended up having very surprising revelations about the next film in the /Fantastic Beasts/ franchise! Behold the Five Noses of Dumbledore, Jude Law as Grindelwald (oh, I wish) and... a new franchise about Newt's baby son?
