Looking for fan fictions where harry is constanstly studying or training to be the best. It Can be WBHL or neglected harry. Would just like to see a harry who applies himself.

Example would be [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10831723/1/]]


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Claw of the Raven) Is a pretty under rated series, I really liked all the pureblood culture and it has a very studious bookish harry, who meditates every single day for his magic and other stuff like that, I think what puts alot of people of is the extremely helpful goblins at the beginning but its not that prominent after the first couple of chapters, and also it gets off to a slow start but picks up a lot after the first book. It is also a pretty short series two of the books are 50,000 words one is 100,000 and the last is like 250,000 plus. Pretty sure it is exactly what you are looking for. Its a 4 part series by the way. And it is complete

  When a more studious Harry Potter entered Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming. A Ravenclaw Harry story. Warning: child abuse, character bashing, and pureblood society.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** This one's got a Ravenclaw Harry and from what I've read so far, it's implied he could be just as, or smarter, than Hermione. I don't know if you like humour, (it is the funniest fanfic I've read to date) but here it is:

Linkffn(Flowers for Harry)

Even if I did follow politics and had some groundings with which to be offended I really don't understand how that should have wounded me. Why would you assume I'm a "high society ponce" and a "liberal" based on the fact that I, personally, did not nor ever should find that fic /humorous/.

I would hate to be /depulsoed/ from the community so I won't aggressively respond to that comment, beyond what I've said, as I'm sure you desire me too. I should report you, but as this is the internet that would literally solve nothing. For the sake of humanity I hope you aren't as easily offended in the future. Grow up.

Think, for just a moment, about the words you have so callously thrown at me. Think, for just a fraction of your existence, about what you say before you say it. The internet is permanent. The insults you hurl at someone might make them /snap/. That person you pound on for being weak and a "loser" could be the most vindictive person on the planet - or someone easily driven to suicide.

You don't matter to me. I have no personal connection to you, I don't know who you are and I don't care enough about you to dig through your history to find out.

I attempted to share my /opinion/, something we - as people of the internet - are allowed to do. You tried to shoot me down while I left, after inquiring about why I disliked the fic. I told you, gave you what /you/ wanted, and you berated me for it while making it seem like it was all my /fault/.

Think, for just a second, about your choices in life. If your not here because it's a part of it - then: /Go. Away./

** I posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/62yua6/request_fics_where_harry_is_more_studiouspowerful/][a request thread]] a few days ago with a similar premise.

My favorite fic recced there was linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff), which had a Harry that was more studious in an interesting way, and I myself found linkffn(3446796), which didn't feature this prominently, but definitely more so than canon.
