I know it would be hard since most of them really are cardboard villians in the original, but it's frustrating if you are trying to take the universe seriously to some extend that there are so many recurring characters in canon and fanon whose personalities and deeper motivations are never shown. And I don't mean stories where they just suddenly see the light for no special reason and become kind and compassionate either.

I'm talking about the Dursleys (especially Dudley), Malfoys, Blacks, even Snape or Pettigrew. What do you think? Were they born unfeeling idiots? Where they only motivated by greed and arrogance? Did they ever question themselves or regret what they did? (Except for Snape, of course, but I do find his behavior inexplicable at times, too.) Was there maybe a reason why they felt so strongly against those they considered beneath them other than their parents' influence?


** I'm working on a story in which Greyback is more developed (although not more human of course.) I see him as racist, seeing the world as humans vs. werewolves. He's doing the right thing by his own moral code, fighting for his people, believing Voldemort's promise that a Death Eater regime will treat werewolves better than the current regime. Much of the villainy in the original series is based on racism or prejudice of some sort. People are really susceptible to being racist. When young children are taught to be racist, they really don't have any defense against absorbing those beliefs.

*** Personally I think it's very hard to understand Greyback, except if he was just a born psychopath. The problem with racist werewolves is that they were all born human until they were bitten, you see, and I can't help but expect that they all wished they never had been bitten. The transformation is described as being very painful and werewolves are shunned by society even though most of the time they are still normal humans, no matter what anybody thinks. That means that it should be hard to learn and like the pain at full moon and it's not possible for them to live as animals either. No matter how I look at it it strikes me as very weird that anybody could embrace being a werewolf, or other werewolves who caused their suffering in the first place. Unless, of course, he just started hating anybody who did not suffer from the same predicament as himself and had a happier life and just wished ill upon every person who was allowed to be human. I guess it's a very common problem, hating others for having what you do not, but it's also a gruesome line of thought to follow...

People embrace awful things all the time, saying it's for the best. It's sour grapes. And resentment of people who have what we don't have is extremely common. The difference between Greyback's monstrosity and ordinary human foibles is a matter of degree, not of kind.

***** Ah but I was confused about the racist and raised in a way from childhood part of what you said. Do you think he never knew the life of a human and was bitten at a very young age? It is possible of course... I do wonder about his followers though, it seemed to me that most werewolves either kept themselves out of the war or followed him. But the idea that the discriminated and shunned would unite with those who caused their problems in the first place seemed a bit weird to me. Surely they couldn't all have been bitten as young children, I don't see how most of them could survive, living as outcasts and savages. I don't even know how Remus managed to survive, to be honest, and he might have been the luckiest of them all...

****** He may have been bitten young and then raised by werewolves, or he may have been bitten later and developed his hatred of humans after his human friends and family shunned him.

Werewolves are outcast from human society, so I assume they band together with each other, forming insular little enclaves where their hatred of humans intensifies in an echo chamber. Wolves live in packs.

If Voldemort presented himself as the alternative to the status quo, I can see desperate werewolves falling for that. The Ministry, the Order, and even Dumbledore didn't openly support werewolf rights. Dumbledore allowed exactly one werewolf into his school, only as long as he stayed closeted. To Greyback, Voldemort seemed like the best of a bad set of options.

******* I understand where you are coming from, but there was barely any information provided in canon about werewolves except that they live isolated from society in so called packs, are shunned and discriminated, and the transformations are very painful. And we get Remus Lupin as an (and possibly the only) example of a werewolf who tries to live as a normal person. Everything else can be speculated.

I guess it's reasonable to suppose that Greyback at least likes to attack children, no other hints of werewolves generally liking children better were given in canon. I guess they will have to stay close to the homes of children before they transform since they would probably not be able of conscious thought. Wouldn't the families of the children be alarmed though I wonder, since there will be screaming and howling?

No we aren't told in canon that being a werewolf is in any way beneficial to the werewolves. I think that most supremacist groups have some flawed reason for their way of thinking, mainly that their group used to be above the others during some period of time in history. Werewolves seem to have always been hated and shunned, even Greyback wouldn't receive proper death eater treatment, it's so weird be should align himself with those who are even more bigot than the average wizard.

I really have difficulty imagining the outcasts of society, sitting in caves or hiding in forests, barely surviving by hunting and collecting I guess, and stealing and robbing, with hardly a day where they are not hungry, no proper clothes, no access to medicine or healing of any kind, freezing half to death every winter, feeling that their way of living was superior... And that the pain and humiliation they suffer was a gift... Imagine after the transformation, whether they wake up in a place with no way of even knowing where they are and more have to hide, possibly naked, from muggles and wizards alike? I get the part where they might have stopped thinking of themselves as humans though. However that's just what they are 29 days of every month, completely mundane and normal human beings...

I guess you can live well enough off stolen goods for a limited period of time, but years and years? And you would have to keep moving I guess because Muggles are also able to notice it when people steal from them constantly. Do you think they lived in large packs? Mostly I believe they would distrust each other and also want to hide out of shame. Some of them might dislike others who try to live with magic like humans, don't you think? Others might not have been properly educated at all. In my imagination their lives are very hard and it doesn't help that they have no access to medicine, imagine them hurting each other during the moon...

I think Voldemort just wanted to use the more violent creatures to hurt his opponents and honestly do not believe for a moment that any of them would have had a better life under his reign, he might even have gotten rid of them altogether once the time was ripe...

** You might like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4799264/1/Blind-Faith][Blind Faith]]. It's a Bellatrix POV fic that explores 'off-screen moments' from the time that Bellatrix escapes Azkaban through book 6. (Contrary to the fic's misleading blurb, it's not a romance or smut fic.) In my opinion the author does a great job keeping the Death Eaters in-character while showing the human moments of them recovering from Azkaban, caring about their families, etc. The fic doesn't excuse or romanticize their terrible choices, but it does show how they are able to think of themselves as being in the right.

** u/Hellstrike:
#+begin_quote
  What do you think? Were they born unfeeling idiots? (...) Did they ever question themselves or regret what they did?
#+end_quote

No, but I think Rowling accidentally wrote a lot of things she did not intend to. Just look at Malfoy during the sixth year. A boy forced to work for Voldemort under the threat of death. His attempts are blunderous and in the end, he cannot kill Dumbledore. Sounds fairly redeemable, right?

Except, there are those things called Hague and Geneva Convention which regulates what constitutes a war crime, and Malfoy breaks it repeatably.

Article 23 of the Hague Convention states

#+begin_quote
  In addition to the prohibitions provided by special Conventions, it is especially forbidden

  (a) To employ poison or poisoned weapons;

  (b) To kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army;

  (...)

  (f) To make improper use of a flag of truce, of the national flag or of the military insignia and uniform of the enemy, as well as the distinctive badges of the Geneva Convention;
#+end_quote

Malfoy breaks 23a and 23b twice and 23f every day he is at Hogwarts (unless he was to openly wear Death Eater regalia or showcase his Dark Mark for some reason). Each day he works on the Vanishing cabinet is a war crime. His attack on Katie is a war crime because he is polyjuiced to look like some girl (and due to 23a,b). [[https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/german-commandos-captured-american-uniform-1944/][And while Rowling definitely did not know this, violators of 23f are usually shot within days]]. And it gets even worse/better. Take a look at Article 3 of the Geneva Convention (1949)

#+begin_quote
  (1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria.

  To this end the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons:

  (a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture;
#+end_quote

Guess what his attack on Katie also was.

And that is just one example. Dumbledore's "ten dark years" confession robbed his character of any benevolence, Snape's treatment of his students is criminal and inexcusable (and the "it's to maintain his cover" argument is simply bullshit because it assumes a moronic Dumbledore and Voldemort to work). Hell, Ron mind-raping his driving instructor is another of those character-ruining scenes Rowling just threw in for no apparent reason.

Edit:

That is not to say that Draco is born evil. You can definitely redeem him, but it needs to diverge before the Buckbeak episode (and preferably before the Mudblood incidents). He does not need to change overnight then, but you can make him question things from there on. And he still needs to have flaws. For example, just because he no longer sees Hermione as vermin, that does not mean he suddenly likes the Weasleys. He might even still hate Hermione, just not for her parentage.

After the attack on Katie, it has to be life in prison or you are insulting justice. Coercion is no defence for attempted murder and neither that nor war crimes exclude 16-year-olds from being punished.

You forgot that Draco actually casts the Imperius curse on Rosemerta. She's held under it for several months. But that's alright, both Harry and Dumbledore can /forgive/ him for that. The attempts he makes endanger Ron's, Katie's and Slughorn's lives, as well as all of the students living in the castle at the time as his attempts are so wild that anyone could have taken the place of Ron, or Katie.

#+begin_quote

I disagree - it can diverge even after he takes the Dark Mark. Yes, I know, being a part of a criminal organisation is a crime in itself, as is the conspiracy to commit murder, but the redemption can still happen after he gets tortured for the first time, or sees his parents punished for his blunders. Redemption does not always have to be redemption in the eyes of the law.

Pretty sure most of the downvotes were for being way offtopic and Rule 8 of the sub. Hellstrike probably would have gotten less downvotes if he had actually made a fic recommendation, considering this is a fic request thread.

Rule 8:

  Request threads are for recommendations. Fic Searches are for finding a specific fic. Make a discussion thread if you want to express your opinions about the thing being requested. Flair accordingly.

OP asked for fics in which antagonists from the books are portrayed as "realistic and human", and then clarified that they are not looking for redemption fics. Then OP gave some example questions that a fic might answer to provide motives and background that humanize a character without necessarily redeeming them.

Hellstrike's response was his standard "Death Eaters are irredeemable magical nazis, don't even try" which rather misses the point of OP's post entirely. His later edit brought his comment slightly more on topic, but still misses the point that OP wasn't asking for characters to be redeemed.

***** Make an escape, Shawshank style. Or be released after the jail term is done, whichever.

Not sure what a lifer is in Britain, but in my country, a lifer can be reduced to 14 years depending on various factors involved with the case.
