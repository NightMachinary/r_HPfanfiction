Most of the stories are categories/genres that I don't care about. Eg Hermione with draco or snape, harry with other males, etc. With the ones that I read that are on the list I agree that I enjoyed them but not sure I would say they are the best.

*** I'm ok with Harmony /in principle/, but picky about it. Any suggestion that Harry and Hermione were actually attracted to each other in canon and just didn't show it - especially Harry being attracted to Hermione - puts me off, because it just isn't so. We get seven years of seeing inside Harry's head and he very much didn't think of her romantically. He didn't get distracted by her, or jealous of her dating, and he didn't confide in her or otherwise treat her like the most important person in his world.

Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire pulls it off well, IMO, with their relationship gradually growing from his loyalty to her throughout the Triwizard Tournament. And there are AUs with background Harmony, like Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider, that don't need to justify it because it's usually off screen. Many others haven't impressed me, though.

Any suggestions?

****** Well, some people really dislike that version of Harry. And that's ok, because yes he does have flaws and make mistakes, and they do come back to bite him multiple times.

Most people will admit that the antagonist is impressive, though. And objectively, the fact that it's long, complete, and has very few spelling or grammar errors means that it's already above the FFN average.

But mostly, I'd suggest that you read it just to decide for yourself if you like it or not. It has strong appeal to some kinds of reader, but it's not to everyone's taste.

Also, I suggest the alternate introduction, linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR), which expands the first four chapters and puts Harry's interaction with his parents into a bit more context.

Majority of my knowledge of Harry Potter comes from fanfic and research. I research to an extreme to make sure my work is faithful to the Harry Potter world. Combined with how religiously verisimilitudinous the fiction I write is, it's a big part of the reason why I take so long to update. That being said, it is entirely possible to write good fanfic without reading the source material.

I, too, admitted to the readers that I never read the source material. I'm grateful that a lot of reviewers and fans offered to send me their ebooks of Harry Potter because I'm missing out, not because I'm missing something in my story.

*********** I've never understood this argument. Harry throws childish tantrums because he's literally a child. He has the intelligence and knowledge of a well-read adult, but lacks the experience to use his abilities wisely. There's a piece in one of the closing chapters where Harry looks back on his actions throughout the story and realizes what a colossal idiot he's been.

You can make an argument about Harry's attitude making the story unenjoyable, or about the resolution not meriting the ~100 chapters it took to get there, and that would be fair. But if you think the author is holding up chapter 10 Harry as a model for all things good I would say you've badly misunderstood the story. By the end it's abundantly clear that the reader was never meant to agree with Harry's actions every step of the way.

***** Ugh, now you reminded of another fic where Hermione got stuck as a cat in second year and became orgasmic from Harry stroking her tail and scratching her ears. Gaah... Now I have to drink. Again. But yeah, when you put it this way there is plenty of cringe to go around for everyone.

Happy cake day, btw.
