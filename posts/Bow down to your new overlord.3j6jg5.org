Just kidding. I'm elated to have received the honor to be a mod for this subreddit! I really look forward to the things we can do.

I love this community, and I love fanfiction, and I truly hope I can be a worthy mod for this amazing subreddit.

I'll gladly take suggestions (for the bot and otherwise), answer questions, etc - AMA!


** Bow down, bow down\\
Before the power of Tusing\\
or be crushed, be crushed\\
by...\\
his jolly bot of doooom!

Congratulations and well-wishings. Why is your name 'Tusing'?

*** Premium bot service. So, you get access to this bot where if you type linkffn and then the name of a fanfic on FFN.net, it'll link it below your comment!

And it's free of charge!!

** Hey, grats on the "promotion" :) What kind of fanfiction do you usually read? As a fan of entirely OC-based stories (AQ, Anguis), life can be tough - not nearly enough content to go around :(
