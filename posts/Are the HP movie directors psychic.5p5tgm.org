Watching the epilogue of DH Part 2, did the producers see the future as, when the characters head to the portal, on the right was a Virgin Train, one of their Mk3 sets.

In 2017, Virgin Trains run services to...Kings Cross...using Mk3 Train carriages...

Is it just pure luck or did are they a Seer like Trelawney?


** They hire people specifically for continuity sometimes. It was deliberate, I'm certain.
