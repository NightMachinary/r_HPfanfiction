Hi! So I recently read a fic where Neville and Hermione were together but they weren't really the focus of the story but they were so cute and adorable and I would REALLY love if anyone could recommend fics of those two. I haven't found any on my own


** Neville and Hermione are together in linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) but they're a secondary pairing and it doesn't happen for a while so I'm not sure if it fits what you're looking for.

** I've seen a couple of unrequited Neville/Hermione fics (Neville being the one with feelings for the other), but no fics where it's mutual. I think this is actually the only ship where I've only seen it done as an unrequited love.

** I realize I reccomend this fic fairly frequently or maybe it just seems that way because most of the time when I make a comment, its about this one but Second Chances has Neville/Hermione with Harry/Daphne. It has some bashing. Mainly Dumbledore. Linkffn(Second Chances)
