*Introduction*

Hey guys, I want to try something, and that would be to create a fanfiction about Ilvermorny, the American version of Hogwarts. However, since characters have not been given, only the founder and her husband, along with some of the kids and the Four Houses.

I want you guys to help me with creating characters, they can be male, female, Professor, Headmaster/Headmistress or you can even help create some places and or names. Along with what happens in the area.

I know J.K has started it, however, I am not to sure what is happening with it.

If you are contributing, maybe create some backstory for the character, brief history of family, quirks and looks. Please try to tie everything in to how J.K sets it out. Although it mentions that Muggles can't see it, I am hoping they can still be accepted.

I just want to thank everyone before hand for reading this and contributing if you did so. Oh, and try to keep everything to America or the surrounding area, as the school is based in America, but accepts nearly everyone. Some diversity is always appreciated.

*I want to make everyone know that I am not doing this for money or anything like that. I am just being someone who wants to do this for fun. If it happens to be made a thing in the near future, then I take zero credit for it.*


** Professor Larelle Robins, 39 years old, is a halfblood. She grew up in a working class family in one of the few New Hampshire Wizarding communities. She has dark brown hair and medium brown skin. Her mom is Hispanic and her father was a wizard who emigrated from Britain. She's right handed. She was from Horned Serpent in Ilvermorny, and she teaches Charms.

If she had gone to Hogwarts, she would have been in either Slytherin or Ravenclaw. She very much wants her students to succeed but can forget sometimes that not all of them have masteries in charms like she does, and her second favorite subject is potions. She's a distant (veeeery distant) relative of the Fawleys in Britain.

She has an 18 year old niece named Amanda who moonlights as her teaching assistant. And she absolutely hates chocolate. Her wand is 12.5 inches, beechwood, with a unicorn tail hair core. Feel free to characterize her as you like :)
