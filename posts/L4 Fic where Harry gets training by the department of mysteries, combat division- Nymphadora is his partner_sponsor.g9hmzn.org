:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Nymphadora basically recruits Harry to join the DoM and he goes through crazy training. Each member of these combat squads gets bars in different areas to indicate their ability - bars for healing, bars for power, and Harry earns full black bars for his ability with unforgivable curses.

They test Harry(masked) for accuracy and power and he impresses a lot of the veterans with his power when the training instructor makes Harry angry.

Looking for that specific story, but if anyone has recommendations that have similar plots with DoM secret training they'd be more than welcome as well.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer of Change by lorddwar) is what you're looking for.
