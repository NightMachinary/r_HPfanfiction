Hi,

I read some time ago a fic where the soul fragment in Harry's scar merges with Lily's protection (who's sentient) after a discussion between them as Lily wants Harry to live because she loves him and the fragment doesn't want to disappear by Harry dying so they reach some kind of accord where they merge. This makes some sort of new protection which is partially as ruthless as Voldemort but tempered by Lily's love and bent to protect Harry. I'm not sure but there was something in the title or the summary about "terrible love" (not exact quote, more like a concept). I can't find this story anymore. Does anyone knows how it's called?

Thanks


** I think it might be Samsara by Countess Millarca linkffn(12415212), it talks about great and terrible love in the summary.

  Because Tom Riddle and Lily Potter were brilliant. Harry James Potter wakes up on his eighth birthday knowing terrible, great love. Ravenclaw Harry, soul-merging.

  The blood protection inside of Harry blocked His killing curse and burned His host body to ashes, yet failed to stop His soul from entering his body? Oh wait, it didn't! Harry's blood protection fights against Voldemort's soul and something new is created...a new soul and companion. Harry thinks it is unfair that she doesn't have a body of her own...well he is going to change that!
