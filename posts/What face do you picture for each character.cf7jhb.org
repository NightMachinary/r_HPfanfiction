When you're reading or writing, what face do you picture for your characters?

For example, Dumbledore is the generic long bearded old guy so Richard Harris and Michael Gambon both work.

But what about characters with less parts like Greengrass, Bones, Abbott, and Davis?

Hannah Abbott I always pictured Melody Kay, she was the girl who was Mudd's friend/love interest in Camp Nowhere: [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0443139/mediaviewer/rm1845637888]]

For whatever reason, I missed the boat on Daphne being blonde, I had always heard ice queen but maybe the Slytherin= dark thing I always thought of someone with dark hair, I thought of like a bitchy Katie Holmes, basically if Joey from Dawson's Creek was a snob.

Susan Bones I always thought was a nerd but could be cute. Strawberry blondish, maybe sort of a Molly Ringwald thing going on?

And as great Natalie Tena is, always seemed almost too mature looking to be Tonks if that makes sense. I know she's really probably close to the right age for when she played Tonks, but her face just seems more grown up and less juvenile than I would've expected from Tonks. I always thought of someone with a more expressive face, like Julia Stiles-ish, around the days of Save the Last Dance.

** - *Harry* was typically Dan, but lately I've been thinking that Timothée Chalamet could've done a nice job as him too, since he's got the same dark haired twink look that I imagine canon!Harry having. If Harry's portrayed as a big, manly dude then it's Henry Cavill. He's a like a shy, hairy brick house, that one.
- When it comes to *Dumbledore*, if he's good then he's gotta be Sir Ian McKellen... so literally just Gandalf, I think he's got the perfect mix between funny, adorable grandpa and BAMF down to a T. If he's bad or ambiguous then I just go with Gambon.
- *Daphne* is /always/ young Jennifer Connelly.
- I saw The Mummy (1999) for the first time a year ago and ever since then I can't stop thinking of Rachel Weisz as adult *Hermione*, and I don't care what anyone says. If the author insists on the character being ugly or bland looking then I go with Emma lmao. If I feel particularly stupid, I like to imagine her as a big african dude wearing female clothes and a bushy wig, like Terry Crews or something. I mean JKR /did/ give us license for that.
- *Shacklebolt* is Samuel L. Jackson because of course he fucking is.

*** Yeah, I think the actor who played Kingsley did a really solid job, but I also think there are a few more famous actors who could have been good.

Laurence Fishburne is one example - if he were a little darker skinned (cause I imagine Kingsley as very dark, likely because of the movies and the African style dress he wears) he'd bring the perfect amount of power, gravitas, and the cool calm and collected style I associate with Kingsley.

Sam Jackson is a bit too active, too excited, for him to be the cool as ice Shack, but he'd still do a bloody good job.

A more muscular Adrian Lester would also be good, but that's just cause I <3 Adrian Lester.

** I picture Daphne Greengrass with long, straight blonde hair and icy blue eyes. 'Classically beautiful', but with a stuck-up expression; Susan Bones to me has red hair, closer to auburn than ginger, with a more down-to-earth and kind face, looks fun to hang out with; I imagine Hannah Abbott as having a 'girl nextdoor'-type charm, with an open, honest face and a smile. She'd have straw-blonde hair, probably braided or in a ponytail; Tracy Davis looks a bit plain and unremarkable, with short chestnut-brown hair and brown eyes, but having that cute charm excitable people have.

My impressions of these characters are completely shaped by fanfiction though, I don't think I pictured them at all when I had only read the books.

** I consistently picture hermione as black or with a dark complexion. And with hair like Alexandra Kingston.

Edit:

Just a note, Broadway producers also thought Hermione could be portrayed by a woman of color. Noma Dumezweni

And JKR too: [[https://amp.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/05/harry-potter-jk--rowling-black-hermione]]

 “I had a bunch of racists telling me that because Hermione ‘turned white' -- that is, lost colour from her face after a shock -- that she must be a white woman, which I have a great deal of difficulty with. But I decided not to get too agitated about it and simply state quite firmly that Hermione can be a black woman with my absolute blessing and enthusiasm.”

I'm in no way implying that downvotes = racism.

*** I would have had no issue with a Black Hermione, except that JK very clearly had absolutely 0 intention of her being non-white until several years after the series had been concluded, at which point she decided to say "even though literally every non-white character has their skin colour explicitly mentioned - one of the quidditch girls (Angelina? Alicia?), Dean, Shack etc - and even though I described the physical looks of Hermione dozens of times over 7 books, then oversaw the casting for the movies, and never once mentioned or even hinted that she might be anything other than white, she could be non white! I never explicitly said "Hermione is white"!"

​

Which is nonsense. It's more shoehorning in diversity for the plaudits without bothering to actually include it. She feels bad that she wrote an overwhelmingly straight and white cast, so she's retconning things that either directly contradict the books or, in the case of Hermione, almost contradict them.

That, in and of itself, forces me to hate the idea of Black Hermione, on principle. At least with her "Anthony Goldstein was Jewish all along" there's some reason to believe that given that she gave him the most stereotypical Jewish name possible (short of Shlomo Shekelberg).

**** If never explicitly say a character is white is all it take to make him black, most of Harry Potter casting is black.

From what I remember, Rowling always explicitly say when he character was non white (the Patil Twins, Cho Chang, Angelina, even Zabini . . .), which let people assume : no explicit color = white.

The only exception to this rule may be to the really pale character (like the weasleys?) where she say they are pale, which can be assumed as white.

​

Anyways, my problem with Black Hermione always been Rowling response. Some musical producer decided to cast a black Hermione (because she really was the best, or they wanted to be "progressive", or their is a law that forced their hands, I don't care), so people began to talk/ complain about it.

And while Rowling should have stayed pretty neutral with something like "I didn't picture Hermione as Black when I wrote it, but it doesn't mean she can't be played by one and I'm excited to see this representation", which could have killed the thing before it began. She decide to appeal the minority community and said "I never said she was white".

​

In fanfic, the ones I read are the one where her color is irrevelant, so I don't care about it.

***** Exactly. Character descriptions do not exist in a vacuum. If you explicitly state the ethnicity of all non-white characters, then wait several years, then claim that it's possible for there to be a non-white Hermione, then you are saying that you wrote an entire series of books and only wrote ONE non-white character who you didn't bother to say was even possibly non-white until the series had been finished for years, and that it was a main character.

Which is bizarre and stupid.

As you say, she could have said "Hermione was white, but that's not central enough to her character for a change to be negative. Go ahead and write Black, Brown or Blue Hermione, that's valid."

But instead she said "no she could have been Black, even though that would mean I chose to write her with less detail than every other non-white character in all 7 books, and keep silent about her ethnicity for years!"

One is a good message from an author who respects their fans and is happy to see their mistakes/decisions (like minimal diversity) fixed or altered in a positive way.

The other is the desperate brownie point begging of someone resting on their laurels and totally believing all of their own hype, unable to accept even the hint that they might have done something less than perfectly.

** I'm more interested in fan art as a way of reflecting my visual sense of a character. Using real actors yanks it out of the realm of the imagination for me and ties it to unrealistically pretty models or movie standards of appearance, which clash with my own versions of the characters. (Needless to say, I'm not a fan of the movies. Both Harris and Gambon fail as Dumbledore, especially Gambon.) Whereas fan art lets me point to different interpretations that come close to how I visualize them. For example, here are three different Snapes, all of which feel true to him in ways Rickman doesn't:
