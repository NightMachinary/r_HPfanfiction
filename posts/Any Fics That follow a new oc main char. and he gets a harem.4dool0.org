I would love if anyone has some good recommendations for a original main char set in the harry potter universe with a romance progressed harem(Bonus points if its got Hermione, Ginny, or Hanna) IF there is none with A OC then with harry but in a new story line.

*The longer the better.

*** Yes but what I'm looking in that one is far and few so instead of putting a edit in my other post and only getting a few people to see the new request I made a new post.

** So, you're looking for a story with what is probably a thinly veiled Self-Insert where the SI/author bangs all the girls in canon. Reddit, you never fail to disappoint.
