Hi, I'm looking for a fan fiction I read a long long time ago, in fact I read it when HPANA was still around but it was about Lily and James. I don't remember a lot from it so hopefully the info I can provide helps me.. but they were in college and they had become roommates, I honestly don't remember if there magic involved or not, but I remember one part of the story were James was watching lily while she was on the computer and she was wearing a sweater, maybe glasses? and he thought it was really beautiful.. I don't know that one part of the story always stuck with me haha but they do end up sleeping together.

That's about the extent of specifics that I remember, maybe as time goes on I will remember more and can update this post, but thank you for any help!
