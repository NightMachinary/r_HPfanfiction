Harry (more or maybe others if you want). End up becoming shrunk. Can be because of a Potions accident or another reason. Harry and/or whoever it is who gets shrunk has to learn to live like this until a cure is found.

Note it doesn't have to be Harry.


** Well, honestly why not have it be a ron storyline

he works at a Joke shop after returning as an auror after all

he could have brought his kids to the shops backroom one day

** People getitng shrunk happens often in my story "The Granger Principle" - they use Shrinking Potions several times to infiltrate areas or escape, although they don't get stuck like that for long.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.
