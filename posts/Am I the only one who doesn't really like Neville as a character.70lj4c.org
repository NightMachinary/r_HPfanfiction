Title. I don't know what it is but whenever I see him included in a fic as a major character I kinda groan internally.


** Neville is an awesome character. He's like the Magikarp of the Potterverse; he's weak to start with but if you work patiently with him he evolves into awesome.

Ofcourse, this metamorphosis is hard to portray. Sometimes he gets stuck as a Margikarp, sometimes he evolves into an OP legendary instead of a Gyarados. It can get annoying, but I really love Neville's character so I usually don't mind.

** Neville is actually one of those characters that I'm pretty indifferent to overall. When written well, he can be interesting, but otherwise I just don't really care about him one way or another.

I understand the feeling of disliking a character it seems like everyone else liked though. I have a, perhaps irrational, dislike of Remus Lupin.

*** Remus is generally treated like Draco - people have created an image in their heads that has very little to do with the actual character. His tragic backstory certainly generates sympathy, but his actions from 1981 all the way to his death showcase one blunder after another. Viewing only the canon facts, it doesn't paint a pretty picture about his character.

** If you think of Harry Potter series as an RPG, Neville is the most generic NPC possible - start with a seemingly weak boy, yada yada yada, get a BAMF. Only, JK fucked up the yada x3 part. Neville's character deserved to be fleshed out a lot more.

** One of my favorite characters actually. I can really relate to him a lot. Him and Luna were always some of my favorite characters. (Along with Severus Snape but never mind that now).

I just love those kind of characters that's socially shy and then becomes a badass which Neville does, I mean heck he killed Nagini which was awesome! Wish he had been the one to kill Bellatrix, but hey we have Molly to thank for that!

** I agree with you. I like him in canon but in fanfic he's usually accompanied by Weasley and Dumbledore bashing, noble and ancient houses and "pureblood politics".

** I hate Neville myself. He's passive and a scared all the time, forgetful, he's the only person besides Ron with a shitty pet, and he's usually badly written. I don't like when Harry befriends Neville and I hate fics where he gets with Luna who in my mind is Harry's best match.

** He's one of my favourite characters in canon. In fanfiction it's annoying when Indy!Harry rejects Ron to be bffs with Neville.

** Neville starts off as an incredibly passive character with occasional flashes of potential. I don't like passive protagonists so I dislike him as a main- except when it's AU enough that Alice or Frank raised him. Usually those Nevilles are written as far more confident characters and thus more interesting to me.
