  That sacrifice - you know which one I'm talking about - was one of the most tearful and powerful moments I've ever experienced in fiction.
#+end_quote

Damn yes it was. One could even liken it to what Lily did, which is powerful indeed.

Now, getting back onto the topic (because the topic is not “let's promote that story with Milo”), there is something like that but not exactly in “The Substitute” (already linked), and likewise with “The Stages of Hope” (linkffn(6892925)) though in this case you do know that the character is sacrificial from the beginning and the fic explores this ... you've likely already read them both, however, because they're quality stuff.

Other than this, I know that Darth Marrs's “Harry Potter and the Four Founders” has this happen, though the fic is a harem one so your mileage may vary on how much you could even enjoy it which is why I'm not linking it. Oh ... “Coexistence” (linkffn(1097925)) has this, plus some assorted fluff in case you want other feels too. Plus it's a fic where you are likely to actually cheer on [[/spoiler][Peter and Severus ... as people, folks, not as a couple]]. I think that's all I have, at least as far as a sacrifice of this kind that isn't more or less a copy-paste of the canon one goes.

** It's been awhile since I've read it, which chapter is the sacrifice in?

Anyway, there's always linkffn(Saving Connor), but Harry has been conditioned to be sacrificial since babyhood, and it's not necessarily well written....I so far haven't made it through year three despite several attempts.

*** *SPOILERS*

End of chapter 52, when Milo gains the strength to create his own backstory. Milo could have created a backstory where his mother died to protect him, thus saving him from Voldemort, but instead, he made a beautiful backstory for his mother and family, thus bringing them into existence.

Sacrificing /anything/ for NPCs was something Milo definitely would not have done at the beginning of the story. But here, in his dying breath, he made a family of happy NPCs. And the thing is - you can totally /believe/ that Milo had changed a bit from his calculating, munchkin-ey self to one that actually cared for the NPCs around him. The author brings his character to this point gradually, and the sacrifice means that much more /for/ it.

Amazing character development. I've never read both of the two executed so well together. The author writes it so well.

([[/u/sirpoley]] - you're an incredible writer, and that was one of the /best/ chapters I've ever read in fanfiction, hands down. Keep it up!)
