I'm going in for some orthopaedic surgery next week and will be laid up off my feet for the next 2-4 weeks depending on what they find and how much cartilage they have to repair.

I've got my Netflix queue all lined up, but I'd like some reading to round out my downtime. Hit me up with your favourite novel length stories ladies and gents!

#+begin_quote
  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

**** I feel like I can deal with it being unfinished. It was somewhat frustrating at the end since it stops at a cliffhanger but overall I am very happy that I decided to read it and it is still one of my favorite AU Harry Potter worlds. It is divided into 6 "books", with it stopping a few chapters into the 6th book so if you want a more satisfying ending, just stop at book 5 . It is a long long story though with many adventures, plots, mysteries and following multiple characters. I honestly really enjoyed most of them even if some of these stories and plots are not finished at the end.

** Haha! I can yet again recommend linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black). It's rather different from most fanfics, but if you enjoy intrigue, politics, and strategy, it's a most excellent fic.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/black-knight-harry-potter-au.395017/][Black Knight]] (Black Pawn until the start of the fourth year) is a fanfic over at Spacebattles, who removed Hermione, and instead puts in another brilliant muggleborn... who ends up in Slytherin. It's a rewrite of a fic called Brightest Witch in the Darkest House.

linkffn(Forging the Sword) is likely something you've read before, but if not, it should be high on your list. Even if you have, I've found that it's well worth a reread.

Now, you didn't specify Harry Potter fanfic stories, so I will recommend giving [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com][Worm]] a try. It's 'realistic' superhero fiction. Not in the sense that powers make scientific sense, of course, but in that there's a realistic portrayal of powers on society (they've existed for about 30 years at story start), and that there's never moments where you want to scream at the characters that /if you just use your powers in this way that's been demonstrated before, the fight will be over!/

The characters are very strong too, especially the antagonists, none of whom feel like just another stereotypical bad guy, but rather real people with goals and motivations. It also has a wordcount of 1.7M words, which is basically equal to the ASoIaF series.

*** [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/][Worm]] link. I second the recommendation - I loved this story a huge amount. The first two chapters aren't representative of the rest, but if you don't like it by the end of the first arc (about 6 chapters, and after the first fight) then it's probably not worth sticking with. There's also a lot of Worm fanfic out there, although it's mostly on spacebattles.net. You can find lots of links on the wiki page for [[/r/WormFanfic]].

Back to HP fanfic, linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5) is really good and recently finished. It's a Romione story with espionage, intrigue and politics but also some really great worldbuilding and fight scenes.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
