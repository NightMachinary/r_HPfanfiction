There would probably be a lot of boredom, frustration and regrets if anyone had to actually go through a whole childhood again. The annoyance at the lack of agency, all the fun that staring at a blackboard for six hours a day, five days a week, six years before Hogwarts would be, the emotional disconnect from their peers etc.. Are there any fics that don't just ignore that?

Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time. In this, Harry has gone back in time many many times. He's somewhere around 2,000 years old at the start and is absolutely crazy. He doesn't really act like Harry from canon, but I think that's to be expected.

It has a sequel story that was never finished. Got an update in mid 2015, but nothing since then.

*** This (according to summary) seems full of all the usual tropes/cliches. On top of that sporting one of the least likely (and sickening imho) pairings in all of HPfandom ... Can you give a reason why its good or worth the time? I'd be willing to give it a chance if there was anything worth reading in it. Is there?

**** I read it and enjoyed the story even if it does have some faults. The plot is that Harry keeps getting thrown back in time every time his life ends (whether from old age, suicide or anything else) and it's his 13th time repeating his life. He is tired and wants to try something different since he just wants to figure out why he keeps repeating his life no matter what he does. This time he decides to do something he has never done before - not kill Voldemort.

There were some cliches, although not as bad or as many as the summary implies. Harry isn't really evil/dark and his power and experience is well portrayed. Dumbledore bashing is borderline but his behavior is somewhat understandable since Harry is ignoring him and the prophecy. There is some annoying slash, but its mostly skippable. The relationship between Tom and Harry is not too bad since Harry ends up making him mostly sane and more like young Tom Riddle rather than Voldemort. His goal is trying to change the Wizarding world for the better via politics rather than via killing and fear.

Overall, the story was interesting and had some plot lines and situations that I haven't really seen before. If you can power through occasional slash and don't mind somewhat jaded Harry stories, it may be worth checking out.

**** If I might add to what it's been said, the Dumbledore bashing doesn't exist. Dumbledore is not a bumbling idiot of any sort and his actions are very consistent with the Canon character, but it's true that he's Harry's antagonist (mostly in a political sense, they don't battle with each other and Harry is aware of the kind of power Dumbledore has, which is he tries to make him see reason)

Also, the slash is a part of the story BUT it can be somewhat skipped. What I really like is Voldemort isn't instantly head over heels for Harry, the friendship evolves slowly before they start a romantic relationship.

**** I thought the EXACT same thing before I read it. Despite loving slash, I hate this pairing, I hate OP!Harry and I HATE dark!harry. This fic was not really any of those things - it's probably the worst written summary I've ever seen lol.

The only graphic slash is totally skippable and has a beginning and end note so you can easily skip it. The Voldy in this fic is restored to sanity and in like a 30 yr old body so the pairing isn't gross or crazy. Harry is 600 years old or something, so he's not OP, he's just normal but really old. And Harry isn't "dark" at all - he's lived his life over and over and isn't worried about doing things that could be seen as morally gray because he already knows how they turn out. Finally, the dumbledore bashing isn't bashing at all. Like another poster said, it's just that Harry and Dumbledore are political rivals.

This fic is really good and is still being updated! Definitely worth your time!

The beginning \ first-half of the story was rather well written and interesting --- especially since I was looking for a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue][GroundhogPeggySue]] story.

That being said, once the romance fully kicked in both Harry and VD started behaving so OoC that I had to drop the story, because by that point it was just another crackfic.

So: maybe read the first half and drop it as soon as you start noticing that the story it taking a nosedive in quality.

***** I noticed that too. Although once you get past the slash/sappy relationship part, both Harry and VD do get back to acting somewhat normally. I just dont understand it though, there are so many stories that are well written in the beginning with characters acting reasonably and that have a good story line. But then the slash starts, and it's like the authors completely forget that they know how to write properly and have everyone act like lovestruck teenagers with no brains. I noticed that I rarely finish slash stories since almost every single one I start tends to devolve into OOC ridiculousness.
