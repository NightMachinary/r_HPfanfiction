  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!

** !linkao3(The Last Enemy: The Howling Nights by CH_Darling)

^{^{^}} really good Marauder story starting in 5th year.

!linkffn(The Life and Times)

^{^{^}} It's a cult classic for a reason and I usually avoid them but this is genuinely brilliant. I adored all the characterisations. There's a good amount of plot and intrigue. It is finished (despite how people complain) but yes. Completely reccommend.

*** WOw. i had never read last enemy. I am... smitten.

from the first chapter -- this made me laugh out loud:

  “See you later, Penny Prefect.”

  This stopped Lily in her tracks. She glanced back over her shoulder. “Who told you I was made a prefect?”

  Sirius smirked. “You did, just now. Bet you're awfully chuffed. Tough luck, though. We've got one on our side this year.” He clapped James on the back victoriously, and James grinned, pleased that Sirius had picked up the sport.

  Lily's expression turned to pure horror. “Not you---!”

  Both boys erupted into laughter. 

  “Merlin, can you imagine?”

  “Dumbledore would have to be mad. No, Lupin.”

  “Oh,” Lily sighed, clearly relieved. “And I suppose you think he'll let you get away with everything?”

  “Er...obviously,” said James.

  It's 1975 and war is simmering beneath the surface of the Wizarding world...but at Hogwarts, it's magic as usual as the fifth years prepare for their O.W.L.s amidst politics, pranks, and other poor choices. Severus Snape wants to prove his worth.Lily Evans wants a fresh start.James Potter wants Lily Evans, though no one is more surprised by this than him.Sirius Black wants to write himself a new story.Remus Lupin wants to survive the next moon.Peter Pettigrew just wants to keep up. But as tensions bubble over, sides will be chosen, friendships destroyed, families parted, and paths forever altered. The Howling Nights is the first book of The Last Enemy series, which follows the lives of the heroes and villains of the First Wizarding War from 1975-1981. Watch the trailer! (New chapters posted on Mondays and Thursdays)

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

** I write Marauders fics. I make no claims about how good they are, but maybe you'll find them entertaining.
