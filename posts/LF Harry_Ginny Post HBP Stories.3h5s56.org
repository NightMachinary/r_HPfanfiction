Basically I want good novel length stories where Ginny gets back together with Harry soon after their "breakup" and she comes with them on the Horcrux hunt. I know I have read one before that someone wrote before DH was even released and it was very good. It would be nice if it is AU. I'm would rather a fic that is not just DH rewritten with Ginny inserted but will take that if that is all there is. I've also always liked the idea of Harry saving Ginny from the apparating death eaters attacking the wedding causing her to be pulled along when Hermione apparates them away and forced to come with them but I'm not sure if there are any fics like that. Thanks in advance for any suggestions you guys may have.


** Back to the Garden by Antosha has what you're looking for. Google it. It is Harry/Ginny/Luna, though Harry/Ginny is the focus. The horcrux hunt isn't really the selling point of the story, the sex and the romance is. I recommend it all the same.

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129078][Unintended Consequences]] fits your description though it starts when Ron leaves Harry. It then starts diverging from DH by Hermione going after Ron, leaving Harry alone.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129816][Harry Potter and the Journey through Time]] is a one-shot for a timeturner writing challenge. Harry finds a timeturner to go back 3 years and takes Ginny with him. Starts somewhere in the middle of DH.

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128050][Bonds of Blood and Magic]] applies here. It's not that well known and it's still WiP, but it's a brilliant read.
