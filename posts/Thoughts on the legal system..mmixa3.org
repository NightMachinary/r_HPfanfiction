Okay, so this popped into my mind. How in the world is witness testimony admissible evidence in court in the Wizarding World?

Memories can be modified, and thus Veritaserum wouldn't make a person speak the factual truth, only what that person believes to be the truth (according to their memories).

Am I missing something here?!

Also, what are some corrections/flaws in the Wizarding World's systems? Governmental, Legal, Judicial, etc.


** Memories are also notoriously unreliable in real life, but are still admissible in court.

So yes, it is a flaw in the system, but it is a very realistic one.

*** But I'd figure that because of the presence of mind altering abilities, surely this would've been addressed?

IRL: Scientists say X, a portion of the population ignores/says it's a lie. HP: Pretty much every citizen is aware that memories can be changed/erased.

Fun fact: every time you recollect something, all you're actually doing is remembering the last time you thought about it, not the thing itself.

** I think that the memory modification can be if not completely reverted at least diagnosed. So, it is known when a witness is truly unreliable. Without that, you are right, whole system would fall apart.

Otherwise, yes, even Muggles know that memories are unreliable. We just watched with our daughter for her English classes “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Angry_Men][Twelve Angry Men]]” and it all breaks down on the unreliability of witnesses.

** First, we know that memory modifications can be reversed, as in the case with Hermione's parents.

Second, memory erasure, if not reversible (as seems to be the case with Lockhart), is at least obvious enough that capable specialist healer or Legilimens would be able to tell that a memory erasure occurred. While this might remove the 'evidence' it does show that that person actually had information that was worth removing. With good investigation techniques, reconstructing that information might be possible, outside of the doubt that the removed memory would show.

Third, altered memories are likely seldom done by masters of the art, which makes viewing those memories look very obviously false when viewed in a pensieve, as is the case with Slughorn.

The issue isn't really that memories can be altered, those modifications can often be easily discovered. The /actual/ issue is that in the wizarding world, seeing isn't believing. With Illusions and Transfigurations and potions like the Polyjuice. The simple fact of the matter is that you can never really know that what you see is actually what happened nor by whom.

*** Oh, for fucks sake. Finger print identification can produce false positives. Dental records can be misleading. Eye-witness testimonies are ridiculously unreliable. Amd yet, in the real world, they all count as evidence in the eye of the law. So, how is that for worldbuilding?

**** That's fine. Worldbuilding isn't about making everything make perfect consistent sense at all times. Our world is a real world where there's often things we don't know, and those things are efforts to find out the things we don't know. Not to mention that we see the side effects of these issues: people can be unjustly imprisoned and can later be released with compensation or never get justice. Imprecise methods are combined with bigotry to lead to systemic racism. There are lobbies to reform the justice system and people that support it, and rallies from both sides. This is what worldbuilding does: it creates a world where the implications and consequences of differences from our world are either explored or can be extrapolated.

In the case of the shitty worldbuilding in HP, we know that there are ways to read minds, view memories, and force people to tell the truth. These things are never explored in canon in regards to how they affect the justice system. We see Sirius be imprisoned without trial, but we don't know why that's allowed or legal in their system. We don't even really understand what the Wizengamot is and how it interacts with the ICW or the Ministry of Magic. We don't know how it's picked it how the Minister is chosen. All of these things have major implications on the world. If the Minister is picked by a Wizengamot that's populated by hereditary seats, we can see how the wizarding world ends up being conservative and anti-muggleborn. The Ministry is more likely to transform into a bloated organization full of sinecures. But what if the Minister and Wizengamot are chosen democratically? We should see a society that vacillates between more liberalism and conservatism as the muggleborns and half-bloods searching for social mobility push back against the pureblood elites and the purebloods push back. In such a world, it makes more sense for Voldemort to gain large amounts of power, just like we've seen far-right movements emerge around the world in the past couple decades.

There's more to it than just that, though. The currency makes no sense when we have trouble understanding the value of a galleon. Why is it that shiny binoculars sold as souvenirs and that are used once and never seen again cost more than wands, which are tools used daily by every witch and wizard in the entire country? Why does a daily paper cost 2 knuts, which comes out to about a galleon and a half for a year's subscription? Surely it costs more than that to print a newspaper? How are the Weasleys are poor when the only real expenses they should have are Hogwarts supplies and food? Why is the existence of love potions just brushed over? Apparently they're something most people just take in stride and never consider the larger implications of. Merope dosing Tom Riddle is really a fairly tame problem when you consider just how badly they could be misused. How many witches and wizards are there really? How many children are at Hogwarts? When McGonagall has class with just the Gryffindors, is she only teaching 10 students? If there's many more students, why are there so few teachers? How does magic even work? What does it mean to be a powerful wizard? If a wizard can cast one spell but another can't, why? If a wizard can cast one spell but not another spell, why? Are transfigurations permanent or temporary and why? What property does food have that it can't be conjured?

When I say that JKR's world building is shit, I mean that we don't understand the world well enough to figure out how any of this works without making giant leaps of assumption. If I read Brandon Sanderson's books, I can understand how magic works and what its limits are. I can take that understanding and extrapolate and see where and how it affects the world, and how and where it would do so in other circumstances. I can't do that with HP, because there's so many holes in so many places.

It's like the difference between being able to map the ballistic trajectory of a projectile and understanding where in the universe there's alien life forms and what they look like. We understand the forces acting on a projectile and we can see where it was and where it will be based on what we see now. Maybe we'd be wrong because there's some force somewhere we can't see, but we can make a reasonable guess. We cannot extrapolate out the alien thing because there's so many different ways life could evolve in the universe and so many places that we just cannot see as much more than a speck of light. The data we need just isn't there to come to a positive conclusion. Likewise, the Harry Potter series just doesn't give us the necessary data to fully understand the world in which it's set.

***** The thing is, the books create a wonderful, fleshed out world. What you are complaining about, is that the world in the books revolve around Harry Potter. It's HP's world, not the wizarding world, so we know as much as Harry cares to know. If JK tried to include more worldbuilding, the books would get bloated. So, I'm of the opinion that its editorial decision more than a lack of skills.

****** Okay, but that still comes down to the worldbuilding being shit overall. It doesn't matter if it was an editorial or stylistic decision rather than skill. The fact remains that we do not have the information available to answer any of those questions, despite many of them being basic questions that need to be understood to have a functioning world (the purchasing power of a galleon being a huge one). That means this isn't a fully fleshed out world; it's a shell of a world with decisions made only to further the plot.
