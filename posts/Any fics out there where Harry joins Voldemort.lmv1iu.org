Basically, any fics where Harry's done with the light side and turns to Voldemort for revenge. Preferably long and obligatory, no slash. Thank you!

** I am not a fan of the subgenre, but I know of two.

The first one, I could have sworn the title was "Treacherous", but I can't find it now. In case it helps you with keyword searches, Harry turns out to have a gift for wandless magic, which permits him to walk through walls, kills Hagrid with an axe, and Voldemort helps him make a horcrux---a bracelet.

The second one is called /The River Styx/ by Vanessa Li Potter. It does have a problem, in that when Harry joins Voldemort, he adopts as his nom de guerre Dark Lord Filldeserp, which makes it very difficult to take the fic seriously.

*** I was just about to go check out /The River Styx/ but then I read that name... I mean I get where the author is coming from (Son of the snake/serpent?) but it sounds very silly

**** "Son of Snake" in Catalan.

But, yeah, it's like having a burst of canned laughter every time the Very Serious protagonist makes an appearance or does something.
