:FlairText: [Discussion] OMG Should This Be Canon
:END:
Right now I just finish watching the movie and fantastic beast and where to find them and wondering is the fandom is considering this as Canon. Almost every time you see magic in the movie it is either wandless ,voiceless and have no predictable wand movements. They raise a huge massive dome to lock down the area with nothing more than a point of there wand. Unless you are saying every wizard in that time is on par with Dumbledore, how is this possible... As you can see I'm a little disturbed at this being canon.


** Hmmm, I wasn't really looking for instances of wandless magic in the movie, but the ones I do recall are by Graves and Queenie (maybe).

[[/spoiler][Since Graves was actually Grindelwald, I'd say that his instances of wandless magic can be forgiven. Queenie, on the other hand, I thought I saw her holding a wand, but I can't be sure. But she is clearly a powerful witch, if her talent for Legilimency is any indication. I suppose Credence uses wandless magic, too, but his is really more in the realm of accidental magic. Very violent and very uncontrollable accidental magic.]]

Voiceless magic is taught sixth year and up, going by canon, so really, it's a skill most competent witches and wizards should have.

Wand movements are a bit of a tricky one. My headcanon is that the more proficient a witch/wizard is at a spell, the less wand movement matters. At some point, wand movement ceases to matter at all once you have become good enough at the spell. But I don't know if this is actually mentioned in canon or Pottermore, so I can't be sure. If I recall correctly, most instances where there is little wand movement are for spells which are used quite often, e.g., Accio. But for spells a little more complex (Queenie baking strudel), or used less often [[/spoiler][(the Revelio spell Newt uses to reveal Grindelwald's identity near the end)]], there tends to be distinct wand movements involved.

So, overall, I'd say the movie is fairly accurate and I'm definitely considering it canon.

P.S. Apologies if the spoiler tag doesn't work, this is my first time using it and I'm a little lost, tbh.

EDIT: I just saw the bit where you said they raise a protective dome with nothing more than a point of their wand. Sorry, totally missed that when I first read through it. In DH Part 2 several teachers are also shown to be raising similar-looking wards with only a point of their wand. Hermione raises wards, too, in DH, but there is little mention of wand movement in the books and the wards she is shown to raise in the movies do require wand movement, but also look very different from the wards raised in Fantastic Beasts.

** Not sure what your problem is, really.

Non-verbal magic: introduced in HBP, something we see adult wizards use all the time.

Vague wand movements: again, something we see all the time in the books, with wizards casting many spells with simple gestures - flicks, waves, even just pointing. It's always been the case that wand movements seem to be something you can dispense with.

Wandless magic: this has always been possible. See Quirrell in PS, Snape's legilimency, not to mention the entire discipline of potions.

Shield charm: while we learn in HBP that many wizards are completely incapable of casting the shield charm, it shouldn't be a surprise that aurors and other high level wizards are able to cast it well. In DH Harry cast a shield charm over half the Great Hall, separating Voldemort out from the rest of the fighters, and Harry at that point has an incomplete education. Flitwick, in the same book, casts a shield charm over all of Hogwarts.

** - Wandless magic was already canon.

#+begin_quote
  The magic wand originated in Europe. Wands channel magic so as to make its effects both more precise and more powerful, although it is generally held to be a mark of the very greatest witches and wizards that they have also been able to produce wandless magic of a very high quality. As the Native American Animagi and potion-makers demonstrated, wandless magic can attain great complexity, but Charms and Transfiguration are very difficult without one.

  The wand is a European invention, and while African witches and wizards have adopted it as a useful tool in the last century, many spells are cast simply by pointing the finger or through hand gestures.

- Non-verbal magic was already canon.

#+begin_quote
  ‘... you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of non-verbal spells. What is the advantage of a non-verbal spell?' Hermione's hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, ‘Very well -- Miss Granger?' ‘Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you're about to perform,' said Hermione, ‘which gives you a split-second advantage.'

- Reducing wand motions was already canon. Can't find right quote at the moment though.

- The insta-dome may be some sort of special MACUSA power. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5ev6ez/dark_lords_and_darker_magic/dafl5ci/][Taure provided interesting theory about those here]]

So for person getting disturbed about canon you don't seem to know canon that well.

** Actually, Newt voiced almost every single spell he used, other than a summoning charm in the beginning of the movie. The reason why there is so much wandless magic in the film is simply because we are seeing trained wizards in action, although it isn't used for much more than Telekinesis. The massive dome was likely a shield charm done in unison. Wand Movements haven't mattered since the First book, it isn't even mentioned passed Harry's second year I believe.

Good point. The 8 original movies and 7 original books centered on a bunch of school kids. This movie centered on adult wizards, and the only non-adult wizards were in the orphanarium.

** Well, I agree. Especially the large-scale Obliviation through rain and very very deep trunk. Even if you can argue all these things are canon, the film just stretches it too much.

** the dome may only be similar to a protego, the weren't defending against magic, which only requires a little flick.

** You've missed the fact that in JK Rowlings world the Wand is a European invention. Wandless magic originated from North American magic.

"The most glaring difference between magic practised by Native Americans and the wizards of Europe was the absence of a wand.

The magic wand originated in Europe. Wands channel magic so as to make its effects both more precise and more powerful, although it is generally held to be a mark of the very greatest witches and wizards that they have also been able to produce wandless magic of a very high quality. As the Native American Animagi and potion-makers demonstrated, wandless magic can attain great complexity, but Charms and Transfiguration are very difficult without one"

The article then goes on to state that Wand permits are required for all wizards and witches if only for the purpose of tracking illegal activity.

But it doesn't outright state the only wands are able to be used. It's conceivable that by the 1920s people were being trained in both wanded and wandless magic.
