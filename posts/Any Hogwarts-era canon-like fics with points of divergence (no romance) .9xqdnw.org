I'm looking for fics which have a similar feeling to canon (school-based, gen/no main romance, no massive AUs or OP Harry) where maybe something different happens, like Harry makes a different friend, or tackles something in a different way from canon. For example, befriending Luna earlier, or taking a different subject in 3rd year, or making a different choice re one of the adventures, and things slowly changing from there.

Harry pov and fics which are as long as possible are ideal! I don't like romance, so i'd rather Harry not be paired with anyone (background/minor romance could be okay, but please no m/f for Harry or Harry/Adults.)

I'm thinking of fics like Forging the Sword linkffn(3557725) or the Problem of Potions linkao3(10588629) and fics similar to that idea, where something different happens (Ginny dies in CoS, or Harry discovers a love for potions, respectively) but the overall style is similar to canon (classes are still a part of Harry's life, as well as friends, and no one is massively overpowered or bashed or super ooc).

any suggestions are appreciated !


** "Ron went quiet after that, apparently not having thought that one through. This was why Ron was Harry's best friend, even if Hermione and Neville were pretty great. If Harry jumped off a cliff, Ron would jump off after him and they'd figure out how not to die on the way down."

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

My own "No Longer Alone" fits this. Basically, Harry is fed up with Hermione and Ron fighting all the time over their pets, so he hangs out with Katie Bell and her friend Leanne instead (there is a reconciliation with both when they are back to Hogwarts). This leads to a slightly different confrontation between Pettigrew and Sirius (Pettigrew ends up kissed). So with no evidence of his innocence, Sirius flees and gets in touch with Andromeda, who takes Harry in.

The story is more family-focused than canon, but that is to be expected given the premise. There is a romantic subplot in two chapters (out of currently 15), but it is a tentative teenage romance, not "true love"^{TM} and or marriage at 14. Pretty free of bashing (well, Pomfrey gets shade thrown her way for not recognising child abuse and there is some bad blood between Molly and Andromeda in the background, but definitely no random love potions or stolen money), Dumbledore barely plays a role (he has one scene in Chapter 14) and stays out of things. Harry is roughly a year ahead in DADA and half a year in Charms, but worse in transifiguration than in canon.

tl;dr: Harry + adoptive family (the Tonks) + friends (mostly Katie Bell and Hermione) + life at Hogwarts

  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turns out to be the best decision Sirius has ever made.

** I really enjoyed the Hermione Granger and the Child Protection Movement series linkao3(13695783). The basic premise is that Hermione writes a letter home to her parents regarding her suspicions about the Dursley's abuse during first year, and everything snowballs from there.

  What happens if Hermione notices signs of abuse in Harry during first year? The Wizarding World may not have laws against it, but the Muggle World certainly does...

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9969014/1/Seasons-of-change][Seasons of change]] is only midway through year 2 so no romance yet, but it's a really good one. Basically, Harry is a kinder version of himself.

In canon, Harry is clearly written as heterosexual, so I'm not sure how him not being heterosexual would keep to the vibes of the original? The magical world may not care about sexual orientation, but the muggle world does and Harry is still firmly entrenched in there until he's 17.

*** I don't see how him being gay or bi would be incompatible with the vibes of the original ? the ‘vibes' in the original are mostly just kids bookishly interested in friendship and classes and plot and novel-pacing, which I'm interested in. the wizarding world is likely homophobic bc it's very heteronormative from what we see and there are no out lgbt ppl, but you could have homophobia in a kids book w/t it being depressing. I'm not necessarily looking for something appropriate for 9-year olds (I don't mind swearing obvs or violence or adult themes) and if harry can deal w abuse and ptsd and the death of his family and friends and a terrorist organisation out to torture and kill him since birth I don't think dealing w being gay/bi would suddenly make things inappropriate or bizarre. anyway he could easily not deal w much homophobia. It's up to the author. I don't get what you mean at all.

**** Actually, you answered my question pretty well. That was exactly what I was wondering as I figured including obvious LGBT elements would increase the amount backlash Harry would deal with. Honestly though, I think it would be interesting to have Harry as the MC, but have another character be faced with LGBT isssues. Then we could have a Harry who's forced to witness someone else deal with personal and social issues and maybe that will inspire him to be a social activist? I just see Harry as someone who reacts more about other people's personal dificulties than his own.
