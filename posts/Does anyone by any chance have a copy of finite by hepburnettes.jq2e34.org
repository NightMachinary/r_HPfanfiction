Two things:

Do you know why the Author no longer wanted to upload Finite to Wattpad? I know it may be due to plagiarism, but I also mentioned something about being very obscure. What do you mean by that, is the ending bad? Moon dies?

And two:

I have been looking everywhere for a copy, there were even those who asked in the past here, but I think there was no positive answer. But if anyone has a copy, they could message me privately.

Thank you! I hope not to bother with my request, I want the fanfiction exclusively to read myself, I promise.
