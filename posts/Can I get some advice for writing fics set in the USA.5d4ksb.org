I'm writing a fic set in the US (technically a crossover, but that's not pertinent to these questions) however I'm English born and bred, and while research is helping, I wanted to get some opinions from actual Americans on a couple of things. Canadian opinions are also appreciated for aspects pertaining to Ilvermorny, because I'm working on the assumption it's the only school in North America so they've probably influenced its practices as well.

(Under that assumption, I realise that students from Middle America, particularly Mexico, may also attend, but my personal headcanon is that Castelobruxo in Brazil is probably more friendly towards Spanish speaking students and most young wizards from Middle America would attend there rather than Ilvermorny.)

*1) Thanksgiving* -- do you think wizards would celebrate it? After looking into it, I'm leaning towards no, but perhaps Americans would disagree. If they didn't initially celebrate it, I wonder if after so many years wizards might have started as a matter of culture. Even if they don't as a whole, do you think Ilvermorny might do something (special feast?) at the request of Muggleborn students? (Possibly one for Canada's and one for the US's?)

Also, Homecoming. I'm still not sure I even understand this one so I really have no idea whether or not Ilvermorny / wizards would have it.

*Related:* are there any national holidays you think US wizards should (or really shouldn't) celebrate? (I know Hallowe'en is way bigger over there; I already have plans for that. But I realise they're probably not going to celebrate Presidents' Day.)

*2) Getting to Ilvermorny* -- for those unaware, Ilvermorny is set on top of Mount Greylock in Massachusetts, and I'm looking for any and all ideas on how students get there. I'm leaning towards flying horse-drawn carriages that pick students up from several different locations; the trip would obviously be long (especially for Hawaiians and Alaskans), but a lengthy carriage flight has to be more comfortable than an airplane.

My problem here, however, is that I'm getting stuck on how Muggleborn students get to those locations. Wizards can floo / arrange portkeys / side-along Apparate with their parents, but a poor Muggleborn kid might not be able to afford to travel to the pick-up point. Am I getting too hung up on this point? Is it cheaper than I think to travel (up to) 500 miles? (Particularly as it's in the 90s.)

I have considered the possibility of Muggleborns being sent timed portkeys to take them to the pick-up, but that seems incredibly risky -- aside from accidentally missing it, I can see a lot of curious young siblings rushing forwards to touch it at the wrong moment and getting pulled along for the ride, not to mention over-protective parents insisting on coming to see them off. (Possible solution: gov't. official at the pick-up point who can create portkeys to send unexpected passengers back home.)

*3) GPAs and Extra Credit* -- I know I can fudge Ilvermorny's educational system because it's a fictional magical school originally started by an Irish witch, but I do want to incorporate some US school elements so that I'm not writing Hogwarts 2.0. I just want to make sure I'm understanding how things work before I twist them, so tell me if I've got this right:

Graduation from high school is dependant on passing each class. GPAs are calculated from combining your grades from each class. Grades are determined by the class teacher (as opposed to a set government standard) and dependant on your work throughout the whole school year, plus your score on mid-term and final exams. Extra credit assignments are given at the discretion of each teacher and can be used to improve your grade for a given class, and thus your overall GPA. There are no national exams (like GCSEs / OWLs) but SATs can be taken by choice and are often required by colleges.

*

*I would also appreciate advice on any other US issues or cultural aspects you think an Englishman might neglect to consider.*


** 1. Well, wizards in Britain seem to celebrate Christmas, so I don't see why Thanksgiving wouldn't be an option. And unlike Christmas, there are no real religious connections, so that wouldn't be an issue.

2. Unless you're in the Pacific Northwest, California or the East Coast, trains generally aren't an option for getting from all over the place. I don't particularly remember what gas prices were like back then, so I can't comment on the costs of driving, and I /really/ have no idea how practical planes would be, since I never was on a plane pre-9/11, and afterwards, there would be too much unexplainable stuff in a muggleborn student's trunk to get away with (unless a witch or wizard did some trickery). But don't forget you can set up some sort of whimsical solution. Something like the Knight Bus would be perfectly fine as a solution. Greyhound Buses for example travel all over the place. You're probably just overthinking it. Shit's magic, yo.

3. The thing about the American Education System is that treating it like a whole (especially pre-Common Core, and I'm *not* getting into that argument, so don't even bother) is pretty stupid. Generally it's a thing that varies by states. Some information that may or may not be useful.

Schooling could basically be broken into these components: preschooling, K-12 education (public school (will be discussed later)), collegiate/technical schools and post-graduate work. The only one required anywhere as far as I know is K-12.

School years generally went (at least, how it was for me. Things probably have changed in the last six to twentysome years):

- Preschool (optional). Generally children 3-5 years old. Partial school days.

- Kindergarten. Not optional as far as I know. First year of K-12. When I had this, it was a half day thing.

- First Grade. First year of full day schooling. Basically the first year of what we would call Elementary school.

- Second Grade. Second year of full day schooling.

- Third Grade. Third year of full day schooling.

- Fourth Grade. Fourth year of full day schooling.

- Fifth Grade. Fifth year of full day schooling. Often, but not always, the last year of elementary school.

- Sixth Grade. Sixth year of full day schooling. Often the first year of what we would call Middle School. Basically this marks the point where school gets far more intense than compared to previous year changes, and elective courses are now a thing.

- Seventh Grade. Seventh year of full day schooling.

- Eighth Grade. Eighth year of full day schooling. Often the end of Middle School, though some Middle Schools also host the Ninth Graders.

- Ninth Grade. Ninth year of full day schooling. Often the first year of High School. Also called Freshman Year.

- Tenth Grade. Tenth year of full day schooling. Also called Sophomore Year. No, I don't know or particularly care why.

- Eleventh Grade. Eleventh year of full day schooling. Also called Junior Year.

- Twelfth Grade. Twelfth and final year of full day schooling. Also called Senior Year.

College is sort of a catch all term, used for both colleges and universities.

One thing to note, if you're talking about a muggleborn's previous place of education: Public schools in US =/= Public schools in UK. Public schools in the US are schools for the public. So, state run, tuition is a part of the taxes, and so on. Private schools are the ones that people in the UK would call Public Schools (as far as I know). Of course, homeschooling is often a thing.

For example, I grew up in Michigan. In Elementary and Middle School, we had this thing called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Educational_Assessment_Program][MEAPs: Michigan Educational Assessment Programs]] which had tests in what I want to say were 5th grade, 8th grade and /maybe/ 3rd grade, but I'm not too sure on that one. When I was in High School, we had things called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Merit_Exam][MMEs: Michigan Merit Exams]], though I think it has been replaced with something else. I'd have to ask my friend who teaches in Detroit. They were taken Junior Year, and used to require taking the ACT, one of the two major exams used for collegiate admissions (the other, and more popular, is the SAT). I do know that Michigan has switched to the SAT some point in the last six years. I couldn't really tell you about other states. Fun Fact! On the Michigan Merit Exams, the highest grade possible was an Exceeds Expectations. Also, a teacher doesn't mark homework or tests/exams, they grade them.

Which is probably my big point for cultural points that you want to know: America isn't a homogenous nation in any way. Each state has a distinct difference in culture. I've lived in Michigan, Indiana, Alabama and potentially (if these damn people ever get back to me in the way that seems incredibly likely) Colorado. Each of these is drastically different from the other. And within each state it can vary greatly. For example: Michigan is composed of two landmasses only connected by the Mackinaw Bridge. I'm from the Upper Peninsula, which only contains ~3% of the population of MI but about a third of the landmass, and is culturally more similar to Wisconsin, Minnesota and Canada than the Lower Peninsula (especially more true the further west in the UP you go).

Other random things to know:

Biscuits and Gravy is mostly a Southern Breakfast, are absolutely delicious, and about the only time I'll ever eat biscuits (they are way too crumbly, and get in my beard way too much).

[[http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/southern-biscuits-recipe.html][US Biscuits]] =/= UK Biscuits.

Breakfast foods include things like cereal, waffles, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake][pancakes]], eggs, toast, bacon, sausage, sometimes steak or fried chicken (or chicken fried steak (steak fried like a chicken)), grits (a Southern thing, I can't stand them) and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_browns][hash browns]]. The possibilities are /literally/ almost endless.

Coffee is FAR more common than tea.

Mom, not Mum.

Guns are for more common. I had a fun discussion with [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] about it not too long ago. It's more common in more rural areas (so, basically the middle of the country), especially with rifles and shot guns.

Color, not colour. Honor, not honour. You get the idea.

Distances can be much, much longer than you would often see in England. I've done a two and a half hour drive (so, five hour round trip) as a day trip multiple times. Hell, we once did a four hour drive into Canada to buy a toilet as a day trip when I was younger. It was an eight hour drive to get from my undergraduate college to my parent's house, and I only traversed a couple states (MI to Wisconsin, WI to Illinois, IL to barely into-Indiana).

That's all I got off the top of my head. If you have anything else, don't be afraid to ask!

EDIT: Forgot about Holidays. Really, the Big Five are: Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years and the Fourth of July (Independence Day). Of those, Halloween is the smallest, and is kinda just celebrated for the hell of it. The other four are days when school is either cancelled, or not in session, and state and federal offices and buildings are generally closed. Other days to note: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day][Memorial Day]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day][Labor Day]] are two that generally are very celebrated (partially due to the time of year, nature of the holiday, and the fact that they are ALWAYS a Monday, allowing for families to travel and get together to celebrate), and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Day][Veteran's Day]]. Those are all the ones I can think of off the top of my head that have schools and government buildings/services closed too (excepting Fire Departments, Police Departments and whatnot).

EDIT TWO, ELECTRIC BUGALOO: I think this is my longest comment? Fun.

Also research history, local dishes/ foods for the feasts. In some southern areas young kids drink coffee so it could easily replace some people's "pumpkin juice". Since the school is in Massachusetts you can have a Boston Vs New York quidditch rivalry or something to parallel muggles baseball.

Yeah, you're probably right on that.

The language and spelling differences I've mostly got; consulting the web when in doubt. I do have one question though: do you know a good slang term for "ran away"? I know "buggered off" is too British, but I also learnt "scarpered" is actually Brit. Eng., and I can't really find a US equivalent. (I can't used "fucked off" because it's an 11yo talking to a teacher. Also, if there's regional things, the kid grew up in a Vegas suburb.)

The breakfast thing is very helpful. But seriously, steak for breakfast?? Is that a regional/class thing? It sounds like the kind of oddity a stupidly rich person would indulge in.

**** Ran away. I don't really know of anything else, but it can vary by region so much.

Steak for breakfast is fuckin' delicious. Sure, it's not the best quality steaks, but still pretty good. Mostly a thing if you went out to eat somewhere for breakfast. Chicken is probably more common (particularly in the South).

When I would visit my grandpa back when he was alive, breakfasts were generally: Eggs, hash browns, sausage or bacon, buttered toast, fruit (bananas or grapes), shredded wheat cereal, coffee and water/milk/juice. Sometimes pancakes, with homemade maple syrup. Of course, he was a dairy farmer, so breakfasts had to be chock full of energy.

As far as I know, given how much the Las Vegas metro area has exploded in population over the last couple decades, it has been mostly fueled by internal migration rather than just pure natural growth. So, if there is another region of the US whose culture you're more comfortable with writing, you can say that your character's parents are from there but moved to LV for work before the kid was born, or when the kid was really little.

** 1) thanksgiving actually makes sense for wizards to celebrate. It's a nonreligious feast holiday celebrating peace and cooperation between native Americans and European settlers in one colony. The meaning behind it can be easily exported to wizarding good relations between native wizards and immigrant wizards. However, most Native Americans have very mixed feelings about Thanksgiving because after the tradition was established the settlers kept moving west and killing and relocating Native Americans and claiming their land. So the argument can be made that Thanksgiving is a holiday that gives lip service to cooperation with natives while not actually living those principles. But if Ilvermorny actually respects native students and traditions Thanksgiving could be less of a one-sided affair.

2) Trains would be the most reasonable and historically accurate choice. The USA had an extensive rail network that we were very proud of (e.g. the First Transcontinental Railroad was dedicated at completion by a US President), and freight railroads in the US are still the best/among the best in the world. Passenger rail declined or was bought up and destroyed by car companies in the 1920s/30s to encourage car sales but magical train lines could have been easily hidden from automobile companies. Railroads have a bit of folklore around them in the US; folks often packed their belongings and waited at the train station to be picked up and whisked away to a new life. After the Civil War, reconstructionists came down to the south on railroads with everything they owned in carpetbags (ergo the nickname carpetbaggers). Settlement of the western US usually involved taking the train as far west as it could go and then traveling on foot the rest of the way. (Stories of actually magical railroads are not abundant however.) The Boxcar Children is a hugely popular old US children's book series based on four children running away and living in an abandoned railroad boxcar until they're adopted by their previously unknown kind old grandfather. Etc.

3) there are standard exams but usually the results affect the teachers more than the students. State funding to the school is determined by how well students do on the tests (the better the grades, the more money they get... yes, it is fucked up and a self perpetuating cycle and public schools close when their students don't do well, leading to scared teachers teaching to the test and outright teacher-encouraged cheating.) All the standardized tests are set by the state however. And they're all different in every state. Only about half the states have school leaving exams, otherwise everything is determined by GPA. The nationally standardized tests like the SAT are college entrance exams, which are way better set than state testing. In the US our universities are much better run, testing-wise, than our mandated public education because public education falls under state purview and it's a mishmash of state testing but college standardized material falls under national standards/national degree certification organizations.

So if you include an occasional (every 3/4 years) set of standardized tests that the teachers are more nervous about than the students are, that would be a nice little call out to US K-12 culture. You have GPAs, extra credit, and high school graduation correct.

4) boarding schools are really, really unusual in the USA. There are some really expensive college prep ones (mostly in the Northeast) for rich kids, but overall, kids who go to boarding schools are assumed to be juvenile delinquents being shipped off to military boarding schools to straighten them out. I went to a state run boarding school for gifted students in the south and the first reaction I usually get when I tell people that I went to boarding school is "holy shit what did you do wrong?!". Ha. So be sure to work that in, because 'I'll send you to boarding school if you don't shape up' is a common threat to keep kids in line here and Ilvermorny students will have to explain over and over to their family and friends that it's a 'college prep' boarding school, not one for juvenile delinquents.

*** Also Homecoming is a school dance centered around the 'school spirit' high school football (not your football, our US football 🏈) game. Football season is in the fall, Homecoming usually is in the early middle part of the season (early October/late September), and the homecoming dance is preceded by various school spirit activities throughout the week.

Labor Day is a holiday celebrating the triumphs of labor unions in securing collective rights for their workers. Wizards shouldn't celebrate it. Also Veteran's Day only was created after WW1 or WW2, unless the wizarding community seriously participated in those wars, they shouldn't celebrate it. (Those are both banking days in the US and federal employees have time off.) the Fourth of July is tricky. If wizards were involved and fought against UK wizards during the American revolution (reasonable) then yes, celebrate it. But more to the point the Fourth of July is on summer holidays so Ilvermorny shouldn't be hosting a school celebration anyway.

Also most schools are out by the beginning of June/end of May, I still don't know when U.K. schools get out but I think Hogwarts ends later than us. 2.5 months for summer holidays is usual. September 1st is a late start for us but some schools do begin right after Labor Day (wtf those people). Depends, again, on the state.

*** I thought Thanksgiving /did/ have heavy religous connotations, which is why I thought wizards wouldn't celebrate,* but if it's not then I can see it happening. I did read about the issues it had regards Native Americans, but Pottermore says Ilvermorny had a lot of interaction with Native Americans in the early days so I certainly think they're more equal about these things.

(* I know Hogwarts does Christmas, but that's as much a cultural holiday as a religious one.)

I hadn't realised trains were such a big thing. I dismissed them because (a) I felt it'd be too much like the Hogwarts Express; (b) it'd take so long; and (c) it has to get up a mountain.

** I think the single biggest thing is how drastically people from different parts of the country talk. I mean, I know that the UK has a bunch of variations in accent and manner of speech, now extrapolate that to a country the size of all of Europe. Like, it'd be weird if someone from Chicago say "y'all" and it'd be weird to have someone from Dallas say "you guys". And it'd be weird for anybody to say "yinz", but people from Pittsburgh do anyway.

Then, of course, the different ethnic groups in the US often speak in vastly different ways, to the point where linguists consider African American Vernacular to be its own dialect of English. Then you've got hispanic people, who often use both Spanish and English interchangeably, and mix words and phrases from both together. This is a generalization, obviously, but there have been entire academic papers written on the subject, and I'm not interested in writing another.

The speech differences across the US are incredible.

Travel - honestly, with how spread out the US and Canada are, I would almost go with staff members (or house elves?) apparating to students' houses and then side-alonging them to school. Like you said, anyone rural is going to have have a lot of travel to any kind of central meeting point. If each staff member got ... 6-8 kids - who were given a /very strict/ departure time to be ready by - it could all be done in an hour. And special luggage portkeys that don't work on anything living for the trunks, those could just be dropped on top before apparating.

I turned 10 at the end of my first term in boarding school, and I didn't go home for any in-term holidays. Admittedly this was not in the US, but there's a fair argument to be made that taking just a few days off just worsens homesickness and such when you get back.

** Graduation from high school is dependent on passing grades in the primary focus classes: Four years of English and Math, two years of Science, and two or three years of Social Studies. At least two years of passing grades in another language are often required as well. Participation in some form of Physical Education each year is often an added requirement that will prevent a student from being given a diploma if unfulfilled. Being in the marching band or part of the yearbook team can often substitute for this.

The societal purpose of high school in the 90's is to keep under-18's off the street and busy so they won't cause trouble- literacy and a sense of citizenship are predicted side-effects. The high-school diploma is necessary for entrance to universities, colleges, trade schools and/or military service, although a student can elect to bypass all that by taking a GED [Graduate-Equilvalent Diploma] test. GED's are looked down upon compared to diplomas as they usually are done by those who got into some form of trouble that prevented normal attendance in regular school: jail, prolonged illness or pregnancy. Exceptions are for those who were home-schooled or that took the GED so that they can attend University before they turn 18. They're not considered damaged goods- they're just weird.

So, really, anyone attending Ilvermorny would be most likely to 'take the GED's after being home-schooled'.

Aside from that, I recommend the works of Inverarity, starting with linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle).

** 1) Thanksgiving can be compared to your standard harvest feast. "OMG, we haven't all died! Hooray!"

Homecoming is only a big deal in high school and even then it might not be a big deal. At my school we had a homecoming court that dressed up and paraded around the football game, but no dance or anything.

As far as other holidays, probably just the big ones. Christmas, Easter, Halloween, and if you wanted to put a fun twist on it, you could figure out a more wizard-central look at the 4th of July.

2) It may just be me getting whimsical, but I'd kind of enjoy for them to arrive by hot air balloon or something else completely out of left field. Floo or portkey is kind of boring, and train has been done.

3) Graduating depends on credits more than GPA. You can have an absolutely abysmal GPA but still graduate because you've technically passed the required number of classes. An example would be something like this:

4 math classes 3 science classes 4 english/literature classes 2 foreign language classes 1 economics class 1 art class 3 history classes however many of whatever classes are left. It's been a long time since I was in school. This is what I can remember of my graduation requirements. Remember that it can be different depending on your state/school district as well, because we are American and can't make anything straightforward and easy.

Basically, so long as you take the required number of classes and PASS those classes, you can graduate. Sometimes people can even graduate early because they buckle down and focus on taking only the required classes, and don't worry much about electives. So let's not worry about AP or Honors courses because those just muddle up the basic GPA system

4.0 - A 3.0 - B 2.0 - C 1.0 - D below 1.0 - F

Usually, so long as you have a 2.0 and have taken all the required courses, you can graduate. Obviously, you'd have some trouble getting into a good college with that, but you will have done the bare minimum.

Other things:

- Consumerism. I know it's pretty big everywhere but in America we really, really like it. Maybe I'm stereotyping my own country, but we seem to like having "stuff" more than other countries. And in school in particular how much stuff you have impacts your social standing.

- Spelling has already been covered, but also keep in mind these:

-jumper = sweater\\
-trainers = sneakers\\
-trousers = pants

-lounge = living room

-chips = french fries (only time we call them chips is "fish and chips"

-crisps = chips

-pudding = dessert. We only use pudding in reference to the actual custard-like dish

-biscuits = cookies

Our biscuits most resemble a scone, but they aren't really the same thing. I am not sure what British thing I could compare them to. Some recipes taste a lot like soda bread, I guess...

football (at least the kind you're used to) = soccer (it's only recently becoming more popular, so your kids will probably reference American football more)

- In most HP fanfiction based in England I see a lot of talk of Indian takeout. We do Mexican food here. We love huge burritos and tacos (OMG, tacos...) and salsa and guacamole. We don't call it take out. We just go out for some Mexican.

As far as other foods go, please do not listen to Buzzfeed's many "lulz, American food is sugary and orange and deep fried." articles. I'd be happy to list some "normal people" American dishes if you want.

Huh, I thought dances were pretty much standard. Was your school an outlier or have I just got unreasonable expectations from the media?

This probably isn't relevant to Ilvermorny, but how do you end up with 4 English classes? I understand math because you guys split it up into trig/algebra/etc (we just had one single math class that covered everything) and science is obvious for chem/bio/physics, but I don't understand how you'd split up English classes beyond one of language and one for literature. (We had single English classes, but GCSEs have a lang. and a lit. exam.)

Would you mind elaborating on the pudding/dessert issue? Is "afters" used at all (refering to any after-dinner foods)? My sister uses pudding as a catch all term, but I always considered it to only mean cakes and pies. Is that what you meant or is your pudding more specific?

I'd also appreciate the list of normal people foods. (Or a link to somewhere more reliable than Buzzfeed.)

"Normal people foods" vary wildly based on a ton of different things, such as race, class, and meal. Like, that's an incredible list you're asking for.

As for the classes, it's really odd to me that you wouldn't have an English class every year you're in school. They just get more and more advanced as you get older. They start out focusing on the language aspect and move towards literature.

But yeah, it's tricky to break the entire country down in one post simply because different regions feel completely different from each other, almost like their own countries.

4 English classes = one every year of high school, basically. Kind of a waste of time, yeah, but then again WELCOME TO THE US EDUCATION SYSTEM! hahaha!

As far as dessert goes. Basically anything sweet after dinner = dessert. No matter what it is. Cake, pie, cobbler, ice cream, fudge...all desserts.

As far as "typical" foods, that differs depending on region, but I can give you some "safe" foods that you can mention and are pretty standard wherever you go.

- spaghetti
- meatloaf
- various casseroles
- chicken (fried, baked, roasted, grilled, chicken tenders, chicken nuggets)
- rice is a pretty standard side dish
- macaroni and cheese
- salad is always safe
- scalloped potatoes
- chili is nice, usually served in winter
- ditto with various stews (like beef with vegetables)
- green beans
- sandwiches (just regular ham and cheese or chicken)
- oatmeal for breakfast
- cold cereal
- turkey is eaten usually on holidays
- junk food, of course. Hot dogs, hamburgers, french fries, pizza..

I'm not sure what else to list, because to me it's all just "food." If I Google specific lists then I get either weird regional foods or nonsense lists like the ones Buzzfeed loves so much. The ones that make it sound like we eat nothing but corn dogs and fried Oreos. That should be a good start though. I can probably come up with some more if I actually think about it.

**** In my time, the four years of English classes (Freshman to Senior) were broken down for focus, though this isn't an across-the-board thing:

Freshman = Grammar, spelling, punctuation, parts of speech; basically assuring that literacy had been covered.

Sophomore = Composition and literary forms

Junior = English literature

Senior = American literature

The last two may be swapped in order; some administrations feel that older English lit evolves into American lit. Others focus on American lit first as being more accessible to the modern reader, then go back to the English stuff when the language is more... English.

Mealtimes info:

Breakfast is some sugary cereal with milk, heated oatmeal or if you're going to need the calories; eggs, toast, bacon or sausage (in links or patties). Pancakes/flapjacks or waffles with maple syrup for a ritzy meal. Beverages for this meal are usually milk, juice, coffee or tea.

Lunch: a small version of Dinner's main course, usually transformed into some kind of sandwich. Weight-obsessed teen girls will eat salad (don't worry, they'll gorge on Snickers bars mid-afternoon). School-provided meals include a piece of fruit and the ubiquitous half-pint folded-cardboard milk container. Upscale schools offer it in skim, whole (3%) or chocolate versions. Anything to add dairy rather than succumb to the fruit punch/soda pop conspiracy.

Dinner: Appetizer/salad (and this only to pace the eating if the Main course isn't finished cooking), Main Course + side dishes, Dessert. Pudding is specifically a dessert made from gelatin and cream (usually), often with marshmallows or whipped cream mixed in.

Or to put another way: wherever a meal exists, there will be an attempt to add dairy- cream sauces, cheese baked in or baked on top or served in chunks... except in tea. Americans who put milk or cream in tea have spent too much time with foreigners. They are ambushed and force-fed Jolt, Dr Pepper, or Mountain Dew until they understand their error.

By the way, weird trufact: in Georgia, if you ask for a Coke, they'll ask 'what kind'? That's because Coca-cola is based there, and anyone from the region has substituted 'Coke' for 'soda' or 'pop' in their terminology as a survival technique.

** More considerations (since we talk about America, I will replace muggle with no-maj):

As of 1927, magical America was very isolationist, just like its no-maj counterpart. We know no-maj USA did a 180 degree on Isolationism during WW2, but what about magical America?

No-maj Americans are heavily armed. Attacking them carries significantly higher risk than attacking British muggles. America is also a far more violent country than Britain, with homicide rates at least 4 times higher.

Class distinction and family status are not nearly as important as in Britain. If you take a look at [[https://www.statista.com/statistics/201426/the-richest-people-in-america/][richest people in America 2016]], majority on that list are FIRST GENERATION billionaires. The Waltons (Wal-Mart) are 2nd generation, and only the Mars family inherited their wealth from more distant ancestors. Political dynasties are just as hard to establish. Clinton outspent Trump by 2 to 1 and still lost the recent election. Kennedys and Rockefellers are still on the scene, but they are hardly influential now.

Americans highly value individual achievements. Regardless how much your parents accomplished, if you are a loser you are still a loser. In fact, the society especially despises losers from rich/advantaged families. On the other hand, popular kids (usually with some good skills) often get a pass in schools, and they tend to be the bullies there.

Speaking of bullies, US schools began taking it seriously after the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre][Columbine Massacre]] in 1999. In a country, where high school kids could get their hands on assault rifles easily, bullying your fellow students carries a very SIGNIFICANT risk. You never know when you pushed your victim too far. Then in 2010, a British girl named Phoebe Prince committed suicide following months of bullying in a US high school ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Phoebe_Prince][Phoebe Prince Case]]). That was the point where most US schools started cracking down on bullying hard. I have two children who have been going to several schools (due to moves) since 2010, and ALL their schools take bullying very seriously.

I speak mostly from my own experiences. The US is a large country with significant differences across geographic regions. I personally spent most of my lives in California and Colorado, with an interlude in Texas.

While it is true that there are no national exams, the same is not true at the state level. These exams are required to graduate from high school. As for the SAT, there is a choice between SATs and ACTs, and most colleges accept both scores, or whichever is better. These scores are then used for placement in courses at universities.

** This is quite a project you have here, so I guess I will try to answer your questions in order.

1. Absolutely. Thanksgiving is pretty huge here. It's a time to be with family and celebrate our blessings (traditionally even if you aren't religious you go around the dinner table and say one or more things you are thankful for). So at least the muggleborns should get time off.

2. You can do literally whatever you want. Floo stations, obstacle courses, ride thestrals, leprechauns, Knight Bus V2(though this is rather lame), goblins who are nice, whatever you want. Make it an efficient and believable system. Or don't, it's up to you.

3. You got it. I think the most widely accepted GPA standard is out of 4,, with 4=A, 3=B, 2=C and so on. Some classes like gym are oftentimes pass/fail

4. Issues: I don't think you need to talk about anything you don't want to. They're kids, and what comes up between kids, especially without their parents, is completely up to the authors creativity. So you could have a racist southern white kid/Mexican/black/Asian whatever slowly come to terms with it, or you could have nothing like that at all. You can have a kid from Michigan ask how to purify water, or a Native American kid use different magic. The one thing we are not is uniform. Though we tend to have a lot of state pride, and enjoy sports a whole lot. Some kids are taught how to shoot a gun at a young age, some kids are beat quite handily, some kids grow up in extremely strict households (religious or military parents), some kids are spoiled brats (west coast vegan no corporal punishment culture). Just inserting some common stereotypes for you to use.

** 1) Thanksgiving I think would definitely be celebrated. Not sure about how old Ilvermorny is and if it pre-dates colonization, but if muggleborns attend, there is definitely thanksgiving. FWIW, Canadians also celebrate thanksgiving but theirs is in October wheras the US thanksgiving is at the end of Nov. A lot of private schools in the US have "fall break" so maybe you could have that fall over Canadian thanksgiving so that those kids could go home and then have the school celebrate US thanksgiving with a couple days off etc.

Homecoming is an American high-school and college tradition that is celebrated in the fall (every school sets their own "homecoming weekend") where there is typically an American football game played (this could be substituted for that American quidditch thing) and a lot of alumni come back for the game and/or the whole weekend. Also most schools host reunions for the classes that graduated 10 years ago, 20 years ago and so on during homecoming weekend. In highschool there is oftentimes a homecoming king and queen crowned (usually seniors voted by the rest of the school) as well as a homecoming court (all of the people nominated). IIRC, the movie Mean Girls has a pretty accurate depiction of homecoming. The homecoming dance is only attended by students, not all of the alumni who come back.

2) Getting to school - I think you should do something similar to hogwarts where all the students go together after meeting at one checkpoint (like platform 93/4). We do not have a great train system in the US, but having everyone meet at a "secret" terminal or gate in Boston International Airport would make sense. It could have a floo for magical kids and muggleborns and their parents could just fly there like regular muggles do. For poor kids maybe add in a line that those tickets are paid for by the school.

**** Fall break, which is often called Thanksgiving break, is generally only three days off school. Thanksgiving is always on the fourth Thursday of November, so we get Thanksgiving off, the Wednesday before it, so people can travel, the Friday after it, and then adding the following weekend, that's what fall break is. If people do travel, it's to see family, not to go to beaches like on spring break.

**** My highschool and my college had a week off for fall break - in October. It was almost exactly the same as spring break, but yes less party trips. I think this must be regional because it sounds like [[/u/silvercookiedust][u/silvercookiedust]] doesn't know of it? I grew up in Chicago and we had it and now I live in Hawaii and schools here have it.

***** I think it's just the term "fall break" I didn't know. I knew getting Thanskgiving Day weekend off was a thing; it makes sense to extend that to a full week if you're going to have a mid-term break. I've just heard a lot more about spring break, probably because that's the "exciting" one. (I like crime dramas; spring break apparently makes for a good time to kill people, especially all those partying college kids.)

** 1) Thanksgiving

I do not think that magic folk would celebrate it bc in the USA it is used as a way to ease guilt about the genocide of Native Americans. Magic settlers in America seem to have been more afraid of muggles than Natives. I think that the entire magic traditin would be a celebration of fusing cultures. Perhaps, however, the founding of Ilvermorny would be considered a comparable celebration to Thanksgiving. Isolt taught Native children wandwork, and Native children taught Isolt and company their magic traditions (left ambiguous by Rowling). Certainly, foods were also exchanged, like turkey. protip: we spell it Halloween. And probably magic people would still celebrate the fourth of July.

2) Travel

Honestly, I think something like the Knightbus would work. Buses are a relatively popular mode of transportation here. Buses based on region (a west coast bus, a mid west bus, an east coast bus, a southern bus and then east/mid/west Canadian buses).

3) GPAs

You've got it right, mostly. Schools decide what constitutes an A, B, C , D and F. Not teachers. Typically an A is 100-90, a B is 89-80, a C is 79-75, a D is a 74-70 and an F is a 69 or below. This is variable, of course, and I think Ilvermorny would have a different grading system. SAT or ACT are national aptitude tests that are intended to give intellect a number, to rank students. Most (probably 95%) require it, and then those that don't ony waive the requirement if GPA is high enough.

As far as Homecoming/Prom are concerned, it's really just a school-sponsored social event coinciding with the (american) football season. I suppose Ilvermorny could have similar celebrations for the beginning and end of the Quodpot season.

** Considering that from beginning in America there was a bigger disconnect between magical and non-magical communities in Britain, Rapport's Law coming into effect year after Thanksgiving were made into national holiday, and "modern American magical society" being formed largely by both wizarding immigrants and Native American wizards and you get a high probability that the Thanksgiving is not widespread.

** I've always thought of American wizards as fundementally different in the character of their whole civilization. Modern wizarding society seems to have tremendous holdover from late medeival times, but around then America was just being explored. This is what makes me think American wizards would definiatly celebrate Thanksgiving, because they would be much more isolated from the rest of wizarding civilisation and probably relied on their muggle neighbors more.

As a side point, Brazilians speak Portugese, so there would be a significant issue for Spanish speaking students there. Not much better than an English speaking school.

** Canadian adding my two cents, eh?

1) As mentioned before, Canadian Thanksgiving is in October to celebrate the typical harvest time. We here in the great white north celebrate (and when I say celebrate I mean these are days off from work/school or constitute stat holidays) Christmas, Boxing Day, NY Day, Family Day (varies from province to province), Victoria Day, Canada Day (July 1), Heritage Day (the name is different in each province), Labour Day, Remembrance Day and various provincial days spread throughout the year, though my knowledge of them is scant at best. In short, yeah, I think American wizards would totally celebrate Thanksgiving based on it's cultural/historical roots. From what I've gathered Ilvermorny has Celtic and Native American influences so it could be a nice marriage of the notion that European witches and wizards came over with the explorers.

2) Transport... Oh man. What a gong show. I can't stress how imaginative you'll need to be for this one. Imagine driving from France to somewhere in the far Middle East and you've approximately got the distance it would take me to get from my home to Massachusetts. Canada has decent rail-lines but it would be a two day trip minimum. Not to mention most cities (especially out west) don't have passenger train stations. Speaking as someone who flew pre 9/11 I can tell you it was easier but cost prohibitive. Flying to America from parts of Canada is absurd, and it always have. I could pay $200 more and fly across an ocean for the price it costs me to fly across a continent.

It's magic, so use your imagination!

3) I have no idea what homecoming is. That's an American thing. While it's true, we play hockey and a lot of it (too much but I'm just bitter they don't show the same amount of basketball) our love of high school football is much smaller and far less fanatical than our southern neighbour. We have school dances, that's still cool. But homecoming and prom is foreign (to me the prairie girl, anyhow).

4) As a tidbit of culture, you've underestimated the French Canadian component of Canada. They're weird (to me) but they're still Canadian, and they... Are stubborn. Incredibly stubborn, particularly in regards to language. On more than one instance they've refused to speak English to me when my (admittedly horrendous) French is exhausted. Terribly frustrating, and often rude, the French Canadians are probably less likely to trot off to some English speaking school run by Americans. I think they'd rather be shot.

5) Schooling is all over the place all throughout Canada. Here in Alberta, primary school is kindergarten (usually age 5) to grade 6 (typically age 12), junior high is grade 7 (age 13) to grade 9 (age 15) and high school grade 10 (age 16) to grade 12 (age 18). There used to be provincial exams in grade 3, 6, 9, and 12 but I think they got rid of the primary and junior high school exams (not 100% on this) and kept the grade 12 exams.

We've gone through several grading schemes here but from my time in school (in the 1990s! I'm old) was 1-5 system, 1 being you're a functioning vegetable and 5 being supreme being of child-like genius. Not quite so drastic but you get the idea. Junior high and high school used grade percentages and we did not use letter grade/GPA scale. That's university level stuff. I will make a mention to semesters because I know that hasn't been mentioned yet. Canadian semesters (at least in university) differ from American. We here start school in the fall after the Labour Day weekend and end school in the spring in April. Primary and secondary school go from late August/September-late June.

Canadians don't have an SAT so its individual to each province how to test students but we all take similar courses (english, math, social studies, science(s), phys-ed) that university's base entrance on. We also have vocational schools for students who don't belong in academia and would rather get a trade.

Also lets not forget that there is another school in America! The Salem Witches Academy was quoted in GoF (I could have gotten the name wrong-- its 3am) so I can assume there's other, smaller schools scattered around the USA. Most importantly I think Canada would have its own school, and knowing the French, probably more than one.

Logistically, even counting in magic, it would be nigh impossible to get a student from White Horse/Yellowknife/Iqualit/Churchill/Flin Flon etc... to Massachusettes. With such a small population spread across a huge landmass it would be difficult to say the least to get remote students to the school. Kids from eastern provinces (Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, PEI, Newfoundland/Labrador/New Brunswick) could have an easier time getting there. Plus I feel like we'd have our own ministry, and therefore our own schools, laws and traditions in wizarding Canada, but that's me.

Culturally speaking:

- North Americans drive a lot. It's a car-based culture-- public transit on the European scale isn't quite there yet everywhere (major US/Canadian cities excluded)

- Line up, not queue

- Check not cheque

- Soccer not football

- Apologize v apologise -- Americans use Z instead of S

- We typically live in suburbs, not in city centers

- legal drinking age is 21 (USA) and 19 in all but 2 provinces (18 in Alberta and Quebec); bars/pubs are closed to minors

- metric/american (kilometers to miles, liters to gallons etc...)

- baffling soda/pop/coke debate: pop is the usual nomenclature used for fizzy drinks in Canada and some northern states; soda is American nomenclature. Coke is a purely southern American thing that is a blanket statement for ALL fizzy drinks.

- tea is drunk here but not the way it should be. It can be cold, cold and sweet, with shit bits of candy in it. You name it, we have a tea that tastes like it

- gas/gasoline not petrol

Speaking of just Canadians here:

- poutine is real but not an everyday thing-- and it's fries, gravy and cheese curds ONLY

- We don't say eh, but we do apologise a lot (sorry)

- Canadians still use the u in honour, behaviour, colour etc... but it's acceptable not to as well

- centre not center, theatre not theater, liter not litre

Best of luck!

*** Thanks, I appreciate getting a lengthy Canadian opinion!

The Salem Witches Institute isn't actually a school according to JKR. She's said on Twitter that it's like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Institutes][Women's Institute]]. She only revealed that last year though and so many people assumed SWI was a school before then. I've used it as such in previous fics, but I'm trying to keep this one in line with the new information from Pottermore, which says there's only 11 major magic schools in the whole world (of which we know the names and locations of 8). Any others aren't registered with the international education body and are "often short-lived and poorly-regulated" and of questionable quality. Apparently home-schooling is a big thing among wizards.

Interesting info about French Canadians. I guess in that case they probably do have their own school.

As far as I know, imperial units are all together different than American (this is what my parents have told me countless times anyhow), and it is referred to /generally/ as American and /not/ Imperial. However, being as it's a school in America, I don't think the distinction should come up. Miles are miles, right? (I think so... I'm sure somewhere I'm completely off the mark)

Haha sometimes the stereotype is a good lead-in. I personally don't know anyone who says it, but I'm in the prairies and my surroundings are more 'redneck' than 'east coast fishing village.' Here you're more likely to hear people say y'all, yeehaw and howdy than eh. However Canadians /do/ say it, unknowingly, all of the time and it's probably the biggest character flaw we have as a nation.

** Getting to Ilvermorny - not sure how much of IRL Mount Greylock you're able/willing to incorporate into the fic, but there are roads that lead to the monument at the summit, so it's entirely possible muggleborns could take cars or buses. Mount Greylock is a significant tourist attraction; no one would ever notice. (In fact, my high school took several field trips there).

** The most important thing about magical society in the Americas, in my mind, is what was going on with the magic users among the fifty million or so inhabitants that were present before colonization.

Either a) there was a Statute of Secrecy in the Americas at that time -- possibly also intercontinental trade preceding Christopher fucking Columbus -- or b) magical settlers sent over Obliviators in droves. In the first case, you'd also need that American Statute of Secrecy to be sufficiently strong that mages in the Americas simply didn't care enough to intervene when their muggle counterparts were being slaughtered or dying from smallpox.

That's to explain why magic isn't public while the Americas are full of white people, which is a bit of a prerequisite for what you're dealing with. And that will give you some insight into what you want your school to look like. The next step is to determine which European magic schools had members in which colonies to found schools (assuming any of them got a foothold).

You also need to determine how much influence nonmagical education has on the magical world. Do magical employers sometimes expect employees to have college degrees? Are a lot of students muggleborn? Are their parents involved in their education? Do mages often have muggle jobs? If so, magical schools will reflect muggle schools a lot. Otherwise, they'll diverge.

This is a rather complex topic, if you give it the attention it deserves.

** A lot of these posts have been informative about Muggle America but what they're lacking is advice on how to translate that into a magical system.

For example, with Hogwarts JKR took the Muggle tradition of using letter-based grades (A, B, C...) and gave it a magical twist (O, E, A...). A largely similar system but with a more eccentric angle.

Similarly, if you're going to be taking inspiration from GPAs in American schools, just using the GPA system wholesale feels a bit too Muggle. Just like Hogwarts, I feel like you should take the system and give it an eccentric twist to make it feel more magical. So, for example, we know that there are such things as magical numbers. Seven is the most magical number, five is also a magical number but less so than seven, and six has traditionally been associated with bad things. So you could make it so that getting a GPA of 5 is decent, getting a GPA of 6 is disastrous, and getting a GPA of 7 is genius-level unheard of.

** As someone living in Canada here's my take: GPA is not so relevant before college, but you can add it if you like. It makes school a very competitive environment, as it's not only your grade, but your average versus that of the class which will be computed in order to give you your GPA.\\
So a student getting an A- in a class where the average is A may end up with a lesser GPA at the end of the year than someone getting a B+ in a class where the average is F or D-.\\
If you fail a class, the grade is 0, even if you were two points under the passing grade.\\
You have two GPAs, also. One given at the end of semester and one given close to the start of september of the following year, which gives the opportunity for those who fail a class in a semester to take it again in the next semester (winter/summer) and score a better grade, which will erase the previous one.\\
However, the GPA given in september is a permanent mark on your record and even if you take the failed class and pass it, you will simply have a 0 and the additional mark counting toward your GPA.

People, at the middle of a semester, can also choose the DISC a class so that it counts as abandonned in your record, but prevent the F.
