I'm looking for fics that don't feature Harry, or at least not prominently. Preferably they focus on magic. Please no Next-Gen fics.

I'd like the fic to have queer themes and to have at least 1 lgbt character per 10.

In fact I'll take fics where Harry is there but he's not the main character.

Like linkao3(How To Succeed in Dark Wizardry(Without Really Trying))

Self inserts are fine as long as they're not inserted into Harry and don't interact with Harry.

I'm just tired of him.

Oh and please nothing abandoned!

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8362471/chapters/19156291][Luna Lovegood and the Forgotten Circle]]: an AU fic with a few small points of divergence, but the main gist is that Luna's mother is alive and runs a women's magical collective/school as an alternative to Hogwarts. Some slowburn queer romances, though they aren't the main plot, and lots of themes of magic, wandlore, prophecy, and gender and queer themes. Seems right up your street! It's a WIP but updates regularly. Harry occasionally appears but is far from the plot focus.

It's definitely not next gen, but I'll plug my own fic in the knowledge that it's fairly niche so might not be your thing. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23957842/chapters/57621055][The Might of the Architect]] - a founders era, OC heavy story where two students from different backgrounds bond at Hogwarts while trying to work out what on earth Salazar Slytherin is plotting. It's an attempt to write a somewhat historically grounded founders fic, and the plot explores a lot of wandless and alternative methods of magic, and has a queer main character with a prominent queer romance, although at fourteen chapters in we're only just beginning to explore that. Other themes include power, friendship and isolation. No time travel, so I can promise you that Harry is absolutely not turning up!
