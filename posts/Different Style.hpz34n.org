I'm writing a fanfiction and was wondering how people would take it if I wrote it with a different style to the original books and movies.

But I think the style I'm writing it in suits it better.


** It's fanfic. You do whatever you heccin feel like and when people read some might like it some might not, but honestly as long as you like it that's the important thing.

** I don't personally care about styles, unless it's a "you" POV. I don't know why that's getting popular tbh.

*** Yeah I know. I'm seeing lots of that in other fandoms too and I don't get it. It's so annoying. They could literally use any other POV and it would be fine, but they've got to use the “you are in the movie!” weirdo effect. Like WTH? I'd rather have the Mary Sue character that is clearly the author inserting themselves into the story than the strange “you” perspective.

*** No it's nothing like that. I'm just giving the HP world a different atmosphere, I was inspired by a movie.

** If you're going to change your style from canon, I'd suggest not using the amount of said bookisms and adverbs (especially after dialogue tags) that Rowling did.

**** Said bookism:

"That was great!" Ron chortled.

"Yeah," Harry laughed.

"Think you're funny?" growled Malfoy.

"Thanks," smiled Hagrid.

Just use 'said', 'asked', 'replied', or cut out the dialogue tag entirely if possible. Also, change sentence styles here and there to keep it fresh, such as:

Ron smiled and said, "That was great!"

Excess adverbs:

"No way!" Hermione said excitedly.

"It's true," Harry said importantly.

Ron shook his head and said very aggressively "No."

Limit the -ly words after your saids (or said bookisms). Rather show the character's actions instead of just telling us it's 'important' or 'excited', etc.

***** Oh thanks! I've heard the concept, but I didn't know it's label. "Said bookism" did not parse for me at all.

I demured gallantly.
