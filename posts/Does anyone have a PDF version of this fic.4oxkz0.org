The fics name is Dangerous, written by blacklotus. It was originally on grangerenchanted, which isn't working anymore. So if anyone has the PDF version available, that would really be great!


** I have a zip with pdf, epub, azw3, and rtf version. Drop me a PM with your email and I'll send. (Same goes for anyone, not just OP.)

** AO3 is apparently trying to archive all of Grangerenchanted. You might try under [[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Community:%20grangerenchanted/works][looking at the grangerenchanted tag]] and see what comes up.
