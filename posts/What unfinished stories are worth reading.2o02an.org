** You might want to narrow the focus of your question a bit. The answer is "many of them." I could rattle off 20 or so without even looking at my bookmarks. If you're reading fanfiction and restricting yourself to only stories that are finished, you're missing out on some pretty amazing stuff.

*** Okay, well I like stories based around Harry or Hermione, or Ginny or Luna the most. I like time travel fics, powerful!character fics and very AU fis. Also like slice of life family fics.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] - in progress but incomplete. A very powerful female Harry, time travel (in a sense), and a bunch of really great "slice of life" scenes.

I'll second sibulo's C'est La Vie recommendation. One of my favorites, hasn't been updated in a year and a half, but I hold out hope.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Nightmares of Futures Past]] checks a lot of your boxes - powerful Harry, time travel, incomplete - but I'm guessing you've heard of that one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/1/Deprived][Deprived]] has a powerful Harry and is very AU, and is incomplete, probably abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2869936/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Hero-s-Path][Harry Potter and the Hero's Path]] is unfinished and abandoned, and pretty rough around the edges, but given the fact that there are 10,000+ HP stories whose theme is "big middle finger to the magical world" + "magically overpowered Harry Potter" that are really, really bad, you tend to appreciate the ones that aren't.

This is basically everything you just mentioned and even though it's unfinished it's mildly satisfying due to the plot.

** A great many of them, in short.

Though they can be annoying to read whilst unfinished, don't let the stigma of it stop you from reading what the author has imagined up to the point they stop.

An enormous amount of my favourite original works aren't finished, but there is a fulfillment to being dragged around word after word and then it ends - usually you can guess, but sometimes your mind comes up with awesome ideas for what has yet to happen, theories that get you all excited.

Personally, I'll read a fic to see what made the author decide to publish before they had finished (myself, I'm going to finish my fic, then release it). Sometimes you can see where an author decided to stop because there is so little potential for story advancement that it would become cliche.

Sort of like an anti-cliche - great ideas that are pigeon-holed into badly cliched writing because the author couldn't feasibly continue without degrading their writing quality of work.

What I mean by that is the author has derived a beautiful, original story that is of such an acute originality that switching to cliche (Harry is suddenly supah!rich and knows finances because !Plot!) writing would somewhat waste all that prior writing.

This is literally Hitler!Writing

** Two that I really loved to see updating are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie][C'est la Vie]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7694530/1/Midnight-Gold-The-Rise-Of-The-Forgotten-Lord][Midnight Gold, The Rise Of The Forgotten Lord]].

Both of them are Harry!Powerfull and Non-Boy-Who-Lived. The first one is Harry!Hufflepuff, that travels back in time due the acomplished prophecy. The second one is Hary!Ravenclaw, a lot more political and greyish Harry, but also amushing.

*** I decided to try out that second story based on the fact that you rec'ed C'est La Vie. Uh, when do the amusing parts kick in? I read two chapters and so far it's just a mishmash of badly written cliches, like multiple lordships, helpful goblins, and demonically abusive Dursleys.

***** Not op but I finally caught up with the story. I started reading after finding this thread. it's very interesting. Without giving away too many details Harry is at first perceived as very Ravenclaw- y and Slytherin- y but underneath his Hufflepuffness and Gryffindor comes out from time to time.

it was really really hard staying with the story . There was a lot of dry parts and in my opinion lots of unnecessary paragraphs in the middle. but towards the end the story picks up again.

I really loved how McGonagall's character changes through out the story though :)

** It's not exactly unfinished, per se, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5843349/1/The-Other-Side-of-the-Coin][The Other Side of the Coin]] by Zennith is a good shout for an AU fic, plus it's got a talented Harry.

Where the abandoned part comes in: I was looking forward to the sequel, but that hasn't been updated for a long time.

** This is one of my all time favorites. While it is unfinished, and quite unpolished in places it is fantastic and has a great character development of Regulus.

** A mix of Abandoned and WIP. The lower it is on the list, the more likely it is still to be a WIP. I really wish it was possible to share the list of followed stories on fanfiction.net.
