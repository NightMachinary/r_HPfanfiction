... and they use Wingardium Leviosa to defeat it.


** “What is that god awful smell? Did you forget to shower again, Ron?”

“Piss off, Harry. Forget a shower one time and he hangs it over your head forever... ridiculous, this is,” Ron grumbled.

The sounds of birds chirping rang from all around them, when, all of a sudden, there was a loud roar from relatively nearby.

Hermione turned her nose up and sniffed. “I feel like that smell is familiar, I just can't place it right now.”

Harry's mouth turned up into a smile as he let out a chuckle. “Not surprising, ‘Mione. You've been living with him for some years now, surely you've gotten used to Ron by now, yeah?”

“Again, piss off.”

With a stern look - very reminiscent of their time at Hogwarts - Hermione shushed Harry and Ron. “Get up, let's find out what made that sound and is giving off that smell.”

Well used to the more clever one of their trio's plans, Harry and Ron shrugged and stood up to investigate.

Wands drawn and walking slowly in a tight formation, the three set out towards where they thought the sound had come from. They walked past trees, careful to avoid crunching any leaves underfoot, scanning their immediate surrounding all the while.

“Smell's definitely getting worse,” Ron remarked.

No gesture or sound was made to acknowledge his observation, but both Harry's and Hermione's postures tensed just a bit more. Even though they were older and more mature now, they had never forgotten how to handle themselves from their misadventures.

Another roar, this one sounded a lot closer than the one previous, though. The roar was followed by a loud crunch, causing the birds in nearby trees to squawk and flee.

“Whatever it is, it's close,” Harry said.

As he spoke, the roaring beast walked into their line of sight, causing the trio to stop in their tracks.

The beast spotted them, stopped its movements and titled its head in a facsimile of child-like interest.

“It's a Mountain Troll.”

Neither Harry nor Ron responded to that, at first. Then, slowly, a grin started forming on Harry's face. “That it is, Hermione. It's a Mountain Troll. Do either of you have a camera on you?”

Hermione turned incredulous eyes on him at that, mouth gaping with befuddlement. “Why on Earth would you want to take a picture of this?”

Ron, quicker on the uptake, started forming a grin of his own. “For old times' sake, ‘Mione! It's a shame there isn't a bathroom nearby for us to save a damsel in distress.”

“No. Absolutely not. You two will not act like idiots and re-enact our first troll encounter.”

Ron and Harry shared a glance, then simultaneously nodded, causing Hermione to roll her eyes and sigh in familiar exasperation.

Before Hermione could do much to dissuade them from their path, they were already charging the Mountain Troll like buffoons. “We'll save you, Damsel!” Harry shouted, casting a few exploding curses around the troll's feet, confusing it.

“Never fear, Damsel! For your rescuers are here!” Ron exclaimed, picking up rocks from the ground and throwing them at the beast.

The troll roared in rage - similarly as its species-mate had done so many years ago - and started charging Ron, flailing its wooden club all the while.

Hermione looked at the scene in exasperation, though a smile was worming its way on her face. “Honestly. Boys.”

As the troll swung its club at the ground near Ron, Harry saw his opening and grabbed onto its arm, causing the beast to wildly flail its arms. Harry slowly made his way up to the troll's neck, hanging on for dear life, though not without a giant smile on his face. “Ron, look!” then promptly shoved his wand up the troll's nose. “Get it while it's distracted, Ron! LevioSA! I believe in you!”

With a flourish, Ron stretched his wand arm, swished and flicked, then. “Wingardium Leviosa!” As he finished his incantation, he levitated the troll's club up over its head, then looked over his shoulder at Hermione. Once he saw Hermione was holding her head in the palms of her hands, his smile widened ever more.

Then, he dropped the troll's club on its owner's head, knocking the beast out.

As it collapsed onto the ground, Harry and Ron let out cries of triumph.

“Granddad, what are you doing?”

Harry, still smiling, looked over at the sound of his granddaughter, Madeline, looking at him in confusion. Behind her were the rest of their camping party, including Ginny, their kids James, Albus and Lily, as well as the rest of the children and grandchildren of the Potter-Weasley brood. “When did you guys get here?” he asked, still grinning unabashedly.

Ginny, bless her, answered. “When we heard the shouts, we came to investigate. We arrived just in time to see you jam your wand up a troll's nose, Harry.”

Harry jumped down from the troll's neck, pulled his wand out of its nose, then wiped the snot off on Ron's jumper. “Yuck, that's disgusting. So you saw our heroic adventure, then? What'd you think, Gin? I think Ron and I did great, don't you?”

Ron looked momentarily disgusted at his jumper, now reeking of troll snot, but regained his smile at the reminder of his and Harry's epic re-enactment.

“I think you're both idiots, Harry.”

Harry walked up to his wife with all the swagger he could muster - which looked decidedly out of place on a man of nearly 80 years old. "But I'm your idiot and that counts for something."
