How far is too far for an AU? I'd be interested to hear what you think are immutable facts for the series. This doesn't mean you can't like the changes, just they go too far for you to still think of this as Harry Potter fanfiction. You don't have to be able to justify your opinions but what are they?

A few for me, Harry Potter is the son of James and Lily Potter. If those aren't his parents then no matter how good your story is I don't think of the character as Harry. I don't particularly care about what year he was born in so long as you have a good reason for changing it, but his parents were James and Lily. Personally I'm not bothered too much who raised him so long as there was a good reason and his behaviour matches any new expectations.

Magic isn't quantifiable. Harry Potter magic is magical to me. If someone tries to put it in scientific terms then for me its not magical any more and therefore not Harry Potter. A story with quantified magic might possibly be good but to me its not Harry Potter.

Magic is hard. The first book says; 'there was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.' Magic needed to be studied, worked at and practised. A prodigy can do this better and quicker but it still needs to be done. You might get a fun ride out of a summer of study but its not Harry Potter to me.

I don't need Ron and Hermione for the story to be Harry Potter, I don't need the story to be centred around Hogwarts but I do need a few small things. What are your limits?


** The essential personalities of the characters. I can't stand Weasley or Hermione bashing not just because I like these characters, but because to get to that point, you need to completely edit the personalities of the "bad" people (i.e. make them detestable friends), but also Harry's (i.e. turn him into someone who holds on to a grudge for any offense).

*** What do you think about AUs where Harry goes to Hogwarts late. Ron and Hermione have had a chance to develop without him there. At times Harry is the glue between them. Without Harry would it make sense for her to be the same obnoxious know-it-all we see in the first book? Where its not bashing but they're clearly different people because they've had different experiences? Are they still Ron and Hermione, is it still Harry Potter?

Would Hermione be willing to capture a journalist and imprison them in a jar if she hadn't be eased into breaking rules with Harry and Ron?

**** I actually think A Black Comedy did a great job with their characterization of Hermione without Harry being at Hogwarts with her. She was always the upright, rules monger and later in her life she's drowning her sorrows in Butterbeer because she's had a regrettably boring life or whatever she says. Without Harry, she never went on any adventures, never took risks, and never really did anything noteworthy.

**** That's a good point - it's very much a nature vs nurture discussion. I think no matter what happens, Harry still has a very big heart open to forgiveness (he managed to be a good person even after 10 years with the Dursleys, and managed to not just forgive Snape for his horrible treatment and pure-blood beliefs, but actually named a son after him!). Ron is still a good friend, with a unique understanding of the wizarding world. Hermione is still a bookworm, but after a few years in the wizarding world would have learned to relax anyway - she learns very quickly to look away or even participate in rule breaking.

*** A question about the last point. What if you change the circumstances change and Harry has a larger social circle than just Ron and Hermione?

For example, I'm writing an PoA divergence where Harry is fed up with the constant fights about Scrabbers and Crookshanks and hangs out with Katie Bell instead. The Sirius/Pettigrew encounter plays out differently and only involves the two adults, Harry, Katie and her friend Leanne. Pettigrew ends up kissed when dementors gatecrash the party, Sirius cannot clear his name but gets in touch with Andromeda, who adopts Harry. While not substitute parents, the Tonks become family to Harry. So this leaves Harry with more friends who stick with him when Ron leaves and Ron is no longer the link to a substitute family for Harry. I have no intention to bash Ron (I just want him out of the picture since I find him boring), so I intend to end their friendship over Harry being chosen as fourth champion and Ron not believing Harry.

With Ron neither being Harry's only "fun" friend nor the link to the only family to show him any form of affection, would Harry still as quick to take Ron back? Would it be believable if their friendship turned into something more akin to acquaintances you talk to occasionally?

1. Harry is named Harry. I really don't like it when he's called anything other than that. I also don't like when authors switch his gender.
2. Inserting technology into the story. (E.g. There was a story that I was following recently when Harry, Hermione, and Neville were gifted iPhones. It slapped me completely out of what I was /trying/ to read.)

*** Technology is fine. iPhones in the 1990s are shit.

Wizards will adopt technologies they find useful, such as cars, cameras, radios, and the Hogwarts Express.

iPhones with its instant messaging capabilities, built-in camera, and various entertainment apps should greatly appeal to wizards. But any adoption of iPhones should happen well after 2010s, not in the 1990s.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian's postwar fics]] do a great job of showing how a far more progressive Magical Britain began adopting new technologies to both enhance their security and improve their life qualities. Arthur Weasley worked full time on these projects and developed some really nice stuffs such as flying invisible cars with portkey function, and of course their own brand of smartphones, the MirrorPhone.

As I said before, wizards adopted tech even in canon, although generally several years later. Since HP world is set in parallel to ours, there should be interactions between them and that's what makes HP world so special. If you really want zero technology in your story, then perhaps a high fantasy set in the Lost World of Somewhere is more suitable.

But any story that hands out iPhones in 1998 is a piece of shit, and it shows that the author knows shit!

Unless the spells are actually weaker when you don't use a wand. But why is it considered a sign of superior magical ability if that's the case? This puts the average Native American or African wizard as better than the average in Europe, or, let's say, on equal levels with Bill Weasley.

  The magic wand originated in Europe. Wands channel magic so as to make its effects both more precise and more powerful, although it is generally held to be a mark of the very greatest witches and wizards that they have also been able to produce wandless magic of a very high quality. As the Native American Animagi and potion-makers demonstrated, wandless magic can attain great complexity, but Charms and Transfiguration are very difficult without one

Because wands require swishing and flicking and pointing and whatnot so it wouldn't be as easy with a single swipe (or nothing at all) of your hand.

I wonder if control over underage magic is more common there. Although I've always had a headcanon that it was the norm before the International Statue of Secrecy was put in place so children were discouraged from using it in public after that, as to not blow up their cover seeing as children are more irresponsible. I think Ariana though was very rebellious and therefore practiced it, leading to the muggle boys attacking her and Dumbledore calling it ominous and unusual. It marked Ariana (presumably) becoming an obscurial and his father landing in prison. And then Riddle was torturing people with it, which made him even regard it as more unusual. So it's a very bad thing for him as it reminds him of his family's tragedy. As a result, I think it was seen more among muggleborns and people like Riddle since there was no one to stop them from doing it. But Harry wasn't the brightest fairy in the bush soooo....

The International Statue of Secrecy was introduced because young witches and wizards were being targeted. So I would think a big part of why the law exists is because young witches and wizards would be at more risk of exposing themselves to the non-magical community.

I wonder why non-European wizards and witches agreed to implement the International Statue of Secrecy since it was primarily a European problem? I don't think, as you say, that young witches and wizards were as much at risk.

I would hazard that incidences such as blowing up an Aunt are less common when you're taught how to control what is in essence accidental magic.

*************** Yes, exactly. Power is subjective in the HP universe.

Yes, I guess that's the point of the headcanon: they could control it and show off before the hunts happened but were later discouraged to do so since it might risk blowing their cover and lead to another hunt again, making it highly frowned upon to do so and as a bringer of bad luck. This explains why the only two people we see controlling it are Riddle and Lily, children with no prior knowledge of the Wizarding World: muggleborns. I just never saw it as a sign of talent since, again, I doubt the average witch or wizard outside would be better than their top aurors. I think it was more common among muggleborns and no one really stopped them since they're not seen in mass numbers.

I think it was to help their brothers and sisters. After all, the Magical world seems friendly enough with each other. And it's not as though outside of Europe there were no witch huntings. They happened all over the world, I'd assume. So a disrespectful wizard visiting Europe could easily blow up their entire cover, which would be utterly pointless for them.

It's a very dramatic change, I can see many of them wanting to help out but on the other hand the politics of it might be difficult to wade through. Most likely I suppose they were also facing unspecified forms of persecution.

  A mysterious illness leaving a handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot.

**************************** Ignite does have romance but it's inline with the amount of romance in the original series. It's similar to the Harry Potter books overall, though there's a lot more action/adventure and leans a fair bit darker in tone at times. It makes references to Anguis (as that is technically a prequel) but it isn't necessary to read.

It's a cast of characters-Scorpius, Albus and Rose and others-trying to fix what's happened to Hogwarts in essence, with a wider mystery.

Hogwarts is left almost completely cordoned off to the outside world for the story-so very isolated. But the sequels are much more expansive with the characters travelling all over the world. The Harry Potter main cast are reoccurring characters as well and it takes place within the context of the events of the original series, so the world and the cast have very much been shaped by the Wizarding War and it's effects.

***** I have a similar attitude to the people above, and for me that point lies when they make Harry irredeemably evil (not dark! but evil). Harry's characterization to me lies in his desire to help and his capacity for forgiveness and understanding and this can manifest in a variety of ways in different AUs.

Take hpmor (my favorite, but a highly controversial fanfiction). It in a way completely changes Harry's character by having him be rational!, but it does it well and he always tries to do what's right and he still has a high capacity for forgiveness.

If the story doesn't have Harry (or a canon era character at all) in it, and it's an AU, I don't really feel much regarding it, because the point of a non-canon era fic to me is to use the world without the characters, and the AU is to use the characters without the world constraints.

**** (oh my, get ready for the long story, I just started writing a short answer and it got away from me)

Well, Alexandre Dumas is an author who wrote novels inspired by historical events (ex: The count of Monte-Cristo, The Three Musketeers, etc.). The original form and context of the comment is a bit lost in a wild cloud of misquotations and crappy translations (from the original french), but we know that he one day said or wrote something to the effect of "I might 'rape'/'violate' History, but at least I try to give her beautiful children".

Probably the most agreed upon origin of this quote is that a literary critic or random journalist tried to snark Dumas about the wild historical inaccuracies contained in his books (probably also angered by the depiction of the nobles and clergy in some of these stories... plus Dumas was black, or more precisely had mixed parents, which was not any better, especially in the time-period, so there is that), going so far as to accuse him of 'raping/violating' the great History of France. And so Dumas answered these accusations with the swift aforementioned punchline (hinting at the fact that at least his books were good and sold a lot), therefore rendering the critic into a salty and whiny mess (quotation needed).

Today this 'quote' can be used to highlight the idea that strict adherence to historical truth or any form or canon is not a necessity in art, as long a the result is good.

Also of note, I chose to write these two lines you quoted to illustrate the story in the way I see it, and they cannot in any way be considered an accurate literal depiction of what actually happened... therefore ironically illustrating the very point I'm trying to make whilst making it.

** Hogwarts. I know its an irrational thing but I've always considered Hogwarts to be the one thing that's indispensable from a harry potter story. I consider it the place where the events of HP happens, where it all started and ended, where Harry considers his home, and while yes you can learn magic in like Durmstrang or IIvermony but funnily enough, I've never thought of magic as what made HP so memorable for me. Everytime I read a story that starts with a lengthy arc on Harry's childhood or whatnot, all I can think about is "when is he going to Hogwarts?" I guess it's just that most authors can't write a setting that's interesting enough or even something decent enough to justify a complete change in setting to outcompete something that's already been so deeply established, although, I understand when people want a new and fresh setting or something different but Hogwarts will always be a part of HP to me.

Also a smaller thing but I've always liked that the story was set in the 90's which means that muggles wouldn't have phones/cameras readily on hand which allowed for the stuff like flying car, dragon, flying on brooms etc to happen without causing an instant disaster. That and there's no bloody pop song lyrics pasted on every chapter!

** If the setting is completely mundane---even, or perhaps especially, if it's a crossover with something /else/ that is---I have no interest. Magic in /some/ form that the protagonist/main character can use is one of my requirements.

The /actual/ form is less important, but it has to be /magic/.

If Harry Potter is a soldier with Improbable Aiming Skills, Improbably Fencing Skills and a Vibroweapon or other Absurdly Sharp Blade, he'd fit right in, in Metal Gear, but it wouldn't be /Magic/, and I'd not likely be interested when I'm looking to read /Harry Potter/. Harry as a threat or fruit-user in One Piece may involve him doing technically impossible things, but it's not /magic/, and I likely wouldn't be interested.

On the other hand, if Harry Potter was The Gamer, or a Naruto-esque 'Ninja', a D&D Wizard (or other spellcaster), a mage from Warcraft, or even---or perhaps, especially---he was Vanilla HP magic Harry with a few toppings, then I'm interested. Probably.

Quantifying magic, as you said, is a no-go. It's magic, not science. It should have its whimsical and unbelievable quality to be classified as magic but it should have its limitations and not be too OP. Just because magic exists, doesn't mean it can do /anything/.

There are shops that sell clothes and simple objects like quills, because they can't be duplicated a hundred-fold as they won't last.

Yep, precisely. This is one of the reasons Transfiguring yourself is so risky: because unless there's someone else who knows what you're doing and can reverse it, you're basically a goner if something go wrong and you accidentally transform yourself into something too dumb to remember it should turn back into a wizard at some point.

No, because Transfiguration is hard to begin with, and Human Transfiguration is /very hard/.

But besides, this wasn't so dangerous since there were plenty of capable wizards around to reverse the transformation if something went wrong. McGonagall, one of Britain's greatest Transfigurators, was right there in the same castle. As for this proving the applicability of Transfiguration in duel, regardless of the wizard's skill, nothing tells us this didn't take more time and concentration than it would be practical to muster in a duel.

And you specifically said "most people besides Dumbledore". Citing literally-Dumbledore (who is noted to have been particularly gifted/interested in Transfiguration, going by the class he taught and Marchbanks's comments) sets a very skewed perspective for the difficulty of any given feat.

And I must apologise with respect to Moody, I'd forgotten until just now that aurors are noted (by McGonagall in Harry's careers meeting(?)) to enact a lot of transfiguring and untransfiguring in their line of work, making adept use of such a spell entirely within the expected range of Moody's abilities.

Crouch, however, was only noted to have an OWL in the subject and, unless the Wiki is lacking (a possibility that is far from impossible) his exact grades were never given. Human Transfiguration is a NEWT subject and---while it is, I agree, quite likely---we don't, I think, have any evidence of Crouch Jnr taking the subject at NEWT level. I am open to correction.

In short, my objection was not in response to your point (which, as I understand it, was that most people would be unable to simply transfigure their opponent mid-duel) but to the specific clause given of "most people who aren't Dumbledore" and "at least ten seconds of impeccable spellwork and mental concentration". Particularly the latter point, since even an incomplete or an imperfect Transfiguration would be likely to be disabling.

It says "shabby", but does that necessarily mean "damaged"? Just thinking out loud, maybe the canon books explicitly say so, but "shabby robes" could just as well mean they're very basic robes that don't seem to quite fit him in size or shape --- which would be consistent with a non-Transfiguration-specialist being forced to Transfigure his own.

** I definitely need magic. I don't understand why you would want to a Harry Potter fanfic without magic. It doesn't have to be overbearingly magical but should add the necessary spice or background music. I like stories that explain certain aspects of magic but not in a scientific way.

Stories in which Harry learns some martial art in a matter of months through self study or actually masters the art through only a few weeks of study in some dojo, are also a stopping point. I have been learning martial arts for over 20 years now and it takes at least a year to reach the status of beginner not master. Asian martial arts are a way of life and a specific outlook at our interactions with one another and ourselves , not just fighting. So no stories in which Harry masters karate, Kung fu or MMA through books and then shows that he can defend himself without a wand because muggles aren't helpless etc.

That's something I do in my fics as background information.

** There are three types of AUs: Setting, Character, and Plot.

Plot is completely malleable. In addition, you can throw the HP plot into another work and I doubt I'd notice unless it was especially blatant. Plot is unimportant.

Characterization can be reworked, even more so if its accepted fanon or limited to a single or small number of characters. It's mildly important, and can allow me to call a work an HP fic even if the other two pillars are gone. (Coffee shop AUs, I suppose? I don't believe I've actually read one for HP). I recognize the legitimacy of swapping characters (PoV or the whole cast, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][/Alexandra Quick/]]) as well.

Setting is very, very important. I still read HP fics because of the /magic./ You could create a fic set in the distant future on a different planet, and if you still had recognizable magic, I'd call it a HP fic.^{1} This also has a downside, though. Even if I can deal with no-magic AUs (even though I don't recall any), I cannot deal with blatant reinterpretations of canon magic, namely non-conceptual magic. I have developed a quiet dislike for these. If a fic doesn't at least loosely conform to canon's rules or Taure's interpretation of them, I will, most likely, drop it. On the other hand, Hogwarts is not too important. The British Wizarding World isn't even that important to me.

I do, however, recall some sort of Middle Ages fic.^{2} I'd call it an original work with HP character names slapped on it. I couldn't recognize a single thing, even if it had Potters, Malfoys, and Hogwarts and some form of magic (can't remember). Conversely, I take [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12717474/1/Horry-Patter-and-the-Philologer-s-Stone][/Horry Patter/]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12299677/1/The-Universe-Is-An-Optimisation-Problem][/The Universe is an Optimization Problem/]] as true HP fics, even if they take the development of the world in a wildly different direction than canon.

Of special note is the inclusion of religion. I enjoyed what I read of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10847788/1/Goldstein][/Goldstein,/]] but in general --- in fact, for all fiction --- I am somewhat leery of it. I actually think this is a problem of quality rather than anything else. It does, however, seem to fundamentally clash with the world of [[http://shop.pottermore.com/collections/ebooks/products/harry_potter_the_complete_collection_ebook1-7_english][/Harry Potter./]]

** I really like this question.

For me, it's:

- The magic system has to be close to the one presented in the books and movies. No 'using the Force', no 'Core threads', no 'scientifically explained magic system'.

- The wizarding and muggle worlds must exist largely separate. To me, one of the key themes of the Harry Potter series is the separation of the two. Science should not be introduced to the magical world, and magic should not be 'given' to muggle households. A muggleborn maybe introducing a /little/ bit of magic to their house, or a house with one magical parent and one muggle parent having a blend of the two is fine, but there needs to be a very strong separation between the two societies.

- Religion doesn't really go well into the Harry Potter mythos. It's such a touchy subject, and I think JKR was right to sidestep the whole issue. I've read some very pro-religious fanfiction and some very anti-religious fanfiction and I think in all cases the story suffered due to the inclusion of the matter of religion.

- Similarly, the existence of ancient powers, demigods, elemental beasts, deific eldritch beings, etc etc don't fit into this world. Harry Potter is a largely human-centric world. While there are very powerful creatures (dragons, dementors), and very intelligent and sentient races (goblins, merpeople, centaurs), I feel that the only 'species' to have both sentience and considerable magical power are the humans.

This mostly applies to house elves, but I have seen the, I believe, mistaken belief that house elves are more magically powerful than wizards, mostly because they can apparate into places wizards can't. I think this completely ignores the point JK Rowling was making that house elves are able to do so /because/ wizards view them as lesser and do not take them into account. Not because they have inherently more powerful magic-just different.

*** Oooh...mentioning religion here is something I like a lot. One of my all-time favorite fics includes a healthy dash of Catholicism in it. It sounds very strange, but it features a Hermione who grew up attending the Catholic Church in her area and sings in the choir. She has a beautiful voice, and I can totally admire adding that into her character because singing is never really discussed in Harry Potter.

Anyway, I digress, but the integration of her faith (not overdone by any means) with her magic is just really well done in that fic. I enjoyed it immensely, and it's fascinating how the author integrated lots of mythos outside the Catholic Church but part of what I would consider possibly Paganism into the story as well. Adding in a nun who is a witch was a fun part of the story as well!

I've read other fics that include religion in the HP universe, but they usually incorporate more Paganism and Wicca beliefs and Magick as opposed to Christian religious beliefs. So far I haven't stumbled upon any that are either overly pro or anti religion, but I would find that likely annoying regardless of what religion was represented.

What about house-elves?

I think it's pretty explicit in the books that the world being very "human-centric" is a result of humans being massively racist against everyone else. Magic isn't a human-only power and other species seem to have powers and knowledge (like cantaur divination, or elf magic) that may be very powerful but are not treated seriously due to racism.

It's not really clear how much other species are able to use magic and whether they don't because they just /can't/ or because humans have interfered with them so much (destroying their habitats, killing or enslaving them, etc) that their civilizations never managed to progress like humans have.

** I'm with you on most of those, I love stories that explore or try to explain kinds of magic. Runes, blood, elemental. All kinds of magic is great.

There is one thing that bothers me though it is any kind if "wands are just limiters, but because I am not a regular wizard I was raised muggle. I can overcome this weakness." Any rants or talk about how foolish modern wizards are because of modernization, and I get frustrated.

You don't have to use wands to do magic, fine. But if everyone is using wands, they are probably superior in some way. Especially if Voldemort, the assumed educated and well traveled wizard still uses his wand.

Dance in the rain, and bless a harvest, sacrifice blood to the sun for some huge fire spell. Awesome. All good. Even some "wandless magic" which is generally assumed to be wand spells just without the wand.

But straight up superior? No way, maybe more flexible. Or perhaps you can make much larger uses and expressions of magic with some time.

I hate comparing technology and guns, but it is the most apt comparison when it comes to dangers of old vs new. There are much bigger, more powerful, and older guns sometimes to a ridiculous degree like the Gustav Gun.

But what would you try to kill someone with? A musket barrel loaded gun, the Guatav, or the modern pistol?

Sure an old revolver can be lethal, but that vs some modern pistol with special rounds?

Old stuff can be good, great even like the AK47 still in use to this day. But there is a reason things fall out of use.

Take Snape's spell, very lethal and quick too the Sectumsenpra.

People love throwing that into fics, and you know what they're right, a flash of light and an invisible blade slashes the target! Also it it requires specialized healing! Also permanently kills severed limbs, so no reattaching!

Modern magic people!

** They have to be in the Harry Potter magical universe. I might still read them, but having Harry and his friends just be old high schoolers and there being no magic doesn't feel like a Harry Potter story to me.

Usually, they have to go to Hogwarts. It also doesn't feel like Harry Potter if there is no Hogwarts. Although I don't mind stories that start recently after they graduate from hogwarts and it's still referenced a decent amount.

They have to start in character before slowly adjusting them out of character in a way that feels natural. Starting off OOC at the beginning just puts me off. And there needs to be good development when adjusting from in to out of character that it feels natural.

Edit: I just remembered one. Harry has to be male. I've never gotten used to the idea of Fem!Harry. In fact, all characters have to be their original genders.

*** Without wishing to get into a tangential "definition of science" debate, this is an overly broad definition of science. History can be studied and analysed. So can literature. They are not sciences.

To summarise a very complex debate, there is no single characteristic that all science possesses, but in general a science will have many but not all of the following properties:

- Reductionism (the idea that all things are simply the sum of their parts)

- Naturalism (the idea that all things are explained by natural processes)

- Unity (the idea that the universe works according to a single set of rules)

- Mathematisation (the use of mathematics to model and predict with greater precision than natural language)

- Empirical observation

- Conservation (the identification of properties which do not change over time)

- Symmetry (the identification of properties which do not change through transformations)

- Falsification (the idea that you must propose hypotheses which can be proven wrong)

- Peer review and other social institutions for the approval and disapproval of accepted knowledge

A lot of people think "magic can be observed and studied, therefore a science of magic is possible". But that is a massive over-simplification. People have been observing the world and coming up with theories about how it works since before the ancient Greeks. That doesn't mean they were doing science. Even methodic observation is insufficient to classify something as a science, if you don't have enough of the other properties. For example, conspiracy theorists will often perform methodical observation, but they do so in support of unfalsifiable hypotheses.

I would say that there are some characteristics of magic that disqualify it from being capable of being studied scientifically. Most importantly, magic does not appear to be reductionistic, naturalist, unitary, mathematical, nor does it follow conservation principles. All you're really left with is the ability to perform observations, the existence of social knowledge institutions, and /maybe/ symmetry. I don't think that's enough for a science. If it is, it's going to be a very different type of science than we're used to IRL.

** Harry Potter must in some way (Birth or Adoption) be the child of at least 1 of the Potters. And like you so long as he fits the expectations of his upbringing i dont mind him not raised at 4 Privet Drive.

The specific year the story takes place doesn't matter so long as the events depicted feature 'Harry's' childhood to early adult hood, with 'Harry' as the Main Character. I generally dont care about Harry's kids school years, or the marauder era.

Harry must at some point go to or interact with hogwarts, or must have in the past. Harry's love interest can in no way be an OC, unless it is a setup relationship or framing device for the story. Named main characters must at least 80% come from Cannon sources. I dont read Harry Potter fanfiction for OCs, the closer to 0 there are other than for worldbuilding the better.

I can not read Dark Lord Harry Fics. Morally gray utilitarian Harry? Yes. dark lord bastard who kills at the drop of a hat? No. Tom Riddle CAN NOT BE GOOD, he can become an ally against a worse foe, but you can not redeem this sack of shit or treat him as a good person.

Unlike you I actually Prefer Hard Coded, Quantifiable magical systems. I've always liked the idea that on a base level magic is magical with all of its quirky habits and whimsy but when you really try to find it and have a unique outlook you can find the patterns to magic and truly see it as a system to be manipulated, like a programmer writing code. And that our ingenuity or desperation in regards to magic can break or manipulate the hard structure of magic in a kind of Hard/Soft blended magic system. Honestly Fate/Stay night has my favorite magic system and i have zero issue with using that in place of normal HP magic.

Honestly it all comes down to the fact that i mostly read crossover fanfiction and i generally love Anime/Videogame tropes themes and writing styles so i have no issue with HP fanfiction being a bit loose in regards to canon compliance so long as i get to see an interesting story that makes sense with the changes that have been implemented.

*** Have you read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) ?

One of the things that I found myself really enjoying was the magic theory portions later in the fic. The story mentioned magical cores but it wasn't the typical "oh wow, Harry's core is so powerful! Second only to voldemort and dumbledore, wow!" thing that makes the trope so cringe worthy. The story had a brief explanation that no one really knows where magic comes from or that there's no physical core even if every cell was examined under a microscope. People just started calling it a core and iirc, the 'power level' was not about how big someone's core is but rather how well they can channel magic through their body. And there's a part about wandless magic that is a spoiler harry uses wandless magic but because of circumstances and forcing his body to perform an act of wandless magic, it means that he can only perform one spell or maybe to be more accurate, one specification of a single spell. So yeah, I think PoS really balanced the wandless aspect

And my favourite part was that it expanded on magic and how it's practiced in other parts of the world. I know its cannon that wandless magic is possible for certain societies but it wasn't expanded on by JK so I enjoyed the parts expanding on different parts of the world. Like how wands are a the magical foci in the west introduced by Merlin while further east, where that influence wasn't that strong, sword katas, staffs or body movements are the foci used to channel magic. All of them serving the same function but with each system having its own disadvantages and advantages. Sorry, I just realised I getting off tangent

That actually reminds me, what /is/ the canon magic system? Like I've never really thought about it but looking back it seems that it's more of a soft magic system with there being not much of a limit to how many times a person can cast something without getting tired, or any rules that governs its use. Is that what makes it canon? If that's the case, I don't rememeber a point in PoS where a character has actually 'depleted his/her magic' by dueling someone else or to do some sort of magic although I may not be remembering it clearly. So while I do agree the typical magic cores in most subpar fics are just grating and a disgrace to canon, I would put PoS into that category.

The fact that a lot of wizards can't cast the patronus implies that there is a range in power and ability. So how is that judged if it isn't quantifiable in any way? Also without it being quantifiable, is it possible to just constantly cast spells every second for the rest of your life? I understand the hate for magical cores since it's 95% of the time an easy cop-out excuse to say Harry is more powerful than everyone. That said, I really think a "magical core" is the easiest way to show that, while mystical and hard to explain, magic still has limits.

If Harry is /more powerful/ than anyone (he isn't much) it can be attributed to the same phenomenon in the real world. Some of them are more skilled in certain subjects than others because they're born with an inherent aptitude for it. It's not genetical either and thus pretty much unexplainable.

I don't think a magical core is necessary to make someone more powerful. Dumbledore is very powerful, due to a mix of aptitude and experience, much like Voldemort.

Harry has the aptitude but his experience is very minimal in comparison to them.

Then there's what fans, in the privacy of their own mind, will /consider/ to be the baseline canon universe from which their fics will derive.

Because i only see it in fanfics as some Harry superpower that can't be traced by the ministery (while the trace is not on the wand) and can't be tracked so he can use it secretly against his enemy. Mostly combined with him being the only person in the story using it.

******* Lupin casts a few wandless spells in the books, such as Bluebell Flames in /Prisoner of Azkaban/ on the train. The Wiki references tells me that Dumbledore also demonstrates wandless magic in the same book but I'll be honest, I can't remember when that was.

Tom Riddle could do crude, wandless versions of the Cruciatus and Imperius curses at Wool's Orphanage, remember? And no, that wasn't "accidental" magic: he clearly indicates that it's a skill he has developed, that he can do it on purpose. Same for Lily and the flower-opening thing in the flashbacks. There's also Harry casting /Lumos/ on his wand wandlessly in /Order of the Phoenix/.

Let's also not forget that House-Elves and Goblins constantly do wandless magic and are very good at it in the former case. Both are explicitly beings who could use wands as right as wizards, but aren't allowed because of the Wand Ban.

But again, all this is secondary to the fact that other indubitably-canon sources, like /Pottemore/ and /Fantastic Beasts/, written by Rowling herself, clearly show it to exist. And that's not even /beginning/ to go into more debatably-canon territory like the films, video games or /Cursed Child/, mind you.

But why would Tom /lose/ this ability? Which, again, /isn't/ accidental magic. Right there in the name is that "accidental" magic is involuntary. There's a clear line, I think between subconscious desires being granted by accidental magic, and Riddle who consciously, mechanically gets specific effects from specific wishes through specific actions.

You didn't even answer my argument that other species' magic /isn't/ different from wizards', it's all just magic, and it just comes down to cultural things --- that wizards invented wands first and hoard them from Elves, Goblins, Dementors et alt.

And /why/ do you disregard /Pottermore/ and /Fantastic Beasts/ here? Even if you choose to disregard the events therein because you don't think them to be well-thought-out, surely they're rather tangible evidence of Rowling's authorial intent. You can accept them as evidence that Rowling thinks of wandless magic as something that belongs in the HP world /even/ if you don't like the idea that Grindelwald looks like Johnny Depp and Obscuri exist, you know. It's perfectly valid.

P.S., not convinced by your "the Bluebell Spell was wanded" argument, and you seem to have conveniently skipped the /Lumos/ and Dumbledore examples.

Because, and this is the significant thing, all canon sources about wandless magic make it clear that it's pretty useless next to wanded magic. You can definitely do it with enough practice but it'll never be as precise, powerful or versatile as what wanded spells would do.

As for disregarding the movies, fair enough (though I prefer the Wiki's way of taking book over movies when there's contradiction, but accepting movie-only info that doesn't contradict the higher canon sources), but I wasn't talking about the movies anyway. I was talking about /Pottermore/ and /Fantastic Beasts/ --- e.g., info direct from J.K. Rowling.

#+begin_quote
  Pottermore is just incoherent hole filling
#+end_quote

See, this is kind of what I was talking about above. You're entitled to thinking that most of the new /Pottemore/ material is garbage, and keeping it out of your /head/canon, but A), this does not mean that it's not objectively canon in the absolute, and B), this doesn't mean it's not interesting data to figure out what Rowling's intent was /when/ writing the books, which should be without appeal at this point.

So if she carelessly refers to wandless magic here and there in interviews and /Pottermore/ and /Fantastic Beasts/ and stuff, then even if you don't think any of those things are canon narratives, this should still be extremely damning evidence that Rowling considers, and has always considered, that wandless magic exists in the HP universe --- but is simply rarely used by people with wands because it's not very /useful/.

As you say, he is able to focus it, which is what wandless magic is. Accidental and wandless magic are basically the same except for the fact that accidental magic is accidental, meaning involuntary. So Tom is definitely using wandless magic before Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  We never in the books see an adult do wandless magic.
#+end_quote

Yes we do. I am pretty sure that Dumbledore uses wandless magic a few times during the books, and Quirrelmort definitely does:

#+begin_quote
  “...and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you tonight.” Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.

  “Use the boy... Use the boy...” Quirrell rounded on Harry. “Yes --- Potter --- come here.” He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off.
#+end_quote

Both of these are in POS, and there are probably some more applications of wandless magic in the other books.

  Lily and the flower is movie not book.

I don't have the book for reference, but here is a quote I found on [[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/160325]], presumably from HBP:

#+begin_quote
  “But I'm fine,” said Lily, still giggling. “Tuney, look at this. Watch what I can do.” Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from themselves and, though the girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which Snape lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval. Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held out her palm. The flower sat there, opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre, many-lipped oyster.

** Apart from straight up bad writing, I've yet to encounter anything that's too far to the outside for me. The crazier the better. I especially love twisty alternative worldbuilding, alternate magics - codifying things or expanding on the powers - adding new layers of characters and culture. . .

Really, it doesn't have to share much of anything specific with canon. Any rule I tried to come up with, I could probably think of an exception to. I don't care what characters it's about, don't care about timeline, don't care about magic. I guess it annoys me when characters go throwing wandless magic around like it's nothing, but even that is borderline canon just not in Europe.

I /personally/ dislike romance-focused or sex-heavy stories, but that's the same whether it's a fanfic or a bestseller.

** For me, I only have a few hard lines when it comes to Harry Potter fanfiction.

- If Harry is underage, the story has to involve Hogwarts. Hogwarts is where the magic happens. Things don't have to occur in the way they did in Canon but Hogwarts stays. I'm okay with stories that take him away for a while, but eventually he HAS to go there.

-I agree with you that magic has to be mysterious. Magic can be defined pretty well, but not ever function like science.

-Harry is the main character. Perhaps it can be from some else's point of view if it is extremely well written, but Harry has to be the main fighter of Voldemort.

-Harry fought in the past or is currently fighting Voldemort. Without this happening or previously happened the world is far enough different that I don't think it is HP anymore. That doesn't mean I won't read it or give it a chance, but I don't consider it Harry Potter but an original story.

-The story has to involve at least 7 or so JKR characters acting somewhat like themselves. Perhaps that act moderately different due to circumstances, but they have to still have some recognizable traits. If all the characters are different except Harry Potter I would consider that an original story and not HP fanfiction.

Edit: - Also the statute of secretcy and no underage magic (unless behind wards). Both of those are important to me. I think the fact that the magical world is hidden adds a lot to the HP world
