I feel like I've read everything and a bit more, so now I want something of quality. My only condition is no major romance, no dark-harry or something like that, obviously no bashing. I'll probably edit this request if I find anything else for the blacklist.


** The major romance is a hard one.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** Exile by bennybear - After the battle of Hogwarts Draco Malfoy is put on probation and forbidden to use magic for 5 years. He ends up in exile in the muggle world, working through trauma and depression and struggling to figure things out.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile]]

Digging for the Bones by Paganaidd - third year AU. Severitus fic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/598019]]

Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood by cambangst - the trio have grandchildren and must face the threat of another dark lord and pure-blood supremacists on the rise. Murder mystery. The beginning is a bit confusing the first time reading it, but stick with it. It will become clear after about a third in.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647]]

Finally I can recommend pretty much anything by Iniga.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/49515/Iniga]]

I really like The Bureaucratic Error where Remus Lupin is send back to the beginning of PoA. There are some big chunks of Tonks/Lupin there, but it is not the main focus of the fic.
