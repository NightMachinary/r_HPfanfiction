Do any of you know some longer harry/hermione fanfictions where

harry is not extremely powerful like harry crow or some mad rational scientist

instead more like in the books?

Something like harry mcgonagal, that starts at year one. Just something where harry gets hermione, not ron, and no soul bond/timetravel/post

*** I have the opposite gripe: too harmony fics reduced Hermione to damsel-in-distress or research assistant. /Brutal Harry/ and /Blindness/ are just two such examples.

**** [spoiler] I think Blindness really dropped the ball by making Harry effectively not blind anyway (/spoiler)

** All of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/][Starfox5]]'s fics have a reasonably powered Harry, stronger than in canon, but definitely not over.

*** I like his fics a lot, it's a shame for us Harmony shippers that he seems to be moving towards more canon pairings fics lately :/

** Would be interested in this too. I'd also be interested in a Harry that isn't BWL, WBWL or anything like that.
