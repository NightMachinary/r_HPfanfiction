It has just occurred to me that I have no idea how the spell actually works. The first reason I though of is that because every country has their spells in different languages, the spell would accordingly show the time of the place that links to the language. That though was debunked quickly however since I realised that more than one country will have spells in latin so it wouldn't make much sense. Also, HOW is it that language would supposedly affect the time shown? So I decided that that wasn't the answer. After that I though of how even when the witch/wizard goes to a different country and uses that same exact spell, aka Tempus, they get the correct time for the time zone and it had me thinking of how that would happen. I came to the conclusion that every country or main city has checkpoints that have some sort of charmed object that shows the ‘correct' time. Those checkpoints would detect when the witch/wizard wills the spell Tempus to work and the specific currency for the spell would search for the nearest checkpoint and use the time there as the one to show the caster. This probably is not the case and the answer to my question of how the spell works would be ‘magic' but I just randomly wanted to know the theory of it. As far as I know there are no answers in canon and if there is one I would appreciate the information :). Sorry for rambling but I just felt like writing my though process somewhere. Feel free to share your thoughts.

That's because the tempus spell doesn't exist in canon. It's completely fan-made. As such, you are free decide how you want it to work in your story.

**** I had the same reaction when I went to check the cannon version of the spell and found there wasn't one. In my fic, the spell usually gives the hour and minute time, but can be tweaked by the caster's intentions to give a time in another time zone.

**** Just in case, I'm going to tell you that Notice-Me-Not as a spell isn't canon either.

However, 'repello muggletum' as an incantation is actually canon.

** As others have already said several times, the Tempus spell is completely fanmade with no basis in canon. That said, I want to give a shout to the way it's presented in chapter 64 of linkffn(Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay). In that fic, the caster has to be focusing on how they want the time to be presented, which can be both good and bad.

On one hand, this makes the spell flexible enough to tell you the time in a different time zone, or even present it to the caster using a completely fictional time system such as stardates from Star Trek. On the other hand, if you're not focused enough, it can tell you that the time is "now, in this galaxy," which is about as unhelpful as you can get.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

It's even worse than that. "Notice me not" is at least loosely based on a canon spell (the one used to make Muggles not notice the Leaky Cauldron or the Quidditch's World Cul Final stadium) even though it's never named.

The "Tempus" spell doesn't have any Canon root, and it's unlikely there are any since Wizards are shown to use watches.

**** Though their watches are weird it's safe to assume that wizards might use a slightly different time telling method. Though I believe the spell ok the cauldron is most likely a variation of a muggle repelling charm

***** I think weird watches are kinda rare in the series, at least only a few are specifically described as unusual in some way, which is not to say every one should have been described, Dumbledore's (has a dozen hands), the Burrow's (says where the Weasleys are at any time), Ron's seventeen's gift (gold with tiny stars instead of hands), and Dedalus's (enormous pocket watch).

Some people may favor something old-fashioned (like Fudge's pocket watch), but they are not as common as wrist watches (a /lot/ of characters have them).

******* Goyle, Montague and Pansy have wrist watches (nearly every Weasley and a few Order members too, Harry had three on the series), maybe they have something different or unusual, but even then it's not really necessary to describe how they work.

I am so annoyed with the Tempus spell I went to look for any watch mention in the series (and boy, there was a lot, even ignoring the Quidditch matches and characters looking for mischief and wrongdoing).

Harry's was not really described, I think, except to say it was gold, old (from Fabian's), and a bit battered.

** It's not a canon spell, so it's up to the writer to decide. In my case, I decided that a wizard who wants to be able to use Tempus casts another spell to tell the wand to check a particular clock whenever the Tempus is cast. Some people would see Big Ben and others might show the digital clock on their bedstand.

** It's a fan creation, but I envision it as a system of arithmantic divination clocks that emit a localized field. The spell, instead of doing a complicated divination of the location of the planets, does a much simpler divination on the value of the field. The divination clocks have two weaknesses: they are impossible to move without requiring a complete recalibration, and they are incredibly expensive. This means only the upper classes have access to the magic, thus creating the reliance on pocket watches for lower classes as seen in canon.

This use of entirely planet-based timekeeping leads to another major difference in magical society: there are no time zones. After all, a potion requiring an ingredient to be added precisely at noon won't care that it is noon GMT, it cares about the position of the sun.

Since most people are unable to afford divination clocks, people select a location to set their clocks to. Mechanical clocks have multiple dials, so a person working in the ministry can see London time to get to work on time, while also knowing when the local shops tend to close.
