I read this fic a while ago maybe 4 yrs ago. It centres around Harry and Hermoine, with their being a way to measure magic in number by shooting a spell at someone that has a gauging spell cast on them. Harry has lightly above average 80-90 with Dumbledore and Voldemort being around 120-150. Harry has an unlimited supply of magic though, it regenerates so fast it doesn't matter. Harry and Hermoine uncover a spell that can be used to give muggle magic and have them come up average power(around 50). The spell takes out magic form the casters permanently but since harry's is super refilling and Hermoine's is very high it doesn't matter. I believe it is set after OoTP or instead of because most fics I read are from that time zone. I really enjoyed it and am looking to read it again. Alot of the summers are spent in Grimmauld place and the Granger parents end up studying and going into a advanced Hogwarts Curriculum.


** I'm not sure about most of the description, but I do remember one with Harry having an unlimited supply of magic.

After Hermione removes some sort of magic block on Harry, his magic measures as always refilling to full almost immediately.

*** the biggest part that was different was that they were able to turn Hermoine's parents magical and they learned how to do spells for protection.

** I'll second what [[/u/wgates]] said, it also sounds like it could be one of the many stories by robst on ff.net [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst][Link]]
