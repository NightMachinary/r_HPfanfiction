Are there any fic's about a child of either Bellatrix or Sirius and them growing up, I just think the dynamics in the black family are really interesting. Thought of something like Sirius raising Bellatrix's daughter, or the child warring between the good and bad influences of their family. Idk if anything like this has been written? would appreciate suggestions for anything like it?(if not i may have to write it myself, bit obsessed with the idea!) x

** The only child of Bellatrix of story that I can recall (that's not a Harry is the son of bellatrix story) is The Estranged Star. It was interesting but there were some parts of it that I wasn't really into. Sadly it's also unfinished.

If anyone knows of any other oc son of bellatrix stories pls share them.

** linkffn(12531290) is a fic that has Delphini ( Bellatrix and Voldemort's daughter) as the main character and it is canon compliant although it does not adhere to the Cursed Child. ( Fuck CC!!It's not canon. )
