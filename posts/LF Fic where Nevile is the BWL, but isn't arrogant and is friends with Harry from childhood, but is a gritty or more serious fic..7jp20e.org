Somewhat similar to linkffn(The Other Boy Who Lived) but in this one Neville and Harry aren't friends, but aren't rivals either.


** I believe linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) fits the bill.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.
