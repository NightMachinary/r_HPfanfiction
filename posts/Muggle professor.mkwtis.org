I would like a fanfiction in which a muggle (It can be OC or crossover) is a professor at Hogwarts.

Any pairings is fine, if there are no pairings then that's even better.

Preferable were Draco gets treated better.

*** - “A Better Man” by Valandar linkffn(2531438), but Vernon is very happily married to Petunia, so no adultery here,
- “You're my Density” by RobSt linkffn(11033616), but I don't remember much about this story, just that there is “Professor Petunia Dursley”.
- “Petunia Takes Charge” by Leath1 and its sequels linkffn(4067744;4195056;4352237) Petunia is divorced and she is the one who is the professor, so no shennigans again.
