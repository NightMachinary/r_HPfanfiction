I love The Pureblood Pretense. It's so well written and just sticks with you for some reason. Yet at the same time I couldn't get past the summer before second year. But then a few months later it updated and I read the new chapter and then went back and skimmed the rest. Like I have such a positive view of the series, but at the same time... basically, long story short, Harry is ridiculously overpowered and I really dislike the overpowered character trope, yet at the same time the fic is so good. I don't know what to think.

I don't want to sound too negative, but I've already seen a lot of discussion on the positives of the series, like the immersive writing, the well done characters, the plot, etc, so I'm just going to list some gripes I have because I've never seen this stuff mentioned anywhere. Obviously, spoilers ahead.

Harry's extreme high level of ability is just a bit too much. It takes less than one term for Snape to think she's a complete genius, and by the end of first year Snape leaves her to run his Potions lab by herself for a week (I know that's an oversimplification and there were extenuating circumstances but for real? You can't leave an 11 year old in charge of a Potions Lab, much less one that's supposed to be making potions during a weird illness epidemic!)

And in the summer before second year are we really supposed to believe that this 12 year old was able to:

1. Concoct and execute an elaborate scheme to make a ton of money that involved making a shit ton of potions, all the while using her family's money for supplies and hoping they don't notice anything missing from their bank account

2. Develop the whole partial Polyjuice thing. Isn't that kind of a major breakthrough in the field of Potions? (And besides that, are Harry's and Archie's families really so oblivious that they won't think it's weird that their children are slowly becoming identical?)

3. Enroll and complete a year of a mail in course

4. Start renting an apartment for an alibi in case the whole stay disguised as a Pureblood thing goes horribly wrong. (How will this work? Will her neighbors really not notice that no one enters or exits the apartment for nine months out of the year?)

And she does this all within like 2 months. Granted, maybe some of this was addressed after I stopped reading, but I just didn't find it believable. But at the same time, I still love the series. Like, I'm looking forward to fourth year. I'm very conflicted.

Ok, I've said my thing. Basically, I'm wondering what everyone else thinks.


** SPOILERS FOR SONG OF THE LIONESS BELOW, SORT OF, AND THE FIC

I think this series really follows the tone of the crossover a lot more than it does the tone of Harry Potter. Alanna the Lioness is a bit like the later Narnia books, crossed with Brandon Sanderson, but written for the Percy Jackson age group. It is a weird thing to describe honestly, its been a while since I've read them. However, I think Harriet's character is a great mix of Alanna and Harry Potter. Some of the events such as a contagious sickness happen in the book too, but they are quite different in execution.

Some things you are not meant to question too closely, and one of the things that the fic does best is utterly ignore the being discovered as a girl trope. This doesn't really happen in the source material.

She has great capacity and power, but not much control over it, and all of the things that you mentioned have in story explanations. Snowhit and Aurora's Breath aren't beyond her ability, people do wonder and gossip about her apartment leading to its discovery, the correspondence courses are supposed to be easy etc etc.

*** I also used to read Tamora Pierce's books. While I think she's a great writer, it always severely bothered me that she always included underage sex / pregnancies in books marketed and written for the /Percy Jackson/ age group...I've also seen this a lot in quite a few /Harry Potter/ fics, especially with /Ãœbermensch/ Harry. Pierce uses the line, "but it's historically accurate", but the way she literally goes out of her way to write in something like this in every one of her books / series rubs me the wrong way.

#+begin_quote
  "With the fourth Alanna book, I had Alanna drinking wine, as people who could afford it in the Middle Ages did. My editor objected to this (not the sex, mind, but the alcohol). I reminded her that it was historically accurate; as a historian herself, she knew that, but she still objected." - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8adoeb/my_name_is_tamora_pierce_awardwinning_author_of/][Tamora Piece in a recent AMA]]
#+end_quote

Also see [[http://girlsincapes.com/2014/10/01/el-problematicfave/][this article]] about Pierce's Tortall book / Alanna tie-in, the /Trickster/ series.

--------------

As an edit, Pierce has also used "historical accuracy" as an excuse (sometimes very incorrectly, and very clearly, without doing any research) to defend not including POC / LGBTQA+ characters in works, despite some them taking place in a completely fictional / fantasy setting. When people objected to this, particularly when she told people "but having black people as main characters in /Agent Carter/ isn't 'historically accurate'", Pierce did /not/ react very well.

#+begin_quote
  "Which is more offensive to you: black help and blacks in service, or no blacks? I would like to see more POC, yes, but that was the time, and I'm not sure I'd like to see more POC if they're always going to be in service." - Tamora Pierce
#+end_quote

Meanwhile, Pierce included several POC characters in her own books, which, by her own account, were "based in the Middle Ages". So, according to Pierce, it's perfectly "acceptable" and "historically accurate" for her to include POC characters in a historical setting, but not others...for whatever reason.

Pierce also reacted in a poor / negative way to the "non-white" name of a well-known black actress:

As gross as it makes me feel to consider teenagers having sex, the fact is that they do. And for Alanna, Kel and Beka getting pregnant during their respective series would have been the end of their careers. Daine maybe not so much, but she would still have faced a lot of stigma. So it's kind of understandable that the heroines are at least /worried/ about it. Her Emelan series doesn't feature any of that, in part because the protagonists are that much younger for that much longer.

The Lioness series is nearly 35 years old at this point so I find it amusing that you're calling it marketed for the Percy Jackson age group.

Perhaps she should have instead reminded her editor that by the fourth book Alanna is a fucking adult and old enough to drink wine anyway.

This is true, some do. But the question is, did Pierce really need to include the underage sex in her works, especially when it's marketed towards YA, and children are reading these scenes? Even Phillip Pullman of /His Dark Materials/ (at least, the American version) didn't go that far in /The Amber Spyglass/, nor did J.K. Rowling with /Harry Potter/.

(In fact, Rowling herself directly cited "children would read these sex scenes" as the reason why she wanted to avoid putting anything overtly sexual in her books.)

Meanwhile, we have Daine directly talking about having sex, quite bluntly, with Numair, who is her /much/ older teacher and in a position of authority over her, in /In the Realm of the Gods/ (Pierce's /Immortals/ series, book #4). Even here, the area of consent is incredibly dubious: [[http://www.mlnlaw.com/articles/can-students-consent-to-sex-with-a-teacher/]]

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Because I'm quoting what the OP cited in their post: that it's marketed towards /Percy Jackson/-age readers...which it is. Tamora Pierce's books are classified as YA. No matter how old they are, they're still considered YA. If you look up books online, or go to a bookstore, you'll find them in the YA section.

Tamora Pierce even directly says this on her official website:

Underage by whose definition? Alanna's seventeen when she sleeps with Jonathan. Kel is sixteen when she and Cleon are considering sex. Daine is sixteen during ItRotG. The only character to actually *have* sex is Alanna and that happens entirely off screen.

All of those meet my country's minimum age of consent. Hell, most of those meet America's minimum age of consent (which, given the ongoing state of child marriages in the US is kind of morbidly laughable).

I acknowledge that the Daine/Numair relationship is certainly potentially creepy and definitely could have benefited from aging Daine up.

******* I explained the exact scenarios I have issues with in my other reply. They deal more so with older male/very young girl dynamic, as well as the focus on much-darker topics like [statutory] rape, that sometimes features in Pierce's works.

#+begin_quote

Pretty sure Aly and Nawat have a sex scene in the /Trickster/ series. Aly's pregnancy as a direct result from "mating" with Nawat is also depicted.

Also see: [[https://perceptionsofpregnancy.com/2016/05/24/appearance-may-be-deceiving-pregnancy-in-tamora-pierces-daughter-of-the-lioness-duology/]]

Likewise, Pierce herself said the following:

#+begin_quote
  "...not all marriages are going to be the same; it's a world where *most people of the middle and lower classes begin to marry at 15 and 16 and many young women marry around 18*; and not everyone is going to go into marriage with a solid and sedate marriage plan or way of dealing with one another in their relationship. Some of us--most of us--make it up as we go. Remember, we haven't seen the Contes or the Coopers in their married life before the kiddos arrived.

  Also, if you look at post-war populations, marriages and childbirths skyrocket. People want to prove they're alive; they want to prove they survived. They want to get married and they want to have children. That's what Aly and Nawat did. They lost three people they were close to, and they were still alive. *Also, they weren't exactly counting on having three kids at once.* No, Nawat didn't do things as we think people should do them. He is what? Three years old? He's still learning." - Tamora Pierce, "Marriages and Naming in Tortallan vs. Raka Cultures"
#+end_quote

The thing is, Pierce - again - uses "historical accuracy" and "research" as excuses to write this sort of thing. She also uses these reasons to justify it as "acceptable". However, just because you /can/ write about something, i.e. underage marriage and sex, doesn't mean that you /should/.

Since Pierce cites research, I'm going to cite this study, which demonstrates how (and why) teenage marriage carries with it a host of problems, none of which Pierce displays in her books: [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3000061/]]

My problem with Pierce is that she claims that her books are written with "research" and "historical accuracy", as well as "moral lessons", in mind. Yet, just from browsing her many instances of answering fan questions on her website, as well as reading her books, she more so uses it (by her own admission) for "wish fulfillment" and "because she prefers older men".

To me, that comes across as dishonest, and disingenous. If she simply wants to write such a dynamic because "wish fulfillment", then she shouldn't be seeking to try and justify or defend it. She should simply just be open and honest about what she prefers.

I also take issues with how Pierce tends to heavily romanticize, and portray all of the positives, but few, if any, negatives and downsides to characters to some of the topics (i.e. teenage marriage, teenage sex and pregnancy) that she writes into her books.

Despite claiming to want to include "harsh realism" in her books (i.e., again, with her citing "historical accuracy"), she often times portrays her favored (teenage) romances as very "fairy-tale-esque", with always having "happily ever afters". (In fact, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter][Babies Ever After]] seems to be one of her preferred tropes, particularly with the Tortall series.)

It's that disconnect between the two things that I have problems with, not just the underage sex / marriage aspect. To me, these two, contradicting things break [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief][suspension of disbelief]], as well as completely undermine Pierce's attempts at "realism".

Simply put, it's utterly implausible - and /impossible/ - to have a "fairy tale" ending in world based on "realism". The "fairy tale" ending, especially given the setting of constant war that the Tortall books seem to be set in, comes across as nonsensical and inconsistent with the rest of the books / series.

Yup, this is something I directly mention in my other reply as well. It's probably one of my biggest gripes with Pierce's works: her overlooking the /very/ big problems and moral issues raised by this relationship, simply because "she personally prefers older men / the younger girl-older man relationship".

This thread also touches upon this, and I'm not the only fan who's weirded out by Pierce's "preference": [[http://fiefgoldenlake.proboards.com/thread/18446/age-differences]]

#+end_quote

I don't think a sexual relationship between a student and her much older teacher / mentor is exactly "healthy" (i.e. how Pierce wrote Daine and Numair). As I pointed out, the very reason why this kind of relationship is off-limits to begin with is because the student cannot consent while the teacher is still in a position of power and authority over him/her.

/That/ is decidedly unhealthy, and portrays abuse of power and trust. This article also explains why I have this view well: [[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mikaela-raphael/why-studentteacher-relati_b_1435275.html]]

Another aspect I wanted to bring up is that this isn't the only time that a grown, older adult directly discusses sex, or the possibility of sex, with an underage person / child / teenager in Pierce's works. In /Protector of the Small/, one knight even confesses to Kel (if I recall correctly) about "being so physically ugly that he might have to rape a girl in order to have children".

Speaking of Pierce writing about rape in her books, there's even an entire rape trial / case that happens, also in /Protector of the Small/: [[http://tamorapierce.wikia.com/wiki/Vinson_of_Genlith]]

That's...a pretty messed-up thing to include in a YA novel, and way beyond what you mention as a "healthy sexual relationship" or "YA life including sex". That's not what I'm referring to here.

******** Your post is just way off the mark. This thread is about /The Pureblood Pretense/ which is a fanfic. It takes plot ideas from Alanna but avoids on screen pregnacies and teenaged sex. At least none that I see. Even at that, there are a ton of crappy fanfiction on FF.NET, AoE, and elsewhere that have first and second year hogwarts students thinking in a sexual manner. Thankfully /this/ fic does not include that fault.

You basically used a lot of words to attack the wrong author. Whatever faults Pierce has as a writer/person don't really apply to a derivative work where those faults don't appear. If this post was in a subreddit about alanna the lioness or Tamora Pierce you would be ontopic. But we are not.

Not all source works of fanfiction are perfect. Not even Harry Potter.

--------------

If you really wanted to attack the author of pureblood pretense for some deficiency for one reason or another, you could start with the fact that she cannot write 11-12 year old children well. I believe she admits it, and rather then try, she handwaves it away as "pureblood training". She gets somewhat better over time, but it's still a thing. I accept that and admire her work in spite of it.

- That is a critique that is relevant to this post, granted not this subthread. But I could post it as a child of the original post and be on topic.

You are not strictly against the rules of the sub as I understand it, but your post was in poor taste, hence the downvotes.

If you don't like having a calm and mature discussion, then don't reply. Also, the last I checked, though many on [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] seem to disagree, having a discussion about an author's personal views and books is hardly constitues an "attack".

Except that, as I've provided in my replies, her personal views /do/ affect her works. If derivative works are based on Pierce's works, by common logic and extension, they could've easily taken the less savoury personal views and messages (i.e. "black people pretty much didn't exist in history") that Pierce incorporated into her books. Sometimes, this happens without actually noticing how, and why, a particular aspect was included in the original book(s).

By addressing the faults in the source material, it provides full knowledge and context for those reading the derivative work to make an informed opinion on it, whether it be good or bad.

** God I love this series. I love it so much. It's one of those fan fictions that I can read a hundred times and still be excited for reading the 101st time. The characters all seem true to themselves even in the AU, fem!Harry which I'm always a slut for, more on wizarding culture and sane Voldemort, which makes him so much scarier. I love it so much. I literally went out, bought and read the Alana the Lioness series because I loved this fanfic so much and wanted to read the source material.

Edit: I saw the words Pureblood Pretense and went mad with love. There are a lot of unrealistic things in the series circa Harry's ability level, but I think the writing makes up for those stretches of the imagination. The only thing about it that bothers me is the very beginning of Harry's time at Hogwarts - it's quite stuffy and purebloody, and then the author seems to remember these are just kids, and we get the series we all know and love. Still hoping for a continuation. I know better than most that WIPs are pains in the ass.

A lot of the things you said get addressed in the future, and most people agree that Book 3 is the best so far, so keep reading, yay~!

I'm really excited for fourth year, but holy sh** this book is gonna be LONG. It's currently 132k words and not in Hogwarts yet. Yikes. I'm in love with every word, though.

About Harry being OP, I think the main reason I don't mind it is that she treats her power like a liability. Firstly, because it's a difference between her and Archie, and anything she has that he can't replicate is a risk to The Ruse, and by extension, her life. But also because she's scared of not being able to control it, or worse, being able to control her power, but not /herself/, and ending up doing something tragic and irreversible.

It's certainly not the kind of OP that goes I AM HARRY JAMES POTTER SLYTHERIN BLACK, HEIR OF THE FOUR FOUNDERS OF HOGWARTS, SMARTER AND MORE POWERFUL AND COMPETENT THAN EVERY ADULT IN THE WIZARD WORLD AND THE ONLY HUMAN THE GOBLINS EVER LIKED EVER SO NOW I'LL USE MY ULTIMATE POWERS TO START A REVOLUTION AND EVERYONE WILL LISTEN TO ME EVEN THOUGH I'M 11 AND JUST HEARD ABOUT THE WIZARD WORLD LIKE 10 MINUTES AGO, either XD

** You're not incorrect, Harriet is definitely an OP protagonist, but I think depending on how you interpret the events you listed, it could still be within the bounds of possibility. I'll address them point by point (feel free to disagree, I'm interested in other people's takes on it!):

1. I'm not actually sure she's making that much money off the potions selling? We know she has a pretty generous allowance from her parents for study supplies (she never mentions having to skip buying ingredients due to a lack of money when younger, even though we know she experimented a lot then too) and Krait seems far more impressed with the QUALITY of the potions than with how much money she's making him. Might be the margins on potions are very thin and she's not making much per case.

2. I agree this seems like a major breakthrough, but keep in mind that Harriet is arguably an actual genius in Potions. She's spent her entire childhood studying it instead of doing normal kids stuff; she might be the equivalent of Bobby Fischer or Magnus Carlsen, far outstripping most people in the field, regardless of their age. Honestly, what makes her truly OP is that she's that good at potions, but ALSO good at most other types of magic AND she's got any social skills whatsoever. For your second point, this is addressed later and relates to Archie and Harriet's shared Black lineage. If you apply Occam's Razor from their family's point of view, which is more likely? These two 12 year olds are masterminding a plot to switch places AND developed a potion that allows them to do so? Or "Magic did something weird"?

3. It's stated that it's a pretty shitty correspondence school. I think of it as the equivalent of getting registered as a wedding officiant online XD

4. I think we hear some neighbors discussing it later on in the story and there is some resolution later on that puts some people in the apartment day to day. You could also argue that it's an area where people don't get too inquisitive about their neighbors' comings and goings, for their own safety.

TL;DR You're not wrong, but there are IMO plausible interpretations for the issues you described, if you stretch your bounds of belief a bit. Plus, I dont mind an OP protagnist if they are still challenged by the story.

*** 1. yeah, and she has a cheap apartment and no aditional bills, because she doesn't actually live there, haha

2. I don't think it's really a breakthrough. Didn't the book say specifically to use the hair with polyjuice (and give it to a muggle, obliviating them later lol)? I think people just don't have that much use for the partial polyjuice. I mean, it serves her purpose perfectly, but polyjuice is mostly about transforming into a specific person, for anything else there are other ways to change your appearance.

3. yeah, and she's taking the bare minimum amount of classes (though they sent her letters for her to take more classes, since apparently she's their best student XD)

4. she told the landlady she'd be using the floo to come and go, so that's why no one would see her much. Also, later [[/spoiler][after Leo discovers the apartment, he mentions the neighbors never heard any noises, so he goes there sometimes just to walk on the floor and stuff, so it's not suspiciously silent]]

*** You make good points.

1. From what I remember with the potions selling, the profit margins were reasonably thin. What made her able to earn so much money out of it was using tons of money from her parents' bank account for supplies and counting on them not noticing. Really luck based and also a major risk.

2. I guess the main reason I don't buy that Harry could make this discovery is that I think of Potions as the magical equivalent of chemistry or physics. There are genius 12 year olds attending college and majoring in those fields, some even at the top of their class, but even so, those kids aren't making major breakthroughs. It can take decades to get to that point. It just didn't seem realistic to me that Polyjuice Potion has existed for hundreds of years, and no one has figured out a partial Polyjuice before a 12 year old with 1 year of research experience

2B, 3 and 4 make sense. It just seems like they're relying on luck to not be found out a bit too much.

**** Yeah, I think it was likely just a plot device the author decided she needed and decided to steer into the OPness. Although I'd be so impressed if the author eventually reveals that it HAD been discovered in the past, but it's not being used for some really important reason (like it makes you sterile or gives you magic cancer) and Harriet was just too headstrong/secretive to ask an expert about it.

Part of the reason I like the series is because Harriet's entire life is so reliant on luck to not fall apart. As you get into the later books, she starts adopting more and more masks and you can see the strain of juggling all these lies get to her. I'm hoping for an eventual collapse of her house of cards, just to see what the fallout would be.

***** Yeah, fourth year is looking promising on the things possibly falling apart front. Can you imagine what will happen if (who am I kidding, when) someone puts Arcturus Rigel Black's name into the Goblet of Fire? Harry couldn't compete, it would have to be Archie because it's a binding magical contract, and I don't know how they'd handle that. And it's looking like they might end up stuck being their original selves this year anyway.

Who knows what will happen. As you can see, I am still very into this series despite finding it unbelievable.

** The fact that she is talented/strong/whatever makes the storyline interesting. It's all about the pretense more so then beating the big bad. I feel like this story is more about when/how she will be detected then about the individual OP things she does. I have a feeling that the pretense will break in her 4th year and things will come to a head.

If you think about it, a perfectly ordinary Rigel has fewer chances of being detected. As it is, I cannot figure out how she makes it through the 4th year without getting detected by Professor Snape. Or failing that, the goblet will have Arcturus come out and it falls apart then and there. Hermione also has experience now with Harry who brewed a super difficult potion... But Harry won't be able to replicate the feat in America or even really talk about it as it's a super detailed potion. Hermione might just get curious...

** I agree it's full of things I normally hate; overpoweredness, contrived situations, Potions revisionism, bizarre misrepresentations of Occlumency, but is somehow excellent despite that. I don't really know; it just shows that when these things are done well they can be entertaining.

My main fault with it is it's far too long; the series just gets longer which really drags and probably doesn't help the extremely slow updates lately.

*** Being well written makes up for a lot. It's also partially that a lot of those things are usually bad because they are accompanied by bad writing. With good writing those annoying tropes are handled a lot more tastefully and are less problematic.

There are several other fics I feel similarly about, that have tropes I usually don't like, but are well written and I like anyway. Pureblood Pretense is one of my favorite fics despite all those things you mentioned, and several more you didn't. Prince of Slytherin has a ton of tropes, but is has them in a self aware way and attempts to subvert them, which is fairly well done imo. Lily and the Art if Being Sisyphus has one of the most OP depictions of Harry I've ever seen, but is probably my favorite in progress fic in the entire fandom. Though to be fair, OP protagonist doesn't actually bother me much, especially if they have other challenges that can't be solved by their OPness, which both Lily and Pureblood Pretense do. Sarcasm and Slytherin has a ton of tropes, and they are annoying and make the story worse imo, as it has them completely unironically and they aren't handled as well. But the story is otherwise well written, so it's still enjoyable to read even with them. It's basically a not self aware version of prince.

** It has been a while since I have read it, but I do remember stopping for the reasons you described. The fact that she is so amazing that she can run a potions business on the side, impress Snape with potions skills, perform insanely advanced spells and find a miracle cure for a disease all at the age of 12 just made me lose interest in her character and the plot.

I do tend to prefer a more realistic approach to characters and plot though. I avoid overpowered character tropes unless they are written in a very certain way (such as in the seventh horcrux or Lily and the art of being sisyphus).

It is likely that the reason you see more positive than negative commentary on some fics is that the readers who are not interested or who have a problem with the plot/characters stop early on. Big fans of the series are more likely to recommend the fic or comment with details and specifics.

** A bit late but I've been thinking about reading this fanfiction and I heard a few stuff about it. Mainly that Harry here is a Potions genius and she develops her own kind of mind magic and invents her own potions. You mentioned a partial polyjuice thing, what's that? Is it too overpowered because if that and the mind magic are too strong for someone who's just eleven I don't think I'll read it. Also, would you recommend it to someone who doesn't like AUs that much? It also seems to be Harry/Draco...

*** The partial polyjuice basically gives you some features of the other person, but you don't look fully like them. The plan is for Harry and Archie to slowly increase how much they look like each other over the years in order to maintain their disguise if someone sees them in public. I don't think the partial polyjuice itself is OP, just the fact that it was made by a 12 year old.

And yeah, Harry is straight up overpowered, though not in the same unbearably obnoxious way as the average OP Harry fic. I don't usually like these types of AUs either, but The Pureblood Pretense has an entirely different tone and vibe from most fanfiction, and for all its faults it's strangely readable. I recommend at least giving it a try, you'll never know if you don't.
