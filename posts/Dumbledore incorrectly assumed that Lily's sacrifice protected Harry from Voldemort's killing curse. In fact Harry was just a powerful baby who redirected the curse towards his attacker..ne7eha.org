The morning after Dumbledore left Harry on the Dursleys' doorsteps, aunt Petunia was shocked when she came to pick up the mail to find an overgrown elderly man with a long white beard sleeping peacefully in a tiny basket dressed only in a diaper and a baby hat while sucking on his pacifier. He also carried a letter saying "Please adopt me."


** Harry as a Baby only knew one real spell. It was also the only words he tended to speak. Just as Voldemort incanted the deadly Avada Kedavra, Harry pointed at the ugly Snake man and said "No u" and the curse flew back at Voldemort.

Later, as he was being left on the Doorstep by what would seem to any Muggles watching a crazy old man, Harry pointed at Dumbledore, and said "No u".

People were confused why a Baby was now Headmaster of Hogwarts, but when they realised it was Harry Potter, they assumed he couldn't do a worse job at least.

*** When Harry received his first detention in his first year from McGonagall telling him "You're going to join Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest", Harry responded with a simple "No u" an soon McGonagall found herself by shadows of people that looked like men but they instead had four horse feet.

Later on Harry also received detention from Snape to write down the records of all the wrongdoers in the last decade. "No u" Harry responded and soon Snape found himself helping Mr. Filch recording all the bad things his high school nemeses did.

*** Baby Harry saw his future life flash before his eyes and with all his wisdom and power went 'Me thinks not!' and made Dumbledore a senile manchild. Better yet, if the Durselys also see Dumbledore as a baby while everyone else sees the grown man he is and just... Stays away from number 4.
