** There's tons of him with Daphne Greengrass, of course. And there's also that adorable one-shot with the younger set of Carrow twins, but I'm sure you've already read it. It's super popular on here.

Are you cool with him being paired with a dude?

*my boy regulus:*

Linkao3(face death in the hope)

*Theodore Nott-*

Linkao3(forget-me-not) Linkao3(shadow magic)

*Blaise Zabini-*

Linkao3(vellum voices)

*Fem!Harry-*

Linkao3(Charlotte the Great and Powerful)

Slytherin Harry and how the different men in her life taught her lessons. No smut. Ends with her being independent and dangerous.

Linkao3(flecks of rust)

A strange girl saves Regulus from the cave.

Harry invites one sister to the Yule Ball and accidentally ends up dating both of them. It's so cute.

#+begin_quote
  Harry isn't the Boy-Who-Lived, but his parents still died, and Albus Dumbledore, concerned that Death Eaters might seek the boy's death, cast a powerful charm on him to make wizards ignore him before Harry was left with the Dursleys. Except, with the Elder Wand in play, the charm was far too powerful, and made others essentially forget Harry existed when not directly interacting with him. Sorted into Ravenclaw at Hogwarts, Harry lives a contented life with no one either loving or hating him...until the charm breaks on his seventeenth birthday, and he's suddenly plunged directly into the middle of a living world at war.
