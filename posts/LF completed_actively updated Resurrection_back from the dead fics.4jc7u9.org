I was reading Harry Potter and the Marauders of the Mind by Moonsign and liked the idea of bringing back characters from the dead. Does anyone have any other suggestions like this?


** Too Young To Die has this as Harry's end goal.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Harry knows now what he has to do. He's the only one who can. Everyone helps him out with the fulfilment of the prophecy, but he receives help from last person he would have ever expected, a relative long thought dead. AU DH
