*** For more accurate bot results, you can put the story ID in the call /or/ the story name and the author name.

So *(3688693)* will always get perfect results, *(What Lies Beneath by Master Slytherin)* will be correct ~99% of the time, and *(What Lies Beneath)* will not be as accurate, as there are multiple stories with the same title.

It's a good idea to use the first two suggestions for stories with generic names.
