... Unfortunately, when he goes down to the Vaults to see what he inherited, he is dismayed to find that the ancient Vaults are empty. Apparently the Goblins don't stop taking the yearly fee out of the Vaults just because there are no available heirs to add more gold to it, and investing in small businesses wasn't really a thing back then. Damn.

*** "Ah, a 72 hour ritual to rid your world of any scourge. WE MUST DO THIS IMMEDIATELY!"

"But Harry, we have the scourgify spell now. And it's free."

"Four hour chant to bring your power to new heights?"

"I have to go write a letter..."

Dear Tom,

Soooooo.... The old goat betrayed me too many times, and I know of the prophecy. So, I super pinky promise not to do anything against you if you don't do anything against me. I will further sweeten the deal and offer you one(1) ginger. I learned in DADA that they don't have souls, and make perfect receptacles for soul shards that were accidentally inserted into infants you tried to murder HINT HINT. Enclosed is one(1) contract stating all of this. Immortality is ours!

Sincerely,

Hadrian James Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Bay-Danza-Trump-Hilton-Gates-Jobs

PS: I decided to do a Blood-Renouncement Ritual to get rid of the Trump blood. Do you know how hard it is to write with a bloody quill when you have tiny hands? It's like asking Umbridge not to insult the "dark" creature that could kill her instantly if provoked.

Awaiting your reply,

** Lord Hadrian stared, the sight before him shocking him to his core.

"This is incredible! This is amazing! This is... JUNK!"

"Yes," the goblin sneered at him. There had been a lot of sneering in the hour or so since the results of the inheritance test identifying him as Lord Margrave Hadrian Black-Emrys-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Peverell-Potter-Ravenclaw-Slytherin, but Harry didn't care about that. The goblins loved him, since he was always nice to them and remembered to greet Griphook by name whenever they met. What he cared about was that this proved Dumbledore was lying to him about everything! And now he would have the power and wealth to put an end to the dark headmaster's evil deeds!

Except there was no wealth. Just some cheap paintings, old toys, a tricycle, a bowling trophy. The combined acquired valueless mementos of dozens of families shoved into one vault.

"Where are the gold bars... the diamonds... the negotiable bearer bonds, the money?" Lord Hadrian drew his wand and pointed it at the goblin. "WHERE'S THE MONEY?"

"In the bank," the goblin sneered again, clearly unintimidated. "Specifically, withdrawn from the various vaults annually as described in the contracts your ancestors signed with Gringotts to open those accounts. The deaths of the final survivors of those lines did nothing to invalidate the contracts, so we continued to take our annual fee until today."

Lord Hadrian paled at that, thinking of how many centuries worth of fees had piled up, between the flat fee and the percantage Gringotts took every year.

"So... the balance of this vault is zero?"

The goblin finally stopped sneering, though the toothy grin that took its place wasn't much better.

"I'm afraid not, Lord Margrave Black-Emrys-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Peverell-Potter-Ravenclaw-Slytherin. Gringotts was no longer able to take a percentage once your combined vaults were out of money, but our flat fee to keep the vault open still applied. I'm afraid, as of this time, your balance with Gringotts is a debt of seven point five million galleons, tweleve sickles, and three knuts."

Lord Hadrian nearly choked at the sum, before remembering that just this morning when he was still Harry Potter he had had a vault full of gold. It would hurt, but surely he had enough to pay the debt.

"No worries, just transfer it over from the..." he trailed off as the Goblin began shaking his head, still grinning.

"So sorry Lord Margrave Black-Emrys-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Peverell-Potter-Ravenclaw-Slytherin, but the Potter vault no longer exists, as of your inheritance test it has been combined with your other family vaults. It was already empty anyway."

"Empty?"

The goblin nodded.

"We did warn you the inheritance test was ruinously expensive, and you swore to pay any price necessary to "get one over on that manipulative old goat". Now come along, we have just enough time to get you cleaned up before it's time to put you on the auction block. Gringotts is going to get what you owe us out of your hide Lord Margrave Black-Emrys-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Peverell-Potter-Ravenclaw-Slytherin."

** Take it further and say that he actually OWES money to Gringotts because the vaults were emptied long ago, but because they remained open under the family names, the Goblins still want the taxes. So now, Lord Harrison Sacred 28 actually has to pay almost the entire Potter and Black fortune to Gringotts.

*** Also Ron warns harry because Ron knows of this. Since his great grandfather Bilius did the same mistake and Weasleys only managed to pay half of the debt even after three generations.

Of course, Harry ignores Ron. Thinking he is working for Dumbledore to keep him away from his money so he can steal it.

** "So how many Vaults do I have, master goblin?"

The goblin, whose official title was 'goldmaster' - which made simply calling him 'master' a slight faux-pas - sighed exasperatedly.

However, because he was a different species with a different evolutionary path from humans, this emotion showed itself as what a human would see as a sneer of contempt. This was one of the major reasons human-goblin relations were so frosty.

"Mister Potter-Black-et cetera, I'm afraid that you might be mistaken. The only vault in your possession is the one left to you by your parents."

The young lord looked surprised, which, because of the different sensibilities, was actually seen as a display of viciousness and threat when present on a goblin face. Luckily, Goldmaster Rkur was well versed in human expressions and did not see it as a threat. He idly wondered if the humans even knew.

"But what about the goodies? the gold, the books, the artifacts?"

"Those are with their rightful owners, milord."

The aforementioned Lord narrowed his eyes, which under goblin culture would be seen as the equivalent of a beaming smile. Rkur thought it was very creepy, but squashed the instinct to shy away.

"What do you mean?"

"Milord, are you aware of how inheritance works?"

"I suppose? When a dead wizard has posessions, those are distributed among his heirs, is that correct?"

Rkur thought it was surprisingly accurate, if very generalized.

"That would be correct. Well, most of the families whose titles you have claimed did not die out without heirs, and those who did had their assets handled by the relevant wills, testaments or the Law of Rightful Wealth."

Rkur leaned back. This was actually one of the three gestures with identical connotations. The others were nodding and speaking nasally to mock nobility.

"Take for instance the Emrys line, started by the human wizard Myrddin. When he died, his significant library and tower were bequeathed to his three apprentices, as was written in his will. The line died out with his death, as he never had children, but he was still recorded as a noble wizard and the name was therefore considered magickally active at the time the Statute was enacted. The records state that a wizard from the now-lost Mirk line and a witch of muggle birth each recieved one third of the library, while a third that requested his omittal from all documents gained the third part of the library as well as the tower. From there it spiralled, and the library has since changed hands many times."

The young Lord was listening avidly, a bit disappointed, sure, but he'd expected something like this. Wizards weren't idiots, after all.

"Needless to say, the vault under Emrys' name was closed in accordance to gringotts policies, all the belongings inside given to their rightful owners, and the physical space repurposed. I believe that particular vault has been in use a few times since then, and is currently occupied by one of our clients. The vaults and assets belonging to the other persons whose names you now wield were handled similarily."
