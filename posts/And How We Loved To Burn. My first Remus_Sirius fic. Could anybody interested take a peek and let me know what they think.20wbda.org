** Not bad, I'll check back once you have a few more chapters under your belt before I give a full review. 3.5/5 first impression

*** Ok thanks, I had intended for that to be the whole thing, just the two glimpses. Any critiques you'd like to give?

**** It's nice and cute and relatively fluffy, but it doesn't have that edge that make you feel like shit afterward because you know that ship won't ever work out. Still, its still a ton better than most of the stuff on FF.net (most of them are just smut though, but w/e)

****** Check out some stuffs from Julie Fortune/Rachel Caine (She's a relatively BNF, and a published author). She got the angst down really well without feeling over dramatic.

** I like this. Remus/Sirius is one of my ships, and it's hard to find quality stuff if you've been reading them for awhile. Keep going, you write very well :)

*** Doesn't help that most of this particular's ship greatest works are on LiveJournal, and a bunch of them are expired/deleted/friendlocked.

OT: Have you come across Fairy Boy or any other works by Auburn Crimson/Mieko Belle by any chance? She declared her works an embarrassment or something like that and deleted her FF.net/FictionAlley account. I can't seem to find a mirror anywhere else either...

***** Google (key term) fic recs. Replace key term with Wolfstar, Remus Sirius, RemusXSirius, etc..

Be prepared to use Google Cache and/or Archive.org however.

[[http://kari-kurofai.tumblr.com/post/14502031228/have-you-read-more-than-6-of-these-wolfstar]] has an OK list, although most of them are fairly old, so are automatically AU. I highly recommend Mercy, Pity, Peace though, the writing is brilliant.

*** Thanks, I agree about finding quality work, though I think that can be an issue with fanfiction in general. It's great to get some encouragement, people don't tend to leave reviews, so thanks again.

**** Usually with me, I'd leave a review only if its really good (or really bad.), otherwise I'd just favorite it or keep a bookmark.
