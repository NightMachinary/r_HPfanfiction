I'm seeking the very best of Harry Potter fanfiction! I've read some good stuff in the past but have now hit a very solid wall and nothing seems to be awesome enough. I'm ok for crossovers or straight up HP 'verse so don't hold back! ~Cheers! Edit for clarity: I want your personal favorites, ones that you could read again and again. Good story, good development, good ideas, anything that you would personally recommend.

*** This is frustrating af. The writing quality is high, but it is aggresively slow paced and filled with huge paragraphs of non-sensical, rambling, info-dumps.

Exhibit A: [[/spoiler][After a lazy breakfast that typically involved either cereal, muffins, or toast and jam, Harry and Hermione usually talked. Nothing more than mere talk. Those were the hours Harry found he enjoyed the most. They sat together, either in one of their rooms or on the living room couch or sometimes in the backyard by the pool. They talked about topics they'd never had cause to broach before. Simple, every-day things that had nothing to do with school or evil wizards. Harry learned things about Hermione he'd never known, and it was astounding because he'd always thought he knew Hermione very well. They talked about first discovering they had magical powers; Harry learned that five-year-old Hermione had caused the entire contents of a bookshelf to end up on the floor in an untrained, unintentional attempt to reach her favorite children's book. Her parents, in a panic, had taken her to a doctor, who'd recommended them to a specialist, who consulted his colleagues, one of whom was a squib and approached the Grangers and told them the cause for little Hermione's strange accidents. Harry found out Hermione's favorite flavor of ice cream was mint chocolate chip. Some day she wanted to visit Salem, Massachusetts, in the United States and troll through the libraries for authentic documents of the witch trials. Despite her assertions to the contrary, she actually knew a lot about Quidditch... and that she knew so much because of Harry's involvement and her desire to understand the sport he loved so much. She had a recurring dream about being the last person on earth. As a little girl she fought to the point of tears trying to braid her hair down so it wasn't a bushy, wild mop. Her favorite part of Christmas was the lights on the tree. Little things. So many little things completely apart from school that Harry found most fascinating about her, when he'd thought she was quite possibly the most interesting person already. He tried to reciprocate, tell Hermione as much about himself as she'd told him about her, but there was no way to barter fairly. The person he started with wasn't as rich as Hermione, he didn't have as much to give, his life was flat and pale by comparison. What wasn't a void was more than likely painful. Even still, she always listened intently, smiled and seemed to appreciate the pathetic little he could give. She seemed to enjoy their talks when it was his turn to share, maybe even half as much as Harry enjoyed listening to her.]]

** linkffn(a long journey home)

For me, this is the one story I can go back and reread repeatedly. The writing is poignant, humorous in parts, adventuresome, and awe-inducing. It hasn't updated since April 2016, but it's worth your while to read it.

** Personally I'm quite fond of NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series. Im a suck for mystery and mind-blown moments so I love this one. 7 books with a planned out plot from before a word was written. All complete too. Due to the nature of the plot set up, the first book is a but slow but it picks up towards the end.

+I will get a link soon when I'm less busy.+

EDIT: Apparently ffnbot hates me so I've changed the link to suit.

** "Best" is extremely subjective. For example, I don't really care whether a story has character "development", I mostly just want a good story -- whereas some people read /only/ for character development.

Can you be more specific about what stories you like? Otherwise, here's FFN sorted by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10][favorites]] or by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=3&lan=1&r=10][reviews]].

  What happens during the year after the battle ends? Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Draco pick up the pieces left behind in the post-war Wizarding World-a world where they are adults and Voldemort is gone in body but not in spirit... This is *mostly* based off of book canon and what JK Rowling has said in interviews. Rated M for some lemon-y scenes.
