Do you believe that in canon, Dudley and Harry ever met again after their semi-agreeable parting of ways in book seven?


** According to JKR

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Dudley would still see each other enough to be on Christmas-card terms, but they would visit more out of a sense of duty and sit in silence so that their children could see their cousins.
#+end_quote

I think that makes sense to me. They'd visit occasionally but never be completely comfortable. It's a big gap between wizard and Muggle and their rough history would make it even worse. What happened between Harry and Dudley was bad enough, but at least they were kids when it happened. I can't see Harry and Ginny being on good terms with Petunia and Vernon though. I think both sides would endeavor to avoid the other in social settings. At most, exchanging a frosty greeting when absolutely necessary.

My head canon is that the kids get along really well which makes it even more awkward for the parents.

*** Ginny annoys me in this. At the start she is pretty selfish (which she acknowledges later), and then goes to someone's (who she has never meet) wedding planning pranks. Even if Marge says some horrible things, I kinda feel doing anything that takes away from the married couple's day is not on. Marge might have deserved it, but did Dudley and Dudley's new wife? Those farts would have stunk up the whole room, and been loud and gross, which once is a laugh, but continuously? A good prank is one /everyone/ laughs at. What Ginny plans and does are not good pranks, it is close to bullying.

Of course she is also incredibly in character, so, I guess I just don't like Ginny.

** Have you read Cursed Child? Harry met up with him at least once post Deathly Hallows according to the play.

Edit: That is, of course, if you consider CC canon. Many do not. I like [[/u/boomberrybella][u/boomberrybella]]'s head canon. I can practically feel the awkward just thinking about it. :)

*** that pile of filth will never be canon. It was not penned by JK, and she got paid a crap ton to say it was canon, even tho the pottermore website has not used ANY of the concepts inside (to my knowledge).

**** Do you want me to respond to this or are you just screaming into the ether? If you just wanted to vent some frustrations, that is your right and you can stop reading my response right here. I certainly did not intend to anger you. You asked "Did Dudley and Harry ever meet again in canon?" I was simply answering that question to the best of my ability. JK did still say it was canon, whether she was bribed to or not (and why would one of the richest people in the world allow someone to pay her off for damaging her credibility? I don't want to offend you, but that seems a little silly).

*** To be fair, though, Dudley wasn't all that much against Harry; rather, it's that Vernon and Petunia failed to raise him to be a good kid and, also because of Vernon and Petunia, Harry was a convenient victim for him.

So, once he grows up, I can see him even if not trying to make up for it then at least trying to not completely reject Harry. Because they might not be the most compatible of people, but they are family, arguably more than Petunia or Vernon were to either of them.
