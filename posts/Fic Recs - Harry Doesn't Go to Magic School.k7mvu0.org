I'm trying to find pics where Harry doesn't go to Hogwarts or some other magical school. The wizarding world could think him dead or he never gets his letter, something. But I want him to be ignorant of the wizarding world, maybe eventually finding out after figuring out some magic on his own.

Thank you!

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
