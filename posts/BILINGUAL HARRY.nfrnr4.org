** I mean... Technically he is bilingual as he speaks both English and Parseltounge.

If you meant other languages, then there is a fic where Harry learns languages magically. In Apex by JustBored21 he learms French using some method from the Chamber of Secrets.

I also remember a fic where he learns languages by eating some sweet which allowed him to learn them magicall. But I don't remember its name, unfortunately

  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.

** Wouldn't that be any fic that portrays him as a Parselmouth?

If you're looking for real language though, linkffn(3766574) portrays Harry as both a German and an English speaker.
