Hey there! Are there any fanfics where Harry is either being completely shunned be it because of the Tri-Wizard Tournament or the DoM battle?

And are there fics where due to that shunning or the results of the DoM battle (Sirius) Harry turns suicidal but get prevented from going through with it thanks to a girl or girls?

P.S: Not all shunned fics have to lead to him being suicidal.


** linkffn(Rage by TheGirlWithFarTooManyIdeas) and Enslavement by Jeconais on fanficauthors.net are both good.

In this unlikely relationship, the three plot to bring down Voldemort and escape the society that tried to destroy them. Dark, violent, potential H/H/F pairing

** Not exactly what you wanted as it's a 3rd year story, so not about Harry being shunned, but it deals really well with suicide as attempted by two characters. Severitus. Complete. No sequel, although I wish there was one.

*** No, I did not mean that. I meant that Harry reaches a low point in his life like a depression from Sirius death and begin to think of suicide but a girl/girls manage to penetrate through the depression and the suicidal thoughts by showing him, love.

******* Itsjustme1505 seems to be presupposing that all depressive tendencies and suicidal ideation stems from the same place.

Which is horseshit, but is probably more a reflection of our limited vocabulary when it comes to mental health.

I think I understand the type of story you're looking for, one where the foundations of what Harry fights for are removed and he has to find something new to believe in and fight for. Sadly I haven't come across anything like that =(

  Harry is at the end of his rope; he's no saviour, he's just a frightened and hurting adolescent who has been asked to do too much. The prophecy was the last straw. Can McGonagall do something now? Or is it too late? Trigger Warnings on individual chapters although suicide is a strong theme.
