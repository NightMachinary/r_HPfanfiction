*** 1. Horcrux, we can have harry-mort and ginny-mort who are secretly voldemort. May be slash or nonslash.

2. Clone. may be slash or nonslash

3. Polyjuice. Is this slash?

4. Time travel shenanigans. Obviously slash.

5. Dimensional travel shenanigans. May be slash or non-slash.

I kinda want a soul bond story where there is a feedback loop in the sex.

*** I'm curious. For science though. When you have identical gene, what is the probability for defect in the child?

** linkffn(HP and the Sword of Gryffindor by cloneserpents) has an entertaining chapter where Harry and Hermione use a multiplicity of Time Turning to get mega-kinky. No slash to speak of, except as a comedic aside.
