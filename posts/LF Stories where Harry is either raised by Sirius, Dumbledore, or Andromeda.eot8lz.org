As it says in the title.

NO Character bashing. Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but an author going out of their way to bash characters is a NO go.

NO OP Harry.. No Harem Harry. No Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor, et cetra.

Harry slightly more powerful, or slightly smarter is fine, but I'd rather it be as believable as possible.

Bonus if Harry learns about the Prophecy sooner rather than later, but that's not mandatory.

NO Harry/Hermione, no Draco/Hermione

Am Fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be on any site.

Would rather be completed, but if not that's fine.

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. M for later. Eventual Hinny.
