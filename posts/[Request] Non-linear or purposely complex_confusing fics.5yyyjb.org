Stuff where the story isn't straightforward, making you wonder what the hell it's all about. Likely to be densely plotted.

Examples: linkffn(Clash by shezwriter; Ad Infinitum by Speechwriter)

Little to no romance preferred.

Length and completeness don't matter. Edit: Crossovers and fusions are fine too.


** I forget the name, but hopefully someone remembers.

Basically, once Voldemort realizes he can send visions to Harry via their link, he starts messing with his mind. Every other chapter is a flashback to Voldemort's past, and Harry starts to lose sight of what is actually reality and what is a Voldemort-induced vision. It was really well written and it wasn't until the end that it all came together.

Also (also forgot the name) there's one where Harry gets trapped in Azkaban with Rodulphus Lestrange, an auror, Mundungus, and a girl and has to escape. But things don't make sense and he slowly starts piecing it all together.

*** Thanks! I'd started reading this one a while back. The main characters are ones I don't usually read together, but I did like the writing and had forgot the title.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
