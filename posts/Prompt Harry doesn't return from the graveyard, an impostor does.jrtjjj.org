Could somebody write an AU where Harry died in the graveyard (you can leave out the horcrux-blood-resurrection thing or you could have Harry wake up from the Killing Curse and then die) and then Wormtail used Polyjuice potion to take his place, returning to Hogwarts as Harry.

The reason why I think this is possible is as outlined in their video - there was another plan at work in Goblet of Fire. Why did the Portkey work two ways? Especially if they had no intention of bringing back Harry's body as a message of Voldy's return since it would be a better strategy to build strength in the shadows? But Harry's death must be covered up somehow- and who better to pretend to be Harry then the rat who was his best friend's familiar?

I normally don't go for AU but I watched a SuperCarlinBrothers video that made me seriously consider this direction in the storyline.

If somebody does write this, please go heavy on the Harry-Sirius/ Harry-Ron-Hermione angst when they find out that Harry is dead/ isn't Harry.


** I also always kind of imagined something along those lines, but it would be Voldemort who poses as Harry in order to kill Dumbledore. That or the cup was by default a portkey that would take the champion out of the maze.
