The Triwizard Tournament only brings diversity from other European countries within a 1000 mile radius.

But I have a way to not only to add more diversity, but maybe even another subplot.

There is this thing called the Wizarding Schools Potions Championship.

It includes the Schools of Hogwarts, Koldovstoretz, Mahoutokoro, and Uagadou.

Now the event takes place every 7 years, including 1995, maybe it could even be spring 1995.

What if a character like Cho was the Hogwarts champion for this event?

How could this effect the Triwizard Tournament?

Maybe Cho thought Cedric was cute and asked him to help her, even though she did not need anything, and them spending time together made them friends, eventually becoming a couple at the Yule Ball?

What if Cho started to see Harry in a more friendly light after he helped Cedric?

And as a result became more interested in him during DADA lessons in the following book?

What if all of these things did happen, but was glossed over by Rowling?

Tell me your thoughts

** A fifth year whose academic side is never mentioned competing in academic world championships? I doubt that Hermione would do well there, never mind Cho. You'd need someone like Snape, or maybe Lily, but without the instinctive potion knowledge those two are described to have, any contester would simply be filler while the professionals do their thing.

Don't get me wrong, I'd like to read a good Harry/Cho story (like The Headman's hostage), but I don't think that your idea for a subplot is unnecessarily complicated if that's your endgame (and GoF doesn't really need a huge side plot).

As for the international stuff, the Australian school would be unsustainable due to low population numbers (roughly 40 students in total) while the African and Asian would probably use their own kinds magic. And if you want some interesting international stuff, just try to come up with the magical world for Germany and Eastern Europe whilst trying to make that rooted in history and play around the Balkan wars, the HRE, Prussia, the PLC, Habsburg inheritances, the Religious Leagues and so on. Because unlike Britain or France, Borders were drawn and redrawn constantly during the last three centuries (since the statute of Secrecy), so good luck trying to fit in countries which ceased to exist (Prussia, Austria Hungary, the Ottomans) and those which are (relatively) recent inventions (Balkans, Baltic States).

*** Where did you get that forty student figure? That seems far too small.

Hogwarts should be at about 300 students during Harry's tenure there. Ten students (five boys, five girls) per year makes 70, times four houses makes 280...throw in that Harry's year is probably slightly smaller than normal because of the war/Ginny's year and the year below might be a bit bigger because of a post-war baby boom, that gives you roughly 300.

Australia's population is smaller than Britain's, but not so much smaller that it would be just 40 kids at school. Britain is at roughly 65 million people, Australia is at roughly 25 millon - that puts Australia somewhere between 1/2 and 1/3 the size of Britain, so if the rate magic appears in the population is roughly the same that should be around 100 to 130 Australian students in the school. Say 100, make it a smaller estimate.

Throw in one or two dozen from NZ or other countries in the Pacific like Fiji, PNG, the Solomon Islands...a school in Australia would have to cover more countries than /just/ Australia, because there's no other school of magic for a thousand miles in any direction.

****** The name implies aboriginal roots, not Western magic (and I believe having each region develop their unique magic is way more interesting than just all the same but Australia gets spirit visions).

Then again, 11 schools worldwide makes no sense unless Mao purged all magicals from his country and the African one is larger than the Holy See.

******* Plenty of Australian things (even those founded later) have indigenous names. Have you SEEN a map of the place?

I doubt it was founded pre-settlement simply because...honestly, what language would it have used pre-settlement? There are HUNDREDS of languages, and there used to be twice as many! There's not just one single coherent “Aboriginal culture” as there is in NZ with the Maori - groups share some experiences, and some things appear a lot across the continent, but there are so many different cultural groupings and languages.

Pre-settlement unique magic definitely existed. The song lines are old magic, there's magic in the rock art...and in Harry's time, this stuff is covered in classes. Pre-settlement magic was a thing, but not a pre-settlement school - if you had magic before the tall ships came, you'd be sent to someone else who had it and they would teach you.

Spirit visions is a thing for the named African school. There's been basically nothing about Australia. We don't even HAVE a name for Australian School yet.

And again, I wasn't talking about the name. I was talking about the size.

******** There isn't anything useful on most of Europe, which I'd rate slightly more important than a continent of 35 millions. Or how various regimes with purge tendencies (Soviet Union, China) dealt with magic. Or the two China question. Are the Qing still in power? What about magic during the thirty years war?

I'd argue that all schools focus on their ingenious magics and not on the European form with wands. Because whilst wands, like modern firearms, are the superior weapon (insert Imperialism comparison here), large scale climate manipulation (rain dances) are way more interesting imo. Also, it wouldn't be that far fetched to believe that the native magicals were all but wiped out by European diseases, magical Imperialism or that they managed to wipe themselves out completely without western influences.

Tl;dr: Trying to come up with a global magical world is bloody complicated because you have to balance real history, magical stuff and possible interferences.

********** My thoughts about it are pretty simple. I don't care about Rowling's limit to ~11 schools worldwide. Because if a country of 56 millions can fill Hogwarts (and it used to be a lot more students from a lot fewer people, 11 schools wouldn't cut it at all. Even if Mao, Stalin and Hitler purged magic, there'd be way too many students for way too few schools. Logistics would be a nightmare, communications neigh impossible and ethnic murders a regular thing.

So there's an Australian school with an aboriginal name - > It's for Aborigines. Which would give you 40 students at most. More like 20 (using Rowling's muggle/magical ration). The European immigrants have their own school, probably a smaller scale Hogwarts in a normal building. They learn Western magic.

Those are my thoughts on Australia and magic. I'm German, I like history and trying to make sense of Europe for a headcanon is already difficult enough. Especially considering that most magical nations would still be monarchies (since the abolishment movements came from lost wars, which witches and wizards don't care about).

*********** Why would the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal students be separated?

Australia has people from all over the world. By Harry's time fully a third of the population were born overseas, and if you raise it to “either you or your parents were born overseas” it's half. Are you going to tell me that the indigenous kids have one, the “European” kids have one, the “Asian” kids have one...

Why not just /one/, with all of them?

As I said, plenty of Australian places have indigenous names. Most landmarks have both English and indigenous-derived names - compare “Uluru” with “Ayers Rock” or “Grampians” with “Gariwerd”. There are thousands of towns with indigenous names. Having an indigenous name but mostly non-indigenous inhabitants would not be weird. As a name, it would probably fit in with Muggle Australia better than “Hogwarts” does with Muggle Britain.

************ Because they practice different kinds of magic (at least in my headcanon). I'm assuming that their magic is part of their cultural heritage, something generally spread through the family/tribe and not given to strangers. Something they are fiercely protective of, much like any successful formula for anything.

************* They probably DO have unique forms of magic...but they'd also need to learn "Western" magic too, in the same way that an indigenous kid in the Muggle world still goes to school to learn reading and maths.

Non-indigenous Australian kids can't learn exactly the same things as Hogwarts kids either. A lot of the material in classes like Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures will differ, Astronomy uses a completely different sky...

They've probably got either very different wands (there's no willow or ash or holly wood to use, they'd need to use native timber) or no wands at all.

Having one school bridges the worlds.

The germanies (as they were once known) wouldn't be /that/ big of a problem, for all that they were politically disunited until Bismarck did his thing. Germany was a recognised entity at least as far back as the Thirty Years War - possibly earlier, that's just as far back as the sources /I/ know about - and while the modern, post-Treaty-of-Westphalia state borders have ebbed and flowed with the tides of history, the actual countries - meaning territory and culture and language and people and horribly sat-on minorities - have always been there. It's /entirely/ plausible that the post-Secrecy magical ministries would have their own borders that disregard all the muggle foolishness and while the borders may not match entirely, the correspondence would be close.

The balkan states are more of a problem in that they've been one of Europe's poor-relation countries since forever, but the /idea/ of Yugoslavia - a kingdom/state for south slavs - has been around since at least back in the Thirty Years War (to which their main contribution was mercenary soldiers, particularly the notoriously-savage light cavalry famous for being atrocity-prone and inventing the forerunner of the modern necktie) so maybe there was a Yugoslavian Ministry long before there was a Kingdom of Yugoslavia? With Albania as their weirdo failed-state neighbour.

The Ottomans, you're right, are a major issue. I can't see them not at least /trying/ to have a unified Magical Ministry for the territories they actually controlled as at 1692, but I should imagine that any body that tried to administer Egypt and Greece at the same time would rapidly fracture. There's probably an interesting history there, but again it would break down into a set of ministries that would be fairly close to modern borders. Not /exact/, as quite large portions of what we now call the middle east have wholly artificial borders. Hence all the fighting...

**** At least the Germany/Poland/Austria/Bohemia Region would be vastly different because most events which shaped these states (the Franco-Prussian war, the world wars, the seven-year war and so on) are irrelevant for the magical population. Those were not their conflicts. Can you imagine the likes of Lucius Malfoy accepting that they now live in a different country just because some Muggles say so?
