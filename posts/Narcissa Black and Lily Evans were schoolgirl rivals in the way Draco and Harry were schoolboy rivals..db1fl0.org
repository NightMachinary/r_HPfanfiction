** I've seen the occasional fic do the reverse (having them be friends), but never this.

It'd have to age-adjust Narcissa (easier than adjusting Lily -- and thus, by necessity, other Marauders and Severus, and the whole first war) though since in canon she's several years older.

**** The last fic I read where they are, only has it as backstory and doesn't actually explore it (it's a Dramione fic set in HP-era so Lily has been dead for over a decade at this point). Sorry!

**** To be perfectly honest that is nowhere near the most disturbing thing that I have encountered in Harry Potter fanfiction.

Perhaps nuking this planet isn't going far enough...... ^{\s}
