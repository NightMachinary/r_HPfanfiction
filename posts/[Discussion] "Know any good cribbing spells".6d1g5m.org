There isn't nearly enough cheating in HP fanfiction. Hogwarts must be full of nasty homework cheating, though!

If you made a cheating spell, what would its incantation be? Who would use it, in what situation? Would they get caught?


** *Copycatus*

/copies the closest bit of text to a new parchment with just enough simplistic grammar and syntax changes to look different when merely glanced at/

No-one uses this in classes except history of magic. Crabbe and Goyle tried once, Crabbe got extra classes from Trelwaneyâ€‹ because his inner eye was exceptional at picking up the fate of others and Goyle had to explain why he would write an essay on decorative drapery that read like owl-order ads in transfiguration.

*Thesaurus*

/Takes an existing essay and expands it dramatically by adding unnecessary fluff and replacing words with synonyms/

Can be used to great effect if only a little expansion is needed. Without enough practice this charm has a tendency to greatly overinflate texts and add unrelated content. Often used by ministry employees on press statements to sound smart.

*Arcus dramaticus*

/Creates a flowing freeform text from short paragraphs that are close to bullet points. Needs a lot of practice and mental focus to create meaningful results./

Many authors of fiction use this charm to create rough first drafts of their ideas to test their value and work from as a starting point. Gilderoy Lockhart figured out that using someone elses memory could largely circumvent the need for concentration and imagination, but his works carry the characteristic verbose vapidness associated with the results of this charm. Any student using this charm in school will quickly find it wholly unsuited to academic work.

*Doctorandus*

/Creates a text of near exactly the desired length, style, topic and verboseness. The text will mirror the casters knowledge of the topic. The writing style is rather dull and dreadfully boring./

Used by instructional textbook authors and researchers to save time on the drudge work of their jobs. Student use of this charm is not seen often as the result will seem very complete and clever to the caster, as it exactly matches their knowledge, while an expert in the field will immediately notice any factual flaws due to the dry and factual writing style. A notable example is the master thesis of Albus Dumbledore, who failed his first attempt due to his extravagant ignorance to the format guidelines.

*scribo spiritus*

/The so-called ghost-writing charm will copy the content of one work and the style of another./

Often used by publishers and stupid but wealthy students alike to pass off the work of others for their own. Requires the third party to keep silent or, in the unsavoury cases, be disposed of.

Against her better judgement, Hermione Weasley used this charm on the final written exam of her husband's auror training. Harry Potter, who had passed the test the year before under a different instructor, consented because Ronald "honestly forgot" about the exam and was a good field auror regardless of the paperwork portion of the job.

.

My view is that even with magic you cannot make something from nothing, at some point some amount of actual substance has to exist to work from :D

EDIT fixed some finger fumbles

** Knowing that dictaquills exist, I dont see why anyone bother to actually write their homeworks and essays by hand.

*** Probably for the same reasons it isnt used all that much now, even though it's been around for a while. Where things like sentence structure are important, its best to do it yourself.
