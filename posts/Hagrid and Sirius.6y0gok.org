I have looked and looked but there is no fanfic about hagrid getting locked up in azkaban during the chamber of secrets and meeting Sirius black. My 2 options on this fic

1. Sirius and hagrid escape together somehow in a humor fic and it's about them surviving on the run together

2. During prisoner of azkaban hagrid finds scabers and has him in a cage. While he has him Sirius comes to him for help and hagrids like "blimey! I got em right here!"


** reading the title, i was afraid you were asking for some kind of angsty romance where the pair of them fall madly in love because of their shared wrongful incarceration and misery. i don't want that.

but your ideas are neat. i havent seen anything like either of them either.

I kind of do want that now. Although Hagrid/Bellatrix would be more interesting lol.

** Alright, I'm definitely going to try to work #2 into my own story. I'm almost certain I can do it without making it feel shoehorned in. Hmm... it could be quite fun.
