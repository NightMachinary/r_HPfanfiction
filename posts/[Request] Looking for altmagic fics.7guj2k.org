To clarify, I mean alt!magic in the same sense the Worm fandom uses "alt!power" to describe fics in which the protagonist does not gain her canon superpowers but instead gains alternate powers, usually from another franchise.

Are there any good fics that do the same thing to the Wizarding World? Fics that remove the canon magic and replace it with the magic from another franchise? No super!Harry fics, please. I'm NOT requesting fics in which Harry alone gains powers from a crossover ON TOP of the wizardry.


** Linkffn(8616362) Instead of wizards they're benders with each house representing a different element. Not much knowledge of Avatar is needed to read. It's a great read though incomplete and likely abandoned.

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night.

** linkffn(6390709) I had to dig a bit but I found this one that I read a while ago. It replaces rowling!Wizardry with DnD!Wizardry. It's the kind of fic I'm looking for more of.

  It's funny how the world works. There are too many things near and dear to us for a wand to be drawn at every occasion. Everyone has a story, and the lines and points come together to form a web of something too ephemeral to measure. Harry thinks that the strands are snapping a bit too quickly. A rewrite of The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope. Added to the DLP Library.
