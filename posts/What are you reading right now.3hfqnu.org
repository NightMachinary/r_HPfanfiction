** well, i'm reading this over again linkffn(11425018) because i keep finding stupid mistakes that i missed when i submitted it the first time. Like when chapter 3 went up this morning, i had Harry giving out three apples, when the House-elves only packed him two. Well, four, but they ate two for lunch on the first day. And if i learned anything about real apples, you can't have negative ones, despite what my math teacher was goin' on about in class.

** I'm reading the Albus Potter series (third book) recently mentioned on this sub, linkffn(5347945) Pretty good, the author drops the quaffle a few times in it: a conversation about being friendzoned, Ron saying well they never went bowling which kind of knocked you out of the world, and some of the new plants/animals he introduces fall a little flat. But I think he does a really good job of creating believable second generation characters and believable adult versions of the characters we know and love.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

My favourite kind of binge. Too bad our ship is filled with a lot of very hormonal teenagers writing about a purely sex driven Fleur with no character.

**** I know and it's really depressing at that :(

Of the ones I'm reading or have read; In Spite of Obstinate Men looks like it could go against that trend. Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum is also one that bucks the trend but Harry is ooc in it due to being raised by Sirius (among others) and there's still no smut yet.

Honestly with this ship, you're lucky to avoid the harems and there's way too many of those to begin with.

Butterfly effects ensue, with Voldemort reviving without opposition from Harry, Dumbledore trying to save the situation and Fudge making everything worse. Meanwhile, Harry learns French.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew and Harry's inherent nobility leave a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature Harry bearing more effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance...

  Starts off from the Quidditch world cup, Harry finds a more important reason to fight for and that sometimes, a fairytale or legend is a lot more than it seems. Sticks to canon at first but will tread to AU territory. M rating because I'm paranoid.
