What it sounds like just moments or plot points or arcs you wish had happened with Ron and/or Hermione that didnt.

I for example wish that Ron being good at strategy was expanded on more. You have moments sure like the chess game and when Ron stops Hermione from attacking the Giant ( i think it was a giant its been a while since i read them) because he realizes it could result in more deaths. But I do wish it was highlighted and celebrated more.

And for the case of Hermione I wish she had been the one to leave in Deathly hallows and not Ron. She and Ron both had major fights where they didnt talk to Harry. But Ron being the one to leave feels more repetitive because its out of jealousy again and Harry is very isolated again. For Hermione the curcumstances arent as likely to be repeated if she leaves and when she left last time Harry was less isolated so he missed her less. So this time is different.

So what do you guys wish had happened with Ron and Hermione in canon?

**** Like in 6th year mainly, the bird incident the most egregious topic. The 3rd year Scabbers thing is another one.

***** I agree Honestly I feel like the Scabbers thing should have been solved without Hagrids help. Hermione was applogetic and seemed like all Ron really wanted was her to say sorry my cat ate your rat. And then he could say sorry I ignored you I dont think its your fault I mean crookshanks is a cat but i was sad and frustrated friends?

And then theyd make up on their own. Honestly Hagrid telling you who you should feel bad for seems like trying to hard to make the reader sympathize with Hermione.

** I don't think Ron was a good strategist at all, though. He was just good at chess. What I do think is that Ron should've been the one to answer Harry's (our) wizarding world questions more. The French girl speaking to Harry in GOF? Ron should've explained Beauxbatons and he should've been the one to point out the Dark Mark.

Narrative and Harry not ignoring all of Hermione's flaws would've been fine for me.

*** Ron character importance diminished by each book that in DH he was just another filler character. FFS he grewup in wizarding world, He should know about Deathly Hallows symbol and tale of three brothers, you don't need Luna's father.

**** I very much agree with this Ron was pretty well done i think book 1-3 maybe 4 too 5 onwards his character kinda stagnated and his positives seemed less highlighted.

Him leaving in 7 bothered me since while I get the mental state he was in at the time wed seen this character development before in book 4. It felt repetitive in book 7.

****** True but the end result of that feels very similar to 4th year he still has a fight cuz he jealous and leaves Harry feeling very isolated and depressed because he misses his best friend. We've seen this before with Ron. Which makes it feel like you havent developed the character beyond that point in book 4.

And of all of it is manufactured by the Horcrux and none of it reflects his actual insecurities then its very pointless with the exception of creating drama.

With Hermione leaving instead it creates a scenario that we havent experienced with her not really. So chance for character development and something more new.

*** I agree Ron was in a better position to be the exposition dump than Hermione and it honestly made little sense since she is smart but didnt grow up in this world. Shed miss alot of the subtext and nuance of things.

And for not ignoring flaws which flaws do you think hed accept and which ones would he call ou t or refuse to accept prompting potential character arcs for her?

High handedness and the need to be right are the ones that impacted Harry the most. I don't need him or anyone else to get all preachy. Pointing out that she was going about the house elf thing all wrong or expressing his feelings about the firebolt would've sufficed.

House elf liberation could've been a great arc for her. One where she decides she wants to work in Regulation and Control and learns to work /with/ those she sees as different and/or lesser.

***** I think the fireboldt thing could have led to the house elf one.

So shed learn that shed need to worth with people and couldnt just do things for their good without getting their go ahead all the time from the fireboldt incident. And that would result in her handling the SPEW thing differently.

** Ron needed more positive traits. Good at chess doesn't mean good at strategy. By the seventh book, Neville was a better character, in my opinion. He had undergone a transformation from a scared, shy, and fat boy to a brave leader. Ron was mainly put in for random bits of wizarding information and some comedic relief. He really should have had more personality

*** I ageee i highlighted the strategy because it was something that could have been a thing and frankly should have been a thing and wasnt.

Ron should been more the people person

Hes the one whose the most social, he understands this world the most. He might loose his cool and lash out but he understands the impact his behavior and words can have on others more than say Hermione who for all her talents is very much not a people person and therefore isnt as capable of anticipating behavior.

** I wish Harry went to yule ball with Hermione. How that would be played out with Ron? Was he gonna blow up with his jealousy again and says nasty things about Hermione/Harry? Would Harry forgive him again?

*** I mean its I think dependent on how it plays out. If its like in canon where they are both desperate for dates and Harry is like hey Hermione wanna go with me ? While setting him up with maybe say Lavender with I think Ron wouldnt be jealous. Harry just needed a date Viktor was genuinely crushing on her and she was responsive.

If Harry on the other hand actually got interested in Hermione 4th year and asked her out while we keep the fact that Ron was unaware in of the crush till the Yule ball I think he would be jealous but Harry and he are best friends and they just got over a fight. So he cares more about Harry and his happiness than Viktor. So he would be bitter but would try to be happy for his friend who hed realize had a huge crush. I think he wouldnt have an outburst then. Instead it would simmer as a unspoken tension between them and I think maybe explode later like maybe 5th or 6th year.

And as for forgiving him Ron and Harry both value their friendship alot so yes I think Harry could forgive him.
