So, I read a HP Fanfic probably about 3 or 4 years ago and I remember loving it, but I can't seem to find it again. I remember that it had Harry and Dumbledore adventuring together and that it was supposed to have a sequel, but nothing was ever posted (at least at the time. 2012 I think?) I feel like I found it on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP_5_Starred_and_Featured_Authors/84507/][this C2]] after I read Wastelands of Time. For some reason, when I try to remember the story, the letter S comes to mind (I think a word in the title started with one, but wouldn't bet on it) along with the color Red. I realize it's not much to go on (cue Seamus: "It's nothing to go on.") but I've seen the internet do amazing things before, so figured I'd ask.

Thanks in advance.

Cheers


** I think this is what you're looking for. Amusingly, the author is also the founder of the DLP C2.
