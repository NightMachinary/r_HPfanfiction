Hi, everyone.

I'd like to audioread fanfiction.

I've been considering doing this for a while now, and I've decided to make a post to see if people are interested in seeing it done.

I'm aware that there was a project that died out a few years back, and I want to do it better than that one did it.

I'm learning voice acting to do this, but I probably wouldn't voice the characters. I'd just “read” fanfiction in my normal, natural voice. (I hate the way my voice sounds on recordings, so I have to fix that)

Let me know if people are interested in seeing me do this.

***** Depends on the part. Given my voice, I think it would fit 7th year Ron...

** For a long wonderful period, I could manage to get my phone to read [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] in a British accent. There were some glitches but it was wonderful being able to do chores while reading fanfic.

​

Go for it!

** I listen to a lot of fanfiction on my phone with “speak screen” but it would be fantastic for it to be read by a person with actual emotion and such.I have no idea where you would even start though.

As an author, I've always sort of wanted to try doing something with my works that way, but I don't have the talent.

I hope you do it. There are plenty of stories out there to choose from.

**** My favourite story on the site is The Sinister Man's “Harry Potter and The Prince of Slytherin” so I think that would be fantastic, but it's 900k words, so it would be a project and a half on your part. Extremely popular though, so may be a good one to use as a kickstart.

Aside from that... a few others, but I write more fanfiction than I read these days, so I'm probably not the right person to answer that.
