For me, my favorite character to write would be Ron which is surprising considering I'm pretty indifferent to his character overall. I think it's just easier to write him and kind of fun since he has a very distinct tone.

My least favorite character to write would probably have to be George or Luna.

Anddd most boring would probably be Hermione lol.


** Mad-eye Moody is probably my favorite to write, since he can probably get away with saying anything. Least favorite is Rita Skeeter. Hardest to write is Luna, no contest.

#+end_quote

Very few authors get Mad Eye's character voice right. Most of the time they just write his dialogue as that of any other person, and add 'growled' as a dialogue tag. As if sticking 'growl' at the end means that you no longer have to worry about the nuances of character voices.

Same for House Elves. Kreacher and Dobby start speaking perfect english, with "squeak" as the preferred dialogue tag. It is rather annoying, as imitating elf-speak isn't all that hard, and it is only sheer laziness stopping authors from looking it up in the books.

** Favourite: Dumbledore. He says things that might make Luna blink but they are worded so formally you almost have to reread. It's a fun challenge.

Least favourite is definitely Hagrid. His accent leaves my text with plethoras of apostrophes and bizarre spelling and I don't like it.

*** My first attempt at writing fanfic nearly killed my motivation. I tried to stick a bit too close to canon which included Hagrid being the one to tell Harry he is a wizard.

Trying to write an accent sucks. Voice-to-text recognition doesn't work either. I had to scrap the whole first chapter and substitute a different person in.

** I like writing Hermione, because I imagine she's a nervous, self-sabotaging wreck most of the time and that makes her successes and failures much more interesting than writing her as though she honestly and uncomplicatedly believes her own hype.

I dislike... well, I'd probably dislike the twins, if I tried writing them. There are a lot of twin characterizations I really like in fanfic (and canon for that matter) that avoid the Gred-n-Forge cliches, but I know I couldn't pull it off myself.

** Hardest to write is probably Harry for me. Since he's so neutral and immersable as a character, I have to be really careful not to write him as me, but as Harry himself. Also, the border between admiringly noble and annoyingly noble is very thin.

Easiest to write has been Ginny so far. At this moment in the story, she's only 11, and it's really funny writing a little girl as a guy.

I agree that the hardest to write is Luna -- making her appropriately Loony without going too far with it is a tough balance.

** Luna is easily my favorite. There's room for a lot of subtle complexity when you peel back the layers of Wrackspurts and Nargles.

There's no one I particularly dislike writing, although I'm having trouble developing Neville in the direction I want. I've never made an attempt at writing characters with pronounced accents or speech patterns (Hagrid, Fleur, Krum), but it could be an interesting challenge.

** Writing a canon story about Lily. Oddly enough, I'm enjoying writing Sev WAY more than I thought I would. I dislike writing my minor characters. I have all my chapters planned out, so halfway through editing something I have this annoying realization of "oh yeah, you still exist and you need to be relevant because you are important later." Mostly just dorm mates.

** Of the ones I've actually tried my hand at writing (and kudos as always to JKR for creating as many distinct characters as Dickens, which is mind-boggling), my favorite is - well, anyone who's even glanced at my fics knows it's Snape. I loooooove writing Snape. He's an asshole, he's sarcastic, and he's very smart but not particularly self-aware (although I tend to write him post-series, and I assume his experiences in the war (not to mention his traumatic brush with death /cough) would force a moral dimension upon him in place of the moral vacuum he grew up in). He's angry and friendless and working class, and his affinity for the Dark Arts - including his overidentification with magic as a means to transcend his background - invites writers to see magic as a metaphor for personal corruption or self-expression, as well as encouraging theories on how the various branches of magic work. Snape also lends himself to all kinds of literary parallels and tragic/redemptive set-ups. Plus, seeing how other characters bounce off and react to him is half the fun.

So far I've written from the POV of Snape, Harry, Lily, Albus, Aberforth, Snape's mum Eileen, and young Regulus Black, and I've enjoyed them all. The characters I don't find compelling - Draco, Lucius, Fenrir Greyback, and Voldemort - simply don't appear in my stories.

Of the rest, I'd probably have the hardest time writing decent versions of James and Luna. I've included James Potter as a minor character in one fic, but a true portrait of him would test the limits of my empathy; I'm not fond of him, but worse in a literary sense is the fact that his story doesn't 'call' to me.

Luna is a different case. She's a fascinating character, but a little Luna goes a long way, IMO, and far too many fic writers make her twee and wise beyond her years. I think I'd have a difficult, and possibly unsuccessful, time trying to get the balance right. She's a bit fey, a bit foolish, intermittently perceptive, disconcertingly forthright, and just a shade too quirky for me. She's also kind and courageous and somewhat lonely. A truly Luna-esque mixture of all these elements would be hard to blend, and I have a sneaking suspicion I'd botch it, even with the best of intentions.

They are indeed. Add to that, Snape creates drama wherever he goes. He's never just a neutral character; people /react/ to Snape, which makes him useful to have in a scene. Plus, even though he's an insider at Hogwarts, he maintains an outsider's perspective. He clearly doesn't share the prevailing beliefs in the sanctity of children, the worthiness of his fellow resistance fighters, the concept of good manners, the evils of Dark magic, or any sentimentality about the intrinsic value of human lives (although toward the very end, he finally starts choosing to save people - voluntarily, rather than on Dumbledore's orders).

Of course, the more time I put into thinking about why Snape turned out the way he did, and the more elaborate my headcanon becomes, the greater my personal investment in his character.
