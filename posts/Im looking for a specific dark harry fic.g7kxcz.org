** That doesn't sound familiar to me, but you might get more responses if you change your flair to "What's that fic?"

** I think I recognise this - I'll just look at what I've favourited now

Keeping Appearances is the one I was thinking of, and is pretty similar - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6963092/1/Keeping-Appearances]]

Carpe Omnia and it's sequels has Harry/Vasilis being LV's son and gathering followers in Hogwarts - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11360472]]

Others that are pretty good with a more morally grey Harry, though -

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1182551]] Shadow Magic

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1051935/chapters/2104982]] The Bone Man

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21949021?view_adult=true]] Harry Potter Master of Malicious Compliance

*** ðŸ˜­thanks but ive read keeping appearances and ik its not that one. Harry was actually raised by harry and was sorted into slytherin when he first went to hogwarts, and when he went to hogwarts it was under his name as Hadrian(possibly?) Riddle. Dumbledore didnt figure out he was harry potter for a while and Tom/Hadrian let dumbledore believe that Hadrian was just Toms son but that they werent close.
