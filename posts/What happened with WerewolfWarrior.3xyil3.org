So there were the 2 stories from WerewolfWarrior, Big Happy Weasley Family and Dragon Lily, which I really enjoyed for the characters and smaller more grounded story.

So what I am wondering is what happened to him/her? They at one point deleted their work and disappeared and then reappeared recently.


** Some people like a fresh start, I guess? I had a few years away from fanfiction and when I recently decided to start again, my old stories made me cringe, so I got a new username.

*** Also, if you no longer have access to the email account, and cannot remember the password, you're SOL. FF.net does not help you recover an account even if you tell them "I used to have this email but the service no longer exists I swear I wrote these stories" nope nope nope.

**** To be fair, that sounds like significantly less information than you would really need. But on the other hand, there is really basically no hidden details that only the account holder would know that could be used to verify ownership. I doubt they record ips and such. I'd much rather have hundreds of accounts permanently locked due to dead emails than even one given away to the wrong person. But then, I take my online identity very seriously. If I fucked up and lost a username because of an email issue, that's on me and I just gotta deal with it, but if my account just got given away, I'd raise holy hell.

***** Knowing which email the account was set up with? I feel like that's a good place to start considering your email address is in no way public on the site. I also supplied multiple "it was a variation on this" passwords to them to verify. The issue is someone DID hack the account, because I've used the same passwords since the 90s, and if none of my passwords work, then someone who is not me changed the damn thing. This all occurred during the "we're changing your name/user name because there are repeats" debacle that was...I don't even remember how many years ago.

** He got pissed off with the negativity and vanished. Later to reappear on AO3, he hasn't updated recently but if he does it will most likely be there. He left an explanation for his absence on his FF.net account if you care to read it

** After deleting both the fics on HPFFA he posted a note there saying that someone close to him(I guess family) found out that he wrote such fics and so he deleted his fics in a panic and didn't create any backup

** Hmm, I hope he continues writing, there are very few cuckold stories out there.

Plus the 'Harem' actually worked in Weasley Family.

Poor Dragon Lily though, we were just getting to Fleur and it could have been so good.
