** May Marlows's, linkao3(The Train to Nowhere)

She does a great job fleshing out Durmstrang and showing how different the lifestyle and classes are there. The student OCs she creates are multi-dimensional and add to the story, rather than detract. Don't fret though, I believe the golden trio begins to form again through a different and odd series of circumstances that I found very enjoyable.

It's one of the few tom/harry fics that I believe is doing the ship justice. Over 400k words now and they still aren't together (or even thinking about it). Truly a slow build with an eventual, natural developing, friendly relationship(friendship?) of respect and understanding of each other.

Still a WIP but she tends to update every month or so (but 2 updates last week!!)

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

** *The Brave New World by bellerophon30*

*Summary:* A sixth and seventh year story, totally AU. Harry decides that his life expectancy will be greatly enhanced if leaves Dumbledore and Voldemort behind. Destination: The US. 400K+ words.

I am not sure if it's available online anymore but if anyone wants a copy I have one in .html format. Just pm with your email address. I liked it well enough to add it my favorite HP story archive.

Not sure if this qualifies or not but definitely worth the read I think...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9349750/1/Tiber-s-Compendium]]

End of Year 3 & Year 4 re-write, Char. Ooc, AU/AR, still within JKR's world and then some - A book found in an ancient cavern, accessible only by a Parselmouth, leads a youth to discover alternative magic and perhaps a way to change his learning process or the magic he learns. Harry is aware of some things, also featured with a studious nature of a different sort. HP mixed up with magic and stuff from Elder Scrolls. I quite enjoyed it.

****** tbf, it depends on the reasoning.

If you say "i don't like slash because that's gay and I don't like gay people because they're gay" it's homophobic.

If you say "i don't like slash because 97% of all slash stories have draco, snape, lucius or Voldemort as their target, which is very much not ok" then that's perfectly understandable.

You want to be gay? Not an issue. You want to write slash fics? Not an issue. I just want to be able to reserve the right to say “I don't like slash so don't recommend it to me” without being called a homophobe.

******* If you have the option of walking down an empty hallway or a hallway with three spiders in it, does it make you afraid of spiders to chose the one without.

I personally don't read slash stories simply because their not what I like and I'm only reading stories to enjoy them. I admit the reason I am not reading is entirely because it involves a homosexual relationship. Mostly because usually it involves sex scenes as well and I don't like that. Not that I don't like gay people, but I will avoid gay porn if I can.

You can avoid things when possible without being afraid of them
