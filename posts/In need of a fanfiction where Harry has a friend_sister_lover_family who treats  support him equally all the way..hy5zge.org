I need a fanfiction where Harry has a friend/sister/lover/family who treats & support him equally all the way to the end.

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.
