** Depends on if it's MoR or not.

Thankfully [[/u/denarii]] banned it here months ago.

*** I might have enjoyed that story more if there had been a Character Death warning before said character died.

edit: But about that time the story felt more preachy than interesting and I was already basically off it.

**** Wut? Of MoR's many flaws that is not one of them. Telling the reader "a character will die in this chapter" completely ruins any tension and/or suspense it may have had.

*** Same. If I saw that, I'd definitely do a double-take (unless it was something like MoR or My Immortal).

** I've only encountered thing like that once, and not in HP fics. The author of linkffn(Persona 3:Remix) complained two times about linkffn(Persona 3: The Truth of Death). And well, he was right.

Anyway, I always recommend to not tie your opinion on the work to your opinion about its creator. And I live by my own recommendation. So badmouthing (and not criticising) other story will lower my opinion on the author, but won't affect my opinion on the story proper.

  An AU novelization of Persona 3. The contract states that he must take responsibility for his actions. Well, he didn't need a contract to tell him that. He makes a choice, one that will change the course of history, and must suffer the consequences of that choice. He will learn the truth of Death, and its true purpose. See how one choice, one difference, changes everything.

  Minato Arisato has never been normal. When he awakens to the power of Persona and joins SEES, he learns that he possesses the power of the Wild Card, access to the Velvet Room, and a second god watching over him. Includes new social links from other SMT games. Includes 'short' PQ story at 157X; knowledge of the main story is not required to enjoy it, but it does help a lot.

** I've only seen it in older stories (like posted 10+ years ago), but I do find it telling about the author's character. It makes me much less likely to go and check out their other works through their profile. I'll end up coming across their stories organically if they fit my search criteria, but I will not go out of my way to find their things if I've seen them bad talking another story (or author) within their story.

** I don't think I've ever seen that. If I really liked the story, then I'd probably keep reading it, but if I was already on the fence, then bad mouthing someone else's story would probably make me stop reading.

** Personally I think it is in poor taste. Drawing attention to someone in a positive light is always great, but bashing a story in your own seems...mean and petty.
