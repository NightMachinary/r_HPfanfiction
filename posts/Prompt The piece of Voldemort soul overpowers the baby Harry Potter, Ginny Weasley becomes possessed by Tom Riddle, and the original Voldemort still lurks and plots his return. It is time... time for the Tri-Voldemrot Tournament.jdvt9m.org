It's the Tri-Voldemort Tournament, with three versions of Voldemort in the world and none willing to share power it is now a race to see who shall claim the title of Dark Lord +of the Sith+ of Wizarding Britain. Each having their own benefits and disadvantages.

Harry, the Boy-Who-Lived, was taken over by the piece of Voldemort soul as a baby. Now he has bid his time to rise up. Seeking to exploit this strange situation he found himself in to its full potential, he has switched tactics to pretending to the the saviour of the wizarding world while secretly subverting it from within. While he has done much to increase and push his reputation, those around him have their suspicions, especially Dumbledore who may soon fear the worst.

Ginny was successfully possessed by the young Tom Riddle, who now masquerades as her in secret. While knowing much less of the dark arts than her competitors and and not having the connections or reputation of either, she has the benefit of being the least conspicuous. Ginny is able to operate unnoticed while the others much more quickly find themselves in the lime light. She has a lot of work to catch up with her older counterparts, but has more time to prepare without notice. (edit: Being the only Pure Blood might also factor in)

And then we have the original Voldemort, who still for one reason or another returns in all his nose-less glory. He has the benefit that the Death Eaters know and recognise him as the Dark Lord, while both Harry and Ginny take care to conceal their true nature. But this just makes him easier to rally against.

So with these three champions the Tri-Voldemort Tournament has become, who shall be He-Who-Must-No-Be-Named, who shall claim their rightful place as Dark Lord? Stay tuned.

(Just an idea I had)

*** Oh my that's amazing.

Harrymort thinks dating Ginny is a good way to both strengthen his cover while also possibly working his way to get another Pureblood family close to him.

Ginnymort meanwhile thinks its best to get close to the famous 'Boy-Who-Lived' who is responsible for her older self's defeat. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer and all that.

Their relationship looks like a perfectly normal lovey-dovey pair of teenagers to onlookers but behind the scenes both are constantly plotting. With Ginnymort trying to figure out how 'Harry' survived the killing curse and Harrymort trying to figure out ways he can use the Weasleys to advance his agenda.

Everyone else just thinks they make a cute couple though.

** Why stop at three? Imagine the potential of the heroes having to defeat (in no particular order)

- Quirrelmort (with the og Voldy): thoroughly annoyed at this unexpected side-effect of his horcruxes

- Diarymort (possessing Ginny): the youngest and most ambitious, knows the least but has the most to prove

- Locketmort (possessing Kreacher): the easiest to keep out-think, as he's prone to muttering his evil plans out loud

- Snakemort (possessing Nagini): the hardest to communicate with (unless you speak parseltongue)

- Ringmort (possessing Dumbledore): the most skilled, but the least sane, his plans are the ultimate in insane troll logic

- Cupmort (possessing RandomGoblinTM): very devious, and completely untrustworthy, but unable to use a wand

- Diademort (possessing Draco): the prettiest princess at the ball

Harry could be either another villain (if scarmort takes over - he'd be the most impulsive and lucky, but least cunning), or the protagonist who has to deal with the proverbial devil on his shoulder (scarmort offering snarky comments that only Harry can hear - occasionally tricked/accidentally gives useful advice or information).

** ‘Harry Potter' stands proudly atop the slain Basilisk, gladly taking in the praise of the helpless students around him. A part of him quite regretted killing such a great beast and overall he's rather mad someone has beaten him to reopening the Chamber of Secrets, but nothing can be done of it.

In order to establish himself as saviour of these fools he must play the part of the Great Harry Potter, even if that means creating a fake Sword of Gryffindor to slay a very real Basilik.

Oh well, he reasons he can always find more allies later. Saving the Weasley girl... Ginny or something, establishing ties to such an old Pureblood family will go a long way in his quiet takeover of the Wizarding world. Yes, Harry thinks he can make the best of this situation.

He does kind of wonder though why the Basilik came straight for him though, perhaps it recognised him as the true heir of Slytherin despite his current form.

Getting back to the crowd of students he shouts.

‘This FOUL DARK BEAST shall no longer taint these halls, nor harm the good mud- muggleborns of how fair school' He says in his best impression of how he assumes a young hero must talk.

The students stare in awe and confusion before chanting the name of Harry Potter, just as planned.

--------------

‘Ginny Weasley' paces around the Chamber of Secrets in annoyance. Possessing the young Weasley girl's body permanently probably wasn't Tom Riddle's first choice, but... she... could have done worse. Being a part of a Pureblood family, even one as poor as the Weasleys apparently are, is not a bad place to start his rise to Dark Lord.

She has been filled in with the current events of the world, namely how her elder self was apparently bested by a mere baby. Disgusted and confused, she made sure to keep a close eye in this ‘Harry Potter', the boisterous ‘gallant hero' filled every stereotype of how she imagined a Gryffindor plying hero would act to a T.

That this child apparently bested her older self was cause for concern, the boy would have to go.

She gave the Ballisk explicit instructions to go slay her enemy, but it seems Potter truly did indeed have power far beyond her comprehension to have bested the beast, even calling the sword of Gryffindor to help him in his quest.

Eventually she leaves the chambers, brushing past the tearful relief of her ‘family' she walks over to the gloating Harry.

‘Ahh, good to see you're alright Ginny' He said, ‘I have slain the dark beast which kidnaped you'

Ginny almost laughed at the foolishness of this naive Gryffindor ‘hero', but instead she giggled because she was pretty sure that was the correct response.

She is going to have to keep a close eye on Harry Potter.

--------------

‘I must again raise my concerns over Mr Potter, there is something... off about the boy. In a way not even Jame's blood can explain' Snape wears a deep frown in his face as the Headmaster brushes off his concerns.

‘Do not worry Severus I have it all taken care of, and I assure you young Mr Potter is perfectly normal,' Dumbledore replies back with a twinkle in his eyes.

‘But sir-‘

‘Now now Severus. No need to worry yourself with what Mr Potter gets up to. We must focus on doing what we can for the greater good after all,'

‘The greater good sir?'

Dumbeldore pauses for a moment before waving Snape off.

‘Never mind that, now I'm afraid we must end this meeting. I have important business to attend to.'

‘Very well.. Headmaster.'

Once he is sure Snape has left, Dumbeldore opens a secret door in his office leading to a hidden cell.

The body of Professor Quirrel rises and turns his back to the Headmaster as his turban is magically undone to reveal the face of Voldemort.

Meanwhile Dumbeldore's body changes as the polyjuice he hid in his lemon drops wears off, revealing the face of +Johnny Depp+ flipping Grindelwald.

‘Now... where were we..' Grindelwald says to the upstart.
