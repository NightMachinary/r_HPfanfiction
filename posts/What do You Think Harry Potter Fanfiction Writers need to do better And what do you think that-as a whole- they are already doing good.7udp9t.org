Personally, I think writers need to be more confident in their creative decisions. A lot of stories I read stick to canon like glue and I think they would find it a lot more fun to write if they deviated. Of course, figuring out what the changes are and why they are like that is important.

I think writers are very enthusiastic compared to other fandoms and I think it's a healthy thing for the fandom.


** To do: Have an ending in mind that they work towards rather than an interesting premise that fizzles to nothing.

Already do: Write fics (which is all they really need to do to make us happy).

** I feel like a lot of fan fiction writers tend to fall more on the "telling" rather than "showing" way of writing. Passive voice is also a problem, but these are both things that novice writers fall prey to and most fan fiction writers /are/ novice writers. Practice and constructive criticism will only help. Reading a lot of different types of fiction will help, too.

Being able to take constructive criticism is very important as well. HP fandom is not a place for sensitive souls with thin skins who only want to be nourished by the nectar of human kindness because HP fans can be some savage bitches.

Characterization is important and so is consistency. If you have puppy-kicking Harry, give him a damn good reason as to why he's a puppy-kicker and then don't have him suddenly change to being a puppy-loving Harry a chapter later.

I think the HP fan fiction community shows a great breadth creativity and I'm honestly surprised that it's still as robust as it is. I've seen some crazy requests on this sub and more often than not, there's a recommendation for it.

I dunno, a lot of very prolific writers have done this consistently over many years, well past the point where they could be forgiven for inexperience. I think it points to a certain subset of writers that just don't care to get any better at writing, and are just fulfilling plot lines they want to see written.

*** Speaking as someone who abandoned a story in favour of another: sometimes a story is just a dead end, and you need to move on before (maybe) returning to it. It's an art to know your creative and motivational limits, and work with them so that you're able to finish your projects and don't give yourself too big of a task.

*** What helped me a lot with this is reading in other languages. My first language is German and I agree - there are very very very few German fics that I can read without cringing.

"Good enough" fics in English are a little easier to find, but I am still pretty critical especially when it comes to bad grammer.

But French is a totally different deal. My French is bad enough for me to not realize if something is written badly. If someone whose mother tongue is French wrote it chances are I won't find any mistake even if there are plenty.

I tried reading Spanish fics as well, but my Spanish is too bad to even understand a plot line and therefore I stopped.

** Things they need to work on

Having a outline/game plan before chapter one is written or at least once you have decided to write the story further than chapter one. Yes someone may give you an idea or a bit of inspiration but you should have an Idea of the story your telling and the way it's going and how it should end

Keeping the number of story's your writing to a minimum, you don't always have to debut stories as soon as you think of them, write them in the background and focus on what you got both will be better written because of it.

Break away from the Stations of Canon and the stage of Canon. Send your characters off from both the rails of the story Rowling wrote and the places she wrote about, between all the magical animals we know off, all the other animals in just general mythology, and you know the world. Stories don't have to live and die in hogwash. Harry is 17, flush with cash, done with school, he is in the perfect place to decide to go explore the world get caught up in adventures saving new people from new threats with new stakes.

Things they do well

As much as Emerald Orbs get shit, I rather have the descriptions be a bit overboard than see more 600 word chapters of short meaningless call and response between two characters that even after 10 chapters hasn't lead anywhere

** I agree with you, OP. I think that liberating yourself from the canon plotlines is done way too little. If you make a difference, /make the difference/. Stick with it.

An example is always: Harry goes to Slytherin. Chances are high he won't be friends with Ron and Hermione (and yeah, maybe that mean Hermione /will/ become a bloody smudge on a troll's club, but maybe it doesn't because Ron never felt the need to profile himself in front of the famous Harry Potter by putting her down). He'll probably not assume Snape as the culprit. He'll take different approaches to problems due to other people he makes friends with (who have less brash characteristics)....

This is such a weird assumption. It goes hand in hand with the often found assumption that he somehow becomes buddy-buddy with Draco and mates just because they now wear the same robes.

IMHO Snape would be even more annoyed than in canon by having to deal with being Head of House for a Potter and then taking that frustration out on Harry.

But then with Harry in Slyterhin he's gonna be way too busy keeping his head down and survival than going after the secrets of a forbidden corridor or helping out Hagrid with his dragon egg.

**** My reasoning was that he would not have friends who were quite as willing as Ron to blame Snape. If we take, for example, Zabini and Davis and write their characters as sidekicks, but more thoughtful and calculating, it would be pretty easy to have them get off their suspicion on Snape quickly. Its all in the writing, as always.

If SNape would be more annoyed... I don't know. I think Snape is annoyed with Harry because he sees James in him. Having harry sorted in Slyterin may get Snape to take a step back and truly look at Harry for once.

Also, I'm not sure if Harry would truly be walking on eggshells like that in Slytherin. It's probably not the smooth sailing as it is in Gryffindor, but I'm sure "survival" would be way too harsh a word to describe his life in the dungeons.

Sure, "survival" sounds a bit harsh for first year, but the boy who lived is not going to make friends with Death Eater children and if he had a hand on Molly's clock I think it would constantly point towards mortal peril after joining Slytherin. He's much more exposed there, no matter how you slice it.

** By and large most writers need to develop their characters more completely. We are all familiar with the racist, blood supremacist Draco Malfoy, but aside from being told his father and mother indoctrinated him, we are given little to support his continued behavior. We need a few scenes of him and the other Slytherins in the common room, being indoctrinated by Snape, reading from Voldemort's manifesto. When showing scenes of Draco plotting, include a bit of the rhetoric. Show Draco getting off the train, and being immersed in the love of his parents, and their hatred of the lesser races. Give the reader a reason to believe that Draco is what he is portrayed as.\\
Snape is an asshole? Alright, but show us why before book five. Give us a flashback when he first sees Harry at the sorting, when he sees him on a broom etc. Show us that Snape was bullied so very badly as a child that he became a bully himself.\\
One of the many issues with the books, was that the characters were so very flat. It doesn't take much, a paragraph here, a couple sentences there, to build real characters. Everyone is the hero of their own story, everyone has hopes and dreams, and life experiences that have shaped them into who they are. While you don't need to know the backgrounds or deeper motivations for ~every~ character in the story, those who significantly impact the protagonist do need to be fleshed out.

** Get rid of the fucking angst and pointless drama. Every fucking character talks like they are the main character of a fucking movie. No true "realistic" communication between characters. Magic being used to full advantage. Be the mother fucking Munchin you were always meant to be and start being more Genre savvy for ROB's sake. Don't get married before school or choose the girl/boy you intent to marry from the school you went. There are plenty fish in the sea. Don't marry the sister of your best friend just because you got her pregnant. There should be spell equivalent of after morning pill. If you are Self insert, screw canon plot story. You are risking your own damn life. Voldie can have his tiny country to rule. Move to america. If he tries to do anything, americans would come down on his head like a ton of bricks.

Don't play with the Chessmaster, kick the game table under his feet and shoot him in the head.

Is Voldie a saturday cartoon villain? Why the hell does he wait for the end of the school year to make his move? Does he care about the education of students that much?
