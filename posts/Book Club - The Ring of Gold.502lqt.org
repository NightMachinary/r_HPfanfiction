** I liked it, but felt it dragged a little and that maybe a little too much was left for the reader to guess at (primarily the importance of Ginny). Not too much light amusement and a lot of wham-bam fight action. Holding off reading the sequels for now.

*** Yeah, it kind of reminded me of a Jason Bourne movie. Not much magical and missing the whimsy of canon. I read all of the trilogy forever ago, but didn't manage to finish it this time. It lost my interest halfway through the second.

** I first read this story (and the trilogy as a whole) about 7-8 years ago, and have reread it twice since (most recent being earlier this year). I have yet to encounter any other stories that are built in the same way this one is. There's a lot of nice world building, and a lot of mystery which actually builds a lot of suspense, since the answers are not as obvious as they appear, even at the conclusion of the first story.

The story is not without flaws. I wouldn't rate it as an A+, but it is very good, and I personally feel like it is one of very few stories from 10+ years ago that has actually held up well. Sure, the pacing is all over the place at times, and the first chunk of the story is written from Ginny's PoV, but the story gets truly epic in scale, with enough twists to keep you on your toes.

It's a shame that stories like Wastelands of Time and Bungle in the Jungle tend to overshadow this story, but I feel like this story is very underrated, and I have gone out of my way to sing its praises and bring attention to it. I can't recommend it enough.

*** After voraciously reading through the entire trilogy over the last week, I'm left with some pretty big questions. There are some large plot holes once you reach the end, which I'd hoped the author would have made a blog or something to answer questions, but honestly I haven't tried that hard to find it. I think overall I'd rate it a 4/5. The point coming from the plot holes.

Edit: also Bungle in the Jungle is probably my favorite fanfic, only slightly edging out Ginny's Gift and The Long Road Home from the pre-OoTP days.

*** I have finished the whole trilogy.

Jesus goddamn Christ on a Bike. All of you, go read this. GO READ IT NOW.

While some of the pacing is off, that is probably what I would call the most major flaw. Another would probably be every character's (except for Ron's) incredible hard-on for keeping secret things that honestly don't need to, but it is in line with how Ring of Gold starts. But really, go read this.

I will give two hints as to why certain things in Ring of Gold are important even though it is never answered in Ring of Gold. The first:

  "Which came first, the phoenix, or the flame?"

  "A circle has no beginning."

***** He's not really a character of focus. He's mostly just there, and loyal. The main four of importance in this first fic is Ginny, Harry, [[/spoiler][Grigore Taurus and Josef]]. When it comes to the next two, the most important players are [[/spoiler][Harry, Ginny and Josef]] though [[/spoiler][Lord Albert]] is sneaky important.

** I'm halfway through, thought I'd share my impressions so far.

Firstly, I must say that for such an old fanfic, it's aged phenomenally. If it was 2005 me reading it, it'd be an instant masterpiece. Even compared to a lot of recent fanfics, it comes out the victor, that's more of a statement on the fandom than this particular fic.

I was drawn in by Anarchy's recommendation and the mysteries have kept me reading. It becomes obvious fairly quickly that this has been pretty meticulously plotted and it lends the fic a sense of cohesiveness. Characters aren't half bad either. Ginny is pretty well done, though nothing about her screams to me "what a great character!". She works and I suppose that's fine. I was pleasantly surprised by some of the OCs, like Ginny's boss and Grigore Tarus. With a little work in some scenes, the author advanced them into characters with depth.

However, Ring of Gold isn't without problems. The prose, while I thought there were some pretty good moments, is generally average. Not bad as much as very utilitarian - it gets me from scene to scene, but I'm not wowed and I find it kind challenging to read at times. Some scenes I just wanted to get through.

The pacing drags sometimes. There are bits that are glossed over to quickly and some where the pace was bogged down in unnecessary detail, like the very first chapter.

For all the places Ginny visits, I feel like they're wasted opportunities. The chapter that takes place in Egypt could've been set in any urban area. I was told it was Egypt, but I wasn't shown anything interesting. Same goes for the castle in Germany. The town in Romania was much better handled in that regard.

Lastly, I must say the author doesn't write action well. In many action scenes I felt lost because the in-scene geography (or lack of it) made it difficult to imagine it and as such difficult for me to enjoy. They drag on too long and Ginny is a boring character to follow through an action scene. There's plenty of running, but running does not an action scene make. Well, it can, but there's enough of it here that it drags everything else down. The battle in the Ministry in the first chapter suffered from too much description and I can't recall a single thing that Ginny has done in a fight that really grabbed my attention.

I'll post again in a few days, after I finish reading.

** Can anyone provide a longer summary? Is this canon through the 7 books? Is it a Harry/Ginny story or are they not together? Is it primarily a mystery/fantasy epic with some slice of life thrown in or the opposite?

*** I think it was started before DH, so the twins survive intact, but otherwise there is little impact as a result. Mainly an action/suspense epic with a well-developed world which overlaps with the canon localities a little. It's well written, maybe go for the first 5 chapters to see if you get hooked, I think that should be far enough to introduce most of the major players and the plot-line.

It's not predominantly a romance.

*** There's no Romance, so while the pairing would be Harry/Ginny, that's not the focus of the story at all (the story starts off with Harry having disappeared, and Ginny is trying to find clues to his whereabouts, clues that no one wants her to find). Very little slice of life, and most of the story takes place in various locations around the world, trying to unravel the spiderweb of mysteries that are present and to figure out who the enemy actually is.

** I finished reading the whole thing. My previous comments still apply. The actions scenes are confusing and waaaaaaaay too long. The ending is a good setup for the sequel, but that's one of the few redeeming qualities of this fic. The two chapters that took place in the Department of Mysteries were possibly the most boring part of the story. Each was incredibly long and in each there was one interesting thing that happened. All of this could have been handled much better. I think the overblown wordcount is the fic's greatest flaw. If it were 60k words shorter, it would be a much better paced story and there is more than enough unnecessary stuff to cut away. It's not the worst fanfic I've ever read, not the best, but the last few chapters dragged the climax out too much and I found myself skimming a lot. It's not a bad fanfic, but it stands no higher than average.

There clearly was a plan for this, but just the existance of a plan doesn't mean everything was automatically well done. The author had some points they wanted to reach, but between those points there was a lot of flailing and too many words. I'm not feeling at all inclined to read the sequel.

** So I decided to read this book even though it's not my typical go-to genre of fics.

I agree with most of what others have written about the pacing being off at times and some other issues but overall felt the story was good and kept me engaged.

My biggest gripe, and probably why I won't read the sequels, is that the story just seemed to take us from one action sequence to the next without establishing a clear story. I didn't ever really understand why each sequence was necessary. Harry takes the other three to all these dangerous locations and it is never clear why.

In most action movies, there is a romantic b-plot to the main story. There is a reason they do this, so that the audience can catch it's breath and also see the characters as more human. This story never seemed to want to catch its breath. I'm not saying it needed to have a Harry/Ginny romance subplot (though it seemed to be there for the taking and would have definitely improved the pacing) but the story needed something instead of 100 action scenes.

If someone could let me know if the sequels decide to take that advice, let me know and I'd be happy to read further.
