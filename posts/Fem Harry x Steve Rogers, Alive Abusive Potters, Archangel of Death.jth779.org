:END:
Hey guys I wonder if you can help me find a HP x Avengers fanfic.

It's Fem Harry Potter x Steve Rogers, and Harry was adopted from the Potters (alive, abusive, Wrong Boy-Who-Lived) by God and became the Archangel of Death. She hid as a man during WW2 (I think under the name Eugene?) and found the person she was connected to via the red string of fate - her soulmate Steve Rogers. But when Captain America went down with the ship, her siblings wiped her memories of him as she was unable to function as an archangel due to the heartbreak. Her and her other archangel siblings - Michael, Gabriel, etc are known as the Angelo/ DiAngelo(?) family and she is working as Tony Stark's bodyguard who also went to culinary school.

During the battle of New York she's revealed as the Archangel of death Azrael when she resurrects Phil Coulson.

I can't remember the name of this fic or the author, so if anyone can find it I'd really appreciate it!
