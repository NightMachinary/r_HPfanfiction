Is there a fanfic with a manipulative Dumbledore where harry gets the brother to the elder wand or something that can match its power or is just slightly weaker that has some meaning. Unlike in most fanfics where olivander "alright kid here's a really powerful wand. be careful." Then the wand is never mentioned in the story again.

I think this could be a good idea for a fanfic. Idk add a wbwl twist and have harry go out of his way to find this wand while his brother makes fun of him for it saying he'll never be as powerful as him even with the wand because hes the boy who lived.
