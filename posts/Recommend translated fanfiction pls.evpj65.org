There isn't much to explain, recommend fics that have been translated from another language, ideally with a male MC and no slash.

One of the first stories I read when I got into fics was ' [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/harry-potter-and-the-rise-of-the-ordinary-person/][Harry Potter and the Rise of the Ordinary Person]]' and I guess that's where my love for self inserts comes from.

That story was translated from chinese I think but the translation is dead af.

The only one I can think of that's on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] would be ' [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort][I Am Lord Voldemort?]] '

The original being russian .

I'm about to try 'Harry Potter and the Secret Treasures ' that's also translated from chinese, most chinese translations really suck tho' lol


** secret treasures is ok, havent read it past chapter 150,but thats because i forgot about it lol also the translator keeps switching names for the MC, so i assume its MTL and then edited

*** I'm currently at chapter 62 and it feels like the story should be called Harry Potter and the canon-rehashing SI do some unnecessary side-quests.

The canon railroading is really getting to me, I shouldn't be pissed off but I am lol

The conclusion to the COS was really shitty, like, Voldy would've won by doing nothing.

No one knew where the diary was, who was helping him, nothing.

But then he just waits for the main characters in the common room with the basilisk only to run away minutes later 'dragging' Harry and the Mc to the chamber in a really stupid way, srsly, moronic.

Canon is rehashed, they win, the end. But no, lockhart appears JUST TO FUCKING REHASH HIS ARC AND GET NEURALYZED!

I want to see if the MC can actually do something for POA, he already know about the rat, he just gotta catch it but seeing how shitty it's been so far I wouldn't be surprised if it escapes just to railroad the plot, AGAIN.

Anyway, rant over.
