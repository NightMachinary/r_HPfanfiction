I prefer Bi/Pan Draco, but not a requirement. If you could include something you liked about the fic as you recommend it that would be great. Thank you so much!

Edit: also strong preference for no background Harry/Ginny (Hinny) but I know that might impossible so just send your recs.

  Just another Pureblood!Hermione story. A hidden adoption revealed, a brother found, a new world to figure out: "What are you hoping for?" he asked as they stood ready to do the spell. "I don't know," Hermione admitted. "You?" His knuckles were white on his wand. "A sister," he said, his voice very low, "I'm hoping for a sister." Winner 2015 Energize WIP Awards. COMPLETE.

** Green Girl was already rec'd, so I'll go with Rebuilding instead. There is a background Hinny, but it's an 8th year fic and Harry's with the aurors so you barely see it.

Trigger warnings for PTSD, anxiety attacks, and poor ways of coping with the war that just happened.

**** No problem. I'd also like to offer my copy - the fic is a lot of little drabble-length chapters, and pretty much every single one has an author's note... and some of them are quite hefty. Since I'm borderline allergic to notes, I have a habit of removing them before reading. All hail calibre and the glory of regex.

  Hermione Granger returns to Hogwarts to help rebuild the shattered castle the summer after the war. She and the other summer resident - and eventually their friends - have to come to terms with how the war broke more than just the walls of the building. Follows multiple Hogwarts students through '8th year' and one additional year of early adulthood. COMPLETE.

** I've been binging this pairing lately, so here goes.

*Butterbeer Mustaches* - /Just Finished/ - Set post Hogwarts. Hermione owns Flourish and Blotts, and a repentant Draco works at the ministry trying to improve his family's reputation. They bond over their mutual love of books. It's a really well done romance. Both Hermione and Draco feel mostly in character. (completed)

(Sorry no quote because [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], ugh)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12580409/1/Butterbeer-Mustaches]])

*What You Call Sin* - /Reading Now/ - Set in eight year Hogwarts. All of the students are resorted to promote unity, and Hermione and Draco are now together in Ravenclaw. Very slowburn as they build a friendship over an advanced potions assignment. Really enjoying. Both Hermione and Draco feel in character. (in progress, updates seem to be coming out quickly)

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29322264/chapters/72013461]])

#+begin_quote
  His hand clenched and relaxed, then he faced her. “I apologize for how I treated you.”

  He went quiet, but remained as tense as she was. Hermione stared, and a flush of anger ran through her. Did he think just because Harry spoke for him, all was forgiven? That one apology undid years of abuse?

  “What do you expect me to say to that?”

  “Nothing,” Draco said. “But it still needed to be said.”
#+end_quote

*Her Beauty and the Moonlight* - /Just Finished/ - Set post Hogwarts. Ron has been dosing Hermione with love potions for years, and they are living together. She goes on the war path and decides to punish him by fake dating Draco Malfoy. Well written, mostly enjoyable fic. The Weasley (Molly and Ginny too) hatred took me out of the story a bit. Also a little old school take at the end on infertility and continuing bloodlines that icked me out. But overall still a good read if you're a Draco/Hermione fan. (completed)

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8981179/chapters/20533522]])

#+begin_quote
  “Draco, I want you to date me.”

  He laughed at first, shoulders shaking. “Really now. My horoscope did say an unexpected surprise was in store for me today. Seriously now Granger, why are you here? A donation to your cause for creature rights? Some kind of quid pro quo arrangement for political support?”
#+end_quote

Also check out Cassandra Claire's Draco Trilogy. I don't think the end pairing is Draco/Hermione but they got a lot of screen time and build a close relationship. A great read. The author got a deal and has nyt bestsellers now, so you have to search this group. But there is a download link I've nabbed in the past.
