Hey guys. New to HP fanfiction. I was wondering if anyone has any idea if The Santi is ever coming back to finish Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived. It is definitely one of the best fanfics Ive read. Thanks.


** Doesnt look like it mate sadly, if your desperate for more i think there are a few chapters on another website can't remeber where though. Edit- found it on fanfic.me [[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=190897&chapter=12]] , it's also on dark lord potter forms but i think you need an account for that where as you don't for fanfic.me

*** Yeah. I had an account on DLP and read the last bits. Its sad though. Nothing ever mentioned of why he left. He said he;ll put up the next chapter in the next few years after he last updated. I thought he was joking lol. Didnt think he;ll actually leave/take a hiatus. Oh well. Thanks though for the help.

***** Really? Oh well good for him then. I guess that;s a good enough reason to abandon writing. Still a heads up would've been nice lol. Anyways Im happy for the dude. Thanks for replying.
