does anyone ever get excited just /writing/ their story? like you know if you were the reader you'd be on the edge of your seat? push away writing deadlines and writers block, ive forgotten how much fun writing your ideas out could be.


** Yessss

** This is me too! I started my first fic at the beginning of the covid quarantine last March and finished it at around 550k words in six months. I wrote the first 70k words never expecting to post it, but as a way to detach a bit from the stress of life at the time. I never expected anyone to actually want to read it, and was just writing a fic I wanted to read. Now I'm about 175k words into the sequel and still love everything about the writing and plotting process.

** I once watched this Hunter S Thompson documentary where his wife said that she would walk by his office and find him maniacally laughing while punched at his keyboard and I was like “I am Hunter S Thompson”.

Last week-ish I wrote a scene where I killed off one of the main characters. The whole time I was writing it I wanted to like live steam it or some shit.

** I enjoy editing chapters once I get most of the main problems taken care of. Kind of that method of shaping the words into something that flows smoothly, changing it into art.

** I am literally the opposite and it's rather disheartening. My mind is full of so many ideas that it's frankly maddening but when I sit down to write them it all just grinds to a halt only for it all to come flooding back the second I step away from the keyboard...

*** try writing on paper! dont try to write out every idea at once, keep a journal on you and write what you like when you feel like it. dont force yourself!
