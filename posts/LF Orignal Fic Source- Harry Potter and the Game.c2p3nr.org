So I made the grave mistake of starting Harry Potter and The Game by Concept101. However, its incomplete. There was a note SOMEWHERE in the 45 chapters that said it was posted on another site besides fanfic.net. Does anyone know where its at? Ive searched for 30+ minutes and all I keep getting is video game crossovers.

*** So that's the old, unedited one but it's not one that goes past the 45 chapters right? Looks like it hasn't been updated so not sure if it's abandoned or not? I also just finished it for the first time and I want moreee. I'm reading Percy Jackson and the game but it's not the same.
