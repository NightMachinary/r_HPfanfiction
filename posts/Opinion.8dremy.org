Only instead of Lord Harry Potter, it's Lord Ron Weasley and instead of loving every second of his life, he can't stop questioning all the absurd things happening one after another.

** Malicious Compliance. Harry learns from an early age that no matter what he does he will get into trouble, so why not do whatever you want? So he makes a game of it and does /exactly/ what the dursleys tell him to do. Maybe he read "Amelia Bedelia" in the school library or something.

Naturally, he gives Snape an aneurysm when he takes his petty point deductions as directives in the opposite direction.

Points off for not helping Neville not destroy his potion? Act all flattered that Snape trusts him to be an assistant teacher and utterly bollox up Draco's potion under the guise of helping him.

** - Time travel shenanigans where Harry wakes up in his father's body after a drunken one night stand with Lily (before they were an item)

- A realistic Battle of Hogwarts. A frontal assault against a fortified hilltop wouldn't even reach Hogwarts walls. Would be suitable for a semi-serious one-shot where Harry reflects how anticlimactic it was.

- A next-gen AU where Teddy and Delphi were raised as siblings by Andromeda and Delphi is trying to be Teddy's wingman while he tries to get a date with Victorie.

- Harry getting a mentor in either a young teacher (the whole background teachers are of unknown age) or an older student (for example Penelope Clearwater) and the mentor slowly grows into a mother/big sister role.

*** Why would the Battle of Hogwarts suceeding be so impossible with /magic/? Once you've got Apparition, broomsticks and (in Voldemort's case) even unsupported flight, that strategy seems a /lot/ more viable than it's given credit for. Also, the range of spells in /HP/ is unclear, but it seems likely they evaporate at some point if they don't reach a target quickly enough --- else you'd risk being hit at any moment by some misaimed Stunner from Timbuktu that flew steadfast across the planet --- so depending on what the limit is and how far back the Death Eaters are standing, sniping them from the windows might not actually be possible, either.

The Earth is not flat, you know that, right? Asides from that, you don't need to hit a single person as defender, you just throw area of effect curses from the battlements and are almost guaranteed to hit something. The Death Eaters used no brooms and casting spells to fly prevents you from casting offensive or defensive magic. Which makes you incredibly vulnerable right before you reach the castle and the defenders can stun you and you're dead. Besides, the armour suits are waiting there to impale you while landing.

Hell, they could make makeshift potion grenades (just ask Neville to brew anything) and bombard the attackers with that or summon firearms and party like it's 1915.

It is a lot easier to defend than to attack, hence why an attacking force has to outnumber the defenders without a massive advantage of some kind (and the Death Eaters have none).

***** Good point on area-effect spells, but I do think it's quite possible to cast spells while unsupported-flying. I don't believe it's a held spell in the same way as /Wingardium Leviosa/ that precludes casting something else, or else it wouldn't be so impressive an ability for Voldemort.

****** Maybe Voldemort can do both, but very few of his followers seem to be magically gifted. The only who was described as effective in combat was Bellatrix Lestrange, all others were doing alright, but nothing outstanding. Possibly Rookwood, too.

So if we play that scenario out, Voldemort and Bellatrix are on the walls, vastly outnumbered with the suits of armour charging them. That's still not a very good position to be in.

And self levitation would be ridiculously difficult because you are no longer an outside observer but within the moving area. You lose your frame of reference and have to balance the lift with your instinct. Sure, some modern planes (Harrier, F-35) can do that, but the pilot has instruments for tilt, rate of climb, airspeed and such as well as electronic assistance. But Voldemort would have to do the same task without any help. That's why it is so bloody impressive. He flies without bumping in every wall nearby.

******* I always thought that creating the spell that lets you fly is the hard part --- but that once it is cast, it's free, instinctive flight ala /Peter Pan/ that is not at all hard to control. I don't know. We don't really have enough information in canon about it. But if /I/'m right, it wouldn't be too hard at all to cast spells while in such a posiion.

Now that you mention it, it is notable that Lord Voldemort /didn't/ teach Bellatrix Unsupported Flight. Perhaps she was deemed too unstable by him to be gifted with such power? He did teach Snape over her, and Quirrell. It seems he must have taught a third person, or recorded the power in some way, for Delphini to later find, unless she reinvented it from the ground up (which would be amazing, but I don't think that's the case).

Also, ou underestimate the Death Eaters. You'll recall that, at least, Antonin Dolohov was considered an outstanding duelist. He's dead by /Deathly Hallows/, of course, but Barty Crouch Jr. was also a freaking genius. There may be others I'm forgetting about.

******** Making something fly is easy, you just need a force greater than the gravitation to push you away. Keep in mind that we are talking about flying without wings and control surfaces here, so you don't have any way to correct balance and direction of movement besides the force pushing you upwards. Basically imagine balancing on a pole while trying to move the pole in such a way that you neither fall off and still move in a direction you want to go. Now add sudden movements (such as waving a wand) WHILE maintaining balance and direction of movement. Flying a plane is easy compared to that.

As for the other Death Eaters, they can't be that good if they lost to a bunch of children aged 14-16 while outnumbering them 2-1 and using a lot more force than them. They failed all mission objectives in the Department of Mysteries and their opponents suffered no long-term harm.

Personally, my interpretation of magic against physics is that you always try the easiest solution first.

*********** But magic already has options, /natural/ ones, to make something hover like a balloon, which isn't too far removed from what I described: Billywig Venom and a Horned Serpent's Jewel. The Levitation Charm was also developped as an improvement of the Hover Charm --- the latter just makes objects float, while only /Wingardium Leviosa/ allows for manipulation of the object's movements by the spellcaster. Thus, it seems the most easily-achieved effect with magic is a sort of anti-gravity field that makes things hover like balloons; and that the tricky part is to then control that object's movement now that it's floating.

Therefore, I would propose that making himself hover was easily achieved by Voldemort --- some variation of the Hover Charm, cast wandlessly over himself --- but the tricky one was to then direct his body's movements like one can do an object with /Wingardium Leviosa/. With /Wingardium Leviosa/ (or the Locomotion Charm, for that matter), this takes the form of pointing your wand in the direction you want the object to go, as if you were pulling the object along on a string; you can't do that when you're yourself the object, and that was what Voldemort had to work around to develop unsupported flight. It's also possible that a living being's natural magic rebels against any variations of the Locomotion Charm being cast upon it.

************* I'm sorry if that didn't come across right, but my view is that it was /developping/ the spell to do it that was extremely hard, as opposed to using it once it was created. Such that if the secret of the Unsupported Flight Spell hadn't died with Voldemort and Snape^{[*1*]} , and had instead been made public, just about every wizard or witch might have had a shot at it. Much like driving a car is relatively easy, and /creating/ the car was the tricky part.

Regardless of whether Voldemort had left some record of it for her, or she remade it from scratch, it actually seems imaginable that the secret may be gotten out of her post-Cursed Child, and the wizards of the 2040's may forego brooms and fly on their own power./

** Write about that goblin rebellion where the goblins won and took away the right to carry a wand by wizards. And since not everybody has enough concentration or power to pull off wandless magic, the purebloods suddenly find out that muggles and their weapons are not that bad.

Or write about that time when Tom Riddle tried to discovered the Chamber of Slytherin was in a girls toilet and he had to try to enter it without anybody else finding out. And then he has to slide all the way to the bottom. Write it from Riddle's point if view. His incredulous thoughts will certainly make it humourous. Example - "I looked up to my noble ancestor Salazar Slytherin to find the values in a Dark Lord. If you would have told me that he built his Chamber of secrets under a girls' toilet, I would have cursed you to Saint Mungo's. Now, I think I will postpone the decision to become a Dark Lord if it will make me crazy enough to do things like these."
