I've been a fanfiction reader for more than 10 years and finally last year I felt confident enough with English to start writing my own fic.

This is my first long fic, featuring my favourite character(ignored by the fandom) Remus and Sirius. Although they are the protagonists they are not the only ones. It's an AU canon divergent fic that answers the question of what would happen if Sirius and Remus made different choices after Hogwarts.\\
How would their lives have been if they had other priorities, other important people in their lives other than the Marauders?

Come and read my fic if you're interested.\\
