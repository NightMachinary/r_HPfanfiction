** That fic is both the most favorited Harry Potter/LotR crossover as well as the single most favorited LotR crossover on FFN.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

*** So it is. I checked that fic, but only the first chapter. Should have read the second. Thank you!

**** It depends if you like the Tolkien style of story telling or not. I think it's one of the best HP fanfics ever written.

***** Yeah, I know. I've read it. It's just that I'm planning on writing my own LOTR crossover and I didn't want to accidentally write something similar to what I thought I once read. But I couldn't find the fic I was thinking of.
