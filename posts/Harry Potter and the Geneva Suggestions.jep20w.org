Or where Harry is so dark in his pursuit of killing death eaters that he resorts to torture, rape and cannibalism to do the job.


** That's at least the third time I see this prompt. What's up?

Also, resorting to Dark magic is one thing, but I fail to see how the methods you propose would realistically help him in his goal of defeating the DEs.

*** I can see torturing being used

maybe the threat of Cannibalism basically by implying harry eats the death eater and if the death eater doesnt talk harry will eat them

but rape is the toughest

*** Oh rape is a classic and horrible way of demoralizing an enemy. A tactic used in almost every dirty war - most notably Soviets and Japan in WW2, the Yugoslavian independence wars and almost every conflict in Africa.

What I don't see realistic is cannibalism.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.
