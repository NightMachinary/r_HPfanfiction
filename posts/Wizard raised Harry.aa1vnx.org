** Linkffn(3160475) Harry McGonagall is a complete story. Has a sequel but I never read it.

Also Linkffn(Black Luminary) has Harry raised by his Black grandfather. Very, very, different than canon.

** There's another one, by Marauderlover7, on FanFiction.Net, where Sirius breaks out of Azkaban and takes Harry from the Dursleys when he's 8&1/2, and so he ends up going to Hogwarts knowing quite a bit about magic...

*** linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) starts that series. But it is one of the ones OP mentioned where the adults do most of the work until book 3 or 4.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
