This is to the authors here...

How do you get back too updating a story after a year long or even a longer hiatus?

Will your vision for the story change in this period?

Will you have the same enthusiasm you had when you initially started writing the fic?

Do you read your work once from the start, before you start writing again?


** I would recommend re-reading the story from the start before continuing. And to reread your notes.

*** Yup! And maybe reading something you've written for other fandoms, or even an original idea. I have an entire folder of old scenes and snippets and sometimes I'll go through and read them and be like “oh shit that would be so good here”

** Despite whatever [[/u/rpeh]] says I don't stop working on much. A few things I have but that's a different argument. Sometimes things take a lot longer to come to what I'd consider worthy of being posted. So sure, sometimes there's a long gap. But, despite what most readers seem to think, I'm not just ignoring it completely. I'm usually just stuck or writing an entire story for Christmas rather than working on it. So the answer to question one is mostly just, "When I get it to a point where I'm happy with it."

'Vision for a story' is kind of a odd way to phrase anything. My 'Vision' wont change. The minutia of how I go about getting to that final goal may. I might find a word or phrase that sticks with me more and develop on it, when chatting with my beta I may feel that a different idea work better to get where I want to go. I might find a certain symbol repeats more than I anticipated and focus on that. But the goal of the story has never changed during the writing process.

Almost never. Beginnings are fun, middles are tedious, ending offer a great sense of accomplishment. The middle chapters have always been the hardest for me to write across the board.

Fuck no. But I can recall from memory full paragraphs of some of my stories I've spent so much time on them.

*** This is exactly what I wanted to know.

As a reader, I just wanted to know what it takes for an author to get back into a story and how they go about doing it.

Cause it is difficult for me to get back into a story when the it hasn't been updated in a long time. When it's difficult for me, a guy who just consumes these amazing works by you great people, I just wanted to know how difficult it is for authors.

Thanks

** Of course, reread couple of times. And if you are not passionate about the story anymore, it is the best sign I know about that you should put the story on the back burner, perhaps never to be pulled to the front ever again.

** My stall points are usually because I've reached the middle and discovered I haven't fully worked out the repercussions of the early events. Sometimes I can't resolve this because it's gotten too big, either for the scope of the story or for my ability to sort out the ripples. Sometimes I'll have a shower thought that grows into a way to come at it sideways and make everything come back together.

Often when I try to come back to a story I've abandoned in my files somewhere, I'll realize I no longer agree with the characterization and thus cannot continue writing it. There was one story where I legitimately forgot what the endgame was supposed to be and couldn't figure out how the pieces I did remember fit in with the rest of the story - I eventually recycled what I remembered into a completely tonally-different ending that I liked better (and still don't know how I was supposed to get to the original ending).

I rarely post any of my stories because I know I can be a scatterbrained writer who can't control the mess the story tries to grow into.

** I'm writing my fic since last year and while I made no longer pause than a month or so where I wrote nothing, I'd have to say enthusiasm comes and goes. Currently I am at ca 160 K words and so I reread it from time to time to get a feel for the story again despite me not having stopped writing. Also you really forget details so I rec you to read your story and your notes again to not accidentally create a few plotholes. I always feel a bit guilty if I don't update for too long but mostly it's the comments that motivate me again.

** This is why you should pre-write your fics all.
