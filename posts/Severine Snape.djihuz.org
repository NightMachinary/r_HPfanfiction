** I feel like this is actually a lot more reasonable than what we got in canon, since Rowling asked us to just sort of accept that Snape was in love with Lily (a muggleborn) despite his willingly joining the Death Eaters (a terrorist group that murders muggleborns) and not think too hard about it. This still has Snape being an awful person working in direct opposition to the ideals of her supposed love (like, say, "racial purges are bad"), but it's toned down rather a lot.

** She would probably flinch on seeing and avoid looking at Harry's/'Lily's' eyes, focusing on his mouth or something.

Might look at Harry sadly or wistfully at what 'could have been' with James, even if she realistically had no hope in hell.

Probably reminisces on James being a prankster that was against cruelty to muggleborns and that/righteous, glossing over things like his early arrogance the way others probably did with Lily's flaws in canon.

James' friends... that's incredibly complicated, I think. There likely wouldn't be a werewolf incident as per canon, since the underlying reasons wouldn't exist, but if something did happen and James saved her it'd cement him in her eyes.

She might even be friendly with Remus or disgusted because of his friendship with Lily.

On James' maturity in his last year or so at Hogwarts, she'd probably feel bitter that a good man was ensnared by Lily.

In contrast to other views of Lily, Severina would probably decry Lily as Snape did with James in canon: arrogant, conceited, and... well, negatively.

Lily, a muggleborn, insulting and disrespecting the culture she basically migrated into.

Incidentally, this might cause her to view Hermione the way she did Lily, and feel disgusted/worried if history repeats with Harry being close friends with Hermione.

Severina treating Hermione with shades of Snape's canonical behavior towards Harry? I could see it. And if Harry stands up for her, it somewhat paradoxically, achingly reminds her of James' behaviour.

** "... Because /God forbid/ you engage your brains and /owl a grown-up!/"

Weasley looked suitably chastened. Mr "Best Game of Chess Played in Hogwarts for Many a Year" had, after all, missed the blindingly obvious gambit and jumped straight into /a flying car./ Jame- Ha- /Potter/ looked disarmingly familiar. His jaw was set defiantly, as if his punishment was unjust but there was nothing he could do about it. Strange. James, for all that I loved him, never experienced true injustice. Even his arrogant wife never looked like that, but there was something...

A jolt went through me. It hit me all at once. Black messy hair. Bony limbs sticking out of billowing hand-me-downs. A bone-deep distrust of any adult's ability to help... This wasn't just The Boy Who Should Have Been My Son. I was looking in a mirror of myself that reflected twenty years ago back at me. Did that mean..?

I sighed. Some cunning would be required. I put upon a weary voice:

"As it is, you are fortunate that it is Professor McGonagall that will be dealing out your punishment; doubtless you'll be let off with a detention and biscuit. Were you my students, you would be halfway home by now. I don't suppose either of you thought to cast a diagnostic charm on yourselves after nearly getting beaten into a fine paste?"

Doubt painted itself across their faces.

"We... Don't know how yet. Professor." The term of respect seemed torn from Potter's teeth. His mother had been like that too, palling up to Slughorn as though she were his equal...

"Really? There are no rules against using the library, Potter - as Granger can no doubt inform you. This once? I will do it for you both, but in future you will ask Madam Pomfrey or learn for yourselves." I waved my wand in a wide arc over them both before they could object.

Miraculously, they had only sustained minor bruising and some whiplash - however Harry... I deliberately kept my voice very calm:

"I am going to order some sandwiches from the kitchen. Then, Potter, I am going to tergeo your glasses to within an inch of their life - quite how you can see out of those escapes me. Then we are going to have a chat about why several prolonged periods of starvation are showing up on your scan. And /you/ Mr Weasley, will explain why that statement doesn't seem to shock you as much as it should." Both boys paled under my stare. "Flopsy!"

The house elf /popped/ into being. Weasley practically fell off his chair and Potter was oddly unaffected. You would think he'd seen a house elf before, which given his muggle upbringing was absurd.

"Mistress Snape?"

"Sandwiches and pumpkin juice for three, please."

"Would you be liking any particular sandwiches, Mistress?"

"Oh just whatever you have leftover from the feast. That will be all, Flopsy."

She bowed gracefully and disappeared. A strangely calculating gleam entered Potter's eye.

"Whatever you're thinking, /don't./"

"But, I'm not even -" Harry spluttered.

"I knew your father and that look meant he was planning something."

"I thought that you hated my father!" He blurted out. "Professor Dumbledore said so last year!" Oh God, he was so James it was painful.

"Did he now?" I raised an eyebrow. "We may have fallen out at one point, but that doesn't erase years of friendship. I probably knew him best of anyone in the castle right now." That did it. You didn't need to be a legilimens to see that Harry desperately wanted to know more. No doubt those muggles only told him about Lily. "Tell you what, Potter. For each question of mine you answer, I will answer one of yours. Deal?"

Harry nodded mutely. Determination flashes out from under his dirty glasses. My heart ached suddenly. He could have been mine.

** Most of the appearance of her former crush, but the eyes ? The very window into the soul ? That would hurt. Though Harry wearing glasses and having scruffy hair helps.

** I can see it. Severine sees a lot of James in Harry, and takes a more maternal role, rather than an antagonistic one.

That first interaction with Snape in potions class? "What are the three principle uses of Kingsfoil in potion making?" replaces the Draught of Living Death question.

She has mixed feelings on the friendship with Hermione. For one, she is another Muggleborn seducing the Potter heir away from Magical Society. On the other hand, she is a muggle-raised witch rescued by the Potter Heir.

I think Severine would take the time to give Harry the education he should have received. Not to a "King Super-Harry of England, Lord of the Grey, Master of a Thousand Harems" degree, but just a "Wizarding World developed differently than the Muggle World in four/five centuries of separation" way.

If you are looking for a bigger change, perhaps Snape was the one to pick up Harry instead of Hagrid? A more balanced, or even more slytherin-biased, view instead of Hagrid's gryffindor-biased one. An introduction to Potions rather than "get it done so the stone can go to Dumbledore" that happened in canon. (Hagrid actually stops Harry from buying additional books, though it may be more "you aren't buying books of hexes and curses" than "you aren't buying extra books", considering which titles are mentioned.)
