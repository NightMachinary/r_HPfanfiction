So many dark Harry fics make him out to be evil or using dark spells to be something reprehensible. I am looking for Fics where Harry uses Dark Arts and is Grey or Dark himself, but where the Dark Arts are portrayed not as evil at least from the 'dark side', like it is more of a cultural difference or going back to the olde ways. I guess I just see it as an /eye for an eye/ kinda thing, something nartural, were there is more balance and more sacrifice equals more power - how thats achieved and whats morally wrong is subjective I guess. Like blood magic, some fics say its all evil, but some there is Harry doing it and thinking its fine because the blood was giving willingly. Something along those lines. ideas? :) PS: Happy New Year Y'All


** Also you might take a look at the incomplete but well-regarded [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=14151][Out of the Night by RainingInk]]. It tells of Harry learning more about the wizarding world's unsavory side by working for a storekeep in Knockturn Alley. The story was abandoned and removed by the author, but others have made the download available- the link is to the DLP Review thread which includes the download links.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** Still being worked on (no, really - last post yesterday), but I'm thoroughly enjoying [[http://www.keiramarcos.com/roughtrade/?cat=1359][Darkly Loyal]] by Keira Marcos. You do have to join the site to see any fic, but she doesn't ask for much info.

Summary: They call him Blackmoor. They call him a dark lord. They only have themselves to blame for the man Harry Potter became. When the Light Movement strikes a personal blow in their efforts to control him, he'll show them the true folly of provoking the Master of Death.

It's definitely an eye for an eye thing in this one. Although granted, since it's time travel, some of the reactions are technically happening before the provoking actions. Oh, and it's a trio - Harry/Hermione/Draco.

**** Yeah, I was a little leery, but she makes it work. It helps that she makes it clear that it didn't all happen at once, and that adding the third to the existing duo had very rocky moments and hurt feelings and massive adjustment of expectations. Made the relationship(s) more believable.

** Just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841]] and it's fantastic- Dark is still pretty dark, anti muggle etc, but it's also the best sensible option; lots of Machiavellian politics, nasty but necessary Voldemort, Weak Dumbledore, a few misplaced apostrophes, but well worth it.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** Is self promotion against subreddit guidelines?

i see nothing in the sidebar for it.

anyway, my fic kinda sucks at this moment due to my chosen style of writing, rampant dyslexia and my love for the odd and unreasonable, but i think it fits and will fit your bill:

if its current form annoys you, let me know, and i will alert you when i have completed it and refined it.

**** Google pointed me at 'emergent gameplay' which talks about not having a pre-determined plot.

Just a shot in the dark, but that makes me think he might mean that he's writing the story the same way I write mine, namely: "What would so and so do in this situation? Okay, what happens as a result of so and so doing that? What situation does that leave so and so in?" on loop without any preset direction for things to go.

[[/u/ryanvdb][u/ryanvdb]] below is right, its essentially discovery writing, but there is almost no way any modern bloke reads the wiki entry on that to understand.
