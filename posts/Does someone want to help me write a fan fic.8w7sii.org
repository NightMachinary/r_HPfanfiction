I have never done one before and I am not confident I can do one on my own quite yet. I already have a story in mind and actually its based of a story of someone else I got permission to adopt. Its 19 years later and Voldemort returns due to another Horcrux that was missed. Now Harry must fight Voldemort yet again and protect his family.

Anyone up for it? I know its been done before, but none of the ones I've read are completed or written shitty,


** As someone who has tried a collaboration before, you should know that it is /not/ the easy option. Collaborations are much more difficult than writing a fic on your own: it's a constant exercise in compromise, even if you and your co-author are on largely the same wavelength, and meshing different writing styles is a nightmare.

**** It can work though. I'm currently writing a collab fic with my friend, and it's going quite well. I'm not saying it's easy, but it does have benefits. If you find someone who can compliment your strengths and weaknesses, it can work really well.

To be honest though, it probably won't work that well over the internet. You'd probably do best looking for a writing-buddy/beta who can look over your stuff and you can bounce ideas off.

Good luck!

** If you need help, remember there have been hundreds of years of great minds coming up with ways to structure stories.

Check Gustav Freytag's concept of the dramatic arc. It gives you an idea how to build up and structure your story.

Then, download Simple Mind app and start organizing your ideas, the characters and their abilities.

Next you want to set up a timeline.

Then start writing. Dont worry if you cant make 20k words a day.

*** The one thing I think I would have any problem with at all is the prose quality, to be honest, not structure, ideas, or anything macro of the sort.

**** Back when I was younger I thought I was really really good at writing. Today, when reading the stuff from when I was younger, I cringe hard and want to hurt myself.

My point is - dont worry yourself.

The story you want to tell should be playing in your head like a movie. Doesnt really matter if its a frame-by-frame movie or running in 60 fps HD 3D VR-Holodeck Quality. Write it down as it happens. You can easily edit sentences later on. Phrasing comes with experience.

** No you must write your story yourself okay? That is why it is your story! :) If you want to see it come to life enough, YOU need to make that happen! You cannot get others to do it for you. :) That is yes lazy. All you have to do is try! :)

** There's nothing wrong with lacking confidence. The best advice I can give is to write it and then ask people for feedback. You're much more likely to get help that way as people would rather spend their writing time on their own ideas, but don't mind being betas for others.
