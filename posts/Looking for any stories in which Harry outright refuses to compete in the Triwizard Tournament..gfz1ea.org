This can be anything from Harry just simply refusing to using to their means to get out of the contract.

Any recommendations would be welcome. Thank you.

** Related question, are there any fics where Harry decides it's better to lose his magic and be a squib than to risk his life competing? Everything I've read where he refuses to compete is supported by a loophole or some form of political shenanigans to escape the contract itself, I don't think I've ever seem him willfully break it.

**** That's a little tough to do as I really consider it to be more of an "In the Eye of the Beholder" type of issue. For instance, I enjoyed all of the stories that I recommended in this thread and didn't care about any so called "bad writing" eg it wasn't so horrible that I had to drop it. Obviously you had a different opinion (which is expected).

For myself, I'm very tolerant of writing problems as I know that for the most part fan fiction is all amateur's experimenting with their writing skills to tell a story that has caught their interest. From what I understand there have only been a handful of fanfiction writers who have "gone pro" and have gotten paid for their own original work.

So for the most part all I do is recommend stories that I enjoyed reading (though I have been known to occasionally "reccomend" a story I downloaded but had not yet read but "hit" on the requested criteria.

I had a second comment in this post that recommended a couple of other stories. Hopefully you'll like those better.

  Harry sees only one option when his name comes out of the cup - to escape where the contract can't follow; across borders where the Ministry's laws can't follow him. Where he goes changes him, and those who remained change too. Desperate measures implemented change how paths are walked for not just Harry but others too.

  If you are forced to participate in a competition that's reserved for adults only, doesn't that mean you should be considered an adult? Harry gets some much needed help and advice before having some fun by allowing his marauder heritage out to play. H/Hr

  The champions for the Triwizard Tournament are going to be drawn on Halloween, so Harry just knows something is going to happen. Better to direct the explosion than be in its path, yes?

  This is a series of oneshots involving Harry believing that everyone in the 'magical' world is insane. Involves a boatload of sarcasm from Harry. Mr. Black makes an appearance. Books 1-7 - Completed! Crack-fic.
