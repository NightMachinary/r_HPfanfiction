Basically the Hogwarts Mystery game but told through a story rather than a game, that tells the same story. The Cursed Vaults seem interesting but I don't really like the entire game so if you know of any good fanfictions that tell the entire story out there that'd be appreciated :)


** maybe these one:

  Athena Lockhart is haunted by the disappearance of her brother Jacob. With everyone thinking she's cursed too and the foul Merula Snyde willing to make her life at Hogwarts a living hell, can she survive school, find the Cursed Vaults and find out what happened to her brother? With some magic and the help of loving friends, everything is possible.
