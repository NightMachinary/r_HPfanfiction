  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

But, I think if you post a few stories there, they're happy to have more general fics too. As it's moderated, the stories tend to be of a better quality, although a lot of them overload on the fluff imo.

** It's not really fitting into your mold, but I want to share it anyway. How about a series about Albus S. Potter that is basically a sequel 7-book series to HP? It basically comes up with a way to answer all questions from the original series that could be answered by "Because, uh, magic!"

Be warned, the 7th book is still WIP, and has been no update for 4 months.

That's book 1, don't be put of by its lack of action, its role is developing basically all of the other 6.

**** [shrug] With some writers in this fandom you'd think that's the case. And given how little Rowling bothered to flesh out her magic system, "without contradicting" isn't quite the modifier it could be...

Linkffn(Forging the Sword) Is quite good. I never finished it, but what I did read was quite an interesting exploration into wandless and 'unstructured' magic.

Linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) has been updating a lot recently, and features interesting elemental magic.

EDIT: But, I suppose these are not what you're looking for. I apologize. I tend to focus more on magical theory, so the characters and settings are less important to me. Both fics are still high quality, however.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

**** Also, you may want to specify what canon means to you in terms of material.

Common Example: Listing Charlus and Dorea Potter as Harry's grandparents contradicts the expanded by pottermore/tweets/interviews/etc stuff, but not the 7 actual books.

That, and I can't say I'm particular to any name with the word "flea" in it.

Because it doesn't, Fleamont is named after his grandmother's maiden name. Fleamont's father for example was called Henry.

Also technically Charlus doesn't fit the scheme for the Potter family either, as there hasn't been an English king called Charlus and as far as I can tell Charlus is a French name.

** Have you read Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness? linkffn(4315906)

It follows Neville in his 7th year, and was the first story I ever read. Still one of my favourites, and is canon compliant, and weaves itself beautifully round what we know from the books, as long as you don't include things Rowling said on twitter.

*** It is very much not canon compliant.

The plot is also extremely unrealistic and just generally terrible, which can be expected only from such a sick and delusional author.
