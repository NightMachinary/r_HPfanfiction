Hey there,

any good powerful!Harry stories out there? I'd like something like Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse or Resurgence. I don't care if there's stupid tropes in there, just make the story somewhat good and I'm happy.

Should be over 100k words and either finished or regularly updated.

Thanks in advance!

  Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.

  End of 3rd year. While Sirius is on trial to prove his innocence, Harry is abandoned by the Dursleys who, after the Marge incident, have enough of him. Luckily Harry's picked up by Bill Weasley. And ends up joining Bill on a Cursbreaking expedition to Cambodia. He gets far more than he asking for! Disturbing news, promises, trouble and danger keep following Harry's every step.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
