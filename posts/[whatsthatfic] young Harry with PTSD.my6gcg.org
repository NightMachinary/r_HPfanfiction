:END:
I remember reading this fic where Harry comforts Neville and understands because sometimes he avoids the third floor as well, so it's def post-Philosophers Stone but within Hogwarts years.


** I'm just following. Sounds interesting. I would like to read that story.

** I just had an idea for a fanfic. Takes place a month or two after Cedric dies.

/Voldemort's Death Eaters kidnap Harry, Ron, and Hermione from their sleep. His plan is to break up the group and isolate Harry because without his friends, he's much less powerful/

/Not talking crap but think of how he defeats the Basilisk to save his friend's sister, how he defeats the dementors to save him and Sirius, and how he fights Voldemort to try and save Cedric/

/He puts them all in a 3 story house. Harry on top, Hermione in the middle, and Ron on the bottom/

/This could also symbolize their friendship, Harry the leader, Hermione the brains, and Ron feeling like he's at the bottom/

/Harry is in a room with nothing but a mirror. He sees Dudley's friends making fun of him for being an orphan, we than see his aunt calling him a freak when he got his letter from Hagrid, Marge's comments on him, finally we see his uncle threatening to starve and beat him. The mirror goes white and than it turns into Dudley again, he morphs out the mirror and starts to insult Harry saying, “Who'd wanna be friends with you”/

/Very important to use actual quotes from the books and movies/

/Dudley slowly turns into Harry wearing a Quidditch robe and starts telling him that he's a pathetic, useless, annoying, bothersome, wimpy, freak who doesn't deserve love. He says that people only like him for his fame and money and he'll never be more than The Boy Who Lived. We hear him and Cedric's voice start to laugh as the other Harry says that he'll never be able to save those he loves because he doesn't deserve love himself. He mocks Harry for being skinny and small and turns into what Harry looked like at 11./

/Think the first scene with Harry in PS, before the zoo incident/

/Harry starts to pound on the door trying to get out but the laughter gets louder./

/Hermione is also stuck in a room but with a book. The book opens to a picture of a girl from her old school that bullied her. She repeats insults to her like how she's a teachers pet and so annoying and ugly. The girls turns into Hermione in muggle clothes. She makes fun of her for not having friends and how people only like her because she can help them out on homework. She starts to close it but can't./

/Note: They were asleep when they were kidnapped so no wands./

/Ron is in a room with a picture of his family. Everyone except him. They laugh at him and Fred tells him that he'll never be able to be as good as them. They tell him that they don't care about him and how he's even second place to Harry. They tell him people only hang out with him because they feel bad for him. They say people only like him because he's friend with Harry. The picture turns into Malfoy (not in a picture but a life size Malfoy) who mocks him for being poor, than into Harry. Draco turns into Harry. It's a memory from when Ron insulted Harry when he thought he put name in the goblet. Harry's crying and asking Ron why he hates him. Ron screams apologizes but Harry can't hear. Finally Harry turns into Ron who repeats the same things as his family and how he's useless and stupid./

/Eventually after they all bang on the doors, they disappear and the find they're all in the same room together. Hermione and Ron hug but Harry can't seem to interact with them. Suddenly a black cloaked figure appears from the shadows whom they believe to be a Death Eater. The figure pulls down the hood to reveal Harry, but with an evil smile. Ron instantly pins him to the wall and demands to know where the real Harry is. The figure just walks through him and pushes Ron next to Hermione. It tells him a riddle./

/Note the riddle belongs to LetMeExplainStudios. Luv ur channel/

/Recall this phrase of odd design, this clue our game will sweeten, old illusions drift away, when hollow fears are beaten/

/Suddenly Ron corners the imposter to which he points to behind Ron. Harry is now visible and the imposter is gone./

/Hermione hugs him but realises that he might be fake and pushes him to the wall. She demands to know how they all became friends and Harry recalls the troll. She hugs him and they all explain everything that happened to the other./

/Hermione recalls the riddle and says the must go back to face their fears and insecurities/

/Harry goes upstairs and sees the other Harry. The fake starts to insult him but Harry repeats stuff Sirius and Remus said to him when he had nightmares/

/AU where Sirius and Remus become Harry's guardians at the end of first yr/

/The fake looks shocked and as Harry pushes him he morphs into Dudley and finally gets pushed back into the mirror. Harry pushes the mirror of the table and breaks it. He pulls it up and sees an emerald green key among the glass. He takes the key and walks out the room/

/Hermione sees the book and rips out the page of insults next to the picture. She writes about all the nice things Harry and Ron tell her and closes the book. She book burst into flames and what remains is a brown key/

/Btw the collars relate to the characters, Harry's green eyes, Hermione's brown hair, and not gonna spoil Ron's key/

/Ron sees the picture and rips it apart while repeating words of support from Harry, telling him that Ron is someone who makes him feel confident and brave and how lucky he (Harry) is to have him as a friend. The picture starts to melt onto the floor and what remains in a Gryffindor red key/

/They all meet together and as they try to pull out the key, they realise their pockets are empty. When Harry checks again he pulls out a bright golden key and gives it to Ron because he trusts him the most to open it. Ron unlocks the door and they end up at 12 grimmauld place where the order are discussing how to find the trio. They walk up and when Sirius notices Harry he runs up and hugs him. The others are surprised and they recount their story./ This was based off of HI I'm MaryMary
