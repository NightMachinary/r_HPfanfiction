I just want to read all the stories with a unique Harry Potter since most fanfictions on ff are usually just Harry Potters that are better than canon Harry Potter in terms of thinking. I want a Harry Potter whose personality is not usually written, and thats just the bottom line. You can literally just recommend a Harry Potter who isn't Harry Potter, like Harry Potter went back in time and made a different identity or something like that.

Or it could be a Harry Potter who isn't human, which I haven't read enough at all(there need to be more). Really, barmy harry when he isn't raised normally, stupid in terms of intelligence and not Ronald Weasley Book 4 or any other kind of stupid that makes people frustrated in bashing stories, maybe fluff overpowered harry like core threads, could be anything really.

Just not the Harry who is seen as generically genius or cool or smart by people. I've enjoyed To The Waters and The Wild and In The Mind of a Scientist, which are very different in their Harry's but have something in common which is their harry is not someone the reader would immediately tag as gary sue material.

​

So you could really just recommend me anything as long as these rules aren't crossed. Rule #1: Harry isn't (last 1-2 lines ago). Rule #2: Harry isn't weak in terms of offensive and defensive power, hell he doesn't even need to be good at those kinds of spells, he just needs to be good at fighting. Rule #not really: Im finna snort some crackfics, anyone got some?


** Very creepy Hellraiser crossover with a kinda OP Harry, but in a way I haven't seen done before: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]]

Amazing crack fic with manipulative Dumbledore and young escapologist Harry: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9469775/1/Escapologist-Harry][Escapologist Harry]]

Harry gets fed up with the Order keeping him at the Dursley's, so he writes some “strongly worded letters”: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3157478/1/Dear-Order][Dear Order]]

Unique dimension travel with a Mad-Hatter-esque Harry, surprisingly not crack and has a good plot and no pairings: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]]

Sorry if formatting is weird, I'm on mobile. Hope these are to your liking, even if they're mostly crack oneshots!

*** Definitely reading EBTMG and Stages of Hope, but I'm looking for longer fics and already read Escapologist Harry which was definitely funny.

*** Backwards Compatible was one of the first fics I read. Ruskbyte is a unique writer.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13914792/chapters/32023899][Creepy Potter]] on AO3 has a Harry who was raised by Slenderman and associated teenage/child creepypasta monsters. He winds up aggressive, foul-mouthed, very very attached to his 'brothers' (who love him as well, surprisingly decent family dynamic there if you ignore all the murders), is nonhuman himself and mostly eats people at home, and when he is dispatched to Hogwarts against his will he gets sorted into...Hufflepuff.

I was surprised by how well-written and funny it was, tbh. The premise sounds like crack, but it didn't read like it, at least to me. Highly recommend, not seen anything like it.

*** This sounds very interesting and actually fits all the requirements I had in my own head. If you know any other stories where harry is raised by inhuman beings, that would be really nice to know.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5001827/1/Grimm-A-Fairy-s-Tale][Grimm: A Fairy's Tale]] sees Harry get adopted as a changeling by the Queen of the Winter Fae, and raised by a bunch of lesser fae as tutors and friends. That's the only other notable one that comes to mind, though.
