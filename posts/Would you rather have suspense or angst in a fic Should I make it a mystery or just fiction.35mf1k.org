I want this story to have a JKR-like feel to it and I'm torn on whether to make it a true mystery with clues and shown just from the Trio's perspective, a lot like GoF, or whether to write some from my (potentially sympathetic) villain's point of view to help the emotional buildup to the confrontation at the end.

Which would you rather read?


** Personally I prefer things that stick to the perspective of only a couple characters. If there is too much of both sides, you can tend to fall into less/weaker character development. Often I also see authors using a lot of perspectives because they can't get creative about how else to reveal that information.

As long as you avoid these pitfalls, though, it honestly matters little how much perspective you use.

** I think fanfiction suffers from a lack of good mysteries (aside from 'What was that author /thinking/?!' of course) so I'd favor that. On the other hand, you're not limited to one genre or even in telling a story in one way. If your mystery has a companion piece about the other side, it might prove to be an intriguing comparison. Which story gets more reads/more reviews?

** Some of my favourite fics are mysteries. Angst is good in small doses, but if you overdo it, it's just obnoxious.

** I always think of angst as overwrought romantic tension: unbelievable characterizations and unnecessary disagreements in order to provide conflict where none is needed. The romance aspects of the original series are probably some of the most contentious in the fandom. Many people feel differently, however, and love a good romance fraught with will-they-or-won't-they moments. Just my two pence.
