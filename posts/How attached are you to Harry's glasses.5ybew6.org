Meaning if he doesn't wear glasses in a fanfiction, does it annoy you, anger you, please you, or are you indifferent?


** I find it pretty annoying when Harry getting rid of his glasses is a part of indie!Harry or Harry becoming super powerful. It's similar to how changing Harry's name to Hadrian or some other stupid shit pisses people off.

***** And an unbreakable charm, and a charm to keep the glasses clear of fog, rain, /paint/ ...

The glasses are a huge weakness.

Never mind the magical solutions, why didn't he think about ordinary contact lenses? He grew up in a high-technological, modern, muggle world.

Did he even replace the crap muggle glasses he grew up with, lovingly paid for by the Dursleys? Change them because his eyesight changed over time?

****** Not everyone likes lenses, I have a few friends with glasses and none of them like lenses. If I had eyesight issues I'd go with glasses as well, because I'd probably accidentally poke my eye out or touch it after eating spicy chicken wings one week in. I mean, I once put toothpaste on a razor when I was still half asleep. Lenses would be a disaster.

** Depends why he doesn't have them. If it's vanity, I dislike it; I don't think he cares that much about appearances. If it's practical (such as deciding he can fight better without them) or because the story has someone other than James as Harry's father (thus making him not have poor eyesight in the first place) then I don't mind.

** The only time I care about the glasses is if they are used in or made into a plot point. I really don't care if Harry goes to a magical eye-doctor in summer of '93 to get his eyes fixed or something, but when he starts becoming an animagus and that fixes his eyesight, or his eyes get better through some random ritual and some quidditch regulation means that he is now forbidden from playing in official matches, that turns it into an actual plot point. Similarly, if he starts enchanting his glasses to act more like Moody's eye, that's cool, too. I just don't really want some big deal made about it when it really doesn't matter except for cosmetics.

One thing I've seen that alternates between bothering me and being kinda cool is when he fixes his eyes or otherwise removes his glasses, and suddenly the female love interest starts waxing poetic about his eyes. Glasses don't mask your eyes that much, and I doubt that Hermione and Ginny have never seen him without them. On the other hand, it does give some tiny explanation for why a random tertiary character suddenly falls in love with him.

** I guess I always thought he would do one of two things: get his eyes fixed (either magically or with laser surgery-he is rich after all), or buy nicer glasses. I've been wearing glasses for 15 years and my prescription changes every 2 years, so he'd need new glasses probably! Also can't imagine them being great for quidditch or aurors, so he'd probably need to do something in either of those jobs

** I have glasses, and I don't like wearing them.

** On one hand I dislike the idea that eyes are somehow hard to repair when you have access to magic. One the other its one of his identifying identify features like his scar.

Personally I would be happiest if they casually get fixed the first time he goes to hospital wing while he's there for something else. Bonus points if he keeps wearing glasses out of habit with a few minor enchantments as a fashion choice.

He doesn't seem very fond of his celebrity status. Everywhere he goes, people gawk at his scar. I'd have slapped on some muggle makeup to cover it.

The worst use of his scar as identification was in a fanfic where the goblins demanded he show them his scar as proof of identity. No wonder they removed the Philosopher's Stone from Gringotts. Worst security ever!

** I hate the glasses. They're only there as an identifying feature, just like his scar. And Harry hates his celebrity status.

If I was Harry, I'd get contact lenses, cover the scar with muggle makeup, and perhaps even change hair colour. How does everyone know about his bloody scar, anyway?

  Harry nodded.

  He pointed at Harry's forehead.

  Harry pulled back his fringe to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.

  "So that's where You-Know-Who --?"

  "Yes," said Harry, "but I can't remember it."

  "Nothing?" said Ron eagerly.

**** I think it's more about there being a reason mentioned for why he'd be able to see well enough to not need to wear glasses. It being convenient is a reason why he could care about it, sure, but way too many people use /that/ as a reason why his eyesight miraculously gets perfect and that's just ... ugh, burn those fics.

** I don't really care one way or the other... if the glasses are never addressed I'm usuallly perfectly fine with it (because it's not very interesting). There's nothing really wrong with getting rid of the glasses either, but it can be a red-flag for a stupid fix-it fic and I think that's why some people might be weary of it. I don't know how many fics I've seen where Harry immediately after getting his eyes fixes strolls into Gringots to become a Lord, gets his magical block removed in St. Mungos and discovers a list of his "magical gifts" (or whatever the fuck they call it this time) like "natural occlumens" via a ridiculous blood ritual. Oh also he's an Animagus now.

The fixing of the eyes in itself isn't bad, but it gives a higher likelihood of the fic being trash - at least in my opinion.

** You have to understand that your face, is heavily connected with your soul. It is your identifying feature. You may change your face through the use of Transfiguration, but it takes a lot of time, effort, and an expert on the subject, which is a rarity to find (only about three in Magical Britain). Most wizards just choose to pay fifteen galleons for glasses that never break, and appear back in your hand when you lose them, rather than spending thousands of galleons on transfiguring your face. And people that do change their face successfully, report feeling 'dirty' or 'wrong' this may be a byproduct of interfering with the soul and has caused them to revert back to normal, spending thousands of galleons just to do that, again. That is why people will usually wear glasses instead of getting magical eye surgery.
