I may be a tad obsessed with HP Fanfic, and I write a ton that I never publish just to explore ideas. I decided to compile a list of interesting branching off points mostly in narrative order.

- Grindlewald

  - What if Dumbledore had joined Grindelwald?
  - What if Dumbledore had had his own vision for the future and brought Grindelwald to his way of thinking?
  - What if Grindelwald won?
  - What if Dumbledore had been maimed during the final confrontation with Grindelwald, despite his victory?
  - What if Dumbledore had not taken political power in the aftermath?
  - What if Dumbledore won but still died?

- The Gaunts

  - What if Merope and Tom Riddle Sr stayed together?
  - What if Merope chose to rejoin Magical Britain instead of simply giving up and dying?
  - What if the Gaunts raised Tom Riddle Jr?

  - What if Dumbledore was not such an asshole to Tom and mentored him?
  - What if Tom decided on an ambition other than genocide?

  - What if he'd sought foreign power and then returned to the UK in force?

- The Dursleys

  - What if the Dursleys don't let Harry go to Hogwarts?
  - What if the Dursleys are nicer, or just different?
  - What if the Dursleys were more than just neglectful and emotionally abusive?
  - What if the Dursleys didn't care about Harry's academics?
  - What if Dudley was a wizard?
  - What if Petunia was a witch?

- Marauder Era

  - What if Snape and Lily never had a falling out?
  - What if Snape was killed by Remus in the shack?
  - What if Peter didn't betray the Potters?
  - What if Lily never warmed up to James?

- What if someone else raised Harry?
- What if Molly didn't survive the first war and the younger Weasley's were never born?
- What if Ron or Hermione had a different personality?

--------------

*** First Year
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: first-year
    :END:

--------------

- Hogwarts Reception

  - What if a different teacher/person introducted Harry to the wizarding world/rescued him from Island Dursley?
  - What if Harry didn't meet Ron or the Weasleys?
  - What if Malfoy was polite?

- Hogwarts Introduction\\

  - What if the sorting hat had a different opinion?
  - What if Harry kept his head down during the rememberall incident?
  - What if Harry didn't rescue Hermione?
  - What if Harry didn't beat the troll, but got beat by the troll?

- Teachers

  - What if Harry and Snape's first meeting went differently?
  - What if Harry was more prepared for that class?
  - What if Harry was more likely to stand up for himself?
  - What if Quirrelmort tried to mentor Harry?
  - What if McGonnagal bothered to listen to Harry's concerns?

- What if the Mirror of Erised Showed something different to Harry?
- What if showed something different to Ron?
- What if Harry saved the philosopher's stone? Lots of opportunity to explore magic here.
- What if Harry managed to convince someone that he shouldn't go back to the Dursleys?\\
- What if Ron dies during the Chess match?
- What if Hermione picks the wrong potion to get through the flames?

--------------

*** Second Year
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: second-year
    :END:

--------------

- What if Dobby was smarter?

  - I actually am writing a fic on this myself, though it on hiatus while I deal with some editing and direction issues I cornered myself into.

- What if Hermione saved Harry instead of the twins?
- What if no one saves Harry from his relatives?
- What if Harry bothered to ask who the hell Tom Riddle is when he got the diary?
- What if Harry explored his Parselmouth abilities?
- What if Lockhart wasn't a fraud?

  - There is a lot of room for Lockhart to suddenly be interesting other than a foil.

- What if Ginny died?
- What if Harry was permanently injured?
- What if Fawkes didn't come save him, but Harry still managed a win?

  - How would that affect Harry's relationship with the Headmaster?

- What if Malfoy was a little less clever and got himself caught?
- What if Dobby wasn't freed?
- What if the Weasleys were more active in their gratitude?\\
- What if news of Harry defeating the Basilisk became public knowledge?

--------------

*** Third Year
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: third-year
    :END:

--------------

- What if Sirius was exonerated?
- What if Hermione just has to be slightly less rule abiding and was willing to use the Time Turner for personal gain?
- What if Remus remembered his wolfsbane?
- What if Remus was more self-confident?
- What if Snape saw Pettigrew's name on the map?

  - He blames Sirius for Lily's death as much as himself. What if he suddenly knew it was someone else? Snape is nothing if not a man of vengeance, he literally goes against his very nature against Voldemort to put him down for hurting his love.

- What if Sirius acted differently after escaping?
- What if Dumbledore took a more active approach to Sirius's issues?\\

--------------

*** Fourth Year (OH BOY)
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: fourth-year-oh-boy
    :END:

--------------

It would be hard to cover how important fourth year is for the entire rest of the series. I'd go so far as to say, Goblet of Fire defines the series. Here you have the potential for different budding romances, different levels of drive on Harry's part, different ways for him to handle the tasks letting you drift into different areas of magic and different characterization for Harry. In many ways this is Harry's coming of age story, and also sets the darker tone for the following books. Even just a slightly more prepared Harry, and the graveyard could have gone differently. A slight slipup and Moody is outed. Harry being slightly more petulant or more aggressive in defending himself could change the schools perception of him. A different approach to handling Fudge could change the story incredibly. It kind of makes sense why so many fics start in this year, this is where Harry starts to become the Man Who Won.

--------------

*** Year 5
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: year-5
    :END:

--------------

- What if Harry had a real lawyer at the trial?
- What if Harry controlled his temper with Umbridge?
- What if Harry was less angsty?
- What if Harry was more angsty?
- What if Harry actually made a serious effort in Occlumency?
- What if Harry realizes how gifted at teaching he is?
- What if Harry was more prepared to fight in the DOM?
- What if Sirius didn't die?
- What if Voldemort learns the whole prophecy?
- What if Edgecombe didn't join the DA?
- What if Slytherins had joined?
- What if someone else was in charge of the DA?
- Hermione

  - I think of all years this is Hermione at her most clever. The parchment, the DA, her trust and support in Harry. This is where that can turn into a romance as well.

--------------

*** Year 6
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: year-6
    :END:

--------------

Year six can be entirely encapsulated by the questions:

- What if Dumbledore did more than almost nothing?

  - For instance, actually communicating the importance of the Hallows to the Trio, with actual words.
  - Or revealing Snape's role, or his orders?

- What if his friends bothered to listen to Harry?\\

--------------

*** Year 7
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: year-7
    :END:

--------------

- What if the trio were prepared for their camping trip? (Food, etc.)
- What if they were more careful with the Horcruxes?
- What if they were willing to kill or permanently remove Death Eater threats?

  - Or in other words, what if they treated this like a real war?\\

--------------

*** Postwar
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: postwar
    :END:

--------------

- What if the Ministry doesn't change and continues to be horrible?
- What if Harry decides to not stay with Ginny?
- What if the Ron/Hermione relationship explodes?
- What if different people survived the Battle of Hogwarts?

  - A good example for an interesting dynamic with Harry is Tonks surviving but not Remus.

--------------

What are other branching off points? I'd love to add them to the list! Or disagreements even!

What if Hermione and co. had been prepared for their camping trip with say... canned food that they could enlarge/duplicate, keeping the original, therefore not going hungry at all?

What if they had prepared a place to store Horcruxes, therefore not falling under the locket's influence?

What if they had prepared a way to deal with the Horcruxes, taking the sword with them right away?

What if they had been prepared to fight a war, therefore not letting Death Eaters they took down go?

What if Dumbledore had simply taken them aside in year 6 before his death, and told them all they needed to know about the Hallows, then gave them the gear needed for their Job, without the Ministry being the wiser?

Really though, why didn't he? I never found a satisfying answer. He even knew he was dying... why the whole breadcrumb-shit? He made it massively more likely for them to fail that way... I can't see how he could have planned it to all come out the way it invariably ends in Book 7. There are so many moments they could have failed simply by being ill-informed. The fact that they should be able to trust Snape alone could have been a game changer.

Because Madame Rowling was intent on keeping the series as a fairy tale but was unwilling to turn it into an actual dark fairy tale. As such, instead of getting darker as it should be, the world of the story remained pink-esque but got those ugly black puddles from the things Madame Rowling decided had to be dark, and with that we got a path-of-breadcrumbs thing straight out of a fairy tale in a situation when it was wholly inappropriate a course of action.

** 1981: Lucius Malfoy betrayed Voldemort and outmaneuvered Dumbledore, "The Dark Lord Never Died", linkffn(11773877), showed what could happen.

Year 1: Dumbledore managed to trap Voldemort's wraith, interrogated him and found out his dirty secrets. He then oblivated Quirrellmort completely, dosed him with Draught of Living Death, and locked him behind wards stronger than Nurmengard. GAME OVER. "When In Doubt, Obliviate", linkffn(6635363), has something similar like that.

Year 2: Dumbledore took the Basilisk more seriously, check "Petrification Proliferation", linkffn(11265467), for potential fallout.

Year 3: Lupin took his potion. Wormtail got captured. Sirius was exonerated. Barty Jr remained under his father's control. Bertha Jorkins returned home unscathed. TWT proceeded normally. Umbridge didn't turn up at Hogwarts. DA did not get formed. Death Eaters in Azkaban were permanently incapacitated. Lucius kept corrupting the Ministry. Voldemort would be skulking in the Albanian Forest for a very long time.

Year 5: Harry and Hermione fled Britain before the Ministry hearing, resulting in "What If? ... An Alternative to Order Of The Phoenix", linkffn(5265558).

Year 6: Harry forced Dumbledore into stepping up his game, and we got "His Mother's Love", linkffn(10132530), as the result.

Year 7: The Muggle government was watching magical Britain with concerns for some time. They struck after Voldemort took over the Ministry, as in chapters 5 and 6 of "Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue", linkffn(11961978).

Postwar: The old establishment thought they could sell out the Vanquisher of Voldemort and carry on as before. They were wrong, because the Dark Trio would come after ALL of you, as in "The Sum of Their Parts", linkffn(11858167). There would be no 'All Was Well'.

** My favorite story is Forging the Sword where Harry couldn't save Ginny, so I am always interested in such stories. My favorite thoughts are about the challenges in book 1.

What if during the chess game the trio was not prepared for how deep a sacrifice Ron would make? Ron dies at the chess puzzle, they carry on and stop Quirrell. Ron's family never forgives them, nor Hogwarts, . No one saves Harry from his house in second year, a teacher is forced to fetch him. The weasley's are either no longer in Hogwartz, or incredibly antagonistic towards him. If they stay, him saving Ginny second year would create a lot of mixed feelings.

What if Hermione overestimated her grasp of Wizarding logic. She chooses the wrong potion and Harry is maimed or killed. Either way Quirrell escapes. The story then branches into either a disabled Harry story, or a no boy who lived story.

Or, more realistically, Snape simply lied in his "puzzle" and they're all poison! The correct answer was to bring the right potion with you yourself.

Dumbledore could have stuffed the stone in a fideliused room. The devils snare could have been made resistant to light/fire. The Cerberus could have been made deaf. The Keys could have been made indistinguishable from each other, the brooms could have been unflyable. The chess game could've been made more deadly, or a trick, where if you did the chess game you were killed/stunned/whatever, and you had to do some other thing to get past. The troll room could have had a very resistant troll, or some other deadlier creature. Mirror room could have had more than just a mirror in it.\\
Of course it would be better to just have different rooms than that, but what I suggested would've made it much more safer.

Magic isn't mechanistic. Perhaps by leaving a very specific weakness in the defense, he made the defense as a whole stronger than it could have been otherwise: perhaps there was literally no other way to get through that fire, and he could only create such a fire /because/ he offered up a solution right there.

A clearer example of such magic in Potterverse the Fidelius Charm: it's almost flawless, but you must leave a weakness by trusting the Secret Keeper.

More generally, fairy tales are full of powerful protections or curses which can only be broken in one specific way, like a prince turned into a frog who can only be turned back by a kiss.

That wouldn't fit Ginny's canon characterization to that point. We know how /obsessed/ Colin is with Harry, and his bombastic personality (as shown with him taking pictures of Harry at almost every point he can) would be a better fit.

She could feel responsible for Ron being a jerk and apologize on his behalf. She's used to dealing with all the good and bad of being around Ron and can probably recognize this as one of his worst moments. She can acknowledge and talk about that without really betraying him.

- What if Dumbledore had implemented actual security around a device that can bind anyone into a magically enforced contract?

- What if Dumbledore realized that one of his best friends was an poly-juiced impostor? Or if there were sensible policies in place to prevent such a scenario (honestly, for a world in which Polyjuice exists it is completely baffling that the best mechanism they seem to have for identification is asking stupid questions about the past, but even that would suffice here).

- What if Harry - on a dare - somehow actually entered his name in the cup? He could have just asked an upper year to do it for him since there's no real security right?

- What if people actually tried to fight the Goblet of Fire? It really doesn't make sense that such a device exists and can't be countered...

- What if the Tournament organizers decided on a tie for the tournament and (after an investigation and better security) immediately start a new one?

- What if the Goblet of Fire is used for other purposes? *If* it really can't be countered and can enforce a magical contract against anyone what if they created a special Triwizard Tournament with very special rules and particular participants in secret? Do you even have to tell participants about their participation? Or can you just let them lapse on the contract and lose their magic or something?

- What if Hermione for some reason also doesn't believe Harry? Could he become suicidal...?

- What if Harry refuses to participate, no matter what? What if Harry only makes a token effort in each task?

- What if Harry got hurt worse by the dragon? What if he was crippled... badly burned... paraplegic?

- What if Harry didn't immediately forgive Ron? ...Or if Ron remained hostile towards Harry?

- What if Harry didn't share the Cup with Cedric? What if Cedric went first and alone? What if Harry went alone?

- What if Cedric didn't die in the graveyard and manages to stun Pettigrew?

- What if Dumbledore were actually as smart as everyone thinks he is and replaced Riddle Senior's bones with a pig - exactly for such an eventuality (I'm not even a Wizard that could reasearch resurrection rituals yet I'd be genre-savvy enough to see this or something like this comnig)?

"We can expect great things from you Mr Potter." Ollivander said. Harry and Ron used the levitation charm because it was the first spell that came to mind. If Harry had been studying harder then he might try something else. Flipendo is a first year jinx, not going to do much against a troll. Trying to do something clever means he can't stop the troll and Hermione dies in front of him. Traumatic event, failure, all things that can lead to a quieter Harry that works harder. How does he deal with being the hero but having failed to save Hermione, for being part of the bullying that led her to the bathroom. You have one screwed up eleven year old. Will he find a mentor?

** Something I've actually been wondering about for a while is the end of book 3: Peter Pettigrew's choices are pretty lousy at that point, even after being saved by Harry, essentially being a) go to the worst prison in the world, or b) go back to Voldemort. To quote the latter:

#+begin_quote
  "Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go."

Peter's not the most sympathetic character, mind, considering how many people (the Order of the Phoenix, James & Lily, Sirius, those 13 muggles, Bertha Jorkins, Frank Bryce, Cedric Diggory) he kills or throws under the bus to preserve his own life.

But I do wonder, what if at the end of book 3, or even earlier, he was redeemed and was never forced to go back to Voldemort? There's a ton of potential problems with it (how do they clear Sirius's name without getting Peter sent to Azkaban in turn, at minimum), but still, I wonder.

** You are missing almost /everything/ that could differ that revolves around a character other than Harry Potter. You mention three things about Hermione: time turner pranks, romance, and an early death. (In what universe would Hermione prank people?) The only thing you mention about Ginny is that she could die.

First year, just regarding the troll incident:

- Hermione is maimed. Dealing with disabilities could be the focus of the story after that (though it doesn't have to be).
- Hermione's parents withdraw her from school (and potentially move her to another school) -- this has been explored multiple times in some commonly recommended fics. Or Hermione chooses to leave school.
- Hermione refuses to go anywhere without a large enough group. Cue the hurt/comfort quasi-siblingship with a prefect. Or she turns Dean, Seamus, and Ron into her Crabbegoyles (if something untoward happens, she's got some cannon fodder). Or she glues herself to Ron and Harry.
- Hermione becomes paranoid and starts laying magical traps everywhere, finding and creating hidden passages to avoid being trapped anywhere, and becomes the Living Ghost of Hogwarts.
- Hermione insists on learning how to defend herself. Every second she's in class, she recalls the bathroom and thinks: /But will this help against a troll?/ Despite not having the most natural aptitude for it, she becomes a badass combatant, though her other schoolwork suffers. (It's a departure from her character, but in the wake of nearly being killed, it's reasonable.)
- Hermione is obsessed with finding out how the troll got into Hogwarts and unravels Quirrell's plot sooner.

#+begin_quote
  Second Year

You're also missing:

- Ginny doesn't trust the diary because she can't see where it keeps its brain and hands it over to her father.
- Ginny is emotionally scarred by the diary and becomes fully withdrawn from her peers.
- Ginny becomes paranoid in the wake of the book's events, learns Occlumency, starts using it to a dangerous degree, ends up stunting herself emotionally.
- Ginny becomes paranoid and learns a vast array of detection spells. She refuses to go near anything enchanted in a way that she doesn't understand or a competent adult hasn't vetted (to the point of panic attacks). She has to be homeschooled for the next few years, and that skews her education, but she ends up as a master enchanter by the end of the series.

** One thing i never saw adressed.

What about Soviet Wizards? Or Russian wizards that were involved in the conflict?

I mean, the HP verse is simmetrical in the "real world" but to do so you have to give equivalent wizards that represent each side's strength. A Grindelwald supported Hitler wouldn't have had such a bad time in Russia, unless either the Nazi wizards didn't care or if the Soviets had their own.

Building up to that i would be curious about the influences of Marxist/Leninist thought in wizarding circles. Afterall wizards basically live in a post-scarcity society, the main difference in power are caused by the Aristocratic nature of their political system and by education, both of which aren't inherently hard to tackle with enought organizing.

** What ifs and stuffs: * Lunas Mother didn't die.\\
* <Major Character Here> was sorted into a different house.\\
* Dumbledore checked up on Harry\\
* Dursleys acted differently (worse, or better)\\
* Third year when they time travelled they used that time travel to also capture Pettigrew at the same time.\\
* Put some sort of spell on Pettigrew to stop changes (It's gotta exist, or otherwise a metal cage with sharp bits, so untransforming = death)\\
* Plan before time travelling\\
* Dumbledore going with them when they travel back in time.\\
* Ron not breaking his leg, and then going back in time with them. (Might have come up with better plan)\\
* <Major Character Here> didn't goto <Magic School They Went To>\\
* <Major Character Here> did not have magic.\\
* <Character who died> did not die\\
* Harry & Krum grabbed the Cup.\\
* Harry & Fleur Grabbed the Cup.\\
* Krum Got the Cup.\\
* Fleur Got the Cup.\\
* Cedric Got the Cup.\\
* Harry Got the Cup.\\
* Different people who got chosen by the Goblet.\\
* More protections around the Goblet.\\
* An actual way out of being entered.\\
* Teachers actually diffusing rumors about Harry.\\
* Harry being a female\\
* Luna being a year older\\
* Harry being a metamorphagus\\
* <Student Here> gets taken out of school because of the dangerous shit going on.\\
* People find out about Harry killing Quirrelmort, and stopping him from taken the Sorcerers stone.\\
* People find out about Harry killing a huge fucking magical snake.\\
* People find out that Sirius is innocent\\
* <Character Here> gets kissed by dementors\\
* Muggle Government involves itself with wizarding politics.\\
* Voldemort chooses different items as Horcruxes, or different places.\\
* Voldemort chooses a different cause to go to war for\\
* Tom Riddle Jr. chooses not to go to war, but to take over the Government on the inside.\\
* Voldemort chooses a less convoluted plot for fourth year.\\
* Bellatrix is more sane/insane.\\
* Different Minister while Harry is in school (instead of Fudge)\\
* Cerberus being deaf.\\
* Devils snare being resistant to light/fire (whichever it is)\\
* All the Flying Keys being wrong\\
* The chess game is a trick, you have to do a different thing to get pass.\\
* The troll is a more deadly creature.\\
* All the bottles are poison.\\
* All the bottles are sedatives, leading to either Quirrelmort being unconscious, or Quirrelmort going past anyway (He could detect it), and Harry drinking it and falling asleep.\\
* Harry not leaving the mirror, causing him to go mad.\\
* Harry seeing something different\\
* Mirror is corrupted, shows different things, possibly viewer doing evil things, causing the viewer to think thats what they want.\\
* A different mirror being used than the Erised.\\

* harry raised by a dark wizard family\\
* Harry gets a different pet\\
* Harry gets a dangerous pet (Hagrid got it for him, it'd be interesting.)\\
* Harry tries parseltongue on the Dragon in fourth year. (Even if it doesn't work it would make everyone riled up about it)\\
* Harry trains when he realizes that there is a still alive dark lord after him. (Possibly after first year, or second year. Probably at most third year since there is an escaped convict after him)\\
* Someone explaining what Sirius Black did to Harry.\\
* Harry accidentally makes a horcrux.\\
* Harry comes up with a better plan than fly away from a dragon.\\
* Trio tells teacher about Hagrids dragon.\\
* Harry feels guilt over Quirrels death. Since it was caused by him. (I know it is self-defense, but this is Harry so he would probably angst over it)\\
* Dobby doesn't stop letters, just modifies them to encourage Harry to stay home. Either by saying they aren't much friends with him (Tho that doesn't seem too much in Dobbys nature), or having Dobby make so it sounds like they are going to a different school. (Probably Beauxbeautons, or an American school, Dobby probably wouldn't recommend Durmstrang since Death Eater Headmaster)\\
* Harry & Ron choose a smarter plan than flying a car through London.

** A Year 1 divergence I'd like someone to explore:

What if on Halloween, Hermione had returned to the Gryffindor dorms shortly before Quirrelmort let the troll in --- so that Harry and Ron would lock the troll in the bathroom, nobody would be hurt, but they would never become friends?
