The wizarding world is exposed to muggles, I think. I just saw the title, forgot, and I'm looking to read it now

*** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach by acgoldis) ... the setup mentioned in the title is lovely, but it turns very weird very fast and the rest isn't worthy of reading, I am afraid (at least, I stopped, and I have pretty high tolerance for BS).
