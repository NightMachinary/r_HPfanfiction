Friends! I am looking for the best Wolfstar fits (that align with cannon as much as possible) and some fics on book 7 from the POV of the students in the DA at Hogwarts. Any and all suggestions appreciated!! Thanks so much!


** Currently in progress on AO3 “From the Viewpoint of a Wolf and a Star” by firstfloorgenerator.

Remus & Sirius POV throughout GoF and OOtP, and woven so closely around canon it's a real labour of love.

Can't help you with the DA perspective, but I like the idea (of a minor character crushing on Harry in a cardigan...)
