** Polyjuice, or rape (though I guess impersonating someone lover does count as rape). If we go by their canon characters, there is just no way Lily would either forgive Snape, let alone sleep with him.

Back in 5th Year (Snape's worst memory), Lily disliked both of them : James because he was an arrogant arse, and Snape because he was a wanabe terrorist who treated every Muggleborn like trash except her.\\
3 years later (during her marriage), James had grew up and got his head out of his arse, while Snape merely went from a wanabe terrorist to a full fledged one. She would probably refuse to be in the same room as him, so any scenario involving her consent or even alcohol is doubtfull.

As far as I'm concerned, Snape can only be the father of Harry if he is the product of a rape (ignoring once again the sheer impossibility of Snape accepting to take James appearance), or if the author makes a lot of preparation and change the characters canon personalities (makes James an abusive asshole, Lily a manipulative cheater, and Snape someone less despicable).

** - No cheating, for one. Just, no.

- Change Snape's character instead - he is sorted into Ravenclaw and never becomes a Death Eater, Lily is absolutely fed up with James' bullshit and even when he "cleans up" he's still an absolute dick to her best friend (because teens don't need an actual reason for bullying).

- During NEWT years, the two work together more and more often on experimental and/or dangerous potion regiments, and become more in sync. Because Snape never hung around with the DE crowd, he never picks up anti-muggle sentiments and the two remain friends.

- After graduation, both enter a potions apprenticeship with the same master, and gain a joint mastery. Meanwhile, they are recruited by Dumbledore for the Order of the Phoenix. The marauders are also there, including James, who is sneering at Snape - Lily tells him that if he still hasn't grown out of teenage jealousy, he probably never will. James draws his wand, and attempts to duel Snape "for the lady's hand". He is stunned from behind and thrown out of the order's meeting place by Remus.

- This breaks the Marauders into two camps - Remus and Peter, who remain part of the Order and become hesitant friends with Lily and Snape, and James and Sirius, who exit and prepare to fight Voldemort on their own, with assistance from James' parents.

- During order duties, Snape and Lily finally get together, and get married a year later. Both duel the Death Eaters multiple times, and thrice encounter Voldemort. They fight bravely, and Snape's original spell creations (an interest furthered by Ravenclaw) allow him to wound the Dark Lord enough to force him to escape, while Lily keeps the Death Eaters off his back.

- Dumbledore is interviewing Trelawney, when he gets the prophecy. His order guard, Remus, who is there with Peter as a scouting effort for the town, casts the Muffilato he learned from Snape, not allowing the prophecy to be heard by anyone.

- The Evans' (Severus would never keep his father's name) Home is cloaked in a Fidelius charm, and the secret keeper is Peter. When Lupin is captured to extract the secret from whom they believe to be the obvious choice, the Death Eaters discover that he is not the secret keeper through use of the Imperious charm, before he is rescued by the Order. However, Lupin is compelled long enough to tell them the first part of the Prophecy he heard, before the safehouse is broken down and Voldemort escapes, rather than facing the more numeous order force.

- Voldemort, now possessing of the knowledge that Peter is the only remaining logical choice, invests most of his troops into finding him. Nobody can run forever, and Peter is eventually discovered hiding several weeks later. Voldemort murders him in cold blood. With the secret-keeper's death, everyone knowing of the secret is the new keeper, and the keeper cannot be the subject of the secret. The Fidelius breaks.

- Before a new Fidelius can be cast, Voldemort attacks the house with a large group of Death Eaters.

- Severus defends the front entrance, Lily the back, and both are met with a veritable horde of Death Eaters. While the two are busy protecting their home, Voldemort uses his unaided flight ability to silently enter the house from one of the windows. Below, Snape and Lily are being overwhelmed. Severus is the first to lose a hand, severed by a cutting curse, while the left side of Lily's head is stripped of skin by a dark flaying curse. Both continue to fight - to protect their son, they are willing to endure anything, suffer any injury or torture.

- Severus is the first to be overwhelmed. He is knocked down and then tortured by the Death Eaters, who were instructed to leave their Lord to do his work upstairs. Lily eventually joins him. Both are roughed up to within an inch of their life, but not yet dead. However, their combined sacrifice and persistence is enough to shroud Harry in a nigh-unbreakable barrier. The alarm was raised a few moments ago, and they know the Order will be there quick enough to save Harry even if they are killed, so they face their captor's wands bravely.

- Voldemort casts the Killing Curse, which rebounds off Harry. The sacrifice was not as complete or pure as with a single person's willing death, but combined with the fates aligning, it is enough. Voldemort is blasted into bits, and all the Death Eaters fall to the ground, their dark marks burning tortorous. Some manage to escape, the rest are killed or stunned by the arriving Order.

- The two spend several months in Saint Mungos, being slowly healed of their ordeal, while Harry is safely enshrined in Hogwarts. A few Death Eaters attempt to attack, but find the castle well defended. Bellatrix, Crouch and the Lestrange Brothers are apprehended while attempting to assassinate Harry's parents, and sentenced to Azkaban.

- Eventually the three move somewhere else, and Harry grows up a relatively normal child.

That's how I'd structure it. None of that copypaste garbage, or mere switching of characters' names. Here's an original premise that works.

**** Snape was not pureblood. James' pal nearly killed him after they bullied him mercilessly. James/Lilly is more implausible than most pairings. Who's most readers' romantic favourite? Drako. Tormented & conflicted pureblood. Redemption of bad boys is a thing.

** Replied a comment about rape by mentioning that he never slipped her a love potion in canon so he wouldn't rape her either.

In the story, he might've. Slipped her a potion, that is.

Maybe fanfic could also go with a route of Lily forgiving Severus and him turning spy because of that. (He had connections and someone should do it for the safety of Lily and others like her.) He'd have grown up but in secrecy. Then he'd be decent enough person for other possibilities (adultery or assistance to infertile James, for example) to happen.

** There are two options, and it depends on how you want to present Lily and James marriage. Either you are fully canon and both of them were almost-saints walking the Earth with us mere-mortals, or they are not.

If they are not, then the most obvious solution is probably the best. Adultery. You get much better story, but the cost may not be worthy for some.

If they are, the things are a bit more complicated. The most simple seems to me that James (being a pureblood) could be inbred and infertile. Then some magical variant of artificial insemination with her best friend would be possible. There are obvious problems: why not Lupin or Peter? (Sirius perhaps is as inbred as James) There is need to build a persuasive redemption arc for Snape and reconciliation with Potters (I don't think James would allow him hundred meters near Lily, if they haven't some mean of reconciliation).
