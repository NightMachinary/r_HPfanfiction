In most fics of a sexual nature (smut) I have found that hermione is a submissive. while there is nothing wrong with that, I am curious on the reasoning behind it. If anyone would like to enlighten me, I would be very appreciative.


** In addition to what everyone else has said, Hermione's performance in class shows that she's pretty desperate to please authority figures and gain their approval. It's not too difficult to imagine that extending to the bedroom, especially once she's an adult and no longer has her teachers as a constant source of affirmation that she's doing well. And I fully agree with [[/u/silkrobe]] that making her submissive out of bed would be totally out of character.

** The minds of writers.

Hermione has a dominant personality type, a common theme of a closet sexual submissive.

Yes though if I were to guess I'd say it originated from Draco/Hermione shippers and spread like fire.

**** I've never actually read dramione with a real sub Hermione, I have read snamione with that though, beyond my comfort level to read about even. (edit: correction, I've read one with a dominant Draco and a submissive Hermione, but they were both daywalking vampires and that they both submitted to Severus)

I have read sub!Draco with both Ginny and Hermione though... (and with Luna as a side romance, once)

To be honest I don't like dom/sub play when it leaves the metaphorical bedroom. A relationship should be equal to me.

** I don't think that smut fics are usually based on careful, thoughtful characterization. It's wish fulfillment.

As for how likely it is? It could very, very easily go either way. It could be that Hermione could do with a relationship that lets her relax and have someone else take over, or it could be that she prefers to take the reigns in bed as well as out. Both are completely valid interpretations. Making her too submissive /out/ of bed would be out of character, but canon, not being smut, doesn't really tell us about her taste in sexual roles.

** I wonder what you mean with submissive, because among the stories I've read that include smut the ones with a BDSM theme to the smut were by far in the minority. And I mostly read Hermione-centric fanfiction.

** I have never read a story such as this, nor did I go ever looking for them, so I couldn't comment on the frequency of that personality type for Hermione.

That said, the whole "dominant by day, submissive by night" idea is a clich√© indeed, but there must be something behind it or the concept would have never gotten that far. I'm not a psychologist and didn't ever do anything more than read about the difference between public and private personalities.

What I have come to understand is simply the fact, that powerful women (lets call them alpha females) /want/ to have the weight of the world on their shoulders, because they believe themselves to be capable of handling it. That kind of power and responsibility is clearly a stressful situation, so it's not very surprising when those people need to unwind and take a step back from everything they portray in their public personality.

Just as things have changed in public over the past decades, the whole dynamic in the bedroom has too. A woman who is in total control of her own life is also confident enough to voice her desires and give that control to someone she trusts implicitly, for a time. It doesn't surprise me in the least, that to some of those women submissive sex play is the perfect method for unwinding the mind, plus with the right person it can also be very rewarding sexually.

Now, could that be true for Hermione Granger as well? If you consider how much she had to grow up during her time at Hogwarts ending with the conclusion to the second war against Voldemort? She certainly stopped following the rules a long time ago and performed morally ambiguous actions while trying to bring the mad wizard down. So yes, I can imagine that she'd not be entirely opposed to the idea of being sexually submissive. Disturbed and conflicted by what turned her on most likely, since this would be her first sexual experience if Rowling didn't leave a whammy like that out of any books, but at least open enough to start thinking about it.

Although I'm usually not the person to read this kind of story, it might actually be a fun read if done right. Just, please without a dominant Draco or Snape. While I can agree the latter at least has the personality to pull it off, both of them have for years been very untrustworthy and have had an adversarial relationship with the muggleborn girl. That would make for a /very bad/ beginning of a dom/sub relationship.
