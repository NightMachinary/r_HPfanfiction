Hello, I have been in the HP fandom and others fandoms since young , I am in my late twenties now, but I have never written any fanfiction. With the advent of coronavirus and quarantine I have decided to try new things. My fic is mostly focused on the “new generation” and the theme is magical creatures/beings and the prejudice they suffer. I wanted to make punctual changes in the canon ending so the changes that I am making on the “next generation” makes more sense. These changes for now are:

- The 2 wizarding war is more brutal and realistic, lasting longer and with more casualties.
- The Weasley family have more deaths than the canon.

  - Molly for example (no bashing, i simply want her battle with Bellatrix to make more sense, since the woman was the Dark Lord right hand) the battle end with Molly sacrificing for Ginny and killing Bellatrix on the process.
  - Percy dies as well, because i wanted more casualties and I didn't know how to fit him in the story
  - Because of the death of Percy, Fred could live, but not necessarily, I'm still thinking about that

- On the other hand, Tonks survived (Remus sacrificed for her) to raise her kid and had to learn to live without her partner.
- Maybe I could kill Ron or Hermione, that would shake things even more, but I am reluctant since that maybe would traumatize Harry “too much” to function.
- The main canon ships Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny didn't happen (I like the ships in the canon but in my story the war was too brutal on them, so they would not make the best partners for each other).
- The war deepens the bond/dependency of the trio, but at the same time they resent each other a little, all wishing “the other should be there more for them”.
- Hermione stay some time in Australia alone, since the recovery of her parents memories didn't happen so easily, maybe they never had a total recovery (collateral damage of advanced magic on muggles), and that weight on her a lot (but maybe that is too traumatic, still deciding).
- One of the reasons that Harry and Ginny didn't get back together after the war is because she left to stay with her brother Charles for some time, trying to heal her guilty over the death of her mother.
- Harry and Tonks get together later along the way (first just as friends), the raising of Ted being the primary motivator of that. At first Harry is too jaded to be much of help, but he tries anyway, since Ted is the main reason why he didn't give up on his healing journey.
- I know a thing or two about ptsd and I know that having kids right after a brutal war, without therapy is not a good recipe for great parents. So the birth of the children happens later on the way, with some of the children not existing because of the changes.

With all these changes, the thing i am having most trouble is with the “shipping” dynamics, when I read the series I was young and simply did not care about the romantic aspects, and that's why I don't know the most plausible couples of the story. The other thing is the lack of LGBT characters, I didn't care that the canon never written LGBT properly (it was a YA story in the early 2000's, so obviously that subject would not be discussed) but I want to explore this in my story, since I am LGBT and writing a story with just hetero couples don't sit well with me.

*So in short*, what I want to find out is what you guys think is the most probable/plausible relationships that could happen based on the changes that I have made of the canon. One personal request is that there is at least one probable lesbian couple and a gay one (there could be more, i am more capable in writing queer relationships then hetero ones). There is 2 couples that I don't want to change (Tonks/Harry and Bill/Fleur), 2 couples that could not happen (Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione) and I am not very good with big age gaps (more than a decade is already too much for me), but besides that anything is possible. Also the new generation characters are just kids so they don't have romantic relationships yet (but if you guys want to elaborate on that dynamics too I would appreciate since any information could help me in the future). Thank you in advance and sorry about any mistakes, english is not my first language and that is the firs time I post in reddit.


** Short of death eater pairings, you can make everything work with the right divergence and arc.

For example, say that Lavender survived but was badly mauled/scarred. So Hermione walks through the infirmary and sees how badly "that stupid airhead" bled for them and revisies her opinion since anyone who fought and almost died for their cause can't be that bad. A bit embarrassed about her past treatment, she asks Lavender how she is and they get talking. Maybe no one gave Lavender a mirror but she wants to know how badly she has been done for and asks Hermione. Or even both are badly wounded and share a room where they have nothing to do but talk. From there on, you can slowly develop a relationship or go down the "friends to friends with benefits to lovers" route if you want to space things up.

Including too many LGBT characters for the sake of being modern would be the wrong way to go about a realistic depiction. If your cast is smaller than ~40, I'd say that four LGBT characters are the maximum of what you can sell short of writing specific scenarios like "catholic reeducation camp for gay teenagers". After all, if your queer characters are the majority, you can hardly handle topics such as the issues they face from being a minority. And 10% is already more than the population average, which is around 1-5%, depending on the study you consult.

If you have later childbirths, I don't think that the children will have much impact in the story unless you plan on a decade long epic.

Thank you for you reply. It helped me see things in another perspective, your Hermione/Lavender take showed me that a lot of ships can happen if you use a reasonable development.

On the LGBT subject, I don't plan on making a lot of the character LGBT. I guess what I really wanted to know in that front it is what character, between the main ones, is more likely to be in a same-sex relationship. At least for the girls, in the boys side Neville Longbottom would be my pick.

** Good basis. You don't have to kill Ron or Hermione, could give them a dark magic wound. Like a limp, missing a finger or 2, scar across face, etc. That can be seen/used as a constant reminder.

From what I have seen post war Tonks, don't neglect Andromeda who Nym would go to for help. (Also remember Ted Tonks just died too)

As far as other representation I have seen an asexual Luna done well before (but dont remeber where) who was always more interested in a story and cryptozoology
