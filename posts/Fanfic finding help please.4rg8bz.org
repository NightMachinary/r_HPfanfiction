Okay, so there was this one fanfic I read last year or whatever, and it was about Harry waking up in a different timeline/dimension every morning, like one where Cho is his girlfriend, one where magic doesn't exist, and it turned out that like, Hermione was doing it the whole time trying to give Harry a perfect life or something.

So um...does anyone know the name of it please? Or am I just talking nonsense?

  After Harry nicks a Time-Turner in order to save Sirius, reality starts shifting around him. One day, he's not the Boy Who Lived, and the next, magic doesn't even exist. So Harry, being the only one aware of it, sets out to find out what went wrong
