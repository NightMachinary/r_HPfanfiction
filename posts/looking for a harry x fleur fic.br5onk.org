:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There was a fic where it starts in 4th year I think. Harry is an artist and he meets Tonks in Hogsmeade while drawing, and they become really close. I forgot most of what happened but I remember Harry uses ancient magic and eventually after the Yule ball he ends up with fleur. If anyone can tell me what this fic is it would be awesome.


** "The life he leads" or something similar to that title. On mobile atm

*** That's the right one. The author took it down for a bit after he lost the inspiration to continue writing it some such, but he's put it back up and is updating it again.
