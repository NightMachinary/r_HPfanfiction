Did you write it? If so, I'll give it a read, although I usually only read long complete fics.

**** I like your writing style. It's very very short for a first chapter, but that's OK. Do you have a plotline all fleshed out, or are you just winging it?

***** Oh is it that short? Sorry, I'm relatively new to fan fiction and I read a few that had pretty short chapters and I thought that was the norm.

I have a plotline in mind, but it might change due to circumstances. I've always been very intrigued by how American wizards might operate, so internally I've fleshed out a governing system. I'm not sure exactly what's happening with Arthur in the far out future-my main concern is that he's too similar to Harry and fundamentally passive, but sometimes you need a more passive character when fleshing out a world that's unfamiliar to the reader.

I'm mostly doing it as a mental exercise, it might become a Sunday afternoon tradition- it's been very fun to write to far.

****** I kind of like the similarity to Harry, but not with the direct reference to Harry's existence right there to remind me how similar they are. I've read some good fics that kind of mirror or otherwise follow Rowling's plot and character arcs.

** I like it so far. Your writing style is interesting. You might want to put an extra line before the letters and make them Italics to differentiate them more from the main text. You could make the chapter a little longer too. I try not to read stories in which the chapters aren't at least 3,000 words on average.

*** If I could bother you for some more input, what makes the writing style interesting? I've always thought of myself as a rather straight-forward writer.

And thanks, I'll try to make it longer, I'm doing some more writing tonight and I will update it!

**** It is somewhat reminiscent of the original Harry Potter books. Like how you phrase things.
