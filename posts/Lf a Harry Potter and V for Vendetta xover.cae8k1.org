A long time ago I read a V for Vendetta crossover with Hermione playing the Evey role in a world where Voldermort won. The story started off meeting the beats of the V for Vendetta graphic novel but branches away into its own thing. The story pushed the mystery of who is V strongly. At the time it wasn't complete, I dont remember if it was abandoned.

If not does anyone know of other Victorious Voldermort stories with a slow burn style revolution?
