** Linkffn(the beast master by wsbenge) it's been a really long time since I have read it but I do recall lots of interactions with animals, something about imprinting and being in their mind....

Linkffn(tamer by Hikaru Kosuzaku) in this fic Harry has inherited tamer gift and is rebuilding a sanctuary for magical creatures, I think. Been a long time since I have read it

  Power Dark Lord knows not. Something unique to Harry saved him from an attack by the worst wizard tyrant in centuries. Albus put traumatized boy in a picnic basket, and left him on Aunt's doorstep in the dead of night, note attached, of course. Riiight.

  Harry Potter is tired of the Dursleys. And after seeing how Fudge refused to listen to Sirius's pleas of innocence, he's tired of them too. So he runs away. And finds his purpose. Fourth-year fic. Homoromantic, asexual Harry. Slash undertones. Not Abandoned, but on Hiatus for unknown amount of time.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
