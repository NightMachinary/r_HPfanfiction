Alright, I have a few ideas in which I have in my head for writing HP fanfiction - even if its not uploaded right away - and I want to try and not be overly cliche, maybe have one or two in their for some giggles or I need to create a 'plot bunny'.

But, I can say that I have read a lot of different stories that portray characters differently, and to be honest, I want to know how to write them without 'bashing' them.

So for the questions - if you can give your opinion on how to write them or how to style them that will be appreciated.

1) How to have Harry be on friendly terms with the Weasley family, without having to be 'besties' with Ron. He can still be friends with him, not just always together with each other.

2) Dumbledore - Now, I have read a lot of stories where he is a 'senile and meddling old man', and I don't want to see him that way, and I don't want Harry or his friends to completely distrust or hate him. Any advice for that?

3) Luna - Now, I have re-read the books that she is in and rewatched the movies, and for the life of me, I just cannot wrap my head around the idea of writing her. I'm afraid I will mess up somewhere. Is there any baselines to start off with and maybe place a spin on it?

4) Hagrid - I'm sure that this comes up a lot, but is it needed to 'write' an accent for him or to muddle up words with him? I know Harry has a very close bond with him in the movies and books, so how do I recreate that in fanfiction without forcing it to much?

After reading those, is there somehow a way in which Harry doesn't go to Privet Drive, and instead Harry is placed under the care of Dumbledore's friends? Like Newt Scammander or something like that?

From what I am aiming for, I want to try and write a fanfiction in where Harry loves Magical Creatures and taking care of them. It will be something different.

Also, since I am not afraid to mention it, I do have Asperger's, I want to try and make Harry more introverted and selective with how he socialises with people and makes bonds.

Anyway, thank you for reading that rather long ramble. Sorry if I used the wrong flair for this. Please have a good day/night.


** 1. That's easy to do, because Harry and Weasleys are on the same side politically. The fight against Voldemort and Death Eaters goes way beyond the personal vendetta between Harry and Voldemort. Remember, Molly has yet to avenge her brothers Fabian and Gideon! It will be even easier if you have Harry being raised in the Wizarding world, because he has to get in contact with them much earlier. Since canon Harry is a Quidditch fanatic, he's very likely to make friends with most of them.

2. Here you need to break free from canon and develop your own plot. If you make Dumbledore more competent and live to his true reputation, then you need to increase Voldemort's threat level (and perhaps Ministry's maliciousness) for balance of power reason. Also, drop the notion that Dumbledore must sacrifice Harry because of Voldemort's soul fragment.

3. Just don't make your Luna a seer.

4. Hagrid is not popular in fanfics, so you can safely write him as a very peripheral character.

If you let Harry being raised by others, make you sure you understand the butterfly effect that's going to derail the canon plot. Some excellent examples here:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15861804/chapters/36950028][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkao3(15861804): This Petunia is a squib and becomes BAMF archeologist. She loves Harry and that has big effect on Harry's personality. She also works with Bill Weasley, so Harry is close to them early on. Some major canon events still happened, but often with quite different outcomes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363): Lockhart found and raised Harry. Consequently, this Harry is an expert in memory charms and quite cunning. Needless to say, things went down a different track in Year 1 already.

--------------

If you want a model for a very introvert Harry, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620), looks like a good example.

  AU. Petunia Evans might not have been a witch, but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. As a squib, Dr Evans found her niche: Discovering and exploring tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew as a single aunt.

  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!

  Hagrid is not popular in fanfics

I would counter that it's his accent that's not popular (specifically to write), moreso than the man himself.

** I can't offer much advice for the others, but I've been told my Luna is well written. My best advice is to make her as innocent and sincere as possible. Don't make her all knowing, or wily or cunning. She is a girl who watched her mother die when she was seven years old, who desperately wants to have friends and doesn't understand why people don't like her, who is mocked and teased but holds no grudges.

Keep that in mind and your Luna will turn out fine.

**** Sure. My fic is pretty long (170k words) and Luna doesn't come in til like, ch 21, so here's some passages she's in:

"Great." He cautiously approached the winged horse. "Are you sure it's friendly?"

"Of course! They like it when I scratch them on their necks. I suppose it's a tough spot for them to reach on their own." Sure enough, the animal leaned into his cautious petting.

"Do you come visit the thestrals often?"

"Not so much now that I come to the forest with you, but my first month here I spent a lot of time with them. They like having me around. It's, it's nice to be around friends."

Harry regarded her seriously. "Luna, the thestrals aren't your only friends, you know."

"I didn't think so, but Ginny hasn't wanted to talk to me since earlier in the summer. I'm afraid the Gulping Plimpies may have gotten to her. So I started coming out here."

"Who's Ginny?"

"Ginevra Weasley. She's my neighbor, of sorts, in Ottery St. Catchpole, where I live. She's a First Year in Gryffindor. I used to attend primary lessons with her at her house."

"Oh." The two lapsed into silence for a few minutes, until the thestral wandered away towards Hagrid's hut, looking for a meal. "Luna, are the other students teasing you?"

Her wide, silver eyes locked on to his own. "No. No one has said anything mean to me. Mostly, they just don't seem to notice me at all."

Harry had some experience with people pretending like he didn't exist. "I guess it's a good thing that we're friends, then, isn't it?"

"Friends..." Luna drew out the word, as if tasting it. Her lips broke out into her trademark smile, the dreamy expression returning to her face. "Right. I suppose you'd like to practice your magic now?"

~~~~~~~~

Harry was at breakfast, sitting with Luna who was deeply focused on constructing a log cabin made out of sausage links, with maple syrup providing the adhesive. The Great Hall was crowded, and he smiled and nodded in response to Susan's wave. Daphne, at the Slytherin table, sat focused on her food. She hadn't taken her brush with the Heir of Slytherin well, but insisted on continuing her lessons with him.

He kept glancing at the large window that allowed owls entrance to the Great Hall, hoping Hedwig would return today with a reply from Sam. Despite his relocation to Germany, he still responded to often to letters that Harry sent, offering advice and ideas for Harry's late-night training sessions in the Forbidden Forest.

The elaborate design that Luna had built crumbled, the sausages sliding around her plate in pools of syrup, but the girl didn't seem at all bothered, grabbing her fork and spearing one to take a bite. He couldn't help but chuckle at the delight she exhibited over the simplest things.

~~~~~~~

"Luna, wait!"

"Hello, Neville."

"This is where you've been spending all your time? The Forbidden Forest is dangerous, you know." He had caught up to her, the light of his lumos washing over the two. "Where is your cloak, Luna? It's freezing out here!"

"The nargles took it. And Harry and I came out here all the time last year."

Neville snorted and shot a wry grin at the Ravenclaw. "Okay, but Harry can be scarier than anything in this Forest, so that's different." He slid his thick woolen cloak off his shoulders and wrapped it around the girl. "There, does that feel better?"

Luna shifted the basket she held from one arm to the other. "Is there something you needed?"

"I wanted to apologize for Ron. He's going to say sorry, himself, but we haven't seen you around since Halloween."

"You said you were my friends, but you didn't act like it."

"Ron's just, well he's just a git sometimes. And after he apologizes, he doesn't have to come around anymore. We can spend time together, just like in the study group last year." Neville winced involuntarily, thinking how - with Hannah dead, Hermione at Beauxbatons, Susan at St. Mungo's, and Harry vanished - he was the last remaining member of their group.

Luna's face, red from the Scottish chill, didn't change from her placid expression. "Maybe. I have to go, a friend is waiting for me."

She turned to leave, but Neville reached out and grabbed her arm, holding her in place. "A friend? In the Forest? You know curfew is in an hour, don't you?."

"Yes, yes, and yes. Let go of me, Neville."

"Maybe I should come with you, just to make sure everything's all righ-"

Luna jerked her arm out of Neville's grasp. "Stop it! I'm not a-, I'm not stupid, or crazy! I don't need someone to make decisions for me, or tell me what's best for me. I'm not handicapped, I'm not mental, and I'm not Loony!" Tears were falling down her cheeks, her silvery eyes sparkling in the light of Neville's charm.

"Luna, I never said you were, I jus-"

"You just want to look after me. That's not all a friend does. Harry listened to me, he respected me, he let me help him. You think of me the same as everyone else does - a crazy girl from a crazy family. The only difference is, you just feel sorry for me. And that's worse."

"I was just trying to make sure you're okay. Harry's gone, Luna! He's not here! I-, look, maybe we don't agree on a lot of things, but that doesn't mean I can't still be there for you. Maybe I'm not perfect, but I'm standing here, right now. Doesn't that count for something?"

She shrugged off his cloak and threw it at him, storming away deeper into the Forest. Stepping into her and Harry's clearing, she set the basket down and wept.
