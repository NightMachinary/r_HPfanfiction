preferably no romance but if it the stories are really good then the only pairings I will absolutely not read are Harry/Tonks, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Daphne, and Harry/Susan. I don't know how any of those pairings can result from a Black family fic but I've seen much weirder shit.


** Reclamation of Black Magic is probably the best one.

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Updated Sporadically---Not Abandoned*

** "Blackpool" is shaping up to be amazing so far, and The Divine Comedian always finishes what she starts. She says there will be six chapters.

  When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

  For the Ancient and Noble House of Black, the height of power marked the beginning of its decline. A game of politics, for personal gain, for the good of everyone... but using Voldemort's rise to prevent a war was a gamble.-- Winner of DLPs January Contest.

** I don't remember the author's name or what their fics were called, but I'm pretty sure they're on FFN.

IIRC, they wrote several different fics, mostly about members of the Black family, and they really fleshed out some of the more bare-bones parts of wizarding culture, like religious traditions for example. Gosh, I wish I remembered more of the specifics--maybe someone else can recall it. There's a couple things I remember clearly: One was that werewolves aren't shunned in Traditional Pureblood society, that's just the influence of muggleborns. The other is that there's some sort of ritual where a virgin girl goes into a field and has sex with a man wearing a mask, and Andromeda went and screwed Ted Tonks before she could be made to do it. The fic(s) may have all been Bellatrix-centric, but I'm not sure.

Most fics about Sirius and his family are pretty atrocious and over-the-top.
