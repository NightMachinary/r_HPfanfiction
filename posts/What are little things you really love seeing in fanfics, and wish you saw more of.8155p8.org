We have the pet peeves thread seemingly every damn day, so let's examine the opposite.

Are there any little facets or ideas in fanfics that you really love seeing, and wish you saw more of? Little quirks of fanon or original concept? Are there any particular tropes that are maybe more common, but you really enjoy seeing again and again?


** They say you should write what you want to see so for me that means slipping in little details that aren't necessarily relevant to the plot but are cute little moments of magic. So taking some time to come up with a magical brand name or adding some magic to every day mundane actions. They can be good tools for characterisation, or they can simply be fun. I love it when I get a review picking up on something like that.

** Little bits of humour. And I don't mean the raunchy, obnoxious kind but more similar to canon, where the characters have their unexpected funny moments. Most characters have their own unique sense of humour, so I like seeing that in fics.

*** I absolutely /love/ cleverly written one-liners.

A cleverly written one-liner can draw attention to a particular point or give a bit of dry humor to a situation.

/Harry knew of one place where he could get the potions he needed: Snape's storeroom./

/When Snape found out, he'd be sure to hate Harry./

/Suppose it doesn't really change much in the end then./

Something of that sort, I love it when a story makes me chuckle.

*** I might be able to help you with that. I am writing a mystery story where Slughorn gets murdered, and Harry gets more and more stuck in the mess, which goes far beyond a simple murder. Starts at the Christmas party and leaves the HBP plot and Hogwarts behind afterwards. The beginning is a little heavy on the Harry/Tonks fluff since I needed some filler for time to pass and a competent adult on Harry's side.

** Teenagers acting and talking like teenagers. With almost no adult supervision, underage drinking and sex would be far more common at Hogwarts than in most fics. I am not talking about Roman-style orgies here, but something like a Muggleborn using magic to alter his ID, apparating to the next village and getting a six-pack of beer or a bottle of vodka ought to be more common. Also not everything instantly turning into "true love"^{^{TM.}} I know plenty of people who became an item because they were bored or wanted to know how French kissing someone wearing a tongue piercing feels like. Show that kind of casual behaviour in stories which are not just focused on smut. Doesn't have to be the main character, but to have these things somewhere is always nice. Also, if Hermione would chide every use of "foul" language, she would have no free time whatsoever. Don't you remember how any group of teenagers (especially boys) talked when no adult was around?

Writers often focus on teenage angst and yet forget that being a teenager was more than endless brooding and emotional uncertainty.

  Readers believe in fidelity and love, even in a harem story. They want to see people supported and cared about, not see the MC used as a sex toy.

What is confusing this poor reader is that I'm not writing a harem story, so the girls are acting like they have the right to make their own choices, not living their lives solely for the sake of Harry.

** I just really love when a character.. acts like themselves. It's such an obvious thing but I see a lot of weird character altering. Harry is a little shit in a lot of the books which is hilarious- we all got to live vicariously through him when he tells off his teachers. But I'll see so many fics where none of that exists, he's just kind of A Nice Sensible Pleasant Person. I'm all for character development - if it's a Draco centric fic I know he's not a Complete and Terrible Asshole and would probably eventually get the stick out of his butt but it's so weird when all of a sudden he turns into a really sweet, sensitive, chill guy.

#+begin_quote
  "Certainly, my fine chap! History of Magic, eh? That one's not moved in over three hundred years, with Binns teaching it. Take this staircase," the portrait pointed East, "up two floors, turn round, go down three floors, open the wall where it looks like an aardvark, and climb the spiral stair thirteen revolutions. Mind the hundred-and-twelfth step, it's not really there. Bit of a nasty fall if you forget."

  The portrait was talking. Harry remembered Ron had mentioned moving pictures being normal in newspapers, photo albums, and all manner of paintings, but he'd never expected them to talk.

  "Right, thanks," said Neville. Dean and Ron grabbed Harry by the arms and dragged him up the stairs. "We appreciate it."

  Harry forgot about the hundred-and-twelfth stair on the spiral. The portrait was right, it was a bit of a nasty fall; fortunately, Harry had had far worse from his cousin back in Number Four Privet Drive, so he was back up the stairs by the time Ron had turned around to find him. He was, however, very confused when he found the door labeled 'History of Magic' and the others couldn't see it.

  "Well, we've only gone 'round twelve times," suggested Dean, "and you've gone thirteen with that fall."

  Harry nodded. "I guess that makes sense with magic." He opened the door. "I'll see you guys in a bit?"

  "Yep."

Or this one from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892][The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks]]

#+begin_quote
  "Barnacle tree?" Harry looked doubtfully at the shimmering shells. One by one the shells began to quiver. Then the two halves of each shell parted slowly, and little beaks began to poke out of the shells. Before long, the tree was covered in dozens of wet and bedraggled little goslings.

  Harry reached out and touched one gently. The little bird looked at him with bright, black eyes and gave his finger an affectionate little peck.

  "Barnacle geese!" exclaimed Hermione. "They are extraordinarily rare. How did you manage to get hold of a barnacle tree, Professor?"

  Professor Sprout smiled as she reached for a box of worms and began feeding the birds. "My sister shipped it to me from the Isle of Man where she lives. There are still a few wild barnacle trees left there. My whole family has always loved plants and trees."

  (...)

  "Any time, my dear boy. The barnacle geese will be ready to detach from the tree tomorrow; you should come back and see them when they begin to fly." She grinned. "Not many people realize that some birds grow on trees, you know."

**** Because in canon it's almost impossible to dodge a spell. The only example we see if people deliberately dodging spells is in HBP under the influence of Felix. All other examples are of someone throwing themselves out of the way the moment they know a spell is about to come their way. Not only does that fail as a combat tactic - you're putting yourself on the back foot by allowing yourself to be herded around - it also isn't really dodging. It's just being a moving target, the same as you can do against a gunman.

Also because in canon magic doesn't come with a cost, so there's nothing lost by choosing to shield.

Also because in canon shielding is not the only way to stop offensive spells. Blocking and parrying are alternatives, and blocking at least is considered basic enough that it can be introduced to second years.

It might just be because there are too many 'Harry and Co stop taking shit and fix the world', but it is always neat to see adults figure out what is going on and step up.

I've seen this with Dumbles really not being that bad just missing things because of cannon, so you have him see things differently and he puts a stop to all the crap. Or you have an external adult who was not previously involved (seen it with Tonks a few times, Amelia even more)

One of the best I've seen of this was the one where Dumbledor dropped everything when he heard "Basilisk" and called in the marines.

Only half-points if the "adult" in question is a time-traveling version of one the hogwarts kids. 0 points if it is a time-traveling kid from the future that ends up back in his kids body.

** - Incorporating setting elements and aspects of wizarding lifestyle that make perfect sense given how wizards are and what they can do, but that I could not have imagined by myself. For example, in linkffn(Patron by Starfox5), wizards enchant their gift boxes to have sizes, shapes, and weights that have nothing to do with those of the gifts they contain.

A guilty one:

- Hermione casually doing powerful magic. That is, the Hermione being "powerful" might not be a major focus of the fic, but a situation calls for some large-scale or high-level magic, and Hermione just casually does it. For example, in linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozalsky), Hermione spams Fidelius Charms to hide her love affairs.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** I like seeing fics with plenty of spells, mostly healing spells because we all see charms transfiguration and the such, where it's all ‘point and shoot a random spell that does this' but no actual incantation, this is mostly because I'm a fox writer and can't find any kind of healing spell other than cannon that makes sense.

I also like to see those slow burn romance fics that don't have ginny as the pairing. It's ruined many, MANY fics when harry shows an interest in Ginny without a good reason. They're all ‘I suddenly have a massive crush on you because I saved your life... rah rah rah' it's bull.

***** I know your response is very tongue in cheek, but here I go.

To be honest, I would love to see more writers explore how to solve HPuniverse problems with some of the canon characters dead.

Think of how different Year Three would go, by necessity, if Hermione were dead and there is no time turner. How different would Year Two go if Ron had been knocked out of the Anglia by the Willow and broken his neck? If a mandrake killed Professor Sprout? If the hippogriff killed Malfoy? What if the Ridgeback venom proved very deadly to Hagrid? If Oliver had succeeded in drowning himself in the shower after the lost Quidditch match? Dozens more come to mind.

How much would canon change if Fleur died in the lake? If Arthur died in the Ministry? If any of the Ministry Six didn't have plot armor in Book 5? Each would create huge ripples, even if you stayed mostly to the Stations of Canon before that.

One of the great flaws of HP is that nearly no one important dies until the end. Cedric is a plot device, not a character. Sirius is barely fleshed out. Amelia Bones has virtually zero plot impact. Hannah Abbott loses her mother, but Hannah is a cardboard cutout of a character. Dumbledore dying changes the entire tone.

I guess I'm saying I would love a GoT style HP fic where anyone can die, the good guys don't always win/get what they want, and where Bad Things(tm) can happen.

I know of linkffn(Forging the Sword) and I wish more writers would attempt that sort of AU fic.

****** I used a Sirius/Harry/Pettigrew confrontation without Ron or Hermione (or Snape and Lupin for that matter) as background for one of my stories. Pettigrew ended up stunned and left behind when the Dementors showed up. He's kissed, the others escape on brooms/as animagus. You can shoehorn almost any situation to go wherever you want, no need to kill characters off for it. The butterfly effect is the writers best friend.
