Yes. That's all I needed to read.

And then reading more:

The rest of that paragraph you've immediately made him # 1 or 2 in the three categories you list. So....yes again.

The lazy asshole stereotype is boring. It doesn't exist because brilliant people are lazy. It exists because lazy teenagers think they're brilliant but are often just lazy pieces of shit.

Bravado and confidence are not the same thing. An excess of confidence is not really a flaw in so much as an annoying quirk. Nearly getting killed is irrelevant if the character escapes unharmed.

Of course it's a dragon. Why wouldn't it be. You know there's nothing wrong with a patronus being a dog or a cat or a goldfish. Making it something super special is dumb.

He sounds like boring wish-fulfillment.

Edit 2: Hell, it's more entertaining if he can cast a patronus but is embarrassed because it's something silly like a mouse or something. That could at least be endearing.

** TL:DR (like all my advice posts): Natural talent is a myth. Challenge yourself to challenge your character more.

Here's the thing, the elevator pitch for a character makes it hard to judge any nuances. That said, if you feel your character is a Gary Stu, he probably is.

Aside from the heir of Merlin thing that was mentioned elsewhere, you've fallen into the skill vs talent fallacy. Sure, some people are slightly better than others at things, but most of the time, if you see someone doing something masterfully and effortlessly, it's because they've spent hours upon hours working hard on that thing, or at least something like it. That guy you might know who can pick up a mandolin for the first time and play it flawlessly? He's probably spent several thousand hours on things like the guitar, that he's able to transfer the skill. That guy who is an incredible artist? He's read books on the subject, studied the work of other artists, and has been drawing as a passion since he was five. See Howard Tayler's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4qBSrLe19k][lecture series "Talent? Who needs talent?"]] as well as Stephen McCraine's superlative [[https://doodlealley.com/2009/11/29/the-need-for-sustainable-creativity/][comic series "Brick by Brick"]] for more on the subject.

If you wish, you can play with tropes like "had tutors in this" and "Purebloods aren't under the trace, so their kids can practice at home" to offset some of this, but as with all tropes, a poorly written one will undermine everything you're doing with it. Put the time in to flesh out whatever tropes you use.

In order for a character to be compelling, they need to have conflict. If your OC is going to have a growth arc, I suggest looking into [[https://writingexcuses.com/2015/07/19/writing-excuses-10-29-why-should-my-characters-fail-spectacularly/][Try/Fail cycles]]. One of my favorite bits of writing advice on this subject comes from Brandon Sanderson in an old episode of Writing Excuses, who said something to the effect of "Your character can be literally as powerful as you want, so long as the area he's being challenged in is not in his area of expertise." If I recall correctly from the same discussion, Howard Tayler suggested something like an immortal who is captured by vampires. Sure he'll live forever, but he's also food.

Another thing to consider as a source of conflict is give the character a stake in whatever is going on, or give them something that can be lost. An example of this is a character that can't die permanently being upset because the explosion they just survived destroyed their favorite shoes. This is often taken to humorous extremes (I've not seen it, but from what I've heard anime like One Punch Man play this trope to the Nth degree).

Your stated example of "he can't cast the Patronus Charm" is a decent step in the right direction, but I don't feel that it's sufficient. It's a single spell, that has been established as difficult for grown adults to cast, and really only has two known uses, one of which, driving away dementors, is incredibly niche. Harry used it for this purpose what, 3-4 times in 5 books? This supposed conflict feels like low hanging fruit. Whenever you are looking for plots like this, discard the first two or three, because the those are the easy answers. Reach for the more challenging plot points, that will make the victory over it that much sweeter.

There is another consideration. What is the tone of your story? Is it a heroic romp? Is it a crack-fic? If so, I'll give more leeway, as especially with the latter, there's a lot of room to hang a lantern on the fact that you know he's OP, and keep going. Do you want it do be an angst filled drama, or even a serious long form story? In that case, there's a lot less tolerance for Gary Stu to show up, especially when it's an OC.

Also, is he a main, side, or tertiary character? A Gary Stu tertiary character is more forgivable than a main character in some stories.

**** Did you care to see the citations that the user highlighted to make his point about talent? I don't want to go out of my way - and gather some journal articles to prove a point in a fanfiction thread, but there is scientific evidence that says that general aptitude (such a high IQ, or other 'talent' for doing something) is not a very good predictor of success. A better predictor being the time devoted to the activity.

Anyway, as I said, I don't want to get involved in an academic discussion here, so let me go to the point you made about Sirius and James being naturally talented. I always got the impression that they were a little bit like Fred and George, and you would have to be very obtuse to believe that those two did not work hard to achieve the success of their well famous pranks.

Obviously, their learning method was clearly not very orthodox, but I bet they learned lots of things while researching a way to do a perfect prank They probably ended up learning their official coursework by osmose while doing that. And Sirius and James did become animagi when they were like, 15? This certainly required lots of study and discipline... they probably had to work very hard to achieve that thing alone.

**** If I recall correctly, we were mostly told that James was a natural in transfiguration, and in that case it's probably that he was slightly better at it, or understood the basics better, liked it, practiced it more, and then seemed to be a natural at it.

That's how it was with me with math. And when I stopped doing homework, because I was talented at math, guess what? I failed that class.

Edit: Also, note this likely isn't a conscious choice on the part of the person involved. Psychology isn't all that intuitive. Another note is basic things like intelligence, and opportunity to practice will play a factor, but in every case of someone being "naturally gifted" at something by the time they reach adulthood, they will either tell you that they have been doing it for a long time, possibly since they were a kid, or they will tell you it was easy, and if you are willing to learn, you can do it too.

This is a great rule to follow when writing an OC you think is too powerful. Otherwise, at least in my experience, you'll get bored of them too.

I've got an OC called Rose in the fic I'm writing that can trivialize any test of strength, but can't do crap if it involves subtlety or diplomacy. Her third year ended up being one big political problem, which I thought was more compelling than just letting her solve everything in a chapter.

Finally, there's another episode of writing excuses where [[https://writingexcuses.com/2014/03/09/writing-excuses-9-10-engaging-characters/][they address similar issues]]. Might help to give it a listen.

Writing Excuses is suggested for all beginning to intermediate authors, in my humble opinion. To any and all who haven't yet, go listen!

That kid then gets special attention, which encourages them to practice more. Then because of all that practice, when it comes to high school level, the kid looks naturally talented in all sports.

You can have the genetics to be a top elite athlete, but if you never, or rarely play any sport, you are not going to be good at any sport...

You can have the mediocre genetics for sports, but if you practice and train regularly a particular sport, eventually your muscle memory will kick in and you will be able to play something for pleasure... even though it might feel like that you need to work more than everybody else to achieve the same standard...

now, if you have the genes AND the environment - the predisposition to sports AND work hard, then you will have what people tend to call talent.

the same stuff applies to IQ...

You can have an extremely bright kid who has an IQ bigger than Einstein, but this kid lives in a rural area somewhere in an undeveloped country... he works the whole day and is pretty much a slave... then you have another kid who has a very low IQ, but the kid is filthy rich and able to receive the best education that money can buy -

*** I don't know if I can qualify it as an "angst filled drama" but it is a drama where there's no real happy ending. His older sister (like, 10 years older) was tortured into becoming a death eater (and also became very much insane) and killed his parents in front of his eyes. The "Lazy a-hole" act is a sort of coping mechanism for him. In the Battle Of Hogwarts, he confronts her, but then realizes that she's just a shell of her former self. In the end, the fight between the two get so bad he has to actually use the killing curse in order to stop her

**** First, from the bits you've given us, yeah sounds like angst and drama to me.

That said, this does sound like a more compelling character arc. You may want to look into the psychology of cults, mobs/gangs, as well as stockholme syndrome for the sister's arc, as those are more grounded in reality, and far more chilling than tortured into being a death eater, in my opinion. In the HP universe we have the Longbottoms as an example of what happens as an overuse of torture. Cults are terrifying and leave you wanting to do whatever horrible thing they have planned.

"Lazy a-hole" doesn't sound like a logical coping mechanism for someone who is working to save his sister. Driven a-hole fits the stated situation better in my opinion. Perhaps that should be his character arc? Lazy a-hole to driven a-hole to something better by the end? Remember, readers don't want static characters.

Also, if a large part of your character conceit is based on him being an a-hole, know that he isn't sympathetic, which is usually a large part of the recipe for a villain. Check out Writing Excuses episode on [[https://writingexcuses.com/2014/03/30/writing-excuses-9-13-three-prong-character-development/][Three Pronged Character Development]] for more, with a better explanation on this, and how to adjust towards or away from villainy as you wish.

Apply the questions you should ask anytime some new magic or technology is added to a setting:

What is this?

How and why was it made, or where does it come from?

How will it affect the richest/social elite?

How will it affect the poorest in society/socially disadvantaged?

How can this be abused/manipulated?

How can it be marketed?

What does the black market for it look like?

** He should have stronger subjects and weaker ones. For example, Harry is very skilled with DADA and Hermione is amazing at Charms. But Hermione isn't that great at DADA. Maybe he isn't good with theory and better at application/vice versa? Or maybe he is great at practical magic but is horrible at the others such as History, Astronomy, Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies, etc.

But maybe you can make him too confident in his abilities since he is a 'jerk with a heart of gold'. Common traits of such characters include pride and arrogance. So being overconfident eventually costs him too much, so he fails a few subjects and then he has to gather himself and actually study. This can give him trouble since he isn't used to it and he has a short attention span or is too bored. Or he isn't particularly creative and has a very narrow-minded view of things.

Just a side note as well: Does he really have to be descended from Merlin? Maybe you can make him descended from an odd Wizarding figure, making it an embarrassment for the family, and they try to hide it a bit. It could make for a bit of light-heartedness as well. As for the patronus, you seem to be desperate for a flying creature. Firstly, a patronus represents a) your deeper self or b) who you feel grants you protection the most. Tone it down a bit, it doesn't have to be large for it to be powerful. After all, some of the most powerful patroni was a mouse. Maybe a thestral if you're desperate for a magical creature?

Also, since you seem to be writing a fic, make him add a different dynamic to the trio. Hermione is the intelligent one, Ron provides them with information on Wizarding culture and history. Ron is also impressively quick-witted, he most often provides them with quick plans. Harry, well, he's Harry. Seriously though, he's the leader and their best duelist. Just don't make him hog up all their functions in the group, give him his own. Maybe make him a spy for the Slytherins and so provides them with the spiciest Death Eater gossip. Or maybe he's just generally a gossip source for them. But there are lots of possibilities, be creative!

Remember that Draco is the one second to Hermione academically, and that without studying he may pass/do well but he wouldn't out preform them. Personality wise, he sounds like a jerk version of Harry; natural talent, resourceful but being a lazy student holds him back.
