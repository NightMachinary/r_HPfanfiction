I'm looking for a specific FanFiction where Harry is sent back in time to the Marauders time. Lily and James get together but Harry goes to school with them in their last year. Harry was going to be paired with one of Lily's best friend whose name I believed started with a B. The only thing I remember was that in the beginning when Harry is sent back in time he saves Lily at Diagon Alley from Voldemort's dear eaters or him. Please let me know if you know of this Fic I have been looking for it for months.


** Dunno If you found it but here: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4196344/1/]] No idea how to use the bot.

  For all of his life Harry has fought for his freedom and for vengeance, he has been an eternal beacon shining through the oncoming darkness. It was not enough however, the darkness has overwhelmed the world and Voldemort has seemingly won. There were two things Voldemort was not ready for though, Harry's sheer determination and will to win, and the brilliance of Albus Dumbledore.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** linkffn(12317784) linkffn(13214317)

One of these is my own and it's a WIP, but it will be updated fairly often and I have faith, (and apparently so do the readers since the response has been incredible) the other is by probably my favourite HP author right now.

If for some reason they still don't link properly they are:
