Been reading linkffn(13150962)

It's a Rosario Vampire Crossover, and has Harry, in Japan, actively using the Unforgiveables for reasons that make sense. Kuyo was a threat to his friends, he couldn't win in any other way, he casts Avada and kills him.

In a regular canonish story, Harry could see Hermione/Ron getting attacked by a Transformed Greyback, and not having a way to save them in time otherwise, fires off an Avada, killing the Werewolf. Regretting it afterwards, but getting a Speech, from Moody or Shacklebolt of "You might regret killing Greyback, but you'd have regretted it more if you didn't" sort of speech.

Killing a transformed Werewolf with an Avada wouldn't be a crime by Wizarding Britain standards anyway.


** He does that even in canon, a lot of fics have it- though one that comes to mind is linkffn(10707993) Harry Potter And The Unforgivable Tournament, bit funny, bit serious, in which Harry takes to heart that it's only unforgivable against another witch/wizard.

*** The only one he uses in Canon for a good reason is the Imperius. His one successful Crucio was on the guy that spat at McGonagall, rather than Bellatrix, or Wormtail, Lucius, any of the people who have screwed up his life badly, and he never once uses Avada. Avada'ing transformed Greyback would be quite forgivable.

**** I'd say trying to torture the woman that just murdered his godfather is a good reason, but that might be a difference in my own morals compared to the norm.

***** It'd make more sense if he'd snapped off an Avada than trying to torture her, good reason wise. "That evil bitch killed Sirius, I won't let her kill anyone else AVADA KEDAVRA" and it actually working. Trying to torture her is understandable in a human sense though.

****** Just death isn't punishment enough- it follows Dumbledore's opinions- which considering he was more or less Dumbledore's successor makes sense- there are after all worse things than death.

Also- he was an emotional wreck, can't expect clear thinking right after someone you love dies.

******* I get that, but that also means the Crucio should have worked on Bellatrix better than the one that ACTUALLY worked on Carrow. Emotionally, Harry should have wanted her to suffer enough for the curse to work.

But what I meant was more fairly sensible Harry, like the one in the story I linked (It's actually fairly good. His Harry is far more likeable than Tsukune was in canon Rosario) Kind of like Unforgivable Tournament too, yeah. Actively a case of "I'm fucked otherwise, I can regret it later, Avada Kedavra" but on Greyback/badguys to save his friends

******** Only he didn't know until bella said that you had to really mean them- course intent in spell crafting only makes sense but he was a kid and not the brightest- maybe he thought the words and wand motions were it and was so powerful that for him it was.

More I'd say the inverse is true- McG did nothing for Harry but help leave him at an abusive home, never take his side, not help him when he was bullied from points losses, rumors like being the heir of Slytherin and 'cheating' to get in the Goblet of fire.. Honestly, I'd figure he'd be more likely to make Crucio work on the kitty rather than the incest twins.

********* You had to mean it, which meant you had to want to hurt the person. Logically, if someone had just killed one of the few people in my life I cared about, fuck the law, I'd want them to suffer in ways Wu Zetian would turn squeemsih at, so I'd be able to make the Crucio work.

********** Yes- but... How to put this- his emotions were clouded- in that moment I doubt that he wanted nothing more than to make a person suffer- he was also distraught with loss as well, probably worried about his friends and so on.
