Basically, any fanfics with a very powerful Harry. He can be a god, Master of Death, immortal or any other bullshit that makes him above most, if not all. Only restriction is that it needs to be a crossover. Here are some fandoms I would like the crossover to be:

- Percy Jackson;
- Game of Thrones;
- Marvel;
- DC Comics;
- Star Wars.

Fanfics with different crossovers would also be good, but my search is mostly in those five above. Also, most of my search until now what in FFN, so if you guys know fanfiction in other domains of what I'm searching, please comment about it.


** Apologies if you've seen some of these before. The one with the latin title is part one of a series of little oneshots, and highly recommended.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry Potter defeats Lord Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts arcane magic combines with the Deathly Hallows to an unforeseen consequence. Trying to raise Teddy and deal with those consequences as best as possible while desperately wishing his Saving People Thing wasn't quite so strong, Harry grudgingly involves himself in another war when he hears the Great Prophecy and realises people are expecting children to save the world again. Dragging Merlin along with him, Harry tries to keep his godson safe while his unexpected interference throws the Fates into an unknown future. Can he keep everyone safe in the end?

  (Or - The Time Death Shanghaied Harry into Becoming Death and Got Away With It.)If he had known one hundred and eight years ago the trouble picking up the Elder Wand would cause him, he would have left the damn thing where it was. Admittedly, the chair almost made it worth it. (Almost.)

  Harry finds out that his dad is alive, has been the whole time. Instead of being overjoyed, Harry's disgusted. His dad left earth and abandoned his friends. Every painful thing he's ever gone through can be traced back to one man. Now Harry's got super strength he can't control and an almost unnecessary amount of magical power. His dad might be living it up with the Avengers now but not for long. With the help of his friends, Harry comes up with a plan for revenge. Get ready Avengers, Harry's out to punch a god.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24850216/chapters/60115636]]

It doesn't become a crossover until part 2 and I am not a crossover fan, so I dropped it at that time but the first part is entertaining.

I do remember one I enjoyed with sg-1 but forgot the title. An op Harry deals with voldemort and the gets an obsession with space travel. He is visited by an ancient that tells him what he has to do and he ends up fighting replicators with the asguard fleet

  Harry Potter, a superhero, and a supervillain walk into a bar. Things escalate a bit from there. Specifically, into my answer to the Blood Brandy Vegas Challenge, which will forcefully introduce Harry to the DC Universe just when a number of sidekicks and younger heroes are getting a little antsy with the current status quo. Things are gonna get crazy. Harry/Multi. AU Harry raised by Sirius.

** based on how you wrote your request, I assume those 5 are examples, not the entirety of the list you want.

The Havoc Side of the Force by Tsu Doh Nimh\\
Lord of the Rings isn't on your list but The Power He Knows Not By: Steelbadger is incredible so I'm including it. Steelbadger also has a series of DC comics/Harry potter stories that you might want to try.\\
Toppling Heroes, the second of the two so far is closer to what you're looking for and the two are interconnected but you can read one with out the other. Just know Harry was in Gotham before the start of the story looking for Neville and you should be fine.\\
Browncoat, Green Eyes By: nonjon which is firefly is incredibly well written.\\
I have a one or two mass effect stories I could dig up too if anyone's interested
