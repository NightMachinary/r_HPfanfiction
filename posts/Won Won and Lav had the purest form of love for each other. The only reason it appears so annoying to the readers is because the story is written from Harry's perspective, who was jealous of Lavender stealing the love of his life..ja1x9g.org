#+TITLE: Won Won and Lav had the purest form of love for each other. The only reason it appears so annoying to the readers is because the story is written from Harry's perspective, who was jealous of Lavender stealing the love of his life.

** I once started writing a one shot where Hermione is jealous of Ron stealing the love of her life. There was a scene where Hermione was sitting by Ron in the hospital wing and said something to the unconscious Ron like, "I wish I could love you instead. That would be much easier wouldn't it?" I should really finish writing that some day.
