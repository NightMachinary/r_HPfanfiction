** Write it! You sound inspired and the world is your sandbox. There will be an audience for it. Just dont call him Hadrian.

** My three suggestions:

1. Don't write Daphne as Ice Queen of Slytherin

2. Don't rehash canons

3. Don't bash, especially not if you need bashing to bring Harry and Daphne together

*** Oh no, not at all. My plan is to deviate from canon almost immediately and there is no bashing required.

** It sounds very intriguing. As a massive fan of Haphne and other weird pairing I would really like to see this. But I mean when you talk about magic, do you mean Spiderman and MJ comics broken up Mephisto magic? Or like realistic magic?

Either way sounds good! If you do post please link it!

*** I don't mean that every little magical action will have major consequences but there are two lines from ASOIAF that intrigue me: 1) Magic is like a sword without a hilt; there is no safe way to use it, and 2) Prophecy is like a treacherous woman...she'll bite your prick off every time.

Again, not every magical moment would have consequences and I don't intend to exactly copy anything, but the idea of magic costing something interests me. That and compelling characters facing moral and philosophical dilemmas.

** I for one would like a fanfic where magic is even more powerful and a sense of wonder and terror is prominent regarding magic. Fuck magic having a price to use. Make the real danger come from people. Raise competence and danger of people in general. Have multiple groups vying for power and control (and actually be relevant) besides Dumbledore, the Ministry and Voldemort & co.

You want a grittier take on the world? Do it through the people. Leave the magic as it was or make it more awesome.

** I'm always up for reading Haphne and other comments in this thread have given some great advice. So I will just say be careful with the grittiness. A lot of people say they want gritty, but if the story is gritty just for grittiness sake people will quickly get bored or not care.

** Nothing actually wrong with making Daphne ice queen of Slytherin if you do go there. There is a reason it's a popular trope. Definitely sounds like an interesting premise.
