  The boy from the train was right. In order to be Sorted, they really did have to fight a troll.

*** There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2630300/11/You-Did-What][this chapter]] in nonjon's You Did What! where James Potter and Sirius Black have to do a sorting which is good but probably not what you were looking for.

(I would've edited my post rather than reply to myself but I thought it might have messed with the bot.)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]] has a different kind of "Sorting". Its not really a Sorting per se, just another rite of passage.
