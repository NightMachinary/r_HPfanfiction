His job focuses on muggle baiting. Wizards enchanting muggle objects especially in the muggle world. Would that be an accurate description? Do you think ignorance about muggles can be excused because wizards don't necessarily interact with muggles a lot nor need their technology. I always felt like the muggle and wizarding worlds would be like different countries due to the long separation between the two worlds being longer than America has been from Britain if I remember when the statute of secrecy was first put up right.


** I mean, Author Weasley didn't even know how to use a rubber duck... I think outside of select magicals, they probably have no idea how anything works in regards to the Muggle world.

But then they drive cars at certain points, so I think it comes down to - 'Magicals don't know how Muggle stuff works until the plot needs them to magically know how to use said Muggle stuff.'

*** But there is no use for a rubber duck. It's a toy for playing with, that has zero use. It was a silly question, but I think JK intended it to highlight the differences between how regular folk and magic folk live. You fetch someone from an isolated Amazon tribe and introduce him to Western living, and it stands to reason he might think rubber duck might have a purpose, too. After all, lots of useful things are put into animal shapes.

*** I think it's more that they only understand things that are useful to them, cars are quite the improvement over a broomstick for transporting groups of people, especially in poor weather.\\
They copied the Hogwarts Express and Knight Bus from muggles too. It's just unimportant things like electricity (which doesn't even reliably work near magical locations), rubber ducks (which are both relatively modern and a mere children's toy), or how planes fly (because the mystery is how muggles do it without magic, they know how to make anything that needs to fly do so).\\
They don't know what the correct term for firearms is because they're inferior to wands and wizards (so other wizards won't be using them) and they don't generally interact with, let alone fight, muggles, the context of the firearms stuff was the lies they're telling muggles about Black, not any case of them being useful.

And doesnt magic always leave trace ? I would have thought that with a job like his, Arthur would be able to find one enchanted item in the middle of mundame ones.

** As far as things like muggle money or the metro system goes, I bet they've got no idea. I mean, foreign currency is tough for a lot of people. And so is figuring out stuff like transportation. I'm imagining someone who's lived in like Nebraska all their life, with no particular interesting in international culture or travel, trying to figure out these things in Korea or India, for example.

But I do like to believe that there are more wizards than let on in canon who know of things like television or music, for example. I don't know, I just find it difficult to believe that muggle borns or muggle born parents would totally forget about modern conveniences like the Internet or joys like music. Maybe they're stuck on record players still but they haven't given it up.

Perhaps many like the Amish, where they know many things about the technologies and culture of the general population (I'm guessing) but don't have much of an interest in engaging with said things.

With that being said, while I like to imagine it's not so isolated, canon does seem to suggest that wizards or more or less totally clueless.

Who would want their children to make friends in the neighbourhood if they knew that those friends would eventually see or hear something they shouldn't, and get their memories altered? Who wants to call in the men in dark coats to Obliviate the six-year-old next door?

You can never invite your nonmagical friends over without hiding half your house away, you have to constantly watch what you say lest a comment about Quidditch or Muggles or flying slips out, you probably can't tell them the truth about your schooling or employment or sports teams, and sooner or later, they're going to notice that your travel times don't add up. And no matter how much you may come to trust them, you /can't ever let the secret out, or you'll land in Azkaban/.

And again this is all if muggleborns simply sided with muggles, itd be even more of a slaughter if any of them decided to fight alongside the muggles.

Edit: also if its hp canon then wizards attacked first, many, many times. during the entire volds war, the death eater were pretty much infamous for doing exactly that.

*********** Bringing up the aresto momentum ward from the beginning. I'm saying you legilimens high level government agents. Diagon alley is in the middle of London so is the ministry, grimauld, st mungos and who knows how many homes. They don't affect technology. I'm more fond of electricity doesn't work at hogwarts because it's not wired from it. I don't remember the exact quote but I'm pretty sure it was specific to hogwarts. Do you think the wizards would all stay in the same place that was attacked over and over again or would they move though? Say you're a soldier. Somebody pops up in the middle of your formation from nowhere. Would that bring you off balance. And that's if something like a ring wasn't enchanted with muggle repelling. Say the intel division of the military. The people whose job it is to have top secret clearance to know where they need to target. It would be impossible to tell if the wizards are good enough that they'd be infiltrated.

************ I'm pretty sure I remrmber the quote you're talking about and while that does reference Hogwarts it specifically states that it's because of the magic interfering. And again many apparitions also knock the apparater off balance as well and if you lose concentration or get cold feet you can end up splinching half your body off. And I'm pretty sure we can tell how good wizards would be at infiltration since we have aurors and death eaters which are apperently the top of the line when It comes to magic use. Tonks could maybe infiltrate for a bit but all it would take is one lapse of concentration or one caught out lie and shed be outed. Moody is defiently not going to be able to do it as are most of the aurors we see as none of then show anything even close to the level of skill it would take to infiltrate a military base and not get caught. Deaths eyer could be skilled enough to not get caught but none of the death eaters in canon have amenough knowledge about muggle workings to actually do anything with that infiltration they would have no idea of how to talk or act to begin with and again one lie or odd phrase from them would give the whole game up. And also yeah the people could leave but the wizarding world is really small, theres only so many homes that can get destroyed before they have nowhere left to go other than just leaving Britain all together

Edit: also important to remember that it's been stated that there are only 3000 people who count as wizarding Britain population, a thousand of which are Hogwarts students, that's 2000 soldiers of every single witch and wizard decided to be a full time soldier.

************* Isn't it said tonks failed her stealth test? Also you are making claims based off of a very limited view on wizards. You say none can do something but we don't see all of them, we see what, less than a dozen aurors? How many of those could kill hundreds maybe thousands? Think about how bad it would be maintaining a supply line when you risk a wizard ripping the information from your head? The wizards to win would engage in guerrilla warfare. Teleport in, wreak havoc, teleport out. Regarding them not knowing enough, is it possible they could learn? You say death eaters can do something but trained professionals couldn't possibly though? Granted I am making the assumption that adults know more magic than children. Also where do you get the apparition being disorienting from? I only remember Harry and others new to apparition being like that, over time you would probably get used to it. What use are numbers if none of the bullets hit? If they can't even get close without the wizard teleporting around. Not to mention if a wizard gets control of high ranking military personnel or the intel division, they could not only know what the plans are but also know where the military would be most vulnerable. Perhaps even make sure they get faulty information. Plus, if the military knows that ANYONE could be a wizard in disguise or their friend could be manipulated into betraying them/killing them, what would that do to morale and trust in each other. I know it's canon that there are 3000 magicals but the infrastructure seems too large for that small a population. Wizards presumably leave longer so even if we say that there are 40 a year, 40*60=2400. With that being a low number, If we say the average wizard lives to be 100, there are 4000 wizards, but we know there are some who live longer like marchbanks, the owl dude tofty who I think examined dumbledore, dumbledore, bagshot. From pottermore, “While I imagined that there would be considerably more than forty students in each year at Hogwarts, I thought that it would be useful to know a proportion of Harry's classmates, and to have names at my fingertips when action was taking place around the school.” How can a population have 3000 people when there are more than 40 students a year?

************** Yeah there has been debate around the pop number because Rowling is really bad at that type of world building lol. And I completely forgot about that tonks bit as well. But yeah while we get a narrow view of the skill level of wizards I would argue that it's actually to the wizards benefit in that case since most of the wizards we see in a action are specifically stated to be extremely skilled, moody is considered a legend, tonks a credit to the force, Dumbledore a global legend and Voldemort one of the most powerful wizards of the time and yet in canon neither of them have shown any ability to deflect any sort attack equivalent to a barrage of missiles. And throughout the series we never see any example of either side showing good use of tactics and strategy, arguably we never see the use of strategy at all. We see a "trap" by Voldemort that relied on harry specifically not only forgetting the mirror but also being cut off from any form of contact , the entire trap ended up outing Voldemort and losing him a number of death eaters with little benefit to his side. We see a "trap" by bellatrix where she specifically relies on harry chasing her and no one being able to stop harry from doing that, which ended up with pretty much nothing happening. And then again we see a plan for draco to let death eaters through the school and kill Dumbledore, which did work but only because Dumbledore also had a plan to let precisely that happen to act an even more complicated plan that relied on harry being metaphorical jesus lol, the tactics on both sides are questionable at best

*************** I definitely see what you're saying but in regards to the actual tactics, Voldemort is a very cartoonish bad guy to me. Complete with overly complicated plans. Having any kind of mark in an easily seen place that is an identifier for who you support is foolish. The good guys had to be saints remember? Because love conquers all!!!!....... but really I agree with a statement I saw a while back feeling rowing wanted a wizarding Jesus in Harry. We don't see a lot of magical disguises but when we do they work. The polyjuice is only revealed by the thieves downfall, which muggles wouldn't have 24/7, if at all, everywhere. I am really enjoying this debate btw. Never had one this long before.

**************** Yeah same honestly, usually these just kinda devolve into insults by this point lol. Yeah honestly I see you're point with alot of this, there is alot a wizarding could do with thier abilities, (I would love to see a war fic with alot of the ideas you mentioned) I just cant see the wizarding society we see in the books doing that at all lol. I believe there was specifically a nod in the first book where the biggest test for a wizard is having the slightest bit of knowledge. I feel that if a gas bomb was dropped in diagon alley, they could put on bubblehead or something equivalent but they'd probably just try to banish it. You do remind me of a pretty good point though with disguises, while I dont think 99 percent of wizards could pull it off, Barty Crouch Jr is actually someone I could see doing it, in fact honeslt know that hes been brought up I would honestly say he would probably be a deciding factor, hes the only wizard we've ever seen employ actual war like tactics, everything from LONG term disguises to subtle psychological manipulation and long term sabatuering to rig major public events and even going so far as to target prominent figures for attacks to both thier body and their public image to damage enemy moral! Hmm, did barty crouch jr just become one of my favorite characters lol? But yeah anyway on to the actual point, the disguise would be really effective but itd be more about who is donning the disguise, if they have more people in the same skill as barty I could defiently see some serious Intel being leaked back to the wizards for quite awhile but if thyere relying on the aurors we've seen I dont think they could pull it off. Honeslty at the end of the day it would probably be dependent on who's in charge and wether the wizarding world could work together.

***************** Oh my god. This is so sad. The ONLY one who showed even bit of skill in tactics and long term planning/disguises was in Azkaban for years before living under the imperious for years. For my sanity I'm going to say there have to be others of crouch's ability. I really want a fic like this now. I want a fic where the winner isn't obvious. Where it's numbers against power type thing. Every one of the fics I've read that have conflict between muggles and wizards are mugglewank or wizardwank though sadly. Maybe have some of what you said regarding plain stupidity/lack of critical thinking on both sides because neither would be used to conflict like this. I feel like magicals and muggles would have to have completely different ideas of war due to magic being a thing as well as a general desire to keep the statute of secrecy. Over time though both sides would get more used to the other side's tactics. Hell the wizarding world could undergo major changes as their misconceptions are brought to light and they have to adapt to these new conditions. A fic that comes to mind is a Star Wars fanficthat i think is called A Destiny Altered in the time of the Yuuzan Vong war where the tactics/technology of the enemy was like nothing they'd seen before, and I mean completely foreign, whereas the yuuzan vong had been observing/infiltrating the republic for 20 years.

****************** I believe we have come to an agreement then lol, that type of fic sounds amazing! Honestly would love to see an entire subgenre of this type just because of the many different outcomes there could be to this. I'm just now remembering that goblins are also a factor in this thing as theres a chance they could start their won war as well. Oh man if I ever find a war fic like that I'm definetly linking it here, feel like that would be a good capstone to all this lol. But anyways I've been talking all night so im absolutely exhausted. It's been really fun though dude, these are the type of things I made a reddit account for. But anyways I wish you good luck on your future reddit convos and a good night as well, seeya dude!
