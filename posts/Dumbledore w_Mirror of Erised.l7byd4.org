I'm writing a fic where the characters are currently discussing the mirror and I thought about how Dumbledore says he sees himself with socks. I always felt that was a lie until just now. What if it wasn't a lie, but an oversimplification? What if Ariana had given him wool socks for his birthday or something right before she was hurt? I suddenly pictured Dumbledore watching himself receiving a pair of socks from her again and his family all around him happy and healthy... Him hugging her...

So yeah, thoughts?


** That seems plausible - Dumbledore is very much a "from a certain point of view"-style of liar.

** The reason Dumbledore gives for seeing socks is that people always give people like him books. I think there's some interesting ideas in there about him being a genuine person, or his desire to be recognized for that.

*** That's the reason he gives, yes, and likely the reason I would give if I were in his shoes too. Except I don't see me complaining about receiving more books for Christmas. But I loved the fluffy socks I got for Christmas last year. I got gloves and ear warmers this year!

** What if Dumbledore saw himself holding a pair of socks because his greatest desire was to see himself desire nothing but a pair of socks, you get me? Like he spent a big part of his life being ambitious and seeking power and perhaps his greatest desire was to be humble.

*** Yes that could work well with his character. The fact that he's corruptible by power and he /knows/ it is the reason I can't read Dumbledore-bashing where his genial disposition is evil disguise instead of an ideal he strives for.

** Even if she hadn't given him socks before, it could be him just longing for a very normal family Christmas. Especially since that scene with the mirror took place right after Christmas.

** Plenty of fanfictions use this idea. Because it's a damn good idea. Nobody's hearts desires are really measured with material gains. Harry wants a family, Ron wants recognition, Albus wants someone who understands him.

And that's me assuming that they only saw what they claimed to see.
