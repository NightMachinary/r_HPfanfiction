I've recently really gotten into RWBY and thought it would be really cool to do a crossover with Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure it's been done before, but I'm thinking of Harry being sent through the veil sometimes post GoF and that how he ends up in Remnant. I think this would be a good way to realistically train him up to face Voldemort. I was also thinking that the dimension travel would destroy his wand but Fawkes' feather survives and he has to forge his own weapon with it that way he isn't too OP right away. I'm also thinking that eventually Dumbledore and the order will find a way to follow him over in order to bring him back to face Voldemort but by that time he isn't sure if he wants to go back. I was thinking of a Harry/Pyrrha paring but the other day I saw someone commenting on a picture of Pyrrha and saying how she looks just like Lily Evens/Potter was described in the books and now I can't get that out of my head... yet I still like that pairing. What do u guys think... any other ideas? Let me know.

** I would totally read any RWBY/HP crossover. In regards to pairing I think that would be a decent pairing.

***** Np. If you are at all into anime I would highly recommend this show. I just finished the current season last night. It is very very good. Each season the animation just gets better and this season was ended on the biggest cliffhanger yet. Season/Volume 4 comes out in the fall.
