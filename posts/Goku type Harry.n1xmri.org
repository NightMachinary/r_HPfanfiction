'cause the tirel can be read in a few way I would like to explain it a bit.

I don't mean Harry that is powerfull and pulls a transformation out of his ass to win. But I concede that could be entertaining.

I mean Harry whose childhood was not traumatic. He is a happy guy that has his shit together but still gets in to a lot of interesting situations.

I know that the goku analogy is not accurate but it's the best I came up with.


** It's not that hard to make him like Goku, actually. Just make him a very competitive kid who relishes the chance to pit himself against difficult adversaries no matter how dangerous it is.

He'd be if anything even more of a Quidditch freak, probably (help) start a more enduring dueling club, and he'd relish every chance to have at it with Voldemort and his cronies.

Goku!Harry would probably be very happy to be entered into the Triwizard Tournament and may permanently torpedo his friendship with Ron, though.

** "Any last words Potter?" Mocked Voldemort. "Just one. KAMEHAMEHA!"
