You know, a Harry Potter that rolls his eyes and blows raspberries at people who upset him, giggles wildly at even mildly funny things, huffs and grumps whenever someone tries to get him to eat his greens, makes cat noises, asks random and socially inappropriate questions, and calls Voldemort 'a big meanie'.

Any entertaining fics which feature this kind of characterization of Harry?


** I understand rolling your eyes and huffing but blowing raspberries after years old is sign of stupidity. On a more serious tone I really hate those fics that describe 11/12/13 years old acting like toddlers.

** I'd recommend 'A Black Comedy' if I wasn't sure most people had read it but, linkffn(3401052) . Most of Nonjon's work characterises harry like this come to think of it.

'Dear Order' has harry pulling many pranks on Grimmauld Place linkffn(3157478) . Its a pretty fun read.

  "I'm still alive, as you may surmise from this note. Of course, I could be dead and someone is faking the letter to fool you..." Harry is NOT happy about being left at Privet Drive all summer with no one to talk to.
