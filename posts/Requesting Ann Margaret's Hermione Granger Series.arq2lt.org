I'm a huge Romione fan, and I've always wanted to read Ann Margaret's Hermione Granger series, in which she rewrites the last three books in Hermione's perspective. Unfortunately, fictionalley, the website where the stories were originally posted, is down, and so I was wondering if anyone had a pdf or any sort of copy of Ann Margaret's Hermione Granger Series, specifically the Half-Blood Prince and the Deathly Hallows, perhaps in a private archive. If so, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share it with me.

Thanks.
