I'm looking for stories where Harry Potter (or any other character, really) builds a magical utopia for any reason. Doesn't even have to really use it or anything, I just want the mechanics of building the city.

I know one is linkffn (Core Threads)

Edit: is that how you summon the bot?


** I read one like that but it was a time travel - Hermione/Tom Riddle. Even though I never read that pairing before, it was well written and I enjoyed the fic! I'll have to look for it.

  A young boy in a dark cupboard is in great pain. An unusual power will allow him to heal himself, help others, and grow strong in a world of magic. Eventual God-like Harry, Unsure of eventual pairings. Alternate Universe, possible universe/dimension traveling in the future.

Harry starts a magical kingdom with the help of the goblins. So far it looks like it will have equality of all magical races.

  Sick of the Dursleys and resolved to missing his few friends if it means getting away from the people of the Wizarding World and their nosy whispers, Harry gets the idea to leave it all behind for a while, just a bit, just for a rest. Like a camping trip, except he'll take enough provisions for a year or so...maybe some plants, seeds and things for a little garden. Maybe some time away from the things that weigh him down will help the constant highs and lows he's been feeling for a while now. Just a little break. (Or, the one where Harry says TTFN and takes himself off on an indefinite vacation and upsets a few very careful plans.)
