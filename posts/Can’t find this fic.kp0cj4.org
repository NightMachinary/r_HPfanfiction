:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry finds out that he was purposely not given/told about this book that's given to muggle-borns and muggle raised children that helps them understand/learn in the wizarding world properly. He borrows it from one of his classmates. I think it was dumbledore bashing but can't be sure.


** I have read many such fics you have to specify something more.
