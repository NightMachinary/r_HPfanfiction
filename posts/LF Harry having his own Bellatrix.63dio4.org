I am searching for a fic where Harry has his own devoted female. It doesn't have to be Dark!Harry.


** "Adorable Violence" qualifies. Sort of.

*** I recently read both chapters and I can't wait for the next one. (which will take a lot of time I guess.)

This is a nice fic for everyone who didn't already read it.

*** I think Ginny shares lots of similarities with Bellatrix: aggressive, devoted, loyal, merciless, powerful, and reasonably intelligent. They would follow their beloved heroes unconditionally and do whatever was necessary to further their causes.

** I think linkffn(12278649) is going in this direction. Daphne is disturbingly similar to what i imagine a young Bella to be like.

Note that this is the sequel of "Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux", the story moves fairly slow and Daphne doesn't play a very important role. She's only been getting a little more screentime in the last few chapters but the story overall is really well done and definitely worth reading.

  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay. A continuation of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux.
