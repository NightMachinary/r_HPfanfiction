I was reading through the Denarian Remegade series by Shezza for the first time and I was impressed by the magic in it, especially the one taught to Harry by Dumbledore in his classes. I am looking for some more fics which have magic similar to the one like what Dumbledore taught Harry

Also, I also loved how Ripples in the Force portrayed how the force worked, so if anyone has read something similar to that, pls recommend fics
