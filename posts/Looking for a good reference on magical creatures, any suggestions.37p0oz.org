Hey HPfanfiction! I'm new here, I've been working on an HP fan fiction piece somewhat revolving around magical creatures and was wondering if there were any good sites or reference books besides Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them out there. Any help would be immensely appreciated, thanks!


** [[http://themonsterblogofmonsters.tumblr.com/]]

Sources that they used to develop these creatures are listed at the bottom of the post, pictures are for visual reference (and awesome and also credited).

The author has a [[http://themonsterblogofmonsters.tumblr.com/use][usage policy]]- basically leave credit, but they also appreciate if you send them a link to how you used it because they like seeing how their stuff is interpreted/used.

There's a /lot/ that's covered there. [[http://themonsterblogofmonsters.tumblr.com/creaturesalphabetic][A-Z list]]

*** This is an interesting source, but I saw a caveat in that usage policy:

1. Canonical creatures are of course allowed by JKR's allowance of fanfiction and no credit need be given other than to JK Rowling. Even if you use information from here that has been added to by my own personal headcanoning, as with this Dementor post, you need only give credit to JKR.

Thanks for the link!

**** Yep, it basically comes down to what creatures you decide to use in the end :)
