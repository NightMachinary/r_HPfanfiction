Hello!! I was hoping I could get help in finding fic recommendations that start at the beginning of James and Lily's first year. Following their story of them growing up and falling in love and having Harry but instead of them dying they live at the end. I also would like the story to focus on James and Lily as the main characters (POV) instead of it being in the background of say a story about Remus or Sirius.
