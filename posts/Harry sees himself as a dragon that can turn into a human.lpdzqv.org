  This story is dead and WILL NOT BE UPDATED. It may be rewritten at some point, but that is a very far off thing. Check my profile.

*** I also remember reading that fic once, it gave off some Smaug vibes at the beginning when Harry was in his cave. I do remember that Harry ended up eating the philosophers stone, which caused some issues he had to deal with. I have no idea what it was called tho. It would be a shame if it was deleted.

** There's an abandoned short story that I think is the one you are looking for called The Dragon and the Sleeping Beauty by insanulux where Harry turns into a dragon, takes over an island that the creatures on it had taken it from the Goblins. Dumbledore had lost Harry years earlier and found where he was at when his Hogwarts letter was created.

  'I'm cold' was the only thing she could think. Only after she met him it changed to 'Mmh, he's so warm'. Humour/Fluff mostly. Icy Daphne, but in a very different way ;)
