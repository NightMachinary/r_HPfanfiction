I was wondering something while reading fanfictions. If I remember correctly, McGonagall is an Animagus thanks to her impressive Transfiguration knowledge and skills (I think they say so in canon IIRC...?). However, in most fanfics, to become an Animagus, you have to... brew a potion and meditate (so Occulmency). Isn't that a bit contradictory? I mean, isn't it supposed to be linked with Transfiguration skills, not potions? Something like doing human transfiguration with a wand on and on until you can do it wandless or something? Because, truly, if you need potions and Occulmency to be one, Snape should be the Animagus of the staff... Does canon give any hint about it?


** There is actually canon info on becoming an animagus, I think maybe on Potternore? It's a several stage process which involves having a mandrake in your mouth for a month and for a spell during an electrical storm? When it goes wrong you can be left permanently half animal like the woman in the hospital in ootp. Something like that. I can't remember where I read it.

*** I do believe it's from /Pottermore/. It's also really stupid. As I posted recently, I have a theory that it's written that way in all the books, but that's a deterrent for idiots, and the cumbersome process is actually code for the /real/ magical technique.

Which I don't imagine to be the "potion + meditation" combo that seems so prevalent in fanfiction, of course, but rather a form of wandless self-Transfiguration that requires a combination of skill at Transfiguration, and the same sort of abilities you need to successfully Apparate.

(Notifying OP since it's of interest to them as well and I don't want to post the same thing twice: [[/u/Eawen_Telemnar]] )

***** Well, it's basically just a bunch of stupidly complicated instructions. It doesn't take any particular talent at magic to do it, just being good at repeating long words and keeping things in your mouth. How is doing all this nonsense "advanced magic" that proves the Marauders were brilliant at magic?

*** I've heard this too, and it honestly hasn't made a ton of sense to me either. It seemed more like a way to make the transformation as complex as possible so as to avoid having animagi become too common.

I've thought that a better explanation would be just to keep it simple -- make it a really, really advanced Transfiguration skill (and JKR makes it clear that Transfiguration is one of the toughest subjects at Hogwarts). The only thing that bugs me about this is that it makes me wonder why Dumbledore isn't an animagus. He was a Transfiguration master, so it seems logical that if Minerva can do it (let alone the Marauders), then he should be able to as well.

Is this ever explained by JKR?

Maybe he just has a really useless or disgusting transformation. Like a cockroach or something. Not something you'd want to advertise.

What's to say he isn't? The animagus transformation is far more useful if nobody knows you can do it (ex: Rita Skeeter, Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew). I imagine that within the animagi community, "registered animagus" is said with an audible sneer on /registered/.

*** Yeah, I remember reading something like that but I didn't know if it was canon or fanon... Then again, for something canon, it is not overly used in fanfics. And I don't really see the link between having mandrake in your mouth for a month and being a Transfiguration master like McGonagall... Seems a bit weird to me...

Thanks for the answer though ^^

** JKR - good writer, horrible world builder. Animagi, ability to transfigure most anything, space expansion charms - basically, she made magicals very powerful/capable with few limits to their power, but in order for her plot to work she had to ignore all that. So, we just get the idea that most magicals are lazy or incompetent.

** From Pottermore Presents: Heroes, Hardships, and Dangerous Hobbies:

For the space of one entire month (from full moon to full moon), a single leaf from a Mandrake must be carried constantly in the mouth. The leaf must not be swallowed or taken out of the mouth at any point. If the leaf is removed from the mouth, the process must be started again.

Remove the leaf at the full moon and place it, steeped in your saliva, in a small crystal phial that receives the pure rays of the moon (if the night is cloudy, you will have to find a new Mandrake leaf and begin the whole process again). To the moon-struck crystal phial, add one of your own hairs, a silver teaspoon of dew collected from a place that neither sunlight nor human feet have touched for a full seven days, and the chrysalis of a Death's-head Hawk Moth. Put this mixture in a quiet, dark place and do not look at it or otherwise disturb it until the next electrical storm.

While waiting for the storm, the following procedure should be followed at sunrise and sundown. The tip of the wand should be placed over the heart and the following incantation spoken: ‘Amato Animo Animato Animagus.'

The wait for a storm may take weeks, months or even years. During this time, the crystal phial should remain completely undisturbed and untouched by sunlight. Contamination by sunlight gives rise to the worst mutations. Resist the temptation to look at your potion until lightning occurs. If you continue to repeat your incantation at sunrise and sunset there will come a time when, with the touch of the wand-tip to the chest, a second heartbeat may be sensed, sometimes more powerful than the first, sometimes less so. Nothing should be changed. The incantation should be uttered without fail at the correct times, never omitting a single occasion.

Immediately upon the appearance of lightning in the sky, proceed directly to the place where your crystal phial is hidden. If you have followed all the preceding steps correctly, you will discover a mouthful of blood-red potion inside it.

It is essential to move, at once, to a large, secure place where your transformation cannot cause alarm or place you in physical danger. Place your wand-tip against your heart, speak the incantation ‘Amato Animo Animato Animagus,' and then drink the potion.

If all has gone correctly, you will feel a fiery pain and an intense double heartbeat. Into your mind will come the shape of the creature into which you are shortly to transform. You must show no fear. It is too late, now, to escape the change you have willed.

The first transformation is usually uncomfortable and frightening. Clothing and items such as glasses or jewellery meld to the skin and become one with fur, scales or spikes. Do not resist and do not panic or the beast mind may gain the ascendancy and you could do something foolish, such as try to escape through a window or charge a wall.

When your transformation is complete you should find yourself physically comfortable. You are strongly advised to pick up your wand at once, and hide it in a place of safekeeping, where you will be able to find it when you regain a human form.

To return to a human form, visualise your human self as clearly as you can. This should be sufficient, but do not panic if the transformation does not occur immediately. With practice, you will be able to slip in and out of your beast form at will, simply by visualising the creature. Advanced Animagi can transform without wands.

Wait what, canonically the wand doesn't transform? Does that mean McGonagall is constantly dropping her wand when she does this? What about Skeeter and her bug animagus?! That constraint makes the transformation much more useless.

Most likely the shock of the first transformation would end up causing the person to drop their wand since the previous paragraph suggests you may loose control of yourself.

** I prefer Vox Corporis' take on the animagus transformation.

In the first stage, which is also the longest and the most difficult, you enter into a meditative state in order to get in touch with nature and in this state, you magically identify 'tokens' (leaves, sticks, grass, hair etc) which you feel a connection to, and collect them.

Once you have sufficient tokens, you prepare a potion using them. Then, on a full moon night, a ritual is performed using the potion and the tokens in order to induce your first transformation.

Most wizards and witches fail in the first stage itself. It is hinted that ignoring your actual tokens or forcing unrelated items as tokens can have bad consequences.
