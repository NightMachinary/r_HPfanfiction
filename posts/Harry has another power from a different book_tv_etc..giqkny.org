Like a harry potter with sharigan. What power is it and give a link please. List as many as you can come up with.


** One of my favorite HP fanfictions is a crossover with The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. Harry is basically brought over a replacement Dragonborn to replace the original and is given access to Dovah'zul and Nirnian magic by the Aedra

  When the True Dragonborn is killed by the Thalmor before uncovering his true nature, Sheogorath comes up with a crazy plan and Akatosh takes some drastic measures. Now, Harry is stuck in a world he knows nothing about, with nothing to his name but a pair of glasses and a black dragon that wants him very dead. What a start...
