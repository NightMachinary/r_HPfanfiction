hello everyone, I'm desperate and want to find a fanfiction at all cost...

It was a Tom/Harry story where tom befriends harry when they're eleven or something like that. In the first chapter they are in a Christmas party with their family (the Potters and the Gaunts!) and later Harry and Tom are at the great lake and Harry saves Tom from the giant squid and discover Harry's powerful magic. After that we learn their parents died because of grindelwald and they grow up together but at the end Tom become kind of crazy after defeating grindelwald and Harry and his friends run away. The last updates are about Tom trying to find Harry because he's become rather possessive with him.

It was not a complete fanfic but maybe it's in hiatus now... Please if you have any hints tell me T-T


** Okay guys I found it ðŸ˜­ It's the fanfic Field Theory (in case one of you was searching for it too) Great story btw!!
