After the war, George wants to expand his store beyond the Wizarding world and into the muggle world. But he needs someone to manage it, now that he's managing the store alone.

He employs Harry for this task.

Non magical pranks, candies with no magic. Just a regular prank/lolli store inspired by Wizarding products.

Sorry if this is a bit bleak.
