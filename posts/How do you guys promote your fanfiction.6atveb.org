** I self-promoted on the subreddit twice - once when I published chapter one, and once recently in a comment because I thought it might be relevant to what the OP was looking for. In general, though, the story sort of picked up attention on its own, and nowadays I'm getting about 60-70 views a day, even when I haven't updated in weeks.

The thing to keep in perspective is that it's not about making your work popular - fanfiction should always be a labour of love, and your main efforts should go into producing something you want, and can be proud of. As the others have said, engaging with the audience by replying to reviews (I don't bother with guest reviews though) and updating with decently-sized (say over 2/2.5k word) chapters without /too/ long a wait between really helps keep your work at the forefront of peoples' attention.

*** Oh I know, I write because it's fun, but I am proud of it and want people to at least SEE it. Whether they like it or not, well, can't please everyone, right? My chapters are almost too long (like 8K words) and I only update every 2-3 weeks bc of school, etc.

I think my next story's chapters will be shorter. 8K seems ridiculous.

** I don't really write a lot in this fandom (or any other) these days, but back when I was writing under different names, the best promotion was always decent writing, consistent updates, and complimenting other writers' stories (without review begging).

** I post on this sub occasionally. I've also made TV Tropes pages for a few of my stories like [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LikeARedHeadedStepchild][Red Headed Stepchild]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/AndTheMeekShallInheritTheGalaxy][The Meek Shall Inherit the Galaxy]]. Putting a few wicks on relevant fanfic tropes on the TV Tropes main site can drive a few readers to you (and I spend too much time on there anyways). You can also look for places where they play review tag if you want to try that, though that never resulted in more readers for me.

** IMHO the most effective way is posting regular updates on FFN. It puts the story at the top of the "Just In" list, and there's always an influx of views. Now if you're being unscrupulous, I suppose you could always split your fic into smaller chapters to maximize the effect, but I imagine the readers won't be very happy about that.

*** There's definitely a lower limit to chapter length. I'm ok with reading a story in 500 words. You can do a lot with 500 words. It's really annoying when there's ten chapters each with 500 words though. To me, that points to undeveloped and unfulfilling scenes.

** Use ao3 and tag properly. If your fic is decent, you'll usually get decent hits. I rarely update things and am not a /great/ writer, and I still get a few kudos a day or so.

I mean, as a reader, I don't read anything with terrible grammar or awful formatting (skip paragraphs with every dialogue start, oh my god!), but that's just basic housekeeping.
