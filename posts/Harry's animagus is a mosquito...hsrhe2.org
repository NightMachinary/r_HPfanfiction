Now, imagine Harry becomes a mosquito animagus. It would seem boring, so small, gets tiring to fly far, etc.. But, think of all of the people who annoy Harry. Poor them, everytime they do something to annoy Harry, they wake up with dozens of mosquito bites the mext morning, or something along those lines.

**** Sounds risky. Also, only female mosquitoes bite/suck blood, so it would require some gender blending for this to work.
