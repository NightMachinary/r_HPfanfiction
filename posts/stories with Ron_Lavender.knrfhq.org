Can anyone recommend me stories that either end up with Ron/Lavender in a relationship or include them together at some point? For example, I don't mind if it starts with Ron/Lavender and ends with Ron/Hermione.


** linkffn(Hermione Granger And The Paradigm Shift) I guess

You'll have to get past the fact everyone (including Ron and Lavender) is a cheerleader for Harry/Hermione, Hermione is highly unlikable (just replace 'Ron' with 'women' and it reads like an incel manifesto) and the ending is pretty poor but there is some genuinely cute Ronvender stuff

  We all know that Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen to make Ron jealous. But what if she didn't? What if she came to her senses in time and invited Harry instead? As friends of course.

*** I didn't feel the same way. As far as I could see, it respected all the canon characterisations very well, that's one of its biggest strengths. Hermione canonically has plenty of annoying traits, you know.

** linkffn(The Other Gryffindor Girl: Lavender Brown)

I wrote this one about Lavender, it includes her relationship with Ron. It is a one shot so quite short but I hope you enjoy it!

  Lavender Brown wakes up after the Battle of Hogwarts in St Mungo's and reflects on her life from her first day at Hogwarts onwards. Find out what went on behind her fluffy exterior and get to know a brave and strong young woman. Canon Compatible. Rated T for one minor incident of swearing and a brief mention of sex.

If you're a hardcore Hermione fan you may feel it's bashing.

  Snape died alone at the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry may have defeated the Dark Lord at Hogwarts, but the piece of Voldemort's soul in his scar remained. Six years later, Harry and Hermione are mysteriously sent back in time after a friend betrayed them. Will they correct their mistakes and defeat Voldemort once and for all? HP/HG.
