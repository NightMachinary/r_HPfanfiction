As in he no longer cares about going to detentions, or following unfair rule. Why should he care? It‘s not like he has caring guardians. Why should he go to Umbridges detentions, why should he go to Snape's Occulmancy lessons if they are clearly not working? Why should he care what the public thinks of him if it's constantly changing? Why should he have to save the school every year? You get what i'm talking about at this point, i'm sure.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

**** LOL. Everytime it gets recommended I read it again, one of the few fics that I've read more than once. It's not perfect, but it's immensely /satisfying/.

***** And it doesn't bash for the sake of bashing, I mean Molly is acting exactly as what you'd expect her to act. I mean they played it up a little too much at times, but characters are suprisingly in character for the most part, if exaggerated in certain ways.

** I had an idea for a story like this.

Like after being effectively imprisoned over the summer after the GOF year he just pretty much says F it and stops listening to anyone.

​

Goes to the Ministry Hearing and tells them he's quitting Hogwarts only to have them suddenly back off. Pretty much gives Sirius and the Order the middle finger by staying with the Dursleys. Doesn't go to classes.

​

It's not like they can really do anything to him. They've already effectively locked in up and he's always damn near death.

  What if, in fifth year, Harry did just that? An independent Harry story with some OOC, no real bashing, but not a big fan of some of the big players. No pairings. Rating for some curse words. First attempt at publishing on this site... we'll see.

** Well, there's always "Indifference and Neglect" by Seel'vor on fanficauthors:

[[https://seelvor.fanficauthors.net/Indifference_and_Neglect/index/]]

It's... not very good. I mean, it's Seel'vor. But it matches your request - except the action takes place at Grimmauld Place and not Hogwarts.
