:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have this very vivid memory of a fic where Harry believes himself to be a Time Lord (Dr Who style) and travels the world doing Doctor-esque things. It is not a crossover, just Harry misinterpreting what he is - I don't think he ever goes to Hogwarts. I'm pretty sure he called himself The Magician.

As a follow-on, I'm also interested in any other fics where HP or another cast member misunderstands their gift or expresses it in a non-canon manner (ideally ones that eschew wandless/godmode power-ups, please).

Thanks!


** As for your second request, there's linkffn(fantastic elves and where to find them), but I find it drags the point on a lot and becomes very tedious by the end.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12899000/1/James-Stormcaller-and-The-Walnut-Court]]

In this one a 9 year old Harry discovers he has some sort of power and starts experimenting. When looking up info in the library he finds nonfiction accounts of shamans, so he figures that's what he is. After some accidental magic a couple months later Vernon abandons him at the Forest of Dean and Harry decides to take the chance to learn more about being a shaman in such a wild area.

The story gets really into world building, expanding on different magical societies and other magic traditions, including: the Fae, druids, shamans, historical accounts of famous magical explorers and a bunch of other stuff. This first installment is all pre-hogwarts, but the story has like 10-15 chapters until it gets there.

The Magician by Five Minutes Til Bedtime

When he was little, Harry Potter's favorite show was Doctor Who. One-shot. Not a crossover.

*** I'm, like, 92% sure it was ffn... and I'm pretty sure the author made a point of mentioning that it was NOT an Xover... but I can't remember if that was because it WAS listed as one and wasn't actually, or because it kind of was and WASN'T listed as one. Not super helpful, I'm sure.
