So it's so happened that I just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] which is an amazing story I think. Thought I will ask you all if you know any similar stories where Harry is immortal and lived several millennia.


** One story, even mentioned in an A/N of A Long journey Home, is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8337871/1/The-Wizard-from-Earth][The Wizard from Earth]]. It is, unfortunately, abandoned. But still very good, IMO.

*** I've begun reading this one. It's pretty good, too bad it is only about the Egypt-ian times. What I liked in the long journey was that we got all the legends that Harry accidentaly was a part of.

***** Spoilers I guess, it's been years since I've read it so my memory is pretty fuzzy.

Not really, Eragon learns the true name of magic and uses that to win. He also finds a big stash of the dragon heart things which were important too. Arya is the last rider, her and Eragon don't get together. Really nothing else of importance happens that I can remember.

****** No wonder people are so upset. That's kind of a cop out. Especially just /finding/ a large stash of dragon hearts, when previously they were so unheard of that it wasn't even funny. I bet he found them in the Vault of Souls too, because that kind of name doesn't make sense otherwise.

*** Yeah it's a great story, but sadly read it right before the Long Journey :) And no I don't mind dark/evil/fucked-up etc. It's hard enough to find a good story with one criteria (and to be completely honest, dark Harry is quite refreshing most of the time)

**** Read a story yesterday with Harry as master of death and he'd be reborn does that work with you? Or is that not technically immortal enough for you?

** What a beautiful story. Simply amazing. One of the better stories I've read. So good, in fact, that I just spent most of my morning at work reading it instead of, well, working.

** I'm beginning to think about writing my own fanfiction from the inspiration I got from Long Journey. It'll be probably pretty similar, we'll see. Sadly I have to study a lot for university before I can begin doing anything mayor, but I'll get there hopefully. Is anyone interested in it at all?
