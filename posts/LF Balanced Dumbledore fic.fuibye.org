Lots of fics have Dumbledore as completely utilitarian or consequentialist, and use 'The Greater Good' concept so much it's like watching someone beat a dead horse. Does anyone know any fics where he's got a more balanced and realistic/canon?


** blue steel by jeconais has him much more balanced, and he and harry are even on good terms
