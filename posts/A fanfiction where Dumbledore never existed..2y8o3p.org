Does anyone know one like this? I've seen people reply to the manipulative Dumbledore arguments with something like

"But what if he didn't exist? What would the world be like then?"

and I'd love to see someones take on that! Thanks.


** Not exactly what you're asking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][The Skitterleap]] is a (very very AU) world where Dumbles lost to Grindlewald in 1945. Its like Wolfenstein but with more Harry.

** Hey,

Not sure if this is what your looking for, but in a fic im writing Dumbledore died in his duel against Grindewald. Tom Riddle is headmaster (He never became a Dark Lord because he saw all of the destruction Grindewald caused).

Heres the link if your interested: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11083975/5/Evelyn-Potter-and-Fates-Hand]]

Be warned though its a WIP so if your the kind of person who (like me) hates incomplete fics don't read it :p
