I'm sure we've all been there, you're lying in bed enjoying what you believe to be a good fic. Good story plot,nice ship (maybe?), has a lot of potential however there's just one thing that sours your feelings with the fic...

The author writes harry like an idiot.

It feels like the same way people feel how shafted ron got in the movies, ron wasn't a moron and yet there was a lot left to be desired in the films. Same goes for harry in a lot of fics.

Now I have no problem with writing a character not canon compliant, I love dark harry and last time I checked he didn't enjoy throwing unforgivables at people who looked at him wrong in school unless I read the wrong books. But at some point I really have to draw the line, yes harry doesn't have much if any knowledge to the wizarding world even in his later school years...but that doesn't mean he has to act like a total moron who can't even follow the conversation. Harry was always a quick learner was he not? So why is it that every fic I read harry is always going "huh?" "What...?" "I don't understand..." and always has this "totally lost face" any time something is explained to him. Or times where other characters just treat him like a child who understands nothing.

Another trope I see is Harry "always" being brash and "gryffindorish" it always seems like people forgot he was almost in slytherin for a reason...that harry could also be observant and calculated when need be. I understand yes at times he was very thick headed and would charge into something head first without thinking but that wasn't his entire character.

How do you guys feel about how harry is written in fanfiction? And have you ever dropped a story because harry or another character acts too dumb or way too out of character for your tastes?


** Been awhile since I read the books but I remember Harry being quite witty and sarcastic. I always think of Harry as being street smart, the more practical sort.

*** Yeah I always felt due to the way he was raised he was more focused on doing things himself, rather than get help or look for much guidance from people other than maybe 2 or 3 people aside from Ron and Hermione, especially after the first book where no one believed him. I felt because of that he was always observant with things around him, he would do his best to read people and the situation. it also made him very quick witted due to dealing with Dudley. I also always loved his sarcastic/dark humor, I wish we had more of it in the films although I think fics by this point have written dark humor for Harry more than the original.

** Though I agree Harry is intelligent, and that fanfics that dumb him down are usually unentertaining, I disagree with you that almost being sorted into Slytherin had anything to do with it.

  Also I always imagined the Sorting Hat detected the presence of that piece of soul when Harry first tried it on. Because it was strongly tempted to put him in Slytherin. So that's how I see it.

Beyond the influence of the horcrux when it comes to the sorting, being in Slytherin isn't necessarily a mark of intelligence. You can be ambitious and an absolute idiot. You can be cunning but fail with a lot of your deceit because of low intelligence.

That's just the movie, not the books, so not really canon. And I don't recall when/if they were accused of holding their wands backwards, but it sounds more like a generic insult than something that literally happened.

And they both ended up being good at the Unforgivables and other Dark Arts.

So yes, Crabbe and Goyle are dumb, but probably not quite as dumb as people tend to think.

*** I recall a fic where it stated that the majority of abused children go into either Slytherin or Hufflepuff, depending on how they've dealt with said abuse. Hufflepuff got the ones that withdrew and avoided conflict, while Slytherin got the ones that tended to be more resentful and defiant and find ways around their abusers. Given what we see of Harry early in PS/SS, he's clearly more the latter.

** I think its mostly just people comparing Harry to movies Hermione, and thinking that of Hermione can be a genius Mary Sue, then if Harry isn't on the same level he must be dumb as bricks, or at least as close as you can get without infringing on Ron's dumbness range.

I'd blame a mix of Mary sue movie hermione, and the fact that Fanfics are 80% power fantasies. The interaction just seems to result in dumb Harry Fanon, either as a way to juxtapose someone's OC, or to show off how much better their smart!Harry is compared to Canon.

****** Hello !

If I had to add something, I'd say : O looks more like a perfect grade than a simple A. In European schools, it'd be like this :

O = 20/20 or higher, maybe (the fabled "so good it can't be noted fairly"). It's a perfect understanding of the subject.\\
EE : >16/20 - you know enough to outclass most of the other classmates.\\
A : > 12/20 - You've been able to pass by. You know enough to not make a mockery of yourself, but you're not good.\\
D : > 8/20 - If you tried, then you're just not good at it.\\
P : > 4/20 - You didn't try, and didn't have natural talent as your friend.\\
T : < 4/20 - You really tried to fail.

In that case, Harry would have managed really high scores in the classes that mattered.

magical learning involves:

phenomenological, ontological, epistemological, and metaphysical understanding and competency.

******* All of that is fanon, right next to wards. Canon magic seems to be much less sophisticated. For example, the patronus, a NEWT level charm which many adult wizards cannot cast even in dementor-free conditions involves merely

1. Remembering a happy memory.
2. Waving your wand in a circle
3. Saying Expecto Patronum

Simpler spells such as bombarda simply moving the wand in a predetermined fashion and saying a certain incantation. Essays and the theory part seem to cover when and how you would use which spell to achieve what you want.

Finally, as I mentioned previously, EE was the perquisite for all of the NEWT level courses. The fact that Crabb and Goyle were still at Hogwarts after OWLS means that achieving an EE couldn't have been that hard.

I feel like a lot of his argument is gasping at straws. For an example, I find it hard to believe that Harry reading a a book which "had superb, moving color illustrations of all the counter-jinxes and hexes it described" and improving at defense is strong evidence that theory is crucial to magic. Likewise, I find his justification for Harry being able to cast Sectumsempra in ignorance of its effects unconvincing. He starts off with the notion that you have a lot of spell-specific theory and somehow arrives at the conclusion that because Harry knows a lot about the dark arts /in general/ he can successfully cast a spell solely based off an incantum scribbled in the margin of a book.

I could go on, but ultimately, this is a tangent that is irrelevant to the original topic. Standards and by extension grades are ultimately relevant to the student population. The expectations at Stanford may be higher than the University of Phoenix, but both institutions share the same letter grading system. The point still stands that

1. The descriptions for O, EE, and A grades are functionally the same as the descriptions for A, B, and C.
2. EE is the minimum grade necessary to enter the upper level classes.
3. Virtually every student managed to get into NEWT classes, meaning that they achieved an EE or better.

** It's because this type of fics are mostly written by nerdy teenagers whose world is split into bookworms and (to quote a classic) "horny simpletons". Growing up with the Harry Potter books I thought so too at first. But JKR being a bit more mature than I was when the original books were released, kind of made it obvious that the three main characters were meant to complement each other and they were smart in different aspects. Of course the obvious one was Hermione because she had a lot of knowledge, then it was Harry who was quick-witted, practical and talented at new spells, then it was Ron who was (most of the times), like his father, a people's person with a wordly knowledge. My headcanon is that the trio is meant to emphasize different aspects of human: Hermione is the wisdom (quite realistic since most people lose their composure in dire situations), Harry is the moral compass (because he is the fool who carries his heart on a sleeve and often makes stupid decisions based on what he think is right) and Ron is the human nature (friendly, pleasant, yet at the same time insecure, jealous, sometimes even vile). All three of them are so good at what they do but most of the younger people who get involved into this fandom only appreciate Hermione's smartness (movies also influenced this).

** I mean, canon Harry doesn't help lol But I understand what you mean, I think the lack of good authors is really suffering and ridiculous, too lazy there to develop a good story. I believe that those fics where Harry is a complete idiot usually want to highlight another character and make it save the day, so idk maybe that's the reason. As I said in another topic the other day, the latest fans are more rational kids than we were at their age, so they tend to write Harry from a different point than canon, more 'academic' or more stupid to shed light about a other character like a female one or a more rational one, or another that they are fan. so I understand your pain, but these types of fics distinct from the canon are an increasingly common reality that we old fans need to get used to...

I don't think I necessarily have a problem with styles of writing changing as newer fans begin writing more and more fics although I may not particularly like the style like you said we will probably need to get use to it.

And yeah by no means was canon harry great...honestly because I've read a lot of (in my opinion) good stories with harry being somewhat canon compliant I feel spoiled now. As fun as the books are when you have an author create such a huge and fun adventure the original feels...boring? Maybe it's because I've read/watched the original so much though lmao.

Maybe because of that I'm more lenient with non canon harry but I do wish we had more...at least realistic harry, a harry who would act like a human and not some...idk tumblr teen going through his green day and MCR phase. It's always painful dealing with either super dumb harry who can't grasp anything or super emo harry and oh it just gets so much worse when Sirius is introduced into the story.
