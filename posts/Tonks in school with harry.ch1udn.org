I just wondered if there were any fics where Tonks was age shifted and in Harry's year and they became involved. Thanks!

  Tonks is posing as a Hogwarts student when someone slips something into Harry's drink. With Death Eaters on the prowl and the Boy Who Lived not only missing, but stoned out of his mind and horny to boot, what's a girl to do?

** linkffn(12188150)

I can't speak to the quality of this, because I started it and only made it a couple chapters, but I don't remember if it's because I didn't like it or just got distracted. In it, during the Dept of Mysteries battle, Tonks gets transported back to the beginning of Harry's fifth year.

Harry/Tonks is one of my favorite pairings, and if memory serves, they're pretty thin on the ground. I can't promise it'll be good, but it fits the brief.

*** Have you read this? How far from canon is it? If it's just a canon rehash but with Tonks along I've got zero interest in reading it, but if there's more there I might give it a go.

**** It's completely different from canon once you get to book 5, but the first few years are similar (not entirely the same though).
