What about Hermione? She's just as mean to Fleur as the other two women, if more so behind her back:

#+begin_quote
  “It's her,” said Ginny, plonking herself down on Harry's bed. “She's driving me mad.”

  “What's she done now?” asked Hermione sympathetically.

  “It's the way she talks to me --- you'd think I was about three!”

  “I know,” said Hermione, dropping her voice. “She's so full of herself.”
#+end_quote

[...]

#+begin_quote
  “Don't you get used to her if she's staying in the same house?” Harry asked.

  “Well, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then . . .”

  “It's pathetic,” said Hermione furiously, striding away from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall.

If you guys want to shit on Molly and Ginny for being mean on Fleur, please include Hermione too. This fandom is suffering from enough double standards.

      Of course she's not, but she behaved like one up to that point.

      Later, when she showed her true mettle in Hogwarts Hospital Wing, all three women changed their behaviors toward her immediately.

      Yes, he does in Chapter 5.

      “And she's more intelligent, she's an Auror!” said Hermione from the corner.

      “Fleur's not stupid, she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament,” said Harry.

      “Not you as well!” said Hermione bitterly.

      “I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ‘ 'Arry,' do you?” asked Ginny scornfully.

      “No,” said Harry, wishing he hadn't spoken, “I was just saying, Phlegm --- I mean, Fleur ---”

      No, Harry enjoyed Ginny's mocking of Fleur:

      #+begin_quote
        "E is always so thoughtful,” purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill's nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the back.

        #+begin_quote
          Harry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince himself that his feelings for Ginny were entirely elder-brotherly. They had lived, had they not, like brother and sister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing Ron, ** and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm?** He had known Ginny for years now... It was natural that he should feel protective... natural that he should want to look out for her... want to rip Dean limb from limb for kissing her... No... he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling...

                  I don't know why this is constantly overlooked. Actually, everyone who aided Umbridge in OotP is overlooked by HBP. That doesn't strike me as realistic at all. Hogwarts should have been a warzone in HBP after the events of the previous year. I certainly wouldn't forget the students and the caretaker supporting the blood supremacist witch if I were a Gryffinder or Muggleborn.

                    A lot of things are overlooked in HBP.

                    Where's occlumency? Where's DA? Why didn't Voldemort attack affect Harry personally? Why did they spent Christmas on the Burrow while it's stated repeatedly on OOTP how unsafe it is?

                    HBP has a lot of potential, but JKR wasted it on useless teenage drama between Hermione and Ron.

                  He used others, too. Like this crazy toenail growing one, which, you know, probably hurts like hell with shoes on.

                  Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince's self-invented spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch)

                    To be fair, those 'unsuspecting' people were assholes. Crabbe was a bully and in the last book he tried to burn multiple people to death. And Filch is a dick to students only because he's jealous of them. Not exactly the most innocent of people.

                You sure about that?

                James was by all accounts a boy supremely comfortable in his popularity, a confident womaniser (even if only with one women) and perfectly comfortable engaging in such serious teasing and pranking that it created enmity that lasted 20 years after his death (Snape is equally to blame of course).

                Harry on the other hand is unsure of his fame, a very unconfident womaniser and hates serious teasing and pranking (as seen by his anger at the treatment of neville and luna). His rivalry with Malfoy was created by Malfoy and escalated only by Malfoy.

                I'm not at all saying Harry is a better person than James as people are much more complex than 'arrogant douche' being a perfect descriptor but Harry is clearly not as arrogant as James and from what we have seen not as much a douche either.

        That's not really mocking Fleur. That's more just a younger siblings raction to their older sibling & partner' PDA and overly romantic displays.

    Why should only Molly and Ginny be called out at all?

    You're right that Hermione definitely deserves to be called out, but there's a slight difference in relation to Fleur that makes Molly and Ginny's behavior a little bit worse -- Fleur was marrying into the family. There's a difference (imo) between "My husband's close family friends is being an utter bitch" and "My soon-to-be MIL and SIL are being utter bitches."

      Except one could easily argue Fleur was being incredibly rude to them in their house. In my opinion, no one was acting appropriate. But I can totally understand why Molly and Ginny were peeved with Fleur, and I can totally understand that Fleur was thrown into an awkward situation having to live with complete strangers and knowing her future in laws preferred some other woman to her (Tonks). It's a bit unclear what exactly Hemione's issue with Fleur was, if it was pure jealousy over Ron's mooning over Fleur or if Fleur specifically did or said something to Hermione that upset her.

          I don't recall the specifics but you are probably right. I think Molly's behavior is most inappropriate since she is an adult. But I also think a lot of anti-Molly and anti-Ginny people use this whole situation as some sort of proof they are awful people who don't deserve the love others show them, while conveniently ignoring the role Fleur herself plays in this animosity. I mean, Ginny and Hermione are teenagers who will be flawed as most teenagers are. Plus they are given good reason (at least Ginny is from what the text says) to dislike Fleur. At the end of the day, it would be great if they were more mature and empathetic but I'm not going to crucify them here.

[[/u/literaltrashgoblin7][u/literaltrashgoblin7]] points 8 hours ago Its been a while since I read it but i dont really remember Fleur's behavior. The only thing i can think of is she criticized certain aspects of hogwarts i think which could make them defensive.

--------------

[[/u/goodlife2310][u/goodlife2310]] points 8 hours ago I am not sure exactly what she said to upset Molly, but I recall her having critiques of the food and overall crampness of the home. With Ginny she frequently made belittling comments about being a little kid. The thing people fail to understand is these are two areas that hit at extremely sensitive spots for Molly and Ginny, respectively. For Molly, her cooking and her home are her main sources of pride (aside from her family, of course). So much of Molly's identity is in keeping a welcoming home and delicious food for everyone. So for some stranger to come in and insult those very things is going to sting extra hard. For Ginny, she desperately wants to be seen as an adult or mature and not a weak little girl in need of protecting. Of course Fleur treating her as such is going to upset her.

--------------

[[/u/literaltrashgoblin3][u/literaltrashgoblin3]] points 8 hours ago Ohhh ok makes sense. I do think that sometimes people are very harsh with Molly and Ginny. But I think this is a response to the narrative at times being too kind to them especially to Molly so I do appreciate Molly critical material. Not bashing though I think bashing goes too overboard and doesnt explore the flaws as well.

--------------

[[/u/goodlife239][u/goodlife239]] points 8 hours ago I think it would be a very interesting discussion about whether Rowling intended certain flaws we seen in Molly and others to be seen as such. Clearly she wanted us to love Molly Weasley (and we do!) but there were some serious flaws in her personality and behavior. Yet the way the narrative presents it, clearly Harry didn't recognize it. Cho Chang is a good example of the opposite. As the reader, seeing this story through Harry's eyes, I thought Co was the worst, a weepy mess. Now, as an adult, I actually think Harry was the worst of the two in their interactions. But was that always Rowling's intent? Did she actually view Cho more sympathetically, or did she legitimately want us to see crying Cho as bad and tough Ginny as good? I'd hope the answer is somewhere in the middle, that Cho was not wrong to cry but just not the right person for Harry. But I'm not entirely convinced that's what she was going for...

--------------

[[/u/literaltrashgoblin1][u/literaltrashgoblin1]] points 5 hours ago Its really hard to say for sure. Molly for example in the argument she has with Sirius she was I think very cruel to use the fact he was in Azkaban against him. But while she looses the fight ( Harry Ron Hermione and the twins all get to stay like Sirius wanted and Arthur and Lupin both take Sirius's side in the argument) not long after you have the Boggart incident.

This explains her behavior and so her attutude and what she wanted to do is sympathetic and forgivable even if you dont like her logic. Therefore shes never held accountable by the narrative for lashing out like she did. So I do think Rowling wants you to see she has flaws but maybe wants you to accept them and find them sympathetic and not ever have a flaw that she needs to work on.

Which can rub people the wrong way when others who have flaws of roughly equal consequence are held responsible and framed in negative light with out the narrative trying its best to make you forgive them and accept it or insist its something they need to work on and change. Plus character arcs and development are good and Rowling is good at putting it in for background characters.

Like for example Seamus, or Lupin or Neville hell even Draco. So it kinda feels like we missed out on seeing interesting ones from some like Molly.

[[/u/Emerald-Guardian13][u/Emerald-Guardian13]] points 10 hours ago I was going to comment on the same thing. Why is the fact that she may or may not have chosen to have sex with Roger Davies make her insufferable? Seems just like more examples of society's propensity for shaming women for being sexually active. If the problem is the fact that they did it in public (aka a bush)... well ok I guess I could maybe see that but if the problem is the fact that she had sex at all... well I disagree with that reflecting negatively in her.

--------------

[[/u/sandalwood-5][u/sandalwood-5]] points 10 hours ago I wasn't slut shaming Fleur for possibly having sex with Roger Davies, only making the remark that Rowling seems to use it to indicate that she is a bad person/character. Like the comment above said, she later does the same thing in regard to Lavender.

That said, the history behind Hermione/Ron seems to be more autobiographical for JK. It's possible Lavender is based on someone she hated.

[[/u/Emerald-Guardian8][u/Emerald-Guardian8]] points 10 hours ago Fair enough and it's true what you say about how Rowling used it. I could very well see the Lavendar situation based off a personal experience of hers.

She has tons of problems though like you said, most people just ignore them.

--------------

[[/u/sandalwood-6][u/sandalwood-6]] points 9 hours ago Yeeeep. She is a wonderful example of Jo's like surface level feminism.

[[/u/zzledri7][u/zzledri7]] points 8 hours ago upvoted for the MLA referencing

--------------

[[/u/IrishKookaburra0][u/IrishKookaburra0]] points 7 hours ago What about Hermione? She's just as mean to Fleur as the other two women, if more so behind her back:

I don't agree with this to be honest you're essentially using whataboutism to state well yeah Molly and Ginny is bad but look at Hermione.

“It's her,” said Ginny, plonking herself down on Harry's bed. “She's driving me mad.”

“What's she done now?” asked Hermione sympathetically.

“It's the way she talks to me --- you'd think I was about three!”

“I know,” said Hermione, dropping her voice. “She's so full of herself.”

This is not even close to how Molly and Ginny has treated Fleur. Stating someone is arrogant is not comparable to Ginny insulting Fleur's accent and her making a demeaning slur out of it (Phlegm) or in Molly's case, conspiring to have your son get with a family friend who is crushing on something else. With Ginny's case it can be excused as her at least being a teenager thus immature however with Molly it can not. She's supposed to be the authority figure and she's setting a bad example. The only time even she shuts Ginny down about her behaviour is once and it's kind of pitiful, you can't question the validity of Bill and Fleur's relationship by stating she's the opposite of Bill who is hard working and down to earth, suggesting Fleur isn't any of those things and then in the same breath tell Ginny to calling her a cow. She's co-signing that behaviour by even entertaining that conservation about Fleur and Bill's relationship. Molly should have shut that conservation from the get-go particularly as she's the adult. So I think if anything Molly should be the most criticised out of the trio.

[...]

“Don't you get used to her if she's staying in the same house?” Harry asked.

“Well, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then . . .”

“It's pathetic,” said Hermione furiously, striding away from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall.

Again, how is this even a case of Hermione being mean to Fleur? Her anger is with Ron which is why she makes a point to stride away from him. She's clearly angry at Ron's shobby attempt at excusing him drooling over Fleur. The worst thing you could say she said about Fleur is that Tonks is more intelligent than Fleur but that was in response to Ron saying Tonks was ‘okay-looking' and unlike Ginny she didn't proceed to call Fleur a cow even though she could have and no one would have faulted her for it.

Excerpt From: J.K. Rowling. “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Enhanced Edition).” Pottermore, 2015. iBooks. [[https://books.apple.com/us/book/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-enhanced-edition/id1037196935]]

If you guys want to shit on Molly and Ginny for being mean to Fleur, please include Hermione too. This fandom is suffering from enough double standards.

There are a lot of things to shit on Hermione on, her awful treatment of Marietta, her hexing Ron for simply coming in the room she was in with Harry, etc but not this. For me Ginny and particularly Molly should have been criticised more especially considering that there was their sister in law/ mother in law respectively and they couldn't have a heart to heart with her about her being too full of herself.

--------------

[[/u/literaltrashgoblin24][u/literaltrashgoblin24]] points 9 hours ago To be fair to the fandom the narrative for both the books and movies makes it feel that way.

In the movies alot of Hermione's flaws are removed plus she gets Ron's positive traits.

In the books while sometimes she does dickish things its either hand waved cuz ends justify the means and she was right or hand waved because shes acting a certain way for a reason and the narrative wants you to sympathize with said reason.

Like Ron and Hermione both lash out with each other out of jealousy. But in book 4 when Ron does it his dickishness is highlighted. While in book 6 I think when Hermione does it Hermione's feelings are highlighted instead of her actions like it was with Ron.

So even though I wish her flaws were explored more because that would be more interesting its not suprising that it isnt.

But Hermione isnt really the only one.

Ginny has dickish moments that are never really made into a big deal by the narrative

And Mrs. Weasely has huge dickish moments which also have no consequences or treated as a big deal by the narrative

Like believing the gossip collumn and being cold to Hermione

Destroying Fred and George's creations because they were going against what she wanted them to be

Rubbing Sirius's face in the fact that he was forced to be in Azkaban and couldnt help Harry.

And being casual about using love potions and acting like they are no big deal even though they are essentially date rape drugs and the reason Voldemort exists. I mean the narrative kinda handwaves how fucked up they are anyway but still.

--------------

[[/u/PSLs_and_puffy_vests2][u/PSLs_and_puffy_vests2]] points 6 hours ago Can't. Stand. Molly. Or James and Sirius, to be honest. Severus, Filch, and Draco are judged v harshly for their attitudes toward people despite those attitudes being heavily influenced by environment and upbringing. Yet Molly, Ron, James, and Sirius were all “of the Light” and were still jerks. I'll take Percy's pomposity over their attitudes.

--------------

[[/u/literaltrashgoblin3][u/literaltrashgoblin3]] points 4 hours ago It can be really frustrating when the narrative is harsh with certain characters and very lenient with others when it comes to either framing or consequence or both. Sometimes the fandom tries to compensate by being more critical ( sometimes they go overboard but not always) but when the fandom doesn't point out or explore flaws that canon neglected too it can feel even more frustrating.

In my experience Molly and Hermione's flaws arent really explored. Ive seen bashing fics but those don't usually explore flaws they kinda shits on the character and often exaggerates the negative traits too much or adds in new ones so it doesnt feel like you highlight the flaws at all really.

Often times its not even chatacters I hate its actually characters I like which makes it awkward not that its bad people hate and are critical of characters but that many people who like them arent. I feel like people dont really want to call out their favs all the time which is valid but the characterization to me feels better when they do so I wish people did it more especially if they write fic and the canon doesnt.

And he did nothing to mitigate the situation.

I call that a bad fiancee.

#+end_quote

Why do you think that's unreasonable? It's worked well in the past on this sub.

There have been numerous cases where people on this sub disagreed with common plot elements that get brought up in request threads, so they made a discussion thread that turned into a lively back-and-forth conversation. Just as an example, I remember a great discussion post about double standards relating to Hermione. Another discussion post was all about what disgusts people about mpreg. Sometimes people make discussion posts about what's wrong with manipulative!Dumbledore or politician Slytherin kids.

This is why it's strange to complain that the existing system is unreasonable. It works very well (and the whole sub benefits from the lively participation) when people follow it.

Regarding disagreements/questions being too small for a separate post, that point also falls a little flat in the face of the examples we have to look at. Clearly the discussion in the Fluer request post was large enough with enough community interest that it could have been its own post. The anti-mpreg discussion post started on a disagreement as simple/small as "I think mpreg is gross".

The point is, any question or disagreement can be worthy of its own discussion post if you put the effort into expressing your thoughts clearly and persuasively. There's no need to derail someone's request post when you could reach the broader sub of the community with your own post.
