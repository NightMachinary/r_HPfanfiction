*** Well in POA, immediately after Marge starts inflating, Harry "tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him". While I would expect people to move to the living room for after-dinner drinks, there's no mention of it and Dudley is still eating dessert so one assumes that they're all still at the table. Given how the entire scene is written, it's safe to say that dinner was being eaten in the dining room rather than the kitchen or living room, so yes, they most probably do have a dining room table.

(And really, what's the point of a dining room without a table at which to dine?)

*ETA:* And in CoS:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Presumably on account of electronics not working at Hogwarts. I hadn't considered the Diagon Alley proximity issue and the watch. The latter is probably an oversight on JKR's part, but one could theorise that it's magical concentration, rather than proximity, that causes problems with electrics, and that the amount of electrical components in a device affect whether it'll be destroyed by magic.

Thus, a place like Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, with thousands of wizards moving through it over a thousand years, has a high build up of magical energy that causes anything more powerful than a watch battery to malfunction. Also think that Hogwarts is a place of learning where spells are being constantly taught and tried and experimented, whereas Diagon Alley is a shopping street where people aren't going to be performing magic quite so regularly, and is going to be mostly empty at night, which is why the Muggle shops nearby can survive. (Though, perhaps, they have unexplained power cuts rather more often than they should.)

******* Think about how your average eleven year old uses electronics. If they're Ravenclaw material they might bring an extra set of batteries, otherwise they'll just use the pair that's in the Walkman they brought with them. So, it's not surprising that they don't work at Hogwarts after too long, they've run out of power. By the time they get home they're thinking more about returning to school where they can do magic rather than getting more batteries for their cassette player that they're written off as "broken" since it didn't work after the first few nights of using it. Plus the first portable electronics likely used carbon-zinc "heavy duty" batteries, or even worse ones, rather than modern alkaline or lithium ones, again meaning that they'll not last as long. Add in the aforementioned random warps of reality thanks to untrained witches and wizards flinging half-formed spells around, and you've got an environment where electronics don't work.

Kids sure as shit didn't have cell phones, computers were towers on a desk with slow ass internet connections, only business men had any use for laptops.

So here's harry, who until recently has been poor and his only liquid assets is in a currency that doesn't spend on electronics. Of course he doesn't have or care about games or shit like that.

Having produced evidence of developing this idea in her diaries, and having filed this patent to the Ministry of Magic's Department of Patents in 1953 - some twelve years before any evidence of independent development or application on your part of her idea can be unearthed - Arabella Figg is, by this esteemed council, found to be that creator, and fully justified in her accusation of infringement on your part."

And that's how magical Britain was saved by both a squib and a (patent) troll in the same day.

In my headcannon, over 90% of magical patents are held by muggleborns or squibs living in the muggle world. If you've ever wondered why the wizards don't have some widespread use of whatever spell to do X, it's because the manufacturing power rests on the hands of the purebloods. The same people in those annoying government positions who do all they can to keep the "lower caste" from ever building factories or licensing some new product. The purebloods wouldn't benefit directly from allowing them these things, and would never dream of splitting their profits with the likes of Anthony Goldstein (6 patents, 1 before the end of his first year), or Figg (61 patents since 1950, when she was rejected by Hogwarts), or Evens (19 patents filed before her untimely death), or Granger (172 patents submitted before the conclusion of the second wizarding war, several still under review).

I feel like that's a misleading statement. Rowling never used the word in the books, but its not like HP fans came up with the concept of magical wards out of nowhere. The idea already existed, the word had a meaning, and the anti-apparition jinxes applied to an area do fit that meaning.

Now, if you wake up as a character in the HP verse, this is not to say that anyone will have any idea what you mean if you say you want to learn warding. But if you explain yourself, they'll know what you mean... and then condescendingly lump you in with Arthur Weasley and his love of eckeltricity.

One of my unpublished drabbles features purebloods being locked away in their own bubble, unable to import or export anything. They were using stasis and engorgement charms for food, but they had to take off the stasis charms to engorge food and remove it for eating. After a decade or so they started to starve to death -- the food they still had was rotting.

If yes you are fine for millennia. Otherwise it depends on your knowledge.

You can for instance vanish all the water (or most of it) from the food. You will be stuck with a greasy powder but you are in no danger of spoiling. Just a quick aguamenti and you're set.

Or maybe some sterilization charms , or just re-cook the things. Disgusting food is better than starvation.

No you're not. You duplicate food. The original and the duplicated stuff is slightly less fresh than it was. You put half back in the stasis charm. Each time, you get slightly more rotten food.

I highly doubt there's anything like a university in the wizarding world , my hypothesys is that there are apprenticeships , like becoming potion master you need to have a potion master taking you as an apprentice and after several years you will become a master too.

I would not be surprised if such a society made it illegal for wizards to attend normal muggle university.

Can you immagine a dark lord with a deep understanding of physics? Or Biology? Or chemistry? Or any kind of easily exploitable knowledge?

It's probably more subtle than a spell that makes people forget /specific/ dangerous things. There's no telling what somebody might come up with in the future. If I were an unspeakable designing a safetynet, I'd make it so that people affected simply couldn't formulate thoughts combining muggle ideas and anything magic. Then, the obvious place to put such an enchantment is the brick passage between Diagon Alley and the Leaky Cauldron, which every muggleborn or muggleraised is going to trot through. That's why nobody uses pens or pencils at Hogwarts, but we see Harry use them at his relatives' house. Hogwarts is magical, incompatible with technobabble, so quills and ink are go, in lieu of something less fantastical.

Also such methodology allows the removal of the enchantment for particularly moral and gifted people.

The thing is that i doubt it can be put on a place , yes obviously 99.99% of wizards use diagon alley and such but the offshot probability that someone doesn't is a valid concern , we are talking about assured extinction level threat so redundant security is a must.

A group of Eastern European and German wizards trying to get to the West (not as simple as apparating - how can one apparate to somewhere one has never been or seen? Plus some Dark wizards who would prefer people trapped behind the Wall) is the catalyst for a big story involving muggle expelees from Hogwarts, the murders of the police officers from the untitled 2008 prequel story, children in Cokeworth interacting with their magical-powered friends, the rise of the Death Eaters and a Dark Magic underworld in New England which grows beyond the control of the rest of the Pureblood community. Also espionage, muggle music (cultural interactions in wizarding schools, think Sirius wearing a Beatles shirt) and lots of period era focus. Sort of a magical world infusion of John le Carre, Raymond Chandler, the plays of Dennis Potter, the films of Martin Scorsese (particularly /The Departed/) and the influence of Pink Floyd's music though not gratuitously. The working title was 'The Mugs' but I considered renaming it to 'The Wizarding Wall' in reference to both Pink Floyd and the psychological presence of the Berlin Wall during the Cold War and its wizarding analogues.

  Who thought any of the candy described in the books is something someone would want to put in their mouths, aside from liquorice wands?
#+end_quote

The sugar quills sounded just fine. But, then, I'm the sort of person who can munch on a sugar cube and be perfectly happy.

The chocolate frogs sound annoying but otherwise fine (they're just shaped like frogs, not flavoured, and presumably they'd stop wriggling after the charm wears off).

Cauldron Cakes are probably fine, too; I don't recall that we got much info on 'em, but I picture 'em something like those little Hostess cupcakes or [[http://www.tastykake.com/][TastyKakes]].

Drooble's Best-Blowing Gum sounds like bubble gum. If you're into that sort of thing, it's probably just fine.

And Honeydukes also just makes chocolates. Chocolates are generally good. :)

** The “unimportant” bit shoots most of my inquiries in the eye.

Maybe I'd investigate who Harry's others summer neighbours are, bar the squib cat lady and Dudley's playmates.

I'd try to find out exactly how many magic-users there are in the world, which portion of them identify themselves with various wizarding communities (e.g. British, French, etc), and how many of them try to blend in with the muggles instead because they see the benefits of their civilization (including social ones) far outweighing what the wizarding world has to offer (yes, even with magic).

I'd be much more excited to explore the laws of magic, to be fair, which hardly classifies as “trivia”. For instance, I'd like to know what spells the non-Indo-European language (e.g. Caucasian languages, Japanese/Chinese/etc, Quipu, etc) hosts use. If they are not in the same Pidgin Latin that Magical Britain uses, which I suspect to be the case, then that would likely mean that the incantations and wand-gestures are an artificial construct, and so, theoretically, it would be possible to create a complete replica of Avada Kedavra that would get activated when going through the motions of something like the traditional Lumos spell.

There are much more questions like this, but they are either in the “important” group or not in the “trivia“.

p.s. I'd also try to find out what went wrong with this alternate timeline that made Hagrid be late to my (Harry's) 11th birthday. : )

**** Shit, thank you for posting this. This changes so many things in the /many stories I have planned but will never write/.

The United Kingdom appears to be united in the wizarding world, which works with the 1700' map, but Bulgaria is also independent, which doesn't fit at all. Germany? They had a team in the Quidditch game, but that doesn't account for much. But if it exists, how did this come to be? Personal headcanon is that Grindelwald united it, and such came into power. This, of course, means that Grindelwald is the wizarding Otto von Hitler, as far as I'm concerned. Fun stuff! I wish J.K gave us more backstory :(

Coming back to Hogwarts, I dunno, but you wouldn't get into a Muggle uni unless you've sat your GCSEs and A-Levels (or equivalents). And A-Level's are NEWT equivalents, so you'd have to have studied ahead, unless of course you mean they study the Muggle stuff post-OWLs. But that would mean studying for your pre-uni qualifications and I don't know how long it would take to get the minimum requirements, but lets be generous and say a year of hard study, then another 3 at uni for the degree. You're going to be 20 by that point; would you /want/ to go back to Hogwarts to study NEWT classes with 16-18 yr olds?
