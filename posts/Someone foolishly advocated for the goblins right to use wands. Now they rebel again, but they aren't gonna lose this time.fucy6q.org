** And so it came to pass that goblins would overthrow magical humans. The preservation of a warrior caste over generations turned from a tradition into a weapon, and the uncovered secrets of wandlore cancelled out the only advantage the humans had.\\
Around the world, magical human governments were toppled, with goblin courts taking their place. Moderate goblins and humans who would form a government of all magical beings were driven out; in their place, radical goblin supremacists enslaved old blood and first-generation magical humans alike, seizing their wealth and tearing down their monuments.

The dust settled. The Statute of Secrecy remained, now a smokescreen to allow tyrannical goblins, glamoured as humans, to snatch and prey on muggles as they pleased.\\

And so we come to today. Sneering pureblood houses wearing a mask of humanity over their goblin nature, keeping house-elves as slaves (the descendants of the original enslaved humans). Muggleborn humans blissfully unaware of the true nature of the purebloods. A lower caste of disarmed dissidents running a bank, as though that matters to wand-wielders who can conjure anything...

**** Gives another reason for the Malfoys to sneer at the Weasleys. The Weasleys are just the descendants of muggleborns, they don't have the /real/ pure blood.
