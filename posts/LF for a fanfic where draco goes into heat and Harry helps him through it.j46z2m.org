So it's a fanfic where draco goes into heat a without his parents knowledge due to a lie about his birth date, Harry helps him through it and makes him a unicorn hair jacket or something. Any help?

Raspberry Jam by vvc - it's one of my absolute favorites as is another one by this author called Desperate Measures which is Draco/Harry too and Harry is a veela.

Going to reread both this weekend now!

  Draco tries not to think of his upcoming transition and the unwanted partner chosen for him by his father. Then he finds he may have a choice after all. Will the faith he puts into his choice be rewarded? HPDM A slow, soft romance.
