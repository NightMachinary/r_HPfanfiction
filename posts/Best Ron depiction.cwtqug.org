Alot of the time I see Ron in fics he is sidelined or its more of the movie characterization ( where hes kinda jealous and dumb and kinda a dick and mostly useless, third wheel to Harry Hermione) as opposed to book Ron( loyal to a fault, grounded chill most of the time, protective, witty, Harrys bff for life Hermione actually third wheels more) .

So im looking for a story where book Ron is a major character preferably the main one. I prefer one where he gets more focus than Hermione since its usually the other way around. Ships can be whatever but no OC ships or Marauder gen / Harrys gen ships. And no genderbending.

Apart from that slash het fem slash its all good can be more friendship focused too.

Long fic please doesn"t have to be complete.


** One complete good Ron-centric fix I'm surprised to not see here already is Stay Standing

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7523798/1/Stay-Standing]]

It's about a Ron who is sick but is stubborn in hiding it from those he loves. Really good and I love Ron's characterization in this.

** So this is a little offbeat, but linkao3(Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce) is a great fic where Ron's character shines through and he gets to step out of the trio and expand his horizons. It doesn't make any of the trio seem ooc or mean either to make the point. Gordon Ramsey is of course a bonus.

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

** There aren't a lot of Ron Centric stories.

He's used as comedy relief or a traitor simply because he's so well placed for those parts if the writer wants to use him that way. I mean, face it, making Draco the bad guy is a bit redundant, and trying to make Neville into a bad guy takes a whole lot of work, I've only seen it done well once, in JBern's To Fight the Coming Darkness. (To be clear, Nev wasn't THE bad guy of the story, he just became one through circumstances and grief.

I've used Ron as a non-idiot, not comedy relief lead character twice.

The first was a 'Marriage Law' one-shot I did, mostly because I hadn't done one. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4070610/79/Thrilling-Tales-of-the-Downright-Unusual]]

The other is Speed, where we hear about Ron gaining access to the Speed Force when visiting the cousin the Weasleys don't talk about who turned out to be Wally West's father, from his own words after he's being debriefed by a version of the Justice League after basically saving the world.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** So this isn't done and hasn't been updated in years but it's one of the ones where it's mostly Ron center and it's a great read if you don't mind reading something that might never be finished. Flames of Betrayal

**** lol ron lovers get so hopping mad over making fun of Ronnekins, they have to respond to 6 month old threads.

FYI: Mollywobbles was probably weeping for months/weeks-on-end when she figured out Ron was another dumb boy. In a world of wonder and magic I'm sure being so unwanted had to leave some kind of effect on his character.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
