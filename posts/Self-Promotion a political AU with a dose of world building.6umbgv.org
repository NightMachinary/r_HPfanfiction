I'm looking for some constructive criticism on my latest fic, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn). Thanks, and happy reading!

*** Yeah, I was thinking about that... thing is, this is a planned 7-volume fic, and I'm worried about it being too long/intimidating for readers

** I like it a lot. My favorite chapters were the 1st and the 3rd, but so far it's good!

Also, you said in Ch1 that "the headmistress demanded", but I assume you meant "deputy headmistress"?

No critiques for now, but I hope you don't follow the stations of canon too closely. You've set yourself up for some /big/ deviations right from the get go.

Also I'd be careful for how deep the political 11 year old stuff will go. Daphne and Hermione's dialogue was pretty nice and funny, but I'd recommend staying away from the "11 year old slytherins control the future of the wizarding world" trope (which can happen if you're not careful). Politics is awesome. 11 year old politics is cool. But 11-year-old politics being treated as the be-all-end-all of society (I'm looking at you Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches) is a bit over the top.

*** Ah, yes, the political 11-year olds...Harry isn't even going to be aware of politics until fourth year. There's one person in Harry's year who is skilled in politics (not you, Draco. Sit down.) but they have a /very/ good reason to be.

Anyway, thanks for the feedback!

** I reallly like the premise. Some of the more annoying things are that when you switch locations, you don't provide a heading like you do at the beginning of the chapter.

I'd love to see reactions from the Weasleys about Ron's sorting other than the twins, also some reaction from the world at-large about Harry's.

Anyways, really looking forward to the next chapter.

*** Thanks!

I wasn't sure if it would be too annoying to have location tags with every location switch, but I can definitely add them in!

** I've liked this a lot. I hope you expound upon the political structure of the wizarding works. Maybe if you get deep enough in to can make a wizard UN? Something to think about

** I know the Weasleys are said to be comparatively poor - and it is only in comparison with rather wealthy wizarding families; they are presented in canon as the wizarding equivalent of impoverished gentry but hardly the Great Unwashed. I don't recall any implication that there wasn't enough food to go round and I feel rather indignant on Molly's behalf. Also, is Ron really working in a restaurant in the evenings at the age of nine? How does he get there and back?

*** My story is very AU...there was a key event that happened when Ron was about seven (it's been hinted at, but not revealed) that drastically changed the family's fortune, leading Ron to work in the restaurant. In terms of transportation, he Floos there and back.

** Also minor plothole:

Why does gringotts need keys if blood tests are just as quick, and much more secure?

Adding a quick throwaway line of "for a fee" would fix that.
