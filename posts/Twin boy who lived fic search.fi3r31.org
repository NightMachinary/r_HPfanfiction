:END:
Looking for a fic where harrys twin is proclaimed the bwl, James lives lily doesn't. Think the twins name might be callum? Harry gets sorted into slytherin and because of how he was raised thinks his twin is more important so works to make him look better and protect him. Part of a massive series and includes potter manor which has a maze in it or something also snape is mentorish in this one I think could be wrong though tia :)


** Nevermind found it now yay It was saving Connor by lightning on the wave on ff.net
