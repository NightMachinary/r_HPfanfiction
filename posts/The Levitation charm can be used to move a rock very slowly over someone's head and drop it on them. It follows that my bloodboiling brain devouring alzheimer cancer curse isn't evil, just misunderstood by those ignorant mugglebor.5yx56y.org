It didn't annoy me the first five or six times I saw it but it's really starting to get on my nerves when enlightened Harry bequeathes his enhanced understanding to us unimportant folk.

*** Not necessarily, let's take the three Unforgivables as example:

AK could be used in assisted suicide to put long suffering people out of their misery, kind like how Dumbledore asked Snape to kill him.

Imperius was merely mind control, and could actually be used for very good purposes, such as ordering would-be suicide bombers, mass shooters, and other criminals to break up their deeds.

Cruciatus was more iffy. But it still required the right emotion to hurt people. I could imagine different emotions would lead to different effects, such as shield-piercing stunner or nerve stimulator. Moody once said in Book 4, that without the right emotion, even AK would cause nosebleed at worst.

**** Forgive me if my fanon is bleeding through, but it's not just "the right emotion".

Unforgivables require absolute desire of the intended effect for the intended effect to work. For the Killing Curse, you have to want them dead very badly. Usually this means hating them to the point of murder, but I'm sure there are exceptional sociopaths out there who can make it work. So in that case, while it was a mercy killing, a part of Snape must have been very eager to give Dumbledore the axe.

For Imperius, there is nothing "mere" about absolute mind control. This curse has made family members slaughter each other with smiles on their faces. You have to want to dominate the opposing party. Not just control, but /dominate/. While there would be a lot of people with the required attitude who could use it for good, that kind of corrupted thinking would turn bad very quickly in a very large number of users.

For the Cruciatius, Faux-Moody had only one thing to say on it when he taught the class.

#+begin_quote
  "Pain," said Moody softly. "You don't need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse..."
#+end_quote

So, pain. Not stimulating nerve endings. Just pain. This is the curse where you say "I'm going to /hurt/ you now" and then follow through. Coincidentally it's something I wish I knew how to perform whenever some uppity little shit kills me ten times in a row when I'm trying to blow up a tank ^{^{^{mumble}}} ^{^{^{grumble}}} ^{^{^{mumble}}} but I digress.

The Unforgivables aren't unforgivable because they require strong emotions, they are unforgivable because they require /the strongest/ emotions. Cold blooded murder. Absolute domination. And pure, undiluted pain.

As for Moody's quote:

#+begin_quote
  "Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it - you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed."
#+end_quote

You can interpret it that way, that a weak Killing Curse would only cause a nosebleed, but I disagree. Moody said "But I doubt I'd get so much as". There is no such thing as a weak Killing Curse. In this case, Yoda's words ring true; You either do or you don't cast the Killing Curse. Which means you either want them dead, or you are unsure. If you are unsure, you cannot cast the Killing Curse.

You might be right, though. Off the top of my head, Harry failed a Cruciatus against Bellatrix, but it still hit her. It only knocked her down, if I remember correctly. But that's the only example of a failed Unforgivable I know of, so in this case I'm going to claim small sample size.

***** I call bullshit on the Imperius needing someone who wants to dominate. Harry cast it on the first try, barely understanding what was going on other than that he was desperate enough for the goblins and security to let them go to the Lestrange's vault.

If it needed someone to have the absolute dominatrix mindset, then I'd question why Dumbledore didn't toss fake Moody in Azkaban. I wonder what's so unforgivable about the Imperius when it was used as a practice tool in class to teach how to resist it when casting it on people obviously didn't merit a lifetime in Azkaban in that case. Aurors probably use it too in certain situations.

So that means it isn't super insidious magic that corrupts you and should be avoided at all costs.

Same goes for the Patronus charm that needs strong emotions of love and protectiveness. It's just that spells that are fueled from emotions are more potent if you're actually willing to use them for their purpose with the proper emotion backing them up.

Harry was desperate enough to manage the Imperius on the first try because he needed to get the horcrux in the bank. His will was simply stronger because of the need for the other person to stop obstructing the horcrux retrieval and was fueled by fear of getting caught or worse failing in the task. No domination there, even if the curse was weaker because Harry wasn't comfortable with what he was doing. But if he was an adult auror like Moody and he knew the consequences of failing to properly use the Imperius in a hostage situation, I'd say that absolute domination will have nothing to do with meaning to use an Unforgivable.

Plus Harry, Moody and Malfoy weren't tossed in Azkaban, so obviously the circumstances under which it was used matter more than the curse being an 'unforgivable' because it's dark magic.

Fair enough, but he also cast it on a goblin, didn't he? That might make a difference, but I agree a desire for domination might not be all that's required. However, "will" is a very whimsical stat and I don't like that something termed an "Unforgivable" spell could be decided by something as base as stubborness.

Moody's status as retired auror might have given him leeway in their use. Or Dumbledore's permission might have given him carte blanc to teach how he pleased. Or the ministry didn't even know that Unforgivables were used and the ministry is the one who throws people in Azkaban for them. That's one of those weird moments in the series that doesn't really mesh with how people would normally react. We never hear anything from the outside community about what goes on inside Hogwarts, when you'd think news about petrifications and Unforgivables would travel fast.

*** Right. It's hard to say anything about the canon universe. However, if you want to write an AU in which there is magic that has been made illegal and classified as dark for political reasons, out of fear, to control non-human magical species, etc. then I can accept that in that universe.

One common theme I see is that dark spells are often portrayed as being inherently more difficult to reverse. Under this qualification, it might not be that they are inherently corrupting, but that they are obscure spells with oft-unknown counters. This is a poor plot device though in a lot of cases. How easy and broken would it be if you just gave your heroes a "dark" stunning spell that is impractical to reverse on the battlefield. Suddenly your hero can be described as "grey' for using dark magic, but really be a great big teddy bear because they are too good to kill their opponents.

**** If we want maximum verisimilitude, though, "dark magic" is going to be any magic that has been resticted /for whatever reason/, meaning that different "dark" spells will have been restricted for different reasons.

So some actually corrupt the soul, some require an evil mindset, some are just considered too dangerous and some are just considered too mean. Learning why a given spell is on the list might even take a bit of rather tricky research (as the real reason and the official reason will often be quite different.)

A few might only be banned because they're associated with a dark witch or wizard - imagine if Voldemort was well-known for favoring /petrificus totalus/ because it lets him gloat before his kills. It's probably be banned, despite being an excellent law-enforcement option.

** It's an attempt to make Harry sound intelligent, but it fails in a number of ways ... unless done on purpose to show him being slightly unhinged (but few fics of this type take the ambiguous route).

The Killing Curse /could/ technically be used to humanely kill animals for meat. But it's unnecessary -- there could just as easily be spells that grow animal flesh without killing animals, similar to lab-grown meat. And you'd /really/ have to hate the cow you were killing to use that spell, which is just weird. Wizarding farmers would have to be pissed off all the time, which is a hilarious image. (And does slaughtering animals for food split the soul, or what?)

The Imperius Curse /could/ technically be used to gain control of someone who was a danger to themselves -- hopped up on something or mentally ill or suicidal, for instance. But the spell is so powerful that it's one of the most frightening bits of magic in canon and it makes complete sense for it to be banned. IIRC, it can also mess people up if it's cast by a less than skilled wizard, so there's that too. (And a Full Body-Bind Curse is probably a lot less risky, not to mention easier.)

The Cruciatus Curse /could/ technically ... yeah, that one really is difficult to justify, even with my Ubermensch!Harry goggles on. Hm. Well. Extreme, heavy, but fully consenting BDSM is the only possible legitimate justification for this Unforgivable that I can come up with right now. (I won't kink-shame you, grey!Harry, but I will side-eye the shit out of you for this particular proclivity.)

No one has said that the Killing Curse requires anger or hate to perform. It is said to be a complicated piece of magic, but that's it. There is no mention of emotions. Also, no one has said that it is the only method of splitting the soul, just that an act of cold blooded murder is needed. Voldemort could have beheaded his victims with a broadsword and still split his soul. The fact that the AK(too lazy to type) was his preferred spell doesn't mean anything. The reason that farmer wont use the AK to kill cows might be because its just too complex for them to use.

Just because the Cruciatus requires intent to torture and a mindset to revel in it, dosent automatically mean the same for the other curses that are called 'Unforgiveable'

Also, what about using the Imperius for interrogation? Secrets that aren't protected by the Fidelius (which cant be broken without a willing keeper)are fair game, you don't need to torture them.

Second, they literally cannot be used for good. They require the user to be either sociopathic in their ability to hurt anyone and everyone, or hate someone enough to use it. They literally require an intent to kill or do harm. Imagine if guns could only be used by the likes of the Zodiac killer, Ted Bundy and Jeffery Dahmer.

But my point is, Harry wasn't really sociopathic as far as I understand what it means. Also the unforgivables were legalised in the First war, so all the Ministries aurors and hitman used them. Does that mean the DMLE was full of sociopaths too?

The OP was that the levitation curse can kill so can cancer curse or whatever, the thing is the levitation curse can also do other things, it isn't solely designed to kill. If the cancer curse thingie can only do that, then its illegal.

The unforgivables figure in because they are the most common example of dark magic. We don't know how the other unforgivables work to actually render judgement there. The Imperius can be used for interrogation maybe? In a world where Veritaserum exists, I can see it being possible. The AK can be used for executions? It does seem more humane then having them kissed by dementors and then...having...whatever it is that happens.

****** Harry had his own set of issues, and really, he should have been sociopathic given his life prior. The fact that he was not, we can blame Rowling for. Admittedly, the Unforgivables are incredibly useful from a purely utilitarian standpoint. The Aurors were autherized to use them, however, that doesn't necessarily mean that they did. I could see an Auror, whose wife and kids were killed being able to use them on Death Eaters, and the administration officially not punishing them for it. But to say that everyone did sounds false for multiple reasons.

I am going to firmly stick with my headcanon which is supported by canon. That is, that the Unforgivables are outlawed because there is no doubt. You cannot accidentally use an unforgivable. You have to be perfectly aware of what you are doing, with no illusions. If they are found to be used, then the user has basically announced that they killed someone with full knowledge of their actions, that they meant to kill them, and there is no waffling around about it. Guns can be ambiguous. It is a possibility that you will hurt someone, but you can be reasonably certain that injury is more likely. That is why they are used as self defense. But the AK, means that you will always kill them, you will always mean to kill them with absolutely no doubts, and that sort of thinking is on par with a serial killer. In a way, it makes it really easy for Wizarding courts. They don't need motive, or mitigating factors, state of mind or what not. They merely need to prove use of an unforgivable, and the rest is already proven. And besides, keeping people like that around your government for interoggations or executions is always going to be risky.

***** Sorry I'm confused, you said above that there's no way to use the Unforgivables for good, but then you don't argue that Harry used it for what I consider "good" (if you don't consider it the same then I guess that answers my question).

****** Eh, in this case I can admit that my argument is weak, and that it is probably better to blame Rowling's consistency. But consider this, Harry uses the Cruciatus Curse on Bellatrix Lestrange. The intent of an action is different from its consequences. Most people would agree that Lestrange had it coming, and totally deserves it, but at the same time, Harry fully intends for her to feel pain, to suffer. So that is an example of a good consequence, with an evil intent. But they are not one and the same, and that is where the mistake lies.

** I don't see this interpretation very much. Writers usually agree that the Unforgivables and other really nasty curses are really dark.

My own interpretation, which is closer to what I usually see, is that magic has three basic categories (ignoring pure light magic like the Patronus, which is even more poorly explained):

- Magic that is neutral, but can be used to harm (compare a crescent wrench used as a club).
- Magic that is destructive, but not necessarily dark (compare a gun).
- Magic that is cruel, malicious, or requires sociopathic killing intent to use (compare poison gas).

The attitude in much of fanon (with no real canon evidence, I would add) is that the Control-Freak!Ministry forbids a lot of magic in Category 2 or even Category 1, while Harry & Co. are more utilitarian and want to use it. To be fair, it appears that JKR defines both Categories 2 and 3 as dark, since even minor jinxes are technically called dark charms, but there is still clearly something extra bad about the Unforgivables.

** Lmao good example. Yeah dark spells can't be used in a good way as they're literally designed only to do nasty things, but random spells can be used nefariously. Perhaps an overpowered lumos could blind someone if you hold the wand directly to their eyes.

** That's the rationale used for evil in the real world, so seeing it used for evil in fanfiction doesn't seem farfetched to me at all. Yes it is flawed logically, at least at the extremes, but cognative bias makes those flaws invisible to people that want it to be true.
