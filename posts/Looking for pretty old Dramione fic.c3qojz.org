I've been searching for a fic I read several years ago for several days to no avail. I want to say I read it close to ten years ago so it'd be pretty old.

What I can remember is that Draco and Hermione slept together once during the War and Hermione fell pregnant but never told Draco, and is raising her daughter now as Ron's. However her daughter has blond curls and gray eyes (of course) but Ron is never suspicious. For some reason Hermione finally tells him and he's livid.

The Malfoys find out as well but I can't remember much more. I know there is a scene where Lucius comes to Hermione's and interacts with the daughter in a weirdly nice way.

I originally thought the daughter was named Aurora but that brought me to a Thread of Innocence which I also read several years ago so im guessing I tangled up the two stories. I'm hoping someone somehow remembers the one I'm talking about!!! It's driving me insane!


** I've also just remembered! I think there was an epilogue sort of like the epilogue in DH where Draco and Hermione are trying to get their future kids ready for the first day of term and one of the kids dyes their siblings hair blue or green or something.
