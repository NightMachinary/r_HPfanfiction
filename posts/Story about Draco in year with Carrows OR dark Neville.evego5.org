I would like to read story about Draco in his seventh year with Carrows. It can be anything, (even drarry or draco/neville) .....\\
And it would be nice to know if there exist any story where Nevile is dark or not so innocent. I mean he was quite alone for some time and later was the one who leaded DA. I don≈• think he would be happy to be second again when Harry come back.

Now when I am thinking about it, it would be great to read story what hapenned that year when there are in eight year and everyone are different. I don't think I make any sense, but really, anything with Draco or Neville would be great.
