** Cool story, but traveling into your younger body doesn't actually kill your younger self. If time-travel kills yourself, then there's no way you could grow up and do the time traveling. It would be like the grandfather paradox. Therefore, young-you has to persist in some form, likely in the old timeline, while your time travel just creates a new, alternate timeline.

It's a stupid nitpick, but I hate it when time-travel stories can't get their physics right.

*** Assuming one continuous timeline rather than the creation of an alternate universe. Part of the point of 'send your memories and personality and maybe soul back in time' is to get out of the need for a time loop like you would need with a time turner. If a time loop was needed, they couldn't Chang anything that they knew happened for sure, only behind the scenes assumptions ala prisoner of azkaban final few chapters.
