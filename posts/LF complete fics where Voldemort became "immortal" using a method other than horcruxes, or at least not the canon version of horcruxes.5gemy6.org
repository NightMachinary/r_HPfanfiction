  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Well, there is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar). Don't think Voldemort's Immortality's cause is ever discussed in linkffn(Harry Potter and Myrddin's Torch). I'm fairly certain of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Refiner's Fire; Harry Potter and the Time of Destiny). Those are what I recall the names of off the top of my head.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
