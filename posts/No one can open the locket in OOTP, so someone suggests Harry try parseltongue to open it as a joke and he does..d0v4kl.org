I'm curious what would happen. Would anyone guess what that is or would the locket possess someone at once?

**** Makes me want to see a fic where Ginny gets some of Tom's soul due to the diary and starts influencing her indirectly. We often see Harry get influenced by scarcrux. Same thing, different person

***** I've been thinking up one where Harry and Ginny are both influenced by their horcruxes (scar and diary) and they become a sort of mix of themselves and Voldemort. It'd be a weird sort of romance where they're both essentially the same person, but it works because they're a narcissist

*** That would be interesting. I wonder what it would make that person do. And can it possess you if you aren't emotionally attached to it. I bet someone would end up dead because there's a bunch of order members that horcrux would love to get rid of.

** I would assume that when opened it wouldn't have the same affect on people as it did in the books/movie. Remember, it had been learning and trying to influence the trio for weeks/months, it had time to learn their fears ect.

They would attempt to destroy/close it immediately, probably fail destroying it. Personally I think kreacher would confess that he was ordered to destroy it, was convinced it was impossible but since he sees it can be opened has new hope.

Regardless, Dumbledore would probably get involved, and finally have indisputable proof of how voldemort is immortal
