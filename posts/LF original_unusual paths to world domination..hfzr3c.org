We've all read the dark!Harry fics with the self modification rituals, the countless unnecessary lordships and the magic contracts that fix absolutely everything.

But what about the less obvious ways to gain power? The enchanted rocket engine with infinite delta-v strapped to an asteroid heading for the enemy base at a tenth of a percent /c/? The army of the genetically engineered muggleborns? The magic programmable calculator originally designed by a Ravenclaw for arithmancy homework but also capable of quickly reversing SHA256 and now churning out millions of bitcoins to fund the world domination campaign? The wizard Facebook clone with even less regulations on personal data, subtly pushing specific agendas and influencing elections around the world?


** Does secretly imperiusing the entire muggle government (and MI5, MI6, etc.), pushing squibs from pureblood families to become MPs, and controlling (muggle and magical) narcotics trade count? Or is it too trite?

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

** "World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to think of it as world optimization" -- HPMOR, chapter 4:

#+begin_quote
  So not only is the wizarding economy almost completely decoupled from the Muggle economy, no one here has ever heard of arbitrage. The larger Muggle economy had a fluctuating trading range of gold to silver, so every time the Muggle gold-to-silver ratio got more than 5% away from the weight of seventeen Sickles to one Galleon, either gold or silver should have drained from the wizarding economy until it became impossible to maintain the exchange rate. Bring in a ton of silver, change to Sickles (and pay 5%), change the Sickles for Galleons, take the gold to the Muggle world, exchange it for more silver than you started with, and repeat.

  Wasn't the Muggle gold to silver ratio somewhere around fifty to one? Harry didn't think it was seventeen, anyway. And it looked like the silver coins were actually smaller than the gold coins.

  Then again, Harry was standing in a bank that literally stored your money in vaults full of gold coins guarded by dragons, where you had to go in and take coins out of your vault whenever you wanted to spend money. The finer points of arbitraging away market inefficiencies might well be lost on them. He'd been tempted to make snide remarks about the crudity of their financial system...

  But the sad thing is, their way is probably better.

  On the other hand, one competent hedge fundie could probably own the whole wizarding world within a week. Harry filed away this notion in case he ever ran out of money, or had a week free.

I hate this concept, because it's mugglewank (or wizard-idiot-wank).

This also assumes that wizard money is just random coins fully made of gold or silver, not wooden coins enchanted to look like gold and silver, or actual gold and silver but enchanted to be indestructible.

Earlier in the chapter that is discussed in detail and it is established that they are fully made of gold or silver. They have to be minted from the raw metal by goblins, but the goblins will do that about a 5% cut. The whole book is largely wizard-idiot-wank so yeah it's best to stay away if you're averse to that.

**** The-Fic-That-Shall-Not-Be-Named,

or so it is known. Read it if you want to. Not my personal cup of tea, but the rabidness some people show about other fanworks is just...

I don't approve.

**** Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, [[http://www.hpmor.com][www.hpmor.com]], or [[/r/hpmor][r/hpmor]] . It's a 600k word fanfic novel where Harry is a science nerd who goes to Ravenclaw and thinks Quiddich is idiotic. It's not for everyone and it's unpopular in this subreddit, but it has its own following. I haven't read it all (it's way too long!). My view: like most fanfic it has some horrible weaknesses and cringe aspects, but it also has some brilliant parts and it's very funny in places. It appeals to the type of reader who can't stand Captain Kirk on Star Trek and thinks the whole show should have been completely about Spock, if that makes any sense. There are threads about it on this sub that you can find with the search field.

**** Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, it is written in the tone of rationalist fiction, and the writer flexes his scientific background a lot. Otherwise I personally approve, but my taste is not others taste.
