Hi all.

I'm looking for MOD Harry fics. I've never read any before. I've seen plenty of people either like or dislike it so is it possible to link the better ones?

Cheers.


** Linkffn(On a Pale Horse by Hyliian) - this one is deliberately over the top and fun because of it. Harry has been the personification of Death for eons when he gets summoned to another dimension.

Linkffn(The Master of Death by rgm0005) - a cross over with Dresden Files. You'll get a lot more out of it if you're familiar with that series. This also qualifies as a badass old man Harry fic.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

  In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

** linkffn(10311215) : My favorite one. A look at MOD Harry from a outside perspective. Love this version of Riddle. See also other works by this author.

Most other versions of mod have op mary-sue protags. linkao3(11682105) : One if the better ones where the title actually means something.

If you don't mind LOTR crossovers then linkffn(The shards of sorrow) is interesting until chapter 16 or so after which it turns into a canon rehash.

  Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death, some of them not human, none of them exactly like his old one---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now he's Harry Potter again, but his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is going to be to support Jonathan in his defeat of Voldemort. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort comes that Halloween night, discovers what Harry is, and kidnaps him. The story of a long fight between Voldemort's sadism and Harry's generosity.

** Linkffn(13533898): HP/LotR. High-quality prose and a good pick if you want something where Harry isn't OP to the point of ridiculousness. Fem Harry, if you're all right w that.

Linkffn(11115934): Also a HP/LotR. I admit, I've found this one a bit hard to get into so I've not actually read this through. But it comes highly recommended by pretty much everyone on this sub. Worth a shot, if nothing else.

Linkffn(11907443): I'm a bit more hesitant to recc this, as it's Harry Potter/Tom Riddle slash, which I know is not for everyone. First off though, the slash is non-explicit, and secondly, the premise as well as the initial tone of the fic borders on cracky. It gets a bit weightier toward the latest chapter, but it's nonetheless a light, fun fic.

Linkffn(11255223): HP/ASoIaF. I wouldn't call it the best MoD fic out there, but its premise and the way it plays w the ASoIaF universe makes it an interesting read. Also, it's complete.

Linkffn(10610076): Marauder-era time travel. I found this one quite charming, though Harry's characterisation could have used a bit more oomph, imo. But Harry reborn as Sirius's and Regulus's brother, with some nice fluff scenes thrown in? Yes.

Linkao3(17946929): HP/Avengers. Fem Harry. Fantastic characters, real emotional development and well-written prose, with the bonus of fairly frequent updates. Definitely recommend giving this one a shot. Though, trying not to spoil it, in this fic, collecting the Hallows doesn't exactly turn one into Master of Death...

Linkffn(8643484): HP/Avengers. Oneshot. Short and amusing.

Linkffn(8410168): HP/Avengers. I haven't read this one in a while, but I recall liking it for its character portrayals. The friendship between Harry and Steve is quite sweet.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  “I was going to kill you,” Grindelwald said nonchalantly, twirling the wand in his hand. Harry's blood ran cold, all too aware of his own vulnerability. He inadvertently recalled the row of followers in the back of the dungeon, their reverence and fear of the lord undeniable.

  "What changed?" Harry asked, quiet but daring. His heart was beating loud in his chest, adrenaline beginning to pump through his veins. Grindelwald's piercing eyes finally turned to him, tracing his features unabashedly. “Your resemblance to the Potters.” At the mercy of the powerful Gellert Grindelwald, an amnesiac Harry Potter reluctantly accepts to assist in the lord's search for the Hallows --- by spying on the heir to the Cloak of Invisibility, James Potter.
