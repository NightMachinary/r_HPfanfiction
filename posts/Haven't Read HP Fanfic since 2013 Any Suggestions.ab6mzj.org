So yeah its been a few years since I've read any HP fanfics and I was wondering if anyone has any recs they might suggest. The longer the better only request I might make is no slash please. Been on spacebattles and sufficient reading mostly have kind of skipped hp fanfics so they must have some good stuff out by now!


** Quickly skimming through my favourites these jump out:

- linkffn(*A Long Journey Home*)

Possibly my personal favourite fic, a genderbent Harry is thrown back thousands of year in time and discovering she is immortal takes the slow road back. The modern times sections aren't the best, but the one-of chapters in the past are excellent and the Merlin arc is downright totally awesome.

- linkffn(*Grow Young With Me*)

Fluffy romance with a Muggle OC. It doesn't do much more than that but hot damn it is good at what it does.

- linkffn(*Strangers at Drakeshaugh*)

This one is kinda weird. A slow-ish fic focused on young muggle parents? It's got excellent writing though, and not all is as it seems. If you like the day-to-day life beats you'll love this fic.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** I never really got into Harry Potter fics until a couple months ago. Here's my faves so far!

/Some include slash but that's not the focus, I prefer plot over porn myself and my list reflects that/

*The Meaning of Mistletoe*

The first instalment of this four part series was posted to Ao3 in January 2017 and it is by far my favourite set of fics in this fandom. It has a very interesting take on magic, characters and goes in so many directions yet naturally flows.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9323225/chapters/21128351]])

*The Dogfather*

Only recently completed this year, a wonderful comedic tale of a What If where Harry is adopted by nice muggles and comes into contact with Sirius and Remus. I've yet to read the last chapter but I'm sure it's just as great as the rest of the fic (I just don't want it to end for me yet :P)

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487/chapters/31624473]])

*The Art of Self Fashioning*

2015-2017 Very dark and disturbing fic that goes into the magic of transfiguration. I found Harry's perspective to be quite unnerving to read but I read on none the less.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5103614/chapters/11740079]])

*Wear Me Like A Locket Around Your Throat*

The first of the fics I've listed that isn't complete but is still actively updating (updated yesterday in fact) and also one of the first I read. I need to give it a re-read but I remember liking it. It is Tomarry Time Travel which isn't everyone's cup of tea but even people who don't like tomarry have been seen to enjoy it.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7189349/chapters/16316573]])

*Quiet Like a Fight*

Probably the least popular fic on this list with just over 670 kudos but I think it deserves more. A What If situation in which Harry becomes a Slytherin simply because he doesn't have any prejudice on the subject so when the hat suggests it he's like "sure? I guess?". No annoying cliches, no bashing. Just Harry being a kid. Part of a series that is sadly incomplete.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4913998/chapters/11273302]])

*face death in the hope*

Still updating time travel fic with Regulus Black and Harry Potter. Very funny and very well written. Tagged with them as a ship but I've read up to chapter 30 (waiting for more chapters so I can binge) and they haven't gotten together yet.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]])

Edit: how could I forget Antithesis?!

*Antithesis*

Tragedy. Only very recently completed this October. I find it quite hard to summarise past the tropes but seriously, I enjoyed it. WBWL.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456]])

And those are most of my bookmarks tagged as recs!

Others I have marked as rec but honestly can't remember if they deserve such praise or if it just hit my tropey wants at the time include:

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10404927/chapters/22976058]]) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12576408/chapters/28645596]]) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9488711/chapters/21470627]])

**** Oh yeah! I primarily use and prefer Ao3 because of its tag system. Because I love very niche tropes. Also it's not because of mobile, it's almost the exact same on desktop.

They recently added a filter where you can specify tags that you don't want turning up. So if there's a specific pairing you don't like you can pop that in the tags you don't want. It's under "Exclude" and works the same way as "Include". You could also try key words to exclude like "slash" although that term is more popular on ffn than it is on ao3.

To avoid slash, I reckon your best bet is setting your category to "Gen" which means that the story, while it may include a relationship, isn't soley focused on the relationship if there is one. It's my fave filter.

Just some general tips I use too because not every top rated fic kudos wise is actually that good:

- try flicking between the different filter options when it comes to "sort by" to find new content. Date updated best for fresh but kudos for renowned. Then mix them up when you've exhausted them.

- Like a fic? If there's a tag that that fic used that's quite niche, click and check it out, sort by kudos or date updated. For example, I started using "Harry is not a horcrux" and "Harry Potter Abandoned By Dursleys" which are very small tags and turn up results I wouldn't find other wise because they don't have thousands upon thousands of kudos. I also love time travel but I have read all if not most of the highest rates stuff so I check the tag by Date Updated once a week or so for new content that looks interesting.

- Like an author? Maybe check out what they bookmark and filter through what they put down as Recs Only to see their favourites. I don't do this often but it can work, also with other people who have bookmarked the same fic as you. Chance you have the same taste.

There's also searching through bookmarks in general but I haven't tried that out.

That's all that comes to mind rn! Hope it helps

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

  “This is Mr Riddle, one of our Slytherin prefects. I'm sure he'll make you feel right at home. Mr Riddle, this is Harrison Peters. He's just been sorted into Slytherin and will be joining you in sixth year,” Dumbledore announced jovially, though Tom could see that sliver of constant suspicion in his gaze that had never quite faded.“Harry,” the boy hurried to correct. “Just Harry.”And then he stuck his hand out. How... plebeian, Tom noticed with delight. Walburga would probably faint.

I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end.

** The most recent update to linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) was in 2015. Still incomplete, but I'm hoping for another chapter really soon. It's an oldie, but it does a really good job of time travel, balancing advantages with disadvantages and focusing on how Harry builds up his relationships with his friends again.

And I recently laughed all the way through linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions). Excellent Snape redemption arc (very much in character), lots of subtle jokes. It follows the stations of canon rather closely, but the author very much does it in his/her own style.

** Harry Potter and the Natural 20 is possibly my favourite fic out there, period. Unfortunately it's not complete and after a brief resurgence is once again in hiatus, but there's still plenty of story to read already.

** I just started reading linkao3(The Boys of Crowhill) based of a rec from another thread, and it's very well-written. It focuses primarily on Harry; any adult relationships are background. Another one of my favorites is linkao3(Into the Fold by pasi) which is the best piece on Snape that I've read. It's from 2011, but has far too few kudos, so perhaps it'll be new to you? Linkao3(Swung by Serafim) has an interesting premise and also phenomenal writing -- Harry gets Obliviated by Lockhart and forgets everything. Linkao3(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) is another fantastic read and exactly what it sounds like.

A couple more of my favorites -- just putting links because this is turning into a wall of text... linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin; The Augurey; Forbidden by Savageland; Princess of the Blacks; The Young Adventurer's Club; Family by Necessity by ArithmancerProof; Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw; Reign of the Serpent). I also gotta shameless rec my own series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn).

I hope you like some of these! Happy reading!

** I can second many of these recommendations, but my top picks from post-2013 would be:

- /The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond/, linkffn(9818387). By far the best soul bond fic I've read--a realistic handling of the trope with a slow burn romance that doesn't gloss over the problems or immediately jump to True Love.
- /Long Live the Queen/, linkffn(11500936). A bit on the silly side, perhaps, but if you like muggle curb-stomp, this is the story for you.
- /Escape,/ linkffn(11916243). The only long-form marriage law fic I've seen where Harry and Hermione do the sensible thing and get out of dodge. A lot of people on this sub prefer /Marriage Law Revolution/, but this one is definitely the best in my book.
- /Order of Mercy/, linkffn(12181042). My all-time favorite canon-7th year fic. Focuses on Percy working undercover to help muggle-borns escape the Death Eaters.
- /Harry Potter and the Magic of Life,/ linkffn(11002763). A mostly-fluffy Harry/Daphne fic, but the writing is pretty good, and the cursebreaking trip is a lot of fun.
- /Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary/, linkffn(12407442). Luna gets the Diary, and hilarity ensues. One of the funniest fics ever, but definitely not crack.

*** Agreed with the "everyone has an opinion". It gets lots of love and lots of hate.

Some caveats for new readers:

- It was written serially, over an extended period of time. This impacts the plot development, and the first handful of chapters are perhaps not the author's best ([[/u/daystareld][u/daystareld]] has written a alternative beginning, linkffn(Daystar's remix of HPMoR), which expands and imo improves them).
- Harry can be hard to get along with. He's condescending and arrogant, especially in the early chapters. He can also be a very loyal friend, but he doesn't count many people as friends.
- It's as much a tutorial in psychology and reflecting on one's thinking patterns as it is a story. I didn't mind the author tracts, but they're noticeable and they do put many people off.

On the other hand, you can expect a complex plot with legitimately smart characters, lots of humor, loads of cultural references, and an impressive enemy. And it's complete.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** A fantastic crossover is linkffn(Child of the Storm) and it's sequel

A similar and even longer crossover is linkffn(A Third Path to the Future) it's around 1.5 million words and almost every part of it is fantastic, however it's a harem/polygamy fic so if you're uncomfortable with that you might not get as much enjoyment out of it

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.
