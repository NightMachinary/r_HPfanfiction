I was just rereading linkffn(Poison Pen by GenkaiFan) and came across a part discussing the weakening of Purebloods over time. About a decrease in their magical strength, a decrease in the birth rate, and an increase in Squibs. In most stories with this inbreeding is blamed.

In a lot of stories Muggleborns are persecuted for "stealing magic". It occurs to me that I have never encountered a story where this is actually true.

Has anyone read a story with this? For example, perhaps some disgruntled Muggleborn conducted a ritual that increased their numbers over time at the cost of the Purebloods.

I thought it might be interesting.

Thanks.

I know that's an off the cuff quote that she probably meant as a joke, but someone could incorporate that into a fic.

*** injecting a witch/wizard with vernon dursley's blood will cause the victim's magic to become unstable, allowing you to siphon off a large amount of it, storing it in some kind of gem. which can then be used to (temporarily?) boost someone elses power.

** My idea would be something along the lines of how Dresden Files handles individual spells: there is only so much power available in each spell and the more people that know it, the weaker it becomes. Apply it to magic in general and the pureblood claim becomes true simply because there are so many muggles that the number of muggleborns is increasing and that results in weaker magic for everyone. A war that kills a lot of wizards, no matter from which side, would make magic stronger.

Until the numbers start to rise once more and the magic starts to weaken again.
