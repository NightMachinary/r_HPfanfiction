:END:
I am looking for any fanfictions where Harry acts as a mentor to some first years. I know there was a story where he was assigned first years to mentor and eventually took on Ron and Hermione's first years but I don't remember the name. Does anyone know any fics like this?


** The Story Harry Potter and the Last Chance by LeQuin part of the story line has Harry doing the Prefect's job without being one. It gets to the point that the first years refer to Hermione and Harry as Mum and Dad.
