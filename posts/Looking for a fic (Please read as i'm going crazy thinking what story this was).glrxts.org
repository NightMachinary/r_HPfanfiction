:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I remember reading a story where Harry was raised outside of Britain by a second aunt, his mother's other sister. He goes to the World Cup but is discovered and kidnapped, held hostage by the british MoM and forced into hogwarts as well as the TriWiz. The government, australian i believe, raises HELL about it. I think there's some minor Hermione bashing but i can't remember.

I think the last chapter is an AN where he describes how the story would have gone if he continued it, one of the things being that Hermione was being mentally manipulated by spells/potions the entire time as she believes that dumbledore is telling the truth.
