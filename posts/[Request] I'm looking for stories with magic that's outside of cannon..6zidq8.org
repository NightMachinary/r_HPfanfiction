I'm looking for any stories that have magic that wasn't explored in cannon. Pagan rituals of some kind (as a religious event for wizard kind in general or for the individual characters or whatever) or Folk magic would be ideal, but magic from other cultures or even dark magic that wasn't discussed in cannon would be cool. I've had trouble finding anything like this so thanks in advance if you can help me out!

** For different magic, I'd definitely recommend Wit of the Raven -- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit-of-the-Raven]]).

It's been a while since I've read them, so forgive any errors, but I think Circular Reasoning has some interesting dark magic linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning]]), as well as Death of Today linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today]]), and possibly HP& The Untitled Tome? linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10210053/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Untitled-Tome]]). Prince of the Dark Kingdom is massive, but has some ritualistic magic & other stuff as well. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574]])
