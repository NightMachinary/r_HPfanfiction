Preferably not Drarry, more like them reaching an understanding, slowly becoming less hostile and then gradually more friendly.


** Obviously [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]].

No redemption with Harry, but as a human being among muggles.

** Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335]]

Starts very much like Canon, but Harry's obsession with potions changes things quite a bit towards the end.

** Definitely [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11269078/1/To-Be-a-Slytherin][To Be A Slytherin]] by Morgana Deryn.

Has an OC as harry's sister who is sorted into slytherin and has an enemies to friends to lovers relationship over the course of her hogwarts experience with Draco. It's fantastically written, follows the entire series (through skips most of second and third year) and has absolutely fabulous character development for both the OC and Draco. It's also complete.
