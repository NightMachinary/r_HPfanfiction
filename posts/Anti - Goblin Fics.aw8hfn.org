** A bit spoilery for the third book of the Firebird trilogy, but goblins get really, really nasty. It's distinctly not the focus of the trilogy, but it's a significant part of the last book's plot and it (ends with goblin genocide).

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

This one, if I recall, has an 11-year old Harry jump up on a table during Sorting and yell at Dumbledore. Can't remember why, can't be bothered to re-read it to find out. Only reason I keep getting email notifications for Sinyk's fics is that I lost my ffn password and haven't recovered it yet.

******* It's better than the 11-year old that gets to meet with the Queen and learn from Merlin himself through some weird memory-temporal shenanigans because he's an heir of one of the founders (along with Neville, Susan, aaaand iirc Hermione). Gets somewhat Mary Sue-ish, like all of Sinyk's fics, though at the end hogwarts decides she's had enough of Dumbledore ‘endangering' the students and, in spite of Harry arguing otherwise, just transfers Headmastership to Harry and the other three xD

It's sinyk's first fic, iirc, and it /absolutely/ sets the trend.
