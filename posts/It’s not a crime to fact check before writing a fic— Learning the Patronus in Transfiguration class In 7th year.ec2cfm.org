Professor McGonagall turned to the board and waved her wand so the chalk wrote on it magically. "Today class we will be working on casting your Patronus-"

Minerva was cut off by the quick rise of Hermione Granger's hand.

"Yes, Ms. Granger." She said.

"We've already learned the Patronus charm Professor," Hermione said with a slight hint of smugness. "In our fifth year actually."

"Yes I am very aware of that Ms. Granger, but you didn't let me finish. We will be learning how to cast a Patronus wordlessly." --------- I saw this and had to share. It's a HPxPercy Jackson fic and this scene was the ninth strike.

That raises the question if there's some gaseous substance or aerosol, like a misted potion, that eases spellcasting in the area it is in, like ionized gas eases the passage of electricity through the atmosphere?

** It's not a crime. But it should be. All other glaring errors aside, the Patronus Charm is described as beyond NEWT and it likely wouldn't be taught at Hogwarts at all outside of private tutoring. It's simply not worth the time it would take for something like 5% of your students to even partially succeed.

Veterans from Grindelwald's war and in general people who lived in that time probably can cast a shield charm, as well as an array of battle-spells.

** On a similar note a few days ago I noped out of a fic where Harry got a PC with internet and invested in Google. Before even going to Hogwarts. In freaking 1989. I mean, come on it takes five minutes to look up the history of the internet and google and notice the dates.

** On the other hand, obsessive fact checking can bog you down. I remember digging through Finnish weather archives for the snow height in January 1997, or trying to figure out which airlines flew from London (considering the different airports as well) to Gran Canaria in the summer of 1995 and which planes were used on that route.

Finding the BBC weather report for the 21st December 1994 on YouTube was easy in comparison. Finding a LNER timetable for the same time wasn't difficult, but the document reader on the museum web page wasn't working.

I feel like you ought to do your best to ensure that your fic is as correct as possible, but that can quickly become disproportionate to the pay-off because unless you put it in the AN, no one will know that you use historical weather in a scene. Although going through the basics of Lithuanian grammar to correctly gender last names was one thing where people who actually know the language remarked on, so you never know what will stick out to a reader.

*** I see what you're saying. Being obsessive can make writing a chore, however simple things like who teaches what class or what spell goes where really shouldn't be overlooked by Harry Potter fanfic writers. It's off-putting in all honesty. And it's not like an author's note was used to explain the careless mistake because... it was a careless mistake. Yeah, you can't please everybody, but make the effort at least for your fanfic, if anything.

**** To be fair, I find only one of these objections valid.

Let's start with the easiest: there is no indication that it cannot be cast silently. Unless I forgot about it, which is possible. But then it wouldn't be the first time some author changed something to fit their agenda. That's basically the whole premise of fanfiction. Which brings to the second objection.

Every time I read these kind of comments I wonder why people are actually reading fanfictions.\\
"It's not a spell taught at Hogwarts"\\
Sure. In canon that doesn't happen. But AUs exists. Alternate timelines exist. Fics which start either before or in the middle of Harry's seven years at Hogwarts exist.

I find being annoyed by these kind of changes extremely peculiar. I can understand not liking certain tropes or whatnot, but bashing a fic simply because it's adding/expanding/modifying the curriculum is, to me, extremely puzzling. Whyever for are you people here in the first place? IF you're going to scorn everything that that builds on canon you're going to find very very very, and dare I say it a fourth time, very few fics.

The only reasonable complaint that I can see is the fact that it's a charm and yet McGonagall is teaching it. Which does indeed seem odd. But it could nonetheless have its reasons.

Maybe the point is not to actually produce the Patronus, but rather to focus on its casting, which might then make casting some other piece of transfiguration requiring a similar mental frame or whatever easier.\\
Maybe the rest of the curriculum was over and she wanted to give them a challenge.\\
Maybe due to the war and Voldie being buddies with the dementors it's now advisable to teach the Patronus, yet nothing from the Charm's curriculum could be cut and Minnie took time to do it instead.\\
Maybe...

Really guys. At times like this I'd like to get your favourite fics and start going over them with flowing red ink marking everything that fits "nope, this didn't happen in canon".

***** So I get your point, and a lot of it has to do with personal preference, but I like fics best when they build on top of the already established canon rather than changing it without explanation. I'm totally fine with change (hell, that's WHY I read fic), but change for the sake of change OR change with zero effort is just not something I'm interested in reading.

The above scene lacks context (which is what you were trying to provide in order for it to make sense), and without that context it feels like canon was changed lazily and without reason.

(Also the "Hermione is smug about having already learned this" line irked me, but that's a different type of complaint.)

I'm sure I could pick a few random top10 recs and do the same. Except everyone loves those fics, or else they wouldn't be reccomended time and time again, right?

Now, I'm not doubting the fic actually sucks, because, well, statistics would say it most likely does. What irks me is the flock of people who didn't even bother to read the fic judging it lacking for something that could actually make sense and that it most likely has been done in other fics they adore.

***** I'm sorry but there really isn't a maybe about whether the Patronus charm should be taught in Transfiguration class. It's not categorized as a transfiguring spell and certainly not something McGonagall would teach. That was my gripe. It's like saying Wingardium Leviosa is a Transfiguration spell taught by Binns. It's...not true. Or right. Lol, fanfiction can mess around with canon all it likes but not these core facts, I suppose? Especially when the author doesn't make it seem like it's part of the story. If there's no reason for the total erring of a fact like that (like the author's own concept of Magic Theory or something) then it looks more like lazy fanfic writing because this mistake really shouldn't be made if the author was serious about their fic.

Sorry you got downvoted so much, though!
