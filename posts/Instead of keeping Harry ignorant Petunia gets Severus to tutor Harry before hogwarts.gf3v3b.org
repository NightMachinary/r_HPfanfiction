I really like Severitus/Sevitus so yeah any good stories?


** I just read linkffn(The Best Revenge) and stayed up until 5am so I could finish it. It's the best written Severitus that I've come across and a very enjoyable story.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** Not exactly what you asked for, as the relationship between Severus and Petunia starts out /very/ strained, but I quite enjoy linkffn(By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept)

Petunia advocates for both her children from very early on. Although the plot follows many twists and turns and detours, I feel like it's coming together nicely, with updates coming semi-regularly. And it's double Severitus

**** Yes. Real spoiler ahead: It's not revealed until much later, but due to male infertility, Lily obtains sperm from Severus (with his knowledge) and uses it to impregnate herself and Petunia (neither Severus or Petunia are aware of that part) while Petunia is in the hospital after a string of miscarriages. It makes more sense in story, and is probably the most plausible way to get Snape as the father of both Dudley and Harry.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
