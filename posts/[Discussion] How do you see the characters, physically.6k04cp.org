Since there are the books' descriptions, the movies and the insane amount of fanfics out there, not to mention the fan arts, I'm a little curious to know how people see the characters, physically.

Feel free to remind the canon description or to share your personal preferences (if you despise redhead!Susan, for instance), there's no need to narrow the subject.

Also, what are the best descriptions you saw of the characters in a fanfic?

The Jim Kay illustrations are really fantastic; I wish I had seen them as a kid reading the books the first time. They're faithful to the book descriptions and not influenced by the movie portrayals. Harry is thin and small, Hermione is plain but brilliant, and Ron is lanky and fun. They look more like characters from a wacky weird wizarding world instead of movie stars.

Ginny should look like [[https://i.redd.it/y4v4ajwukbwy.jpg][this cosplay]] on [[/r/HarryPotter]]. Nothing against Bonnie Wright, but I think she's not pretty enough as Book Ginny.

Harry Potter should absolutely have MESSY black hairs and GREEN EYES, as these characteristics were plot essential. Dan's height also left much to be desired, as [[http://static1.purepeople.com/articles/4/56/81/4/@/417874-bonnie-wright-daniel-radcliffe-et-emma-950x0-3.jpg][this photo]] clearly showed.

Rupert Grint is ok as Ron, but taller version of him would be better.

Lily's actor was way too old since Hollywood people apparently didn't think 21 years olds looked 'parental enough'. [[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/f4/10/ef/f410efc4253f9de383f7d0add16b6f89.jpg][Karen Gillan]] is often picked in the fandom as model for Lily, although personally I think she's more suited for Ginny, because of her flaming red hairs and brown eyes. In addition, some people like [[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/d2/a8/a2/d2a8a2950b287ae8313182b74208a84a.jpg][Aaron Johnson]] as James Potter.

Richard Harris or Ian McKellen were both more suited than Michael Gambon.

I'm generally happy with the pick of most other adult characters. Matthew Lewis as Neville was great, and Evanna Lynch was perfect as Luna.

For McClaggen well, by the sixth book Hermione Granger must have been well known and have an interesting reputation. He'd be after the reputation rather than the girl. Harry is the chosen one and she's one of his closest friends. For him its about being able to look in the history books and say I tapped that.

In the Goblet of fire it took her four hours of preparation for Harry to deem her pretty. Parvati was described as very pretty and we don't really hear much about her at all. She's also described as shrill and a few other less flattering comments. Lets be fair, before she got hexed in goblet of fire she looked somewhat beaver-ish as well.

** [[/r/hp_casting][r/hp_casting]] shout out.

*Hermione Granger:* I actually have two different mental images of Hermione that I flip between. One is a petite girl with little in the way of curves. The other, perhaps inspired by the idea that she doesn't get too much exercise as a library-dweller, is a slightly curvier version which relatively large breasts and a curve to her stomach. Either way I picture her as having a relatively pretty face and big, frizzy brown hair.

*Ginny Weasley:* petite frame, freckles, hair more ginger than red, very pretty face.

*Fleur Delacour:* Fleur is a very hard character to have character models for, because she's supernaturally beautiful so any given real life person will fail to live up to her. On top of that she's meant to be sexy but is also described as willowy, which I feel rules out both the skinny and curvy ends of the spectrum. She has to be in the middle somewhere: womanly but not voluptuous.

And on top of /that/, most pictures of blondes will be unsuitable as the popular "sexy blonde" is very sun-kissed and golden, whereas Fleur is paler, more silvery. She's the Moon, not the Sun. So she's the most difficult character to find models for.

*Pansy Parkinson:* For some reason I have always associated Pansy with having an epic ass/hips. I think it might be an association created via the idea of her wearing a pencil skirt from the office scenes in the fanfic /Parkinson's Knickers (Or Lack Thereof)/. So I imagine her with a relatively curvy figure but not large breasts. And of course her distinctive nose. Despite that nose, however, I still tend to think of her as quite pretty in a girl-next-door kind of way. Not "model pretty" but eye catching with a "sex on heels" kind of figure. Black haired.

*Luna Lovegood:* dirty blonde, petite frame. Big eyes.

*Susan Bones:* slightly below average height, hair mid-way in the ginger-red spectrum, large breasts, curvier frame, girl next door type, either no freckles or light freckles.

*Daphne Greengrass:* blonde, very pretty, very petite.

*Lily Potter:* average height, hourglass figure, hair closer to red than ginger, no freckles, pretty face.

*Parvati Patil:* Indian ethnicity, toned body and stomach, long black braided hair, medium sized breasts and relatively narrow hips. Also applies to her twin sister Padma, though I picture Padma as less toned.

*Lavender Brown:* brunette, girl-next-door type, medium-to-large breasts.

*Cho Chang:* Chinese-British ethnicity rather than fully Chinese. Slim, small chest, pretty.

*Angelina Johnson:* athletic figure with a bit of muscle to her, but also with some curves. Black.

*Katie Bell:* Dirty blonde, almost brunette. Cute face, almost pixie-like. Slim/sporty figure.

*Men and ugly women*: wiped out by Voldemort.

** Major characters (relative to their movie depictions):

- *Harry Potter*: skinnier, with less jaw. And, of course, with black hair and green eyes

- *Hermione*: plainer and longer-faced. As much as I love Emma Watson, I feel Hermione is stronger without the good looks.

- *McGonagall*: much younger and sourer than Maggie Smith.

- *Snape*: younger and faster-talking. More spite and fury.

- *Sirius*: younger, without the moustache.

- *Dumbledore*: I like Gambon's Dumbledore, but Ian McKellen would have hit the mark -- intense, but without Gambon's physicality.

As for characters more often featured in fanfic:

- *Amelia Bones*: an unfortunately masculine looking woman (not at all helped by the monocle)

- *Theo Nott*: a typical teenager -- all limbs and slouch. Long brown hair

- *Daphne Greengrass* a very attractive, fine-boned blonde. Let down by a terrible personality.

While the fandom has a tendency to iron out the flaws in some characters (Harry, Hermione, Draco most commonly), Daphne's /usually/ worse because she doesn't have any in the first place -- she's entirely a fan creation and fandom created her in many ways to be the perfect Slytherin.

I'm sure there are great Daphnes out there, both likeable and flawed (I haven't found any and would be interested in recommendations). Overall though, fandom has yet to agree on any flaws for her.

The reason she took hours in my head is because of her OCD like need for the night to be perfect and thus she took hours to make sure she looked as good as possible. Hell, I'm a dude and I don't really care about looks, but when I went to prom for the first time I spent HOURS getting ready, I ironed my suit, cut my hair, showered for longer than 2 minutes (being a boy scout you only need like a 2 minute shower to wash and get out since hot water doesn't last long at summer camp), i clipped my nails, brushed my teeth for 3 minutes instead of 2, had my mom deal with any blemishes on my face, had my dad help me with my suit, and so on. that took about two hours and I'm a guy.

** *Marauders*: Younger than they are in the movies. *Sirius* has shoulder length dark hair and a slightly piratey fashion style. *Lupin* has lighter hair with some gray in it, generally wears old-fashioned 'smart' clothes, tweed jackets, that kind of thing. Both Sirius and Remus have stubble; not clean shaven.

James Potter I rarely think about. *Lily* has a shock of red hair nearly down to her waist, and it's always an unnatural red, maybe due to her magic or maybe she started dyeing it at an early age. She likes to wear red, orange and green, and usually skirts instead of pants.

*McGonagall* is younger than she is in the movies. She also likes to wear green, I'm unsure if this is in the movies or books, but I've often imagined her in a bottle green trenchcoat-like woollen robe.

*Ron* looks nothing like the character in the movies, being tall and lean and stretched-out looking. *Fred and George* too, similar to the books' description, in my mind they're shorter and stockier than Ron, not taller and broader. All the Weasleys have a similar hair color to what the movies give them. *Ginny* wears shorts over leggings and boots, and has a slightly punky fashion style when she's not in her uniform.

*Neville* is chubby for longer and never loses it that much, instead converting some of it into muscle and becoming The Big Guy. His mother, *Alice* I've always imagined with a practial pixie cut. *Gran Longbottom* has a wand inside a walking cane, like Lucius Malfoy's.

*Tonks* has a short haircut, not a pixie but still quite short, which makes it all the more shocking when she changes its color. She is younger than in the movies and less self-assured looking, but instead is overenthusiastic. She wears heavy boots which only make her clumsiness worse.

*Bellatrix* is much dirtier looking than she is in the movies, and wears more classic evil witch/old crone clothes than the sexy Goth style Bonham Carter gives her.

*Fleur Delacour* looks nothing like the girl in the movies, having more of the look of a rich girl who loves her horses - very high-society and elegant and beautiful, but also able to be very practical too. Similarly, *Krum* looks older than he is and more like a male model, because the characters are meant to be surprised he's still in school and he's meant to be a teen idol.

*Narcissa Malfoy* is fully blonde, and a more elegant ice queen, grown-up Regina George than we get in the movies. I will say that movie-verse Lucius and Draco were pretty accurate to how I imagined them, though, although I didn't see their blonde hair as /that/ white-blonde, they were more natural.

** I imagine the characters pretty much like film cast, with some exceptions like Dumbledore (Gendalf's face will always outshine the Gambon's in my imagination), I also can't stand Daniel Radcliffe from 5th film onward, so I imagine Harry as if Daniel aged differently, his jaw was just awful and the way he acted made Harry look stupid and impassive.

I read the first 3 books before watching the films, but can't help often imagining them as in films even though I dislike some characters because of the actors. Like Ginny (too meek) and Remus with his awful moustache.

I try to picture Remus as a bit like James McAvoy, Sirius slightly like James Franco (I mean his "I don't give a fuck" expression), Ginny as maybe young Lindsey Lohan or something like that. Snape as just younger. Andromeda I imagine a bit like younger Meryl Streep I don't know why. Daphne as thin, haughty with average hight and not very curvy, blond hair, kind of severe beauty.

But usually if I don't see characters as film actors, than I don't really focus too much on their appearance, only vague impressions.

** For me, I see Snape as being closer in appearance to Adam Driver than Alan Rickman. In the first book, Snape is about 30 while Rickman was ~54 years old, making him almost two and a half decades too old for the part. While Rickman was an amazing actor, part of the tragedy of Snape's story was missing just because the actor was too old. Driver, especially as seen in the role of Kylo Ren, embodies a lot of Snape's character, both physically and personality wise.

** Would it be pointless of me to say that I mostly liked the movie actors? I don't get people who harp on movies for not getting some canon things just right. A movie is an adaptation, it can never and shouldn't try, imo, to be a 1:1 translation of the source material.

A few nitpicks. Daniel Radcliffe was too short starting with OotP.

Snape's problem wasn't even Alan Rickman's age, it was the shape he was in. Fitness has a huge effect on how old you look (compare say Laurence Fishburne to Tom Cruise - same age). I always thought of Snape as perhaps not athletic, but slim. The movie look got especially egregious in the 6th film. Otherwise, Rickman was great.

James and Lily were obviously miscast with much too old actors. I used to hate Remus' casting, but the actor captured the haggard, tired look rather well, so I don't mind it so much anymore. And I'm sorry, but Sirius' hair and pornstache make him look like a disco pornstar. All that's missing is bell bottoms and a Bee Gees shirt. So yeah, I suppose I actually hate Sirius' look in the movies. Not the actor, mind you. Just that fucking hair.

I love that meme where someone took a frame from The Hangover of the wolf pack walking down a hallway and labeled Cooper as Sirius, Bartha as James, Helms as Remus and Galifianakis as Peter. I like it not so much because of looks of the actors (though that doesn't hurt) but I think it works pretty well with regards to connecting Hangover characters with the Marauders.

Apart from height issues in later movies (and acting notwithstanding, we're just objectifying people itt), I liked Radcliffe as Harry. I liked Grint as Ron. I find nothing wrong with Hermione growing up to be a looker. Clearly, Ron was onto something! (btw, everyone who's ever said that "it's inner beauty that matters" must be shown the inside of a human. We're all fucking gross under the skin)

This one seems to tick people off as well, but I liked Gambon's Dumbledore. And on that note, I liked his interpretation of the character, even more than the - apparently more canon-faithful - Harris performance. We've all seen that meme. "Dumbledore said calmly vs DID YOU PUT YAR NAME IN DA GOBLET OF FIYAH" . Let that be cemented here. I liked that portrayal. That was Dumbledore with character, Dumbledore who has issues, as one would expect him to, not the mellow fellow from the first two movies.

Fleur shouldda been hotter tho

** By description, you'd think Snape looked more like how Karkaroff appeared in the fourth movie. Casting-wise I've often thought that Tim Roth would have been a better fit.

Karen Gillan would be ideal for Ginny Weasley.

Bill Weasley as portrayed as Ewan McGregor would be neat. While it's difficult to capture Fleur's ethereal beauty, Keira Knightley might come close.

Stephen Fry as Dumbledore would have been better than even Richard Harris (and would have survived to complete the series, which is a bonus). Already he's tall, gentle-spoken but with a capacity to intimidate, and his nose is already broken. He might have needed to shave off a few pounds for the part, but those robes can cover a multitude of sins.

** I can only speak for the Trio. But the thing is, that the body changes (height, muscles, skintone, etc.) is more just a Short Note in all Books and after that the Text doesnt consider their features anymore. As i saw the trailer to Philosophers stone, i thought the Goblin in Gringotts on the Desk would be Dumbledore ^{^} Harrys Green Eyes and his Scar are his trademark, so its easy to imagine/remember him with that (maybe his Wild Hair). Ron is (according to the Text in the later Books) Taller than Harry and has Freckles. Its very easy to imagine Ron with his Red Hair, but the Freckles were details, that i always forgot, unless of course, the Text mentions it.

I dont know, how i imagined Hermione before i saw the First Movie, but i know that i couldnt imagine her with her "Bunny-like" Frontteeth....in all Books. She speaks very clear and if they are really so large, than it would affect her talking, wouldnt it? I think Her Hair in the Movies fit the description in the Books, especially the first 2 ones. In Later Movies, her "Bushy" looks are disappearing, but maybe its because Emma was growing and her Hair stayed on that Amount/Volume of the first Movies.

But, despite their Book descriptions and Movie appearances (when Order of Phoenix came out as a Movie, Deathly Hallows came as Book, so i imagined The Trio partially on their looks in the Phoenixorder Movie), it was very often so, that i imagined them in their First or second Year appearances, yep, even in the last Book. When Hermione kissed Ron and he "throw" her arround i had some "Dirty dancing"-like image in my Head and said "seriously?! How smutty are they?" (remember, that i imagined them in their younger/childlike looks). Same was in the Locket destruction scene, Harry and Hermione from the first Movies were kissing. Even in the Epiloge i couldnt imagine them that much older, despite 19 Years in the Future.

** Since I grew up looking at the Movie Posters more than the book covers, I have a slightly slanted view on the characters. I almost wish I could wipe the movies away from my mind when I read.

Harry: Similar to the movies, only with a leaner and taller build starting third year. Harry by Deathly Hallows appears to be the same height as James, who himself is described as tall. I also assumed he would have extremely pronounced green eyes since that's pretty much his defining characteristic in book next to the scar.

Hermione: Large Bottom, more petite top (definitely not over a B-cup). Emma is too flat all around, but the face is pretty dead-on to how I imagined it.

Ron: Surprisingly he's the only character I imagine radically different from his movie counterpart, but that's mainly due to the radically different description for the character. Tall, lanky, etc...

Fleur: Always had the feeling that she was one of those "all the right curves in all the right places" types, even without the Veela Enchantment.

Ginny: Large Breasts, toned bottom due to the sports, always imagined her hair as a more pronounced red rather than ginger, akin to how Harry's eyes are an extremely pronounced green. It would almost make sense, as his Wand is Holly and Ginny's is Yew as well, furthering the parallels to The Killing Curse and The Disarming Charm, and Harry's eyes and Voldemort's eyes.

Voldemort: I always thought that the Handsome mask would still be there for Voldemort, like he wasn't as far gone as even the books and movie portrayed him, but still enough to show that he's changed (red eyes, extremely pale skin, and much taller and leaner frame that doesn't seem to have a shred of fat on it).

Dumbledore: Longer Beard than portrayed within movies, more imposing fellow in general.

For Snape I see someone like [[http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/14000000/Tim-Roth-4-tim-roth-14098174-400-505.jpg][Tim Roth]] but a bit thinner-faced, and perhaps with [[http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.447407.1314595275!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_750/alg-adrian-brody-jpg.jpg][Adrian Brody's nose]].

For Sirius, I like [[http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1506980/images/o-BEN-WHISHAW-facebook.jpg][Ben Whishaw]].

** The only characters I feel like the movie really got right were Luna and Hagrid. some of the others were okay, but others were severely misscast from their book counterparts (though that doesn't mean it didn't work out). Example, McGonagall is described as spritely and blackhaired older witch. Maggie Smitch did a great job, but truthfully McGonagall should have been played by someone 15 years younger. Snape had the same problem. First book, he's like 31ish, so he should have been portrayed by someone half of his age. The age thing really was a recurring problem, as they seemed to remember and forget that wizards and witches aged slower, only when it was convenient. Like in the epilogue especially, where they are 37 years old, but instead look like 45, whereas they should have been made to look like 30. Older than the books, but not run down and downtrodden.

I didn't see Luna like this at all, curiously, although it worked well. I saw her a bit bigger, with broader shoulders, for some reason (as there ae no hints of any of this in the books), and with a completely different face. Hagrid was very well casted indeed.

*** Actually, you know who would have made a good McGonagall? Kate Duchêne, who played Miss Hardbroom in the 1998 Worst Witch TV series.

If you've seen that show (or the new Netflix Worst Witch show that premiered this year, or even read the books that the series was based on) Miss Hardbroom is not unlike a much harsher McGonagall, and Kate Duchêne's portrayal is excellent.

In fact, she was asked to audition for "a role rather similar to Miss Hardbroom" for the Philosopher's Stone movie, but turned it down.

So if things had been different we might've had a younger McGonagall in the movies!

** I'll just note some of the characters I think we see alot off, I mostly think of them as they were at Bill and Fleurs wedding as that is their last hurrah.

Harry - about average height around 5'9"-5'11", wiry but with growing well defined muscles, squared shoulders. Wild hair that is just long enough that he can tuck it behind his ear when trying to smooth it out

Ron - Very tall 6'3"-6'6", very thin as all the food went to his bones. Slightly rounded shoulders, A "more on top" hair cut, huge wing span and long tall legs, and large hands. Not overly defined

Hermione - short 5'2"-5'4", average body shape, soft stomach showing her easier life style, bit of a rounder... Bottom. Short legs and arms. Very long and curly hair.

Ginny - Slightly taller than Hermione, 5'5"-5'7", thin dancers like body. Slightly lacking in curves but she is very fit having some nice muscles. Long legged even for not being extraordinarily tall. Pin straight hair cut short around her ears.

Fred and George - 5'7"-5'10", thick brawny bodies with what you would call Barrel chest. Not very defined but with large beaters muscles. Noticeable cuts, burns and callous on their hands. Straight hair that ends at the Top of their necks, shaved sides of their heads

Neville - 5'11" - 6'2", tall but squared shoulders. Huge biceps but soft stomach, even with a bit of pudge still there. Long torso average limbs. Long hair tied back

Draco - 5'7" - 5'9" very thin and wiry, avoiding working physically left him with a lack of muscle tone, long nosed and a bit pinched in fact. Slicks hair back around the tops of his shoulders.

** I really like [[http://scroogemacduck.deviantart.com/art/Leaky-s-Widget-pics-46664400][these designs]], but they're not all what I think of unconsciously when hearing the name of the characters:

- I see Harry as an "elongated" Daniel Radcliffe, basically --- with a thinner face and less prominent jaw (and, of course, the green eyes), but with the same nose and hair (plus the same voice).

- I can't help but see first-year Hermione and Ron as their film counterparts (even though Ron doesn't quite fit), but in my mind they grow up a bit differently --- Ron gets thinner and taller to match his book counterpart and Hermione doesn't end up as generally handsome as Emma Watson did.

- I see Voldemort as really tall and thin, with a face that is sort of skull-like and red irises. As for his voice, I find that Ian Hart nailed it in /Philosopher's Stone/.

- Moody, Lockhart, Percy and McGonagall's film counterparts have permanently contaminated my internal vision. Hagrid, mostly, but with the same height as the books (the films had to cut it down a bit for practicality) and maybe a bigger nose. Pettigrew's good too.

- I see Snape as looking generally like his Rickman version but with a more prominently crooked nose, and possibly slightly hunched. I didn't imagine his voice quite so low-pitched, either.

- The above-linked illustration's Draco and Lucius Malfoy are definitely my version, as is Professor Trelawney for that matter.

- Dobby's [[http://www.encyclopedie-hp.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/08/c18-dumbledores-army.gif][book illustration self]] is close to my mental version, though I don't see his eyes quite so far apart.

- My Dumbledore is also based on the aforelinked artist's version [[http://makani.deviantart.com/art/godric-s-sword-was-practical-25173685][seen here]].

- My mental Lupin is brown haired with a thin mustache, shabby hair, and definitely no facial scars.

- I follow the movies' Sirius and Lockhart, and movie Bellatrix is just impossible to forget.

- Daphne Greengrass looks... kind of like a more dignified Film!Luna, actually. Tracey Davis for some reason I always imagined as having very short black hair and a large nose.

- My Flitwick is similar to his /Philosopher's Stone/ self --- the later, neat-mustached one never felt right.

- Salazar Slytherin looks just like his movie Chamber of Secret statue --- e.g., with those huge mustaches. Not the vaguely Mongol-like guy we saw in the later movies' flashback.

- Movie Lily and Movie James do the trick, basically. I never thought about them much. (Not crazy about Marauder-era fics.)

- Grindelwald looks like [[http://img10.deviantart.net/2b43/i/2007/215/4/f/hp_grindelwald_quickie_by_homarusrex.jpg][this]] --- or, if not this, then anything /tall/ and /dignified/, as opposed to his ridiculous Johnny Depp portrayal. Really, between this and "Nyeeeh-heh-heeeh" Ralph Fiennes, what is it with the casting of the great dark wizards as clownish idiots?

** I have two headcanons about Harry's appearance:

The first is that he has a sort of sharpness to him. The Dursleys couldn't have convinced everybody that a normal little boy was a criminal, so I feel like he would have a somewhat darker and rugged look about him (I got the idea and a wonderful illustration [[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/2d/77/45/2d77454fb0ddce616fb925c884b9ab82.jpg][here]]).

And the second is an idea going around the fandom where Harry's lightning bolt scar actually looks like a lightning bolt, like in [[http://68.media.tumblr.com/7660e475cbcdabdb85eed9377b3b59ee/tumblr_na9dt7IlMz1qem0fvo2_r1_1280.jpg][this extraordinary fanart]] that I think is a very good portrayal of the character.

Actor-wise, I personally feel like the closest Daniel Radcliffe came to a physical portrayal of Harry loyal to the book description was [[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/61/91/59/619159942a54cc71a36e6f8cfd6eaade.jpg][in Prisoner of Azkaban]].

** Harry I always pictured (when he's younger/eleven at least) being very pale and small, general features as having very black curly hair. I don't mean small ringlets but more like large curls and cowlicks (which when you have short hair makes it looks very messy and impossible to keep flat). When he's older having darker tanned skin, around 6 foot or more tall especially by age 17, also his eyes as /almost/ unnaturally green - or at least light enough that they stand out. I'm also one of those of the opinion that Harry isn't only caucasian. Same with Hermione who i've always imagined fairly dark (for someone living in england lol) and 3c hair.
