  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** I'm always super thrilled to receive updates for linkao3(Of A Linear Circle Part 1) it's a very long, ongoing series that I've read twice already when updates were slower and I'll definitely read it again at some point. Flamethrower poured a lot of love, time and research into it and it really shows. The cast is huge, I love how they used history and linguistics, and I have fully accepted the backstories Flamethrower created for the Founders as canon.

Another one I get excited about is linkao3(face death in the hope) by LullabyKnell. After the Battle at Hogwarts, Harry travels back in time to the year 1979 where he not only meet Regulus, but also gets to meet his parents and a Sirius Black he does not know. I really love the interactions between the characters and I get such a kick out of LullabyKnell's portrayal of Marlene McKinnon.

I recently started reading the ever upward series by steanglerfig, the first part can be found here linkao3(to leap and love the fall). I admit I was a bit dubious at the start, but it has already wormed a way into my heart and I'm not even caught up yet. In ever upward, 8 year old Harry runs away from the Dursleys and eventually ends up living with the Basilisk. I love how motherly the Basilisk becomes towards Harry, but that's far from all. Harry befriends so many non-human species, the thestral herds, a super sweet demiguise, an adorable mermaid around his own age, etc, etc. There's a heavy focus on the different magical societies. There's loads of exploration, overcoming obstacles, and so much danger. It really brought that sense of wonder and adventure back to me.

  Tucked under Regulus's arm was an old, hand bound book in a deep maroon. Embossed on the frayed leather were the words, 'The Purest Art of the Patronus: A guide to defending with Light'. Unlike the books in the Black Library, Sirius couldn't feel the oily oppressiveness of Dark Magic. If the title hadn't given it away, the Magic definitely would have.The book was pure Light Magic. Wherein Sirius questions the facts he thought he knew and Regulus fails to hate.

  Excerpt:On the day her mother died she felt the pull of the Force. How fitting that when the Force awoke within her, it was not the pure serenity of Dawn, but the ravenous maw of Night. The knowledge was there, within her grasp, just waiting for her call. When the Dark called to her, it was with one goal in mind that she took a leap--revenge Summary: Some time after the events of the Last Jedi, Kylo Ren and Rey abandon the conflict to make a life for themselves. However, when the war concludes, the couple are found and tried for their crimes--Kylo as a war criminal, and Rey as an accomplice. Kylo is swiftly executed, and Rey sentenced to life. Sixteen years later, their daughter feels the pull of the Force for the first time, and with it, the knowledge of time travel. She travels to the past to fuck things up with her own agenda.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** My all time favorite is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) . It is very complex, very intriguing, very eventful, and even has a very good humor. Excellent worldbuilding which creates approximately a hundred subplots. Tons of well-written characters with minimal bashing (with everything having reasons). Read it. Then spread the word.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
