   :END:
When Voldemort returned after the Triwizard Tournament, everyone assumed his Death Eaters would flock to him. Voldemort inhabited a newly powerful body, thanks to the unwilling sacrifice of Mad-Eye Moody. His followers has clawed their way in to positions of power both in England and throughout the world. And with young Harry Potter nowhere to be seen; the boy had never shown up to Hogwarts.

Then within weeks, the most strange of events began to occur. First, Igor Karkaroff was found in his office at Durmstrang. Teachers found him dead, beaten to death by muggle hands. Further investigation found a secret room off the former Headmaster's quarters, complete with jail cell - apparently the ex-Death Eater still engaged in a bit of muggle torture. It was surmised that one of his prisoners had got the best of him and fled.

Next, a mid-level ministry employee by the name of Dolores Umbridge stopped showing up to work. A brief visit to her home revealed her cold corpse. Her body appeared unharmed except for the smallest of holes in her windpipe, possibly caused by the quite-illegal blood quill in her hand. A short note was found, detailing her work trying to rid the world of blood traitors. Aurors believed the woman was hit by regret and took her own life.

Shockingly, the next body was none other than Peter Pettigrew. Long thought dead, he was found tied to the fountain in front of the Ministry of Magic, with scores of rats rapidly devouring his flesh. This new information brought the case of Sirius Black back to the forefront of the social mind; with a year, the pureblood was released from Azkaban with a hefty reparation from the Ministry.

At this point, whispers began to grow. More bodies turned up, each death revealing secrets of pureblood supremacy, torture and vile acts. The Lestranges, catatonic in the cells in Azkaban, mumbling broken words. Walden MacNair, head removed from his body and mounted on the wall of his living room, along with the dozens of other magical animals he had beheaded. Fenrir Greyback went out for some fun on a full moon and didn't return; he wasn't found until a week later. His body was untouched except two small holes in his torso. More examination revealed his body had been filled with liquid silver which hardened within him, turning his internal organs to husks.

The final straw was the discovery of Lucius Malfoy. His wife reported him missing, yet a quick search of his home revealed the secret room he had hidden beneath the kitchens, fulled of dark items of the most nefarious purpose. His corpse was laid out on the floor, his snake-headed cane driven fully through his neck and a foot deep in to the solid rock beneath him. Between the loss of her sister and now her husband, Narcissa immediately pulled her son from Hogwarts, where he was in the middle of his fifth year, and moved to the continent.

The Aurors were helpless - on one hand, these murders were brutal and efficient, the work of an expert. At the same time, each victim was found to have participated in the most evil of sins, everything from murder and rape to high levels of embezzlement from the Ministry. Rumor spread that Minister Fudge traveled with a security team of six Hit-Wizards, such was his fear. This of course prompted much inquiry as to /why/ he was so afraid; the Daily Prophet's expose of the man's incompetence and history of bribery removed him from office within a week of its publication.

Voldemort was still at-large but without servants or their gold at his disposal, the Dark Lord remained in hiding. Every time he made a move and a Dark Mark appeared above a British village or town, the Death Eaters who took part were quickly found, bodies cold and faces frozen in terror. A few Death Eaters even began turning themselves in, confessing to years of criminal activity in exchange for protection.

--------------

Albus Dumbledore reclined in his office chair. What would have been Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts had drawn to a close. The year had been quiet; the Ravenclaws had won the House Cup, much to Professor Flitwick's joy. Every student had returned home to their families as healthy as they had arrived in September. Almost every one of the graduating 7th years had promising prospects for employment, whether in England or abroad. Former Head Boy Cedric Diggory had made a place for himself within the Ministry and had seemingly made it his duty to diversify the staff there - muggleborn employment rates were at an all-time high.

Speaking of Head Boy, Albus perused the papers on his desk - each listing the credentials of the ascending 7th year students. For Head Girl, his choice came down to Gryffindor's Hermione Granger versus Slytherin's Tracey Davis. Hermione was first in her year in almost all subjects, clearly a brilliant mind whose pursuit of knowledge never ceased. Tracey earned her grades as well, placing in the top 10 of her classes across her year. More importantly, Davis had overcome quite a bit in her time - as a muggleborn in Slytherin, she had fought for the respect of her peers and in doing so, earned the admiration of teachers and students alike. Yes, Head Girl was not simply a reward to the smartest student; the young woman who wore that badge should display the values that Dumbledore believed Hogwarts stood for. He smiled and marked Tracey's paper - well-earned for the Slytherin girl. He hoped Hermione would not be too disappointed; she still had her expansive tutoring service that now provided help to students of all years, and her organizational skills were essential to the teacher assistant program that was entering its 3rd year. The young Gryffindor had nothing to be ashamed of, especially after losing all ability in her left arm thanks to that dreadful troll incident in her first year. She had borne quite a few insults but had emerged to be a capable young woman.

Head Boy was more complicated. Ron Weasley had outgrown his youthful stubbornness and lackadaisical attitude to become Quidditch captain and a friend in need to young and old. His fellow Gryffindor Neville Longbottom was a prodigy in Herbology; Professor Sprout had already ensured he would be received a spot at Athens Flora Symposium, the nearly 2,000 year old greenhouse and herbology school. Anthony Goldstein, the half-blood Ravenclaw was the leader of the Hogwarts Debate Club and was a favorite of Professor Flitwick's. Theodore Nott had shown impressive fortitude after his parents turned themselves in as Death Eaters - he had lived on his own, having been declared a legal adult in the courts. Despite this, he had flourished at school, excelling in his classes while showing a newfound determination to unite the houses beyond blood lines. Hufflepuff's Wayne Hopkins was a possibility - while only a slightly above-average student, Dumbledore believed that he would be an excellent candidate - he was a natural leader, full of charisma.

--------------

That's all I got for now - basically, HP was trained as an elite muggle assassin (muggle for reasons I will explain in the next installment, if people are interested). Trying to paint a more complete version of Wizarding world.


** Harry as a lone 15 years old super assassin? Unless super!Harry is your intention, this sounds just like thousands other Indy!Harry fics that are pushing my suspension of disbelief.

BTW, why does Voldemort always have to return by the end of Year 4? Haven't we already seen enough Graveyard Resurrection Schemes? I mean it's getting really nauseous! I would very much appreciate if an original story has Voldemort returning much later and facing an adequately trained Harry (far more believable than those super teen Harrys).

*** I honestly didn't think to change how Voldemort would return. Thinking now, he possessed Quirrell in book 1, which, if Harry wasn't there, would be unsuccessful in resurrecting him (though Quirrell wouldn't have been defeated, so maybe he continued to possess Quirrel?). During books 2 and 3, he is in Romania or Bulgaria, somewhere in Eastern Europe, right?

Well the idea of this story is that someone took Harry in either right after Halloween night or within a few years of him being at the Dursleys. so at least... from 5-15 would be training him. And the training I had in mind for this story is very particular, related to the effect of how the Killing Curse was rejected and how it affected his magic.

** Well I have always enjoyed the extreme response to death eaters, so I think its definitely interesting in that regard. Though you don't have a story here. What you have are two disconnected one shots. The first being the interesting one, since Dumbledore delivering uninteresting information on near-OCs is uninteresting.

The greater issue being that Harry shouldn't be doing this, not at his age. The muggle nonsense you threw in at the bottom of your post killed any desire I had to actually see this written. I assumed while reading through this post that Harry was a time traveler, whose goal was not just to eliminate enemies, but expose them to the world. Which was intriguing, because while not a unique idea I liked that we were seeing it from an outside perspective.

But whatever, its your story write what you'd like. If 15 year old Harry with a muggle education can defeat anyone, good for him.

I'm not sure how true to the characters you want to stay. but if Dumbledore is in this story extensively, be sure to remain consistent with however you define his role. Is he still very knowledgeable about what the Death Eaters or Voldemort are doing? Is he actively against them? Has he been keeping an eye on Harry at all while growing up? Or is he more focused on Hogwarts and his students? Perhaps more academic focused?

I really don't care much about canon when reading fanfiction. I read it as a cool little success story for Tracey. Other people being recognized as good doesn't make Hermione bad. We also see Hermione do several awesome things in this fic she didn't do in canon that might she might have to stop doing if she became Head Girl.

School isn't a contest for becoming the Head Girl, and graded school work especially isn't. Your analogy would be more accurate if it was a background character being more fleshed out and regularly beating Hermione in school work. And even that could be set up as an interesting rivalry where neither character is worse off for the existence of the other.

****** I don't think you're bashing Hermione, and I don't think anyone else thinks that. In fact, you're the only one to use the word "bashing" in this thread. What you're doing is a bit different.

Someone on a different forum had a good way of putting it: when it comes to giving a character adversity, you have to balance /suffering/ with /agency/. That is, it's OK to hurt a character, but they have to do something interesting with that. Let me try to break it down in this case:

*Suffering:*

- Losing the use of her left arm: a permanent, debilitating injury. Availability of magic makes it easier to cope with, /but/ it also underscores the unfairness of it, since we've seen worse injuries healed without a trace in canon. It gives an impression that you are out to get her.

- Being extensively bullied ("She had borne quite a few insults...").

*Agency:*

- Becoming "quite capable" (not even "very"; just "quite") after "bearing" (not e.g., "confronting") insults.

- Organising a tutoring service and a teaching assistant program. That is, her main claim to fame is doing something that a Muggle could have done.

- Having the best GPA-equivalent in school (but not being the best at everything).

So, her agency is either mediocre or boring and pedestrian, and she gives off an impression of a passive functionary.

For contrast, just imagine it were, say, Harry dealing with losing an arm and being bullied over it. Would you be inclined to write him meekly "bearing" insults and donating his time to tutoring and clerical work, his greatest achievement being that he gets good grades?

I can't read your mind, but given the pattern in your story and those of others with a similar premise, here's my prediction for how you might write that; let me know how far off I am.

- Harry wouldn't take crap from anyone over it, teaching anyone who would bully him painful lessons until it sticks.
- Harry would compensate for his injury by becoming proficient at wandless magic, to the point where there's nothing he could have done with the arm that he can't do with (the wizard equivalent of) telekinesis alone.
- If Harry were to throw himself into academics, he wouldn't limit himself to getting the highest grades: he'd be inventing spells before his OWLs.

In short, you probably wouldn't write him as merely "moving on". Do you see now why people are complaining about what you've done with Hermione?

******* I understand what you mean, though I don't necessarilly agree. I agree about the suffering vs. agency idea. I think the accomplishments I gave her made sense - she used her knowledge of the muggle world to do something useful in the magical world. There appears to be no hint or trace of any sort of tutorial program, study groups, etc in the magical world. She would be doing something revolutionary, in /her/ way. Harry's reaction to something like that is probably more direct, more confrontational. But this Hermione was nerdy and friendless, gets to Hogwarts, makes no friends and THEN gets permanently injured (also, magic has limits - who says the troll incident couldn't permanently injure? What if they didn't find Hermione until the next morning, the troll luckily leaving her alive, and her magic, in an attempt to save her life, concentrated the damage to her arm, which saved her but kept medicinal magic from helping after? It's MAGIC! We can make our own rules, within reason.)

So you're Hermione - friendless, already an outcast on top of being a muggleborn AND having a physical disability. To gain the respect of her peers and teachers, organize the tutoring program (and maybe more... student government?) and achieving high grades would be a tremendous accomplishment. Not all people are measured to Harry's fanon standard of being the next Merlin.

#+end_quote

Without getting into a debate about how revolutionary that would or wouldn't be, this accomplishment doesn't work because it has no clear relationship with the adversity. For example, mastering wandless magic at a young age is something that could be motivated by losing the use of an arm; whereas organising study groups and tutoring is completely unrelated. In fact, it's the sort of thing I'd have expected Hermione to accomplish if she had a boring Hogwarts career, without Harry Potter, Voldemort, trolls, and other adventures eating up her time and attention.

In other words, what you are describing is the baseline. The level of suffering you are inflicting calls for more agency and more interesting accomplishments than that, IMO.

Maybe I'm missing some details, but it sounds to me like the plan is for her to overcome ostracism and bullying by being extra-nice, until the bullies and the bystanders realise that she is a useful source of homework help and start "respecting" her.

**** Regarding the silver, in the HP canon, silver doesn't have any effect on werewolves. You could easily use lead or iron in this situation and possibly create less confusion.

***** Ah, I was thinking of the more global silver vs werewolves thing then. Part of the reason I chose silver is also the visual of the molten silver hardening in his body - think of what happened to the female wolverine in one of the XMen movies who was stabbed with the adamantium tubes.

****** Oh sure! I mean, it's your story and you can pick whatever you want, but don't be surprised when a nitpicky reader messages you and takes you to task for using silver when it's established in HP canon that silver doesn't affect werewolves. /nerd :D I've had people ping me for having speed limit signs in the UK be in MPH rather than KPH. Spoiler: UK does MPH. You never know what a reader is going to twig on.

** I think you have two stories. The first one about the "shadow killer" and a one shot about Dumbledores decision on head boy and girl in a universe that Harry didn't go to Hogwarts. Maybe that could be the start of of a story with Harry being the DaDa teacher in what would be his seventh year after he defeated Voldemort. (He would have had tutors and know no one in the story,)
