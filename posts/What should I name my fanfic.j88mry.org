On Wattpad I'm writing basically an OC insert of Bellatrix's daughter attending Hogwarts but I don't know what to name it, can you guys help me?


** We would need more info.

Let's say the story is about a Dumbledore hiding 2 philosopher stones... You could name it "Lady Lestrange and the Unveiling of Dumbledore's Stones"

If it is about her friend Richard Selwyn getting given the diary instead of Ginny, then it could be "Lady Lestrange and the Dick in the Secret Chamber"

The sky is the limit

** that's something I want to read, I hope it's not Delphini, I hate everything cursed child.

agree with the other person, we would need more info. without more info, maybe: Born from the Darkness, Lightning and Thunder (if she will be shipped with Harry). but more info will be great.
