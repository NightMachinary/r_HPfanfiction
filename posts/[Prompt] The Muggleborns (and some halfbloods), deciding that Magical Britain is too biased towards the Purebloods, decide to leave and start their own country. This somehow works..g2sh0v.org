In fanfics the Ministry can sometimes be really biased towards the Purebloods, the old families, etc, etc. I've seen a few where it's explained that most Muggleborns don't really get far in any career because of this.

So let's take this idea and run with it. The Ministry, and Magical Britain as a whole, is unashamedly biased towards Purebloods. Call it racism, classism, whatever. And this is known to everyone, it's just a fact of life.

And why not add in some racism towards Muggles, who could easily be seen as "Lesser" people, just for the hell of it?

So in comes the Muggleborn and some of the Halfbloods, who decide that this isn't good enough. Deciding that Magical Britain has no place for them they decide to found their own magical country.

Somehow they actually do that. Maybe they take over some country and call that their new home (Magical Canada? Magical Ireland? Magical Hawaii? etc), maybe they somehow succeed from Britain and found a new country on the British Isles.

Doesn't matter. Point is: /somehow/ they found a new magical country because Magical Britain is amazingly biased, so they want to make somewhere better.

**** It's awesome, and a satisfying read, from Lucius Malfoy's POV. He's looking back at the past and seeing all the things he f-ed up that allowed Potter to drastically change the world and trick them. Don't get me wrong or anything, he's still a bad person.

** So, they raise an island out of the ocean in the middle of the atlantic and then ward the place to non-existence and realise they are neighbors with Atlantis which is actually a similar island, just a bit bigger and more advanced because it's a lot older

*** I don't keep up on comic stuff. But if you mean Genosha as a whole, that's been a thing for a while.

But yeah, them all leaving and starting their own nation sounds fun. Sure, there's some population issues, but I think a clever writer could work around that sort of thing.

It might work best as a total crack oneshot, true, but I think you could make a good run at a serious fic with this idea.

Imagine the word getting out of a new nation, one that publicly states that it's founded /by/ Muggleborns. Maybe people with magical kinds start moving there from all over the world?

The nation becomes this small, but very diverse, place.

Okay, that's funny. A whole bunch of the janitors, secretaries, etc, etc, all just /vanish/ one day and take over Hawaii or something because of some random law from nine hundred years ago that no one ever actually overturned.

** Why wouldn't they just emigrate to another country instead of /conquering/ it. Muggle-borns compromised less than ten percent of the wizarding population in Great Britain and the half-bloods who would be more marginalised because they have more recent or they are closer to their Muggle heritage are also a minority, which would make it impossible to conquer another country when you are disadvantaged in every possible way. This prompt is literally impossible without having a Deus ex Machina.

Also, there isn't a wizarding Ireland like there is the Republic of Ireland in the Muggle world, the whole island is under the authority of the British/United Kingdom's Ministry of Magic.

*** Because I think the Muggleborns finding some obscure legal loophole and /starting/ their own country, which could spin off into all the hassle that brings, is more interesting than them all moving to America, or France, or something.

The /how/ isn't really important, not really. It's the /what/ that I think is interesting. /What/ happens now that they have their own country? /What/ happens when they enter trade negotiations with their former home?

There's an interesting fic here, about the founding of a new nation by the oppressed minority, and that's what I'm interested in.
