Wow. This was /incredible/, and it's a shame there isn't a complete sequel out there. I think this is one of those rare really great AU stories and it deserves a really great sequel.

What are some other books like this one?


** Not a huge fan of the story due to there not being a single likeable character. I do give it credit though for making a character I hate almost as much as Umbridge, in the form of Kemester.

*** He wasn't as bad as Umbridge.

** Sorry if I am doing some late exhumation, but this story does deserve it. This story can be seen as an thesis on political manipulation and even more on the lack of morality of the games between powerful people. The perfect illustration of the benefits of having both much money and publicity, or what takes to be within the closed circle of powerful people. But even so it is also the perfect illustration of a problem in many fanficiction alongside canon. In canon, if we are truthful, It is never Harry victory, but Dumbledore and Hermione to a small degree. But never Harry, he doesn't even rank as an instigator but he is a follower with no power nor knowledge standing on its own. And personally I wish to see more fanfics with Harry ( Gryffindor or Slytherin sorted) being the one to know and understand magic (use) at the level Dumbledore, Cassane and Voldemort are demonstrating in Renegade Cause. Actually I want a fanfic with Harry determined to do everything that Dumbledore wanted to avoid by having Harry moulded as a sacrifice lamb because of the Horcrux. In Brief Harry player / master of the chess game and not a pawn.\\
There is also another thing a like to see is without Dumbledore bashing the instance where Harry and Dumbledore disagree completely on what to do for the war or about the Ministry with Fudge at the helm. And in final Renegade Cause is also a thesis on a fact that is very forgotten that in a War there is no a Good Side and a Bad Side, there is only that history is written by the Victor. Harry is in debt to Antonin Dolohov for the pictures that he destroyed. And finally I totally agree with Antonin that in this War there will be no good side, only the less evils side.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13106612/1/Lesser-Evils]] was written by someone who was a member of DLP, as the writer of Renegade Cause was. The author was also directly inspired by Renegade Cause, if I recall correctly.

***** Yeah, I'll probably read it when it's finished. Reading it in intervals just doesn't work for me. I need to finish it in one go.

** There's like 60k words of a sequel, but it never got out of the setup stage and it's been abandoned for almost a decade. RC is unique in the HP fandom in how the author plotted the story, I've not found anything that compares to it in this specific aspect.

**** I mean, what's there is good stuff, go ahead and read it. IIRC it's on the author's FFN page, but it's been years since I checked, I have RC downloaded to an epub file, so I don't need the FFN page.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
