I've seen and heard a lot about self-inserts lately (on this sub and at other places) and thought about writing my own. The problem I encountered quite quickly was that one tends to just go all out on it and break every plot. Ridiculously so. Which is why I made a little challenge for myself to give it limits. I thought that maybe you'd like to see what I shackled myself to.

The Self-Insert Character Roll.

So, basically all you need is a set of dice, or the [[https://www.wizards.com/d20modern/d20mdice/dice.htm][digital equivalent.]]

*Basic stuff:*

What type of body do you wake up in? Roll 1 D4. 1=Your own body 2=your own body genderswapped 3=Canon character (including beings and animals) 4=Fanfiction character-stereotype

#+begin_quote
  if 3 - roll 1 D20. 2 to 5 = You're a Squib or a Muggle (well... fuck)| 6 to 10 = You're a student in Hogwarts| 11 to 15 = You're an adult with average skill in magic| 16 to 17 = You're a powerful wizard or witch

  #+begin_quote
    The low number in one bracket always indicated that your canon character is antagonistic towards Harry. Higher numbers indicate closeness up until friendship and trust (For example: 6 would mean someone like Draco Malfoy, while 10 could mean Hermione Granger.)

    *Special numbers:*

    - 1 = You become an Animal or Being. Roll 1 D6 [1= Hedwig 2=Griphook 3=Crookshanks 4=Fawkes 5=Firenze 6=Nagini]

    - 18 = You're Voldemort. 19 = You're Grindelwald (lol, Prison break is go) 20 = You're Albus Dumbledore
  #+end_quote

  if 4 - roll 1 D6. 1 = You're the Director/King/Chieftain of Gringotts 2 = manipulative!Dumbledore 3 = You're the goddamn Ice Queen of Slytherin 4 = You're the actual Lord Gryffindor-Slytherin-Peverell-Black 5 = Grey!Harry 6 = Innocent!Bellatrix after Azkaban
#+end_quote

if 1 or 2:

#+begin_quote
  *What generation were you born in?* Roll 1 D20 (1 to 5 = You're born in the 10th century (Founder era) 6 to 20 = You're born in the 20th century) Roll 1 D10. Number on the dice is the decade you would /start Hogwarts/ in aka. be 11 years old.

  *Whats your starting point?* Roll 1 D6. (1 = You start off at home. 2 = You start off somewhere you've literally never heard of before. 3 = You start off in Diagon Alley 4 = You wake up in a Hogwarts dorm 5 = You're an unknown Prisoner of Azkaban 6 = You wake up, hungover and with an arm around a hooker, in Knockturn Alley)

  *Whats your starting equipment?* Roll 1D 6 (1 = You're naked and nameless 2 = You're clad and have 5 Galleons 3 = You're equipped with a wand 4 = You have a wand and a non-magical item of choice 5 = that trunk has clothes in it as well as 40 Galleons 6 = At some point you acquired Newt Scamander's trunk (or equivalent), including the riches the Niffler has stolen (Animals optional).
#+end_quote

*Magic:*

*Are you good at magic?* Roll 1 D20 for your general talent in magic on the following spectrum.

#+begin_quote
  1 = Something is wrong. You're almost a squib, what are you even doing at Hogwarts? 7 = You're an average wizard/witch 16 = You're really good at this whole magic thing 19 = You're talented. Someday you'll play in a league with the best of them, like Lestrange or McGonagall. 20 = You have the talent to become a legend on par with Dumbledore and Voldemort.
#+end_quote

*Any specialties?* Roll 1 D10

#+begin_quote
  1 = Tranfiguration 2 = Charms 3 = Potions 4 = Duelling / Defense 5 = Household Magic 6 = Divination 7 = Quidditch/Flying 8 = Herbology 9 = Care for Magical Creatures 10 = You have no special talent in any discipline
#+end_quote

** Do you have any special ability?** Roll 1 D20

#+begin_quote
  1 = You're an Animagus! (Use [[https://a-z-animals.com/][this site]]. (Choose an animal under the "Random Animals" section). Animal you choose, is your form) 20 = You're a metamorph 7 = You're a parselmouth 15 = You're a natural Seer. Any other number = No special ability whatsoever (yet)
#+end_quote

*Do you have any ailments?* Roll 1 D20

#+begin_quote
  1 = Aww bloody hell, Vampirism. 10 = You're a werewolf. Full Moons suck. 20 = You're actually dead. Ghost, Banshee or similar. Every other number: You're healthy as can be.
#+end_quote

*Some Plot- and Storypoints:*

*Does Harry (or the main character - Founders, Albus,...) trust you?* Roll 1 D20. 1 = He hates you (for whatever reason) 20 = He trusts you with his life

*Do his/her friends trust you?* Roll 1 D20. Similar spectrum.

*Does any character fall in love with you?* Roll 1 D20. 1 = Your most hated character in canon crushes hard on you. 10 = None of the characters fall for your charms. 20 = You're free to live out your dirty and/or romantic fan-fantasies. (or equivalents if wrong time period)

*Does Voldemort (/Antagonist) know you're here from another universe?* Roll 1 D6. 1 = Yes 2 to 6 = No

*Does Albus Dumbledore (/pro-main character mentor) know?* Roll 1 D6 1 = Yes 2 to 6 = No

*How soon is shit going to hit the fan?* Roll 1D20. 1 = You got the Avada Kedavras flying around your head from the very first second. 10 = You have barely enough time to get used to the world. 20 = You got enough time to prepare for a wide variety of eventualities.

*How applicable are headcanon concepts?* (Meaning: Concepts and ideas that fill the blanks of canon. Not Notice-Me-Not-Charms fanon things). Roll 1 D20. 1 = Practically nothing you've ever read in any forum is applicable. Don't even trust the wiki. You can only trust what you know from the books and Pottermore (maybe Fantastic Beasts). 10 = A few things apply, some don't. Experimentation is key. 20 = Every bit of headcanon you know is applicable and may be exploited to its full extent.

Two examples:

First Example Roll: (D4=3 Canon Character, D20=19 Special Number Character) You're Grindelwald

Second Example Roll: (D4 =1 Own Body, D20=3 Founders Era, D10=3, Born in the 920s, D6=6 Knockturn Alley starting point, D6=4 wand + item (Wand + Sword), D20=6 Slightly below average in magic, D10=10 No special talent, D20=1 Animagus (Fossa), D20=17 No Ailments, D20=6 The Founders distrust me, D20=13 May have a chance with Rowena, but not sure. D20=4 I'll barely be able to learn annon-canon spell before it gets real. D20=17 Almost all headcanon applies)

Anyway, I thought this could be fun to share. I'll dice my own self-insert character into the comments. Maybe you guys even come up with a little synopsis for yours.


** - Character select d4 = 2 girl!me
- Era d20 = 2 Founder's era (or earlier)
- Starting situation d6 = 6 Knockturne w/hooker, hungover
- Starting equipment d6 = 5 Trunk w/clothes and some gold (assume also a wand?)
- Magic skill d20 = 12 competent w/magic
- Area of specialty d10 = 6 Divination
- Abilities? d20 = 11 no specials
- Ailments? d20 = 16 healthy
- Main character reaction d20 = 15 high trust
- Friends reactions d20 = 4 high distrust
- Any 'ships/lovers d20 = 10 only unimportant people will fall for me
- black queen/badguy awareness d6 = 5 no clue/high disbelief
- white queen/goodguy awareness d6 = 2 no, but a quick convert
- Impending doom d20 = 18 very slow
- Headcanon d20 = 13 somewhat loose canon

I hate throwing up. It's a hella way to wake up.

Also, not particularly fond of stables, but that's where I was, laying on a flattened pile of hay. A disinterested mule was sampling from the edge of my ad hoc bedding. Once I was done puking I had to brush away all the chaff or whatever that was sticking to my bare body... my female, bare body.

Turning to the side I found another bare body next to me- a boy in his teens, asleep. If the soreness around my privates was any indication, he and I must've spent the night together. I've been a woman for all of five minutes and already lost my virginity, and I can't even recall the experience. Mixed blessings, all around.

Searching around, I discovered a leather sack with a double threaded tie. I couldn't open it wide enough to see inside, so I reached in and rooted around to see what I could feel. To my relief, the first thing I touched and so pulled out was a soft linen tunic. Next were some basic shoes; when I say basic, I mean the same sort of tied-leather around your foot slipper, but with hard leather soles stiched onto the bottoms. Then I pulled out a wand.

No question- it was a wand. It was roughly the size of the sharpening steel you'd find in a knife block, carved from a dark wood, marked up with dozens of miniscule sigils, and well-varnished. As soon as I had my hand wrapped around it, I heard it hum to me.

I whispered, "Aguamenti." With a considerate acknowledgement from the wand, fresh water started bubbling out from the tip. I used it clean out my mouth, then shook the wand to make it stop.

In all my fantasies and ruminations about traveling to the past, I was always freaked out by the likelihood that diseases and general lack of familiarity would get me killed sooner or later, and with much suffering in the meantime. The wand made it all better. This wasn't a disaster anymore. It was an adventure.

*** Part 2, because I couldn't let it go...

Turned out the boy wasn't just a randy farm hand- he's the local weirdo named Enfys, known for accidents both miraculous and horrifying. Later I learned that Enfys is Welsh for 'rainbow'. When the bell tolled for prayers, he dragged me away from the gathering townies. I tried out a disillusionment charm so that I could watch and listen. I figure it's important that I know enough scripture not to get tossed onto a woodpile and set aflame. In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spirtus Sancti may end up being the most magical words I can remember.

Calling myself Ausra, I learn that I'm the guest of the local lord named Gerald, who seems very put out that I've lost language skills- apparently I'm supposed to do him some favour. As if not knowing the language was bad enough, not having glasses was making everything a bit harder.

Rowena comes to the village to challenge me for waving magic around and causing trouble. Once she's aware of my whole 'stranger in a strange land' circumstance, she offers to clear up matters with the lord and then have me trek with her back to the enclave they're building in the North. We bring Enfys with us.

Rowena teaches me the basics of Welsh and Latin. The other Founders appear doubtful about me, but Rowena is keen because I show unusual competence for someone untrained. She can see that I'm too savvy to be so stupid-seeming.

Also, I'm discovering a proclivity for seeing signs in the patterns that others don't notice. Honestly, it's like subliminal adverts are being put all over the place.

On occasion there will be rants about how very little of 21st century knowledge is useful in the 10th century, though a few key facts about germ theory and basic physics impress the scholars. Demonstrations of orbital models based upon my fractured memory of science classes help along a few leaps, but nothing that will transform the world. Or maybe they will. I'm committed to writing down everything I can remember about... everything. My parchment, ink, and quill requirements are huge, much to the chagrin of everyone else. Also candles, since the daylight is infuriatingly short most of the year. Simple optics becomes a whole new kind of magic for the Founders. Having access to dragon's breath makes melting sand into glass less of a chore.

I start writing down anything I can think of to help- about the Plague, the value of cleanliness, proper ingredient separation. I keep kicking myself for not quite remembering so many tricks of physics and chemistry. It takes years to work out an early version of a microscope.

I almost never feel clean.

** When I wake up in the new world, I'll soon find out that I inhabit the body of a girl. After coming to grasps with my new found gender-identity crisis, I'll notice that I'm no longer in my own time, but at least in my own city. I only have a set of clothes, a few golden coins and a wooden stick. Eventually I find out that I was now a wizard... ehm... witch. Well... anyway, it turns out that I have a knack for it, but not as much as I have a talent for flying. Sweet. I'm also a parselmouth, which is handy, but given that at this point I kinda figured out what happened, I'll be really silent about that fact. At least I have no ailments.

Albus Dumbledore finds out that I'm not from this universe and invites me to come to Hogwarts. When I go to there, I'll make quick friends with Lily, which in turn makes me the mortal enemy of some of her friends. I also have a blond haired stalker on me... goddamn Lucius Malfoy.

I'm pretty sure Voldemort doesn't know about me, so I'll prepare myself for the eventual conflict on the horizon. While hitting the books, I find that much of what [[/r/Taure]] has theorized over the months of me reading the sub, is actually kinda applicable. Not everything, though, which makes me research everything before I cast anything.

** I felt icky writing this. I'm a goddamn fanfiction stereotype so I went all in.

Title: Slytherin Princess

I shoot up in bed and my lapis lazuli hair flies into my bright green eyes. I look around the room, taking in my new surroundings. I'm sitting among a group of pretty Slytherin girls fast asleep in their own beds. I clutch at myself desperately, but it doesn't appear anything drastic has changed. I quickly morph my hair into an emerald green to match my new, fascinating surroundings.

In the Slytherin Common Room, younger students cower away as I drift past.

A below-average looking first year whispers to her friend, “It's the God Damn Slytherin Ice Queen. Mary Suelin Dumbledore.”

“Who knew Dumbledore's niece would be sorted into Slytherin,” Her friend whispered before I adjusted my crown (metaphorical in case you weren't sure) and met my best friend Harry Potter in the Great Hall.

I somehow understood when we looked at one another that he would almost trust me with his life. Unfortunately, that bint Hermione Granger thinks I'm untrustworthy. It's probably because I'm almost as good at magic as she is. I can feel ancient and powerful Slytherin magic coursing through my veins and I toss my hair to the side when Granger gives me a rude look.

Vampires flew above the students in the Great Hall and Snape donned a beautiful set of lilac robes befitting of somebody like Gilderoy Lockhart. Dumbledore wore midnight black robes and gave me a knowning nod. He was my Uncle twice removed on my mother's side. She died tragically in my youth and Dumbledore was like a second parent to me. My father has a mysterious background that won't be mentioned again until seventy five chapters in.

“Enjoying your time at Hogwarts thus far?” Dumbledore asked wisely. Because he's so old. “Beauxbatons wasn't doing your magical abilities justice. I'm exceptionally pleased you decided to transfer.”

“Quite,” I whisper before fainting into one of my many visions. I'm really good at Diviniation. I could see a tragic future. Voldemort would never discover my existence and more upsetting still, nobody would ever love me.

I will enter into a functioning threeway relationship with Tonks and Fleur.

** This is mine:

I woke up with the worst hangover I've had in my life. The thirst I felt was unquenchable. I needed blood. Badly. Coming out of my coffin I noticed I had several rings in my hand and huge self-entitlement due to my substantial heritage. Somehow I knew I was Lord-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Peverell-Black. I could feel magic coursing through my blood-empty veins and my life-long dream of being in the Harry Potter universe was fulfilled.

I rose from my coffin in the middle of a dark forest. What I assumed was cold felt like the most blissful weather to my skin. I hadn't even walked half a mile when I encountered P-professor Quirrel.. I wish I knew how to use this silly ornate wand to defend myself, alas, all I could do was smack him with my newfound strength in the head and drink his blood until his death. I applied for the job of defence against the dark arts in Hogwarts, despite not knowing how to use magic just yet. I knew for a fact Dumbledore knew nothing of me, therefore neither did voldemort. The world was in for a reckoning, as my untold magical powers and my prowess in defence and fighting would surely bring this whole world under my fist. Voldemort would be a petty fly against me. If only I could figure out why nobody seemed to love me and every two weeks someone tried to kill me.

** This turned out to be fun. It's definitely a bit of a challenge, but the restrictions end up making the plot by trying to figure out how everything comes together. I did give myself a couple of extra caveats though: It couldn't be a crackfic, (since that's my go-to when writing self-insert fics); and any romance in it had to be taken seriously (no whitewashing or "shippy" cliches).

--------------

*Who am I?*

Myself. (debatable usefulness there)

*Starting Decade at School*

1940s (so born in the 30s or late 20s)

*Starting Point*

Home (neutral enough territory; safe start)

*Starting Equipment*

Clothes and 5 Galleons (could be worse)

*Are you good at magic?*

13 out of 20, so somewhat better than average (yay)

*Any specialties?*

Household magic (goddamn it)

*Special Abilities?*

Nope (goddamn it)

*Do you have any ailments?*

Vampirism (guess who's going to be a vampire professor at Hogwarts in the 1990s?)

*Trust of main character towards you?*

5 out of 20, so I might be trusted to give the time.

*Trust of main character's friends towards you?*

14 out of 20, so they see me as decently trustworthy. No undying loyalty there, though.

*Does any character fall in love with you?*

16 out of 20. But I decided to have fun with this one. I assigned canon characters to each number, with more desirable characters on the low end and less appealing characters on the high end. This was all according to personal taste, and not necessarily subjective/canon attractiveness, with no restriction on gender. (For example, #1 = Tonks and #20 = Umbridge.)

No. 16 was ... ^{^{Snape.}} /::gross sobbing::/

*Do the antagonists know you're from another universe?*

No.

*Does the pro-main character mentor know?*

Nope.

*How soon is shit going to hit the fan?*

19 out of 20, so I've got time to spare.

*How applicable are headcanon concepts?*

7 out of 20, so this fic should draw mostly from the books, Pottermore, and /Fantastic Beasts/ ... but I have a tiny bit of wiggle room. That's helpful since there's fuckall about vampires in canon.

**** I really like the challenge of it, especially since it would be so easy to write a Mary Sue or to whitewash Snape into something more palatable. If my SI stays true to my actual personality, then that character would not suffer assholes lightly either (there'd be no comparisons to Byronic anything). And Snape would probably detest the whole "good at household charms" / dark being combo.

It'd be interesting, to say the least.
