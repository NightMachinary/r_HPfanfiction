I am looking for fics with the theme of a sibling of harry actually being the BWL or believed to be the BWL when harry is actually the BWL. I wish for james and lily to be alive.

I would prefer if the fic contains themes of neglect of harry by james and lily or one or the other. pluss if it contains alive grandparents that take harry to raise him.

- pluss for powerful/op/godlike harry.

- story can be dark/ have dark themes.

- pairings not necessary but is ok.

- it must be complete as i hate good but abandoned stories


** Here we go:

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived): magical prodigy Harry is twin brother of BWL. Not complete, but a great read
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): slytherin Harry with style, great character depth of BWL twin. Ongoing.
- linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is a dish best served raw): time-traveling BWL twin Harry comes back to enjoy all the pleasures of power and influence. Ongoing.
- linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes): slytherin Harry with the tropes played straight. Ongoing.
- linkffn(The Return of the Marauders): Harry is probably the chosen one, but Neville is BWL and an arsehole. Tropey. Completed.
- linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning): role reversal of Harry and Neville, James and Lily are incapacitated and live in St. Mungo's, Harry takes up mastering transfiguration to fix them. Complete.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
