My favourite fics are Sirius centric! I love a lily&Sirius friendship but I'm also happy enough if they hate each other aswell. I also really enjoy stuff that have stuff on Sirius' family, for example , izzythehutt's The Black Sheep Dog series was amazing! Where regulus turns good and lives and walburga and Orion want Sirius back! So anything like that or just any Sirius centric fics :) thanks xx

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.

One of my favourite Siriuses... Sirii? Sirius'? Especially his relationship with Harry.

Sirius is a kid of the main character in this one, but he's quite involved in the central action of the plot.

Probably one of the more well known Sirius-centric fics. Pretty good, but I honestly feel it could be great if it was shortened and edited down.

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

  When Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and 8-year-old Harry Potter disappears, the world is thrown into upheaval. What will Britain and Harry be without each other, and who will face the Dark? You only THINK you've read this before. I guarantee you haven't.
