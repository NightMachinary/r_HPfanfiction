I would like to know Fics, that have Harry as an Experienced Auror (or other form of Crimefighting) and gets a new Partner/subordinate. She should be young (from the appearance atleast, coming of age, possibly just finished Hogwarts or started her Career), but could have a good knowing about Crime (atleast in theory, she would be like a younger Version of Hermione....possibly) and a tough character/Persona. They are working good together and there would be maybe a sexual tension.

I will leave it to the author, if they have a Bed session during the Fic of if it stays on potential teasing moments.


** Harry and my OC are never going to get together but that upset a lot of people and I often receive PMs telling me they have good chemistry. She starts in linkffn(The Aurors) being very niave but eager, and by the sequel linkffn(Hollow Ash) she's more mature and resilient, but still looks to Harry as a mentor.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  When a mysterious woman comes to the Auror office claiming to be the victim of a terrible crime, Theia and Harry want to do everything they can to help her. The problem is, she has no memory of what has happened. As they piece together the sinister events, their own troubles and traumas rise to the surface, causing them to question who they really are. Sequel to The Aurors.

  Harry Potter was sentenced to Azkaban prison. However he never went there. Who is James Pathertrory and what has he got against the Death Eaters. Unspeakable, Confident and Cocky Harry. Post OOTP, HBP ccomplient. No DH relation.
