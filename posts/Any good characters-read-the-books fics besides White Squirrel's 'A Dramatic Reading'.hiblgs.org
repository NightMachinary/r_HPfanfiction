I used to guzzle down those types of fics back in the day. But they were trash. All of them. However, yesterday I came across linkffn(A Dramatic Reading by White Squirrel) which has an actual set-up and actually solid reactions (for the most part -- there are a couple cringes but really it's nothing). The problem is, it only covers the first book. So now I'm hungry for more of these again. Anyone got anything? And yes, I know there's an incomplete sequel written by a different author.

  Harry is lost back in time with four people he felt he really should remember...with no memory and only seven books to find out the truth of his life, before it's too late to save his new family. A reading the book series with no actual book usage, for a copy that does contain parts of the book easier to follow along, shoot me your email address and I'll send it along.

** There was one posted for last year's Quantum Bang.

[[http://quantumbang.org/turn-a-page-of-fate-by-chimera01/][Turn the Page of Fate by Chimera01]]

It takes place mostly in the summer before 3rd year (and a bit during the school year), but they read all 7 books.

The premise is that he finds a magical bookshop in Diagon Alley while he's staying there, buys his books, shares them with select others, and they all go about correcting some of the worst bits.

  Summary: After a horrifying bout of Accidental Magic, Harry Potter runs from his aunt's home to seek refuge in the Wizarding World. A chance encounter in a mysterious shop changes Harry's Destiny completely.

**** Ah are you the author? It's amazing! I just finished it and I really loved it. I love your Ron especially, despite Hermione saying he had an emotional range of a teaspoon, Ron was really the most social of the 3 in the books. He managed to befriend both Harry and Hermione who were anti-social oddballs lol. I can see him as a mind healer because he has a way of drawing people out of their shells. Really great fic! I loved every minute

*** I really like this one. It's done in a very different way, and I like that it doesn't just have people reacting to lines. This story has an actual plot and it's very good

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1779118]]

Book1 > linkao3(24609685)\\
The series is at book4, 11 chapters in. Just updated on the first.\\
Fudge, Umbridge, Fleur, Bill, Charlie, Amelia Bones, Sirius, Remus, all sorts of people are there.

Fudge... has some good reactions.\\
Everyone likes how Harry "describes" things. And how "observant" he is.\\
Moody has a running commentary. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!\\
Snape gets yelled at. A lot.

Warning: Harry has lots of money. "The Potters are to the Malfoys like the Malfoys are to the Weasleys." something like that.

Warning: Book abuse. Those books receives tons of glares.
