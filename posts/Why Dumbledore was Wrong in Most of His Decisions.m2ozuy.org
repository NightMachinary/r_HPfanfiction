As a grown up, I literally don't give a fuck what reason Dumbledore gives, it still wouldn't be enough for him to warrant abandoning a baby in front of a house and high tailing it.


** Maybe he did check weather reports?

Maybe he did put some sleeping spell on the little child (not a baby!) so he did not wake up and wander. And some notice me not charms for strangers not to steal the baby? Warming charms on the basket?

Harry did pass the night just fine after all...

Maybe JKR did not think of anything like that and just wanted a fairytale start for her book (think of the abandoned kids in the forest rescued by a she-wolf, of kids brought in by a stork)?

I mean it's easy to demonize a character in a children's book, where the children HAVE to be the heroes, without having all the data of what could happen behind the scenes in the adult world...

Or Maybe BumbleDork really was a senile old man bumbling around and being EEEEVIL (hard to do both at the same time, but haters are gonna hate)

*** I'm not bashing Dumbledore, I apologize if it seemed that way. I understand your reasoning but just. I don't even know. Like you said, it's maybe because of a fairytale start but it doesn't seem that way anymore to me. Like yeah, abandoned kid becomes hero but most of them don't idealize the person who abandoned them. I literally can understand every single thing Dumbledore did. Yeah sure, there was a prophecy so the kids have to fight. He tried his best and I realize that but would it have killed him to knock once? But yeah, I do get that it's just a story so ðŸ¤· Oh and babies can be referred to any person from birth to 4 years old and considering that Harry was 15 months old when the attack happened, I would classify him as a baby.

** Because he, despite everyone's respect, couldn't handle another war. He was at the point where he'd rather just be the Headmaster, but was dragged back into the fray due to Fudge being a piece of shit who didn't stop to think of the actions that would've happened had Dumbledore been right.

*** Correct me if I'm wrong but that happened after fourth year, right? I remember Dumbledore and Fudge being, at the very least, good acquaintances till then except for the Sirius Black incident.

**** It does, but he was also keeping track on things related to Voldemort after his first defeat, which tells me that either Bagnold was willing to believe him that Voldemort might've survived, or that Fudge quickly became completely in love with his power

** The first three or so books were kids' books. The first is practically a fairy tale.

And you know what happens in fairy tales? All kinds of horrible things that we'd never accept in the regular world. Of course infants are left in baskets on porches. Of course the future "chosen one" is abused. No one called Child Services on the Dursleys? Of course not, and that's no more remarkable than the fact that no one called the equivalent on Cinderella's evil stepmother.

But then things change.

By book five, we aren't reading children's literature anymore. By book five, we're now reading YA literature, a genre which demands a bit more realism in terms of how adults and teens behave. Teen readers aren't looking for fairy tales, they are looking for stories that reflect something about their lives. And guess what? The adults are asserting themselves (finally!). They are trying to do the right thing, like keep the kids out of the war (much to their consternation, especially in light of the previous years when they pretty much ran their own lives regardless of all the dangers).

And then we get to the end of the book, where Dumbledore admits to Harry some of the things he did wrong. And here's where we have a problem. If we limit ourselves to the first couple of books, Harry being left on a doorstep and having to fight monsters is the realm of fairy tales. We have nothing to complain about. But when Dumbledore admits to all of this in a YA novel, he's voluntarily taking on the culpability of what must now be regarded as rather heinous actions. Had he not mentioned it, perhaps we could ignore it and pretend it wasn't an issue, but by bringing it up himself, he invites us to review his decisions in the context of YA standards rather than just Fairy Tale standards.

This is not Rowling's fault, not really. She's a victim of her own success. Rowling's genre grew up with her readers, something that was wonderful for the public but which created a flaw in her series. It was probably unavoidable unless all of the stories had remained in the realm of children's fairy tales, but then the series wouldn't have been nearly so popular, would it? Would we even still be talking about it, if Rowling hadn't made the smart decision to have the series grow up like the characters and the readers?

I also need to add that we should be thankful for this. Although I'm sure she didn't intend it in this way, the fact that Dumbledore can be both praised and blamed make him a much more complex character, and that in turn makes fanfiction possible (not to mention more interesting). How much poorer would the Harry Potter fanfiction community be if characters like Dumbledore and Snape could only be read one way?

TL/DR: In the context of fairy tales, Dumbledore's choices are unremarkable; in the context of YA lit (which the later books are), his choices demand judgment, and it's precisely the fact that we can judge him (and other characters) which fuels so much fanfiction.
