***** The question is, why didn't that decree come out in December? Why wait until Dumbledore fled? It's not like Fudge cares about a valid reason or something. Since it didn't come out against Dumbledore for whatever reason, the same reason could protect Trelawney.

****** We don't know how the magical law system works. While it's fanon that the wizengamot acts as the legislative body, from what you can gather from the books, the minister can also be a dictator.

******** I wouldn't be so sure considering that Ministerial activity constantly interferes with Hogwarts. Whether the Governors are politically influenced or whether the Minister has some authority, it is very clear that throughout the series we witness Dumbledore's removal from position twice, arrest of the Gamekeeper, the Dementors, passing of educational decrees, placing Aurors, naming of professors, High Inquisitors and even Headmasters (both Umbridge and Snape were named politically). In some instances Hogwarts may refuse the authority of the Minister and in some instances Dumbledore has enough authority that the Minister trusts him, but saying that Hogwarts is sovereign is quite far fetched.
