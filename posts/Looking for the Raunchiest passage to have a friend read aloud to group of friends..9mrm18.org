Hi everyone,

My friend lost a bet and now he must read aloud a passage of some raunchy fanfiction in front of our group of friends in his best english accent. The other friends don't realize he is reading fanfic and not an actual passage from Harry Potter. I've been looking for something that starts believable but takes a raunchy turn. Im thinking more raunchy than erotic but I'm open to either or. Can be rated R or M or whatever really. If anyone knows any good humorous passages or even if someone wants to write a quick something up I would be very grateful haha. It only needs to be around 2 to 5 minutes to read.

​

  Dobby relished his groinsaw's roar as he withdrew the flesh-choked blade from the astronaut's ruined skull. He turned to Harry, thrusting his bloody, retina-covered pelvis with elfin fervor. "How does Ronnie Ron taste, master?" Harry spat out an eyeball. "Like some kid with eyes."

Or something from "Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor" or "Crack'd Mirror", if you're not going for shock value.

*** Ahh yes I had a similar experience with that fix and drunk friends. Good bonding time [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatTheFanfic/comments/2eesun/severus_snape_professor_and_lover_in_which_snape/#ampf=undefined]] that's the fic i believe as it's been removed from ffn. Seeing as you need something that resembles the real Harry Potter it isn't recomended but it is a great laugh to just read it. Maybe you could do it after the bet mission.
