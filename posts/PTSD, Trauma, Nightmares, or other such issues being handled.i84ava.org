Either Harry having something, Snape, Malfoy, Sirius, Remus, or someone else entirely.

It can be PTSD, or anything else serious, it can be nightmares, it can be stress/paranoia or anything else, I'd just like to see people helping that person or people, if it's multiple. Doesn't have to be the main thing about the story.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash, threesomes, et cetra, doesn't have to be focused on pairings.

Can be on any site, anyone can be the main character, can be old or new. Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

Edit: I'd like it if they don't cheapen it, and actually use it/the issues to deal with the character(s).


** I read one where hermione realized harry was abused and not only for her parents to get him away from the dursleys but helped him set up a support group with other abused kids at hogwarts. Very well written but I cant remember the name.

** I highly recommend "A Dealer, not a Death Eater". It's a nuanced perspective of complex trauma, as opposed to the "traditional" presentation of PTSD.

It also has strong themes of healing, acceptance, grief, and emotional processing in a way that's exceptionally realistic. (It also isn't used for kink or cheap thrills, like a lot of hurt/comfort fics unfortunately are.)

Anyway, it's (very) canon divergent Snape/Lily, and takes place during the First Wizarding War. There's no bashing, iirc, though things are complicated between Lily and James.

The plot is /amazing/, and there's /a lot/ about the dynamics of Snape's family and his early life, plus exploration of the oppression / discrimination Lily faces as a muggle-born.

There're some potentially-triggering themes, and if you were interested in reading it, but concerned about those themes / events, you can message me and I could either hint or just tell you.

*** Ooh thanks! I love stories that write about PTSD, or other such traumas, but as you said a lot of them deal with cheap thrills, or not knowing enough about them, if you have more stories that don't use these as cheap tactics, I'd appreciate it!
