I feel it's unfortunate that Fred and George didn't invite Lee Jordan, Angelina Johnson, Alicia Spinnet, or the other Quidditch players, etc over during the Summer Holidays.

Or Ginny not inviting any of her friends over.

I'd love to see the Burrow more filled with people.

Kingsley Shacklebolt stopping over once or twice every month for Molly's great food and the Weasley's company when it's not Order business.

Nymphadora Tonks still friends with Bill, even though he no longer lives at The Burrow, she hangs around and getting into trouble along with Fred and George.

Molly bringing Remus over for a cup of tea and a nice nap.

Sirius coming over (Through Apparition or the Floo) and as Padfoot running around in the Weasley's large yard.

Bill visiting the family when he's not busy with work.

Charlie flooing over for an hour or so when things aren't busy for him.

Maybe they make room in the living room and put plenty of blankets and pillows on the floor for huge sleepovers.

etc, etc.


** I like this idea with the added stipulation of these people always offering financial help in a weird or unique way to help out the Weasleys.

Be it with groceries, school supplies, whatever to help them get buy. I love the idea of their house almost being a revolving door, especially after book 4.

** I just had this idea of all these different families becoming so enamoured with the Molly's cooking, the Burrow, and the overall kind and welcoming nature of the Weasley family that they all just start moving to live near them over the years. Over time creating a wizarding community to rival Diagon and Hogsmede, with the Burrow right at the centre.

** To be fair, we don't know what happened in the beginning of the summer holidays, since the books are written from Harry's POV. The other kids might have had friends over before Harry got there. Since the Weasleys are described as poor, there might be a "one guest at a time" rule for the kids to keep the family's grocery bill in manageble hights, since there is a difference whether you are feeding one or five extra mouths at a time.

** Did Ginny have many friends? But yeah, F&G could def have done that, tbh. And Remus and Sirius could totally have, like, Floo'ed in every once in a while. I am not sure how their international travel is, and of course by the time Bill moved back there was a war going on.

In the winter they would have blankets and pillows and a lit fireplace, along with marshmallows and hot cocoa. Everyone would swap stories about Hogwarts; Fred and George would regale Ginny with tales of their exploits, and in the summer after First Year they would exaggerate Harry's achievements; instead of the spectacular dive he performed in first flying lesson, they'll claim to have seen him chasing Malfoy around the entire castle, necessitating the latter to fly around towers until he got too dizzy, and then, at last dropping the Rememball, /after which/ Harry performed a dive from higher than the Astronomy Tower to the ground. And of course during the detention he battled Voldemort, and at the end of the year he and Voldemort held a spectacular duel that destroyed the Third Floor. Secretly, they're wondering just /how much/ Ginny will believe before calling them out on it. They gain a lot more respect when she eventually does call them out. But 10 year old Ginny is all too ready to believe everything they tell her.

In summer, they sleep outside, building a sort of blanket fort.

** My headcanon is the Weasleys are lovable white trash in the wizarding world.

- can't figure out birth control, bunch of kids they can't afford,

- believe whatever the tabloids tell them,

- very socially conservative while simultaneously lacking the signifiers of upper class (in Weberian terms, meaning not just economic) by flouting wizarding traditions that more successful families employ

- dislike of foreigners, false sense of superiority (treatment of Fleur)

Other wizards and witches see the broken down Ford Anglia in the front yard and think "yea... i'll just catch up with them at Hogwarts." LMAO!

*** Agreed, but emphasis on the "loving". Like if Molly was a Muggle, she would have moderately supported Brexit, but not talked about it, or even voted in the referendum, because she wouldn't want to upset anyone.

Also, that makes me think of an interesting premise: what are the butterfly effects if F&G gave Molly and Arthur so much trouble they stopped having kids at that point, so Ron and Ginny didn't exist? Who takes his place in terms of adapting Harry to the Wizarding world? Does Hermione just never fit in in Gryffindor? But that would imply that the Sorting Hat Sorted her incorrectly, which supposedly mostly doesn't happen, though I remember Dumbledore saying "we sort too soon"...and if it didn't Sort her incorrectly, that would imply that, given its contingency, the troll incident was not essential to her integration as a Gryffindor. So what takes its place?

Ron was struggling where others weren't, which embarrassed him, hence "you do it, then!" If she's next to Dean or Seamus, neither of whom has the insecurities that 11yr old Ron has in spades, maybe they'd just laugh it off. If she's next to Neville, he'd probably be thankful for the help, no matter how officious. Probably none of them would call her a nightmare within her hearing no matter how she behaved in class, thus no bathroom.

** ‘How about popping over this weekend?'

Molly was busying herself at the stove, while Remus opened the door to the cellar to grab his last butterbeer.

‘I can't bring anything,' he said, watching the empty cellar mournfully.

‘Don't be ridiculous, we'll have plenty! Kingsley's coming, you know how he is,' she said, smiling. ‘Big trip to look for Black in Tibet coming up.'

She frowned, looking slightly worried. ‘I still don't get why he /does/ that. It's not like he's /expected to/ or anything. Nobody will suspect him if he stays home and we need him here.'

‘Not that much,' Remus said mildly. ‘You know if they don't find proof every once in a while, they'll think the information is suspect.'

‘That's true,' Molly admitted reluctantly.

‘Will Padfoot be there?'

She stilled. ‘You know he'll like it,' Remus pointed out. ‘One weekend of freedom. Surely you won't begrudge him that?'

She waved her wand and the diced tomatoes floated into the pan. ‘What if he transformed back?'

‘He won't,' Remus said. ‘And he loves your cooking,' he added, though Sirius had never said that.

Molly's face softened. ‘He does?'

‘Yeah, and he- he really appreciated your hard work at Grimmauld's. It's - I think it's bit hard for him, you know, it being his family's house and all...' Remus let himself trail off. It isn't a lie, he thinks, just something Sirius never said. But he knows his friend, and he knows it /is/ hard and he /did/ appreciate it.

Molly looked nearly tearful now and for a second he wondered if he was overdoing it a bit. Hastily she turned back to the soup and sniffed. Remus can only hope fervently that nothing drips in. ‘Alright,' she said.

‘Who else is coming?'

‘Tonks, of course.'

Of course.

‘And Charlie, though I am sure he'll avoid me like the plague for fear I'll touch one hair on his dreadful cut. The boy looks like a hobo with long hair like that.' She sighed.

‘I think it looks stylish,' Remus ventured, who had never really thought about Charlie or his hair.

‘I'll bet Fred and George are locking the scissors away as we speak,' Molly said.

‘I'll bet they've made fake scissors already,' Remus agreed.

‘Keeps them busy,' Molly said briskly, as she sets the soup to simmer. ‘Obviously I promised him I'll try to resist the temptation.'

That first evening of summerholidays the sky seemed like a purring cat, laying low over the land. The wind brought the smell of freshly cut grass and barbecues from the village, faint enough not to bother but just enough to add something pleasant to the air. Remus leaned against the shed and watched Padfoot chase gnomes. At the table, Arthur was talking about the Ministry in-between bites of a delicious salad, while Ron and Ginny were holding a makeshift competition about who could eat the most strawberries with Molly's homemade whipped cream. The twins were humorously commentating it while simultaneously firing small prank spells.

‘You need to get back in shape, Ron,' Fred said as Ron was forced to drop a - now rubber - strawberry.

‘Yeah! Clearly we've been way too lenient,' George added, making Ginny's strawberry purple. Ginny looked at it for a few seconds and put it down, where it was eagerly snatched up by George, popping it in his mouth. Ron used the opportunity to grab two.

‘And Ron's on a winning streak as he eats TWO. WHOLE. STRAWBERRIES,' Fred shouted triumphantly, as red juice dripped down Ron's chin and Remus had to look away at the sight. Ginny merely took two strawberries, one after the other, while the twins were busy.

On the other side of the garden, farthest from the kitchen, Charlie was telling Tonks about the dragons. ‘... has tiny little rigs on her tail,' Remus heard him say to Tonks, who looked quite fascinated by his stories. Remus thought they looked good together, much better than he and Tonks would...

When he looked back to the house and the garden table, Molly brought out another salad and several cushions.

She smiled at him. ‘Why don't you come join us, Remus? I'll bring out the ice-cake in a minute and there's scones and whipped cream inside.'

‘Thank you, Mrs Weasley,' he said, making his way over to them. ‘I'll join you in a minute, just grabbing a scone.'

When he walked inside, he saw Kingsley doing the same, floating several pans and a oven-dish in front of him. On his left arm and hand he balanced two plates piled high with sandwiches.

Remus raised a eyebrow. ‘That all the food you're packing for Tibet?'

‘Don't be silly,' Kingsley said. ‘Bring some plates from the hall, will you?'

‘There's /more/?!'

‘Of course there's more, this'll barely last them the evening,' Kingsley said dismissively.

‘You know, I really don't think... ah, whatever,' Remus muttered. In the hallway he found two plates with pancakes, several cakes, cold curry, packets of sausages, thousands of cans, smoked chicken breasts, wings and legs, and what looked suspiciously like Kingsley slaughtered a whole pig and made everything he could preservable: smoked and salted hams, soup bones, filets, you name it. Pretty much everything except the head and hooves had been used some ways. He floated it in as best he could, and, upon lifting it in the air, discovered a packet or two of white toast. On the package it said to be careful not to take too much at a time because apparently it gave lots of energy. He floated that into the back of a cupboard which he filled up with the cans and set about putting the pig away while Kingsley put the pancakes, sandwiches, cakes and oven-dish on the table. The cold curry was brought outside.

Soon enough all the cupboards were stocked so much that if anything more was added it would just fell out, and they were left with ham, sausages, two chicken breasts and too many cans of everything from fish with tomato sauce to ananas to put away.

‘Where are we gonna put this?!' Remus asked exasperated.

‘Pleasant problem to have, no?' Kingsley said, watching him intently. ‘I guess you'll just have to bring it home with you then.'

‘I- I can't,' Remus said. ‘You brought it for them, not me. And I cannot pay you back.'

Kingsley shrugged. ‘They'll have enough for the next six months,' he pointed out. ‘More if they try to send it back.' There was a twinkle in his eye and a barely repressed, shit-eating grin.

Remus sighed. ‘Why's that, then?'

Kingsley lowered his voice. ‘It doubles every time.'

Cackling, he went into the garden.
