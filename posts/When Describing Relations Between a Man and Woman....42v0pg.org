Please do not say that inserting P into V causes a feeling of "fullness and completeness." I promise you, as a woman that has had sex with a man, that we are not waiting for that critical moment and pausing to reflect on this "fullness and completeness," or that "everything just felt so right," or whatever else ridiculous phrasing is used to describe this. Phrases like those really just imply that you either don't have a V and/or have not had heterosexual sex.

Please, don't use these phrases unless you are so good at writing that I can literally feel the sensations.


** Not all sex is awesome. Especially when one or both people are virgins. Then it's awkward and uncomfortable and and often kinda gross. Also, women require work (ie foreplay) to be open and wet, and even then, lube and slow going is always appreciated. Every time someone 'thrusts' or even worse 'slams' in with no prep I wince.

But then, original published literature has the same problems. No one wants to deal with reality.

*** Quickies are a thing, as is "just fuck me already".

It's perfectly possible for a woman to get horny from the situation they're in and be ready to go from the moment clothes are off. The idea that women don't get horny and always have to be induced into that state by hard work is puritanical nonsense.

So basically: sex is diverse and varies massively not only from person to person but also situation to situation.

**** Absolutely, not everyone is the same (even excluding the segment of society who enjoy pain with their sex), and neither does my response take into account of the situation they are in (even if "Just fuck me already" /does/ imply that the women has been sexually aroused outside of the mans presences). I actually think that women possibly get horny more often then men, they are just much better at hiding their fantasies (and the effects of them).

However, if you aren't having regular sex (ie a virgin) then prep /is/ needed to get enjoyment out of it, if only due to the anxiety (which causes tensing) expected for first timers. The vagina itself is very elastic normally, but there is some relaxation during sexually arousal. The metaphor I was told in school was a tightly clenched fist, which relaxes into a loose, but still closed, fist during sexual arousal. The space between the fingers doesn't change, but the tension against them does.

Another thing is that vaginal tissues doesn't /start/ to become lubricated until 5 to 7 minutes after a women is sexually aroused. That is to say nothing about being significantly wet enough to ease penetration. Trying to penetrate dry is not only uncomfortable for the woman, but the man as well. Chaffing is a thing.

Twenty minutes of sensual play is minimal /average/ for women and 70-80 per cent of women can only achieve orgasm during direct clitoral stimulation. So when I read that they lock eyes in a corridor and the next paragraph cue deserted niche and he is slamming into her while she moans away like it the best thing ever? Yeah, don't believe it at all.

** Also describing the dick as being steel+velvet, or /inflating/. I've seen those so so often and it just seems silly? The first is used /all/ the time, at least find something else to describe it. And if they're inflating, well, there's only a few circumstances for that to happen under, and when it isn't one of those specific circumstances, I'm gonna think of a balloon. A balloon dick. That's apparently made of steel and velvet.

** I want to take this time to remind everyone, that no, you do not seal shut every possible way of breathing while kissing. "Taking a pause because of a need of air", is not a thing. But then again, you are probably writing about teenagers, so awkward kissing is still in the picture.

Anyway, sex scenes... ugh. I cringe so hard when I read them and its obvious that they're written by someone who wasn't even close to loosing his virginity. Hell, sometimes it feels like they don't even masturbate, with the lack of biological knowledge they present.

Also, I'd like to make [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM79UBTwfsg][this video]] mandatory for all smut fic authors, no matter if they'll then use this knowledge or not.

** Personally, I skim over anything that actually has sex scenes in Hp fanfiction. If it wasn't bad enough that the characters tend to be underage (no, just... no), the writing is something that would be best put to use psychologically undermining IS recruiters it's so bloody bad.

Why not, instead of trying to make me cringe, replace your smut scene with sexual innuendo for engineering enthusiasts instead?

[[/spoiler]["As the probe successfully integrated into the primary manifold following successful lubrication detailed earlier under 'start-up procedure 6:warmup and romanticism', the master control for the manifold reported possible stressing of the internal barriers, which led to a slight interruption in probe operations as the main interface for the probe queried master control about possible damage concerns. After receiving a rather vehement order to continue, main probe interface resumed operations as the manifold's automated lubrication and self-repair functions both kicked in to accomodate the greater-than-expected stress levels direct contact between the probe and the manifold was expected to entail. For some reason, the main interface was pretty smug about this in the post-operation feedback & evaluation section of its report."]]
