** He /is/ pretty clearly a fully-trained wizard, though, and quite a good one; it's all but stated that Hagrid being allowed to immediately be brought back to Hogwarts as Assistant Groundskeeper In Training was an excuse for Dumbledore to mentor him off-record, having repaired his wand and camouflaged it into the pink umbrella.

I mean, look at the stuff he does in the "yer a wizard" scene. /Wordless human Transfiguration/, for God's sake!

*** My headcanon is that was actually a jinx, not an actual transfiguration. (In the games, there are a lot of jinxes that give the victim animal appendages.)

*** I Took Hagrid as just being skilled at magic despite his lack of formal education

or Jk rowling had not thought about the rules of magic yet

But Hagrid, who has completed his education and was allowed to practise magic openly would be a terrifying foe
