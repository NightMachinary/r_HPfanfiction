I want to rec a most excellent fic that I read recently, which I probably saw on this sub! Still, won't hurt to give it another shoutout, right?

Honestly, the bot hates me! Sorry.


** Loved it! I'm so glad there are some fics focusing on the Patil sisters and Lavender. The writing was excellent--- thank you for the recommendation!

** Loved this. Wish it had been longer - always a sign of a good fic I think.

*** jacdot, agreed! I was entranced by the haunting tone of the fic, and I liked that all of the “good guys” didn't necessarily get a happy ending, but struggled. The women were so IC, still great believers in the power of divination. Thank you for your comment!
