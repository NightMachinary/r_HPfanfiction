Ive over the years been recommended OC fics. And in the case its a true OC ( aka not a minor canon character who was expanded on) my knee jerk reaction is nah. However im perfectly fine with minor HP characters essentially being turned into OCs ex Blaise Pansy Nott.

And often qualities id resent being given to OCs like having close friendships with major chatacters or romance with them, gaining importance in the plot by being "special " somehow to start with that I hate it with OCs, im fine in seeing with minor characters.

Make Blaise Pansy and Nott Dracos best friends when it wasnt in canon? Totally fine.

Is Blaise like this progressive heartthrob even though the very little you know about him in canon doesnt back this up? Perfect

Is Nott Hermiones Intellectual rival even though no such indication was made in canon? Love it

Pansy being queen off sass instead of just a snobby girl who sucked up to Draco like in canon? Totally for it

These characters are essentially ocs at this point not ocs in name only and yet I treat them so different than actual ocs and i have no idea why.

Can anyone else relate?


** The reason why OC's get very little love is because there are zero expectations around them. It's a full-on mystery bag, and that's not what fanfiction readers want to read. They want fanfiction, which is seeing familiar characters and familiar settings. If they wanted original stuff, they'd be reading original fiction.

Something worth considering is how the reputation and image of OC's has been tainted in fandom culture since the beginning, from young teens starting out writing by churning out fics featuring Mary Sue/Gary Stu wish fulfillment fantasies. Ebony Darkn'ness from My Immortal, or all the Sonic and Pony recolours on DeviantArt are prominent examples (the craziness of the Sonic OC fandom is where the "Nothing Personnel" meme came from). With so much fanfiction around, readers would rather pick a familiar name than risk wasting their time on a coinflip.

People get around this by doing the "Characters In Name Only" deal by using canon names who have no attached personality, like Ice Queen Daphne Greengrass. Or writing Harry, a known character, with a completely different personality ("Independent Harry"), background ("Harry raised by X"), or skillset ("Master of Death Harry"). You're basically reading an original character at that point, but what makes it different from a true OC is that the character is still drawing on your emotional attachment and investment created by the source material.

*TL;DR:* You're reading fanfiction, not original published fiction. You go in wanting a familiar setting, relationships, magic, worldbuilding, and above all, familiar characters.

*** I'd lean heavily towards the stigma myself.

We've seen too many OCs done poorly.

** Yes! Same! I think it just irks me to read an unfamiliar name as a main character, in fanfiction. Takes me out of the comfort zone, maybe? That, and the few instances of OC that I've read were mostly Mary Sue's and/or author inserts, so that might've made me a bit cautious.

**** Yeah, cannon characters can definitely also be annoyingly Mary Suey, I know what you mean. I've thought about this some more - there was a fic I read recently that had Dorea Potter surviving and entering Harry's life, and her doctor was an OC, I think. It didn't bother me to have him as an OC, as he wasn't established as a main character - he had more screen time until Dorea was up and well, but gradually disappeared after that. There was another fic that was an alternate-universe-travel, that has Harry meeting this great-looking, witty OC, and that made me groan until it was revealed that she was actually undercover Tonks. I was relieved, that gave the character an actual motives & background story.

I think part of what makes cannon characters being OCs better than having actual OCs is that with those, even if their character isn't well rounded in the story, we have sort of a collective-fannon-characterisation running in the background that we can fill in the blanks with.

** These days I actually prefer true OCs over expanded minor canon characters, because I get bored of the general fanon characterization of them. I'd rather read about a completely original character than another fic about Daphne “Ice Queen” Greengrass. (I've read some that I enjoyed, but I'm bored of it.)

That being said, whether it's a OC or an expanded minor character (or any other character) I don't like mary sues or self inserts. And if it's just a passing mention of a character I prefer canon characters, because if it's a new character it tends to pull me out of the story for a moment as I try to figure out who someone is supposed to be.

** there's an authorial tendency for OC's to lean towards the Mary Sue end of the spectrum. Not necessarily their fault, as OC's are usually introduced into the story for a reason - that reason just usually isn't very good.

** I hate/avoid bad writing. I mostly don't mind fleshed out OCs that are background characters, but I've read very very few well written OCs that are also main characters. I also mostly read slash, which has a lower prevalence of outright OCs than other genres, I think.

** OCs are often self insert.It's disturbing if they ship with Canon characters.

** A lot of writers over do it with their OC. The OC becomes the MC, steals all the best action, solves all the puzzles, gets the girl/boy, next coming of Merlin.

If you are gonna make an OC you gotta find a balance between them being involved in the plot and not taking it over. Which I gotta say I haven't seen a lot of.

** Because 99% of OC fics are thinly/badly veiled/hidden self-insert, ofte Mary sue (and it's almost *always* a Mary, not a Marty) fics.

I likewise also avoid fics where minor characters are expanded upon insucg a way they're just self-insert. I also avoid fics where major characters are just self-insert expys.

Oh, Harry, with his long silky raven hair, full lips, curves and feminine body men mistake for a woman's from behind. Nope!
