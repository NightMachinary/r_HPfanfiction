I don't know if anyone is going to recognize this fic from the tiny bit I remember, especially since I can't even remember who the main character was or what the main pairing was... the only thing I remember was this one scene after the war. All of the Death Eaters were on trial, and Lucius is condemned to loose his magic. As his last act as a wizard, he transfigures something (I think his cane?) into a rose or some flowers and gives them to Narcissa. And I remember that he was actually a fairly decent guy in the fic, and he and Narcissa stayed married even after he lost his magic. (But all that was a side plot)


** Hmm...by any chance, is this an alternate-dimension fic where Tom Riddle is headmaster of Hogwarts, and Dumbledore is the leader of a villainous organization called the Burners?

The destroying magic thing just rings a bell. The concept kind of disturbs me, but yeah.

Of course, now I'm curious? Was that fic actually any good?

**** Meh, I haven't read it for ages. I don't remember if it was any good. The writing was of acceptable quality, at least.
