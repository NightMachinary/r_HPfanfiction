** I've started a full reread of linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series, in order to proofread it. My first impression of the premise, before I read it, was that it would just be a gender-swapped Harry but otherwise pretty similar to canon. In fact, it's a highly original storyline, just (skilfully) weaving in some canon elements here and there, but reinventing them.

It has a really interesting balance of Harry being both better off and worse. She has both her parents alive, along with Sirius and Remus (and Peter, albeit estranged), and she readily makes friends from all four Houses. She's passionate and talented enough in Potions that she wins Professor Snape's grudging respect (which is her major goal at Hogwarts). But she faces things that canon!Harry didn't, from a plague that spreads through the youngest students, sending them all into magical comas, to a madman locking her in an underground prison and trying to steal her magic. Her friendships are strained by the identity ruse; even though people don't know what she's hiding, her friends can tell she's keeping /something/ from them. And apprenticing under Professor Snape might well give him the tools to work out who she really is.

Book four just finished, book 5 is starting in the next few months.

** 1. “Percy's Diary by bionsena” linkffn(7542632) ... Somebody suggested it here in some previous thread, and I jumped to it (good Percy story is precious and rare). I really like it, idea is nice, execution is not bad (NO SPOILERS), but I have two small problems with it. First is the length: this has enough juice for like ten or so chapters, currently we are on chapter 39 and it is just 1992. Way, way, too much. The second is that I would actually prefer to get rid off all those commentaries by Weasley family and let the diary just stand on its own. In this version it feels to some extent like those dreaded heroes-read-books stories (except the main text is original) and Weasley comments resembles most of all the most evil creation in the history of humankind, the laugh track. We don't need reminders all the time how great the author is and how clever thing he just wrote in the main text. The diary itself is pretty good and it can stand on its own. Just remove the Weasley track completely and it will be better.

2. “The Poor of God by kilara25” linkffn(3744964) is on its face just another Severitus, but it has elements which make it substantially above average. First of all, it is *brief*. The author had an idea, wrote it down and he didn't drag the thing forever. It is so rare in the fanfiction world, that it deserves special recognition. Second, the sentimental fluff was cut to the decent amount. Snape recognizes his bad ways, apologies, but there is no crying, declaring the deepest love, etc. In the end Snape cares about Harry just little bit more than a decent human being cares for any child, but it is not overly sentimental. Then there is very interesting Luna: perhaps slightly less crazy than the average (and what would be canonical), but her story arc is original and interesting. And on the top of that Snape/Luna is a relationship I have never met anywhere else, and surprisingly Luna is the only woman who I could imagine to be in the seriously non-standard relationship (given the age difference). Recommended.

** If anyone is looking for something fun, light, and heartwarming, I am reading the in-process story Music is Magic by VulcanRavenClaw on A03. I found it last week thanks to the What are you writing thread? It focuses on the Weasley fam, mostly Charlie and Ron, and it is a treasure. The relationships are very well done. AND, the author has paired each chapter with a spotify playlist that made for some great road trip tunes for me last week. It's a much needed break from the heavier stories I've been reading.

** I am reading eldritcher's *Minerva Quartet* this week. It's about Minerva McGonagall and her relationships to Albus Dumbledore, Mad-Eye Moody, Tom Riddle and Harry Potter. Complex, intricate story telling.

[[https://eldritcher-hp-fics.dreamwidth.org/13101.html][*Thy Kingdom Come*]] In this story Minerva starts falling in love with Dumbledore. She is made aware of the Cold War between Riddle and Dumbledore. I really liked how young Minerva sees these two characters.

[[https://eldritcher-hp-fics.dreamwidth.org/13541.html#cutid1][*I, Alastor*]] Mad-Eye is in love with Minerva but he knows that she's in love with Dumbledore. This was maybe the fic I had difficulty reading. Moody isn't a sympathetic character.

[[https://eldritcher-hp-fics.dreamwidth.org/13597.html][*How do you like your blue-eyed boys?*]] Voldemort is dead. Minerva is now trying to rebuild. This is my fav. There's a lot of stuff here that shouldn't work but somehow does. Angsty!

[[https://eldritcher-hp-fics.dreamwidth.org/14045.html#cutid1][*O Gentle Faustus*]] Minerva leaves Hogwarts and Dumbledore's legacy behind her. So if anyone asked me what my headcanon of Minerva right now is I'm gonna point them to this! Angsty!

*What I liked*: The characters come alive in full flesh and blood. I don't read het in fanfic usually but I am pretty sure I'll go back to read this again. *What I didn't like*: A lot of English literature references that breaks my reading because I don't understand it.\\
*neutral*: The fics are in first person. I don't read first person stuff usually but it worked for these fics.

** I technically just finished it, but since I haven't started reading anything else since I'm counting it.

Holly Potter and the Midlife Crisis.

It's a marvel crossover (and very much weighted in favour of the Marvel elements of the setting) which normally would switch me off (egad, I find all that nonsense incredibly boring) but something grabbed me and kept me reading in spite of the superhero veneer. It's a really interesting, PTSD-ridden take on a post-war Potter with some fun, fleshed out setting-design and worldbuilding that I thought integrated the Marvel stuff quite well. Some fun later plot points and developments and an ending that both makes sense and wasn't eminently predictable. The characterwork and interactions were pretty nice.

I don't really know how to describe the writing, other than "It's very fanfic", but it worked pretty well.

They do censor 'god' for some reason (G-d) as well.

There are other sects of Judism that do this as well, with similar reasons. It allows an author the ability to show the purpose behind the word, without compromising their personal religious ethics.

** First I have to mention Loose Canon by Manatee-vs-Walrus, because I literally just finished reading the new chapter. There is a new one posted every Wednesday, so it's easy to remember to recommend it here. As I type this, the story has 107 posted chapters, just barely over 900k words. The story is very well written, extremely pleasant, wonderfully emotional, delightfully fluffy, and often quite funny. What other story would have you happily spend an hour reading about Harry getting ready to host a drag party? Gotta give it a 1/1, every time.

linkffn(13452914)

I reread Cauterize, a story about Dennis Creevey picking up his brother's camera after the war. When I first read that story I wrote in a review about how it was so good that it would have more reviews than words eventually, and I was delighted to see that it now does! I don't want to say much about it other than that it is sad, but very, very good. At under 2k words it'll only take a moment to get through, so if you haven't read it yet dive in. Probably the best one shot in the fandom, though if anyone has any competitors I'm all ears! 1/1.

linkffn(4152700)

Then I started but did not finish The Archaeologist by Racke. The writing style is all about telling, with only a little showing, but truthfully that doesn't usually put me off on its own. It's a cross dimensional thing where an adult (like 35-45 year old) Harry takes over the dead body of his twin sister from an alternate dimension and then sets off to live a free life in the new dimension. After a bit, in order to avoid having a period he performed a ritual that destroyed his new body's ovaries and uterus, which I just thought was a) handled too flippantly by the author, b) medically unsound (ovaries are actually quite important organs; they aren't just about babies and periods!), and c) desecrating the corpse of his sort-of-sister to avoid passing discomfort. I feel like stories I've read like Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool handled this whole gender swap/body snatching thing a lot more gracefully and respectfully. I read a few more chapters after that scene, but I kept thinking about it, and in the end it made me less forgiving of the story's other flaws than I might otherwise have been. Like the bit where Harry described a bunch of different students' midterm papers...one after another...just describing essays like this is something people would want to read...as if it wasn't boring at all. I can see why people would like the story and want to read it, but it just got under my skin a few too many times, so I have to say 0/1.

linkffn(13318951)

Then I read the Rachel Snow series (only 1.5 books exist now, but the updates seem regular) by Welfycat. This is about a fem!Harry who is (at the start of the story) mute as a result of past abuse at the hands of her relatives (no direct details as of yet, but lots of very upsetting implications, so if you are sensitive to that don't read this one). It's a really well thought out AU around this premise, and in my opinion it's really mature in its approach to mental disorders and the treatment thereof. I actually really enjoy all of the scenes where Rachel is in therapy and found myself looking forward to them. I get the feeling that the author has a lot of knowledge about that process, either as a treatment professional/student or as someone who has received treatment like this in the past (or maybe just a very thorough person who did a lot of research). Again, if you don't want to read things about child abuse (not directly depicted on screen, but implied, and probably at some point they will be described by the protagonist) don't read this, but I thought it was a good read, even if it was extremely difficult to get through some parts. Also, for reasons not related to the story the author changed the Potter name to Snow, so Lily Evans became Lily Snow when she married James Snow, and their only child is Rachel Snow, the girl-who-lived. A bit odd, but it isn't like good fics grow on trees, so one must endeavor not to sweat the small stuff. 1/1.

linkao3(25917352)

Finally, I'm currently reading a crossover with the Percy Jackson books called Serpents and Celestial Bronze by Levity_Lirium. It's interesting enough, but I've never read Percy Jackson and I get the feeling that I'm missing a lot. I know a fair bit of greek mythology and have played the pen and paper RPG Scion a bit, but I think that only takes you so far since the PJ universe seems to have built up quite a lot on that foundation. I keep feeling like people are introduced that I'm supposed to know, and maybe things would be more meaningful if I did. Kinda like if the only Star Wars movie you had ever seen was Rogue One. You'd have no idea what's going on because the movie assumes you have a fairly high level of familiarity with the events of Episode 4. I don't think I'll finish it, but I also don't want to give it a 0/1 since I think it's fairly well written, and it has a pretty inventive plot involving Harry transforming into a Gorgon after the basilisk encounter. If you know Percy Jackson, then 1/1, otherwise enter at your own risk.

linkao3(9467660)

EDIT: I clicked post, and then looked at my phone and saw that a new book in the Perfectly Normal series by BrilliantLady is going to come out, starting on February ninth! If you don't know the series, you should check it out for sure. The first entry is a little stilted, but also very short. The later works are delightful, full of great world building, a realistically smart Harry, and a truly delightful pet snake. I'll be rereading that series now to jog my memory, and look forward to recommending the new book every week in these posts for the next few months.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

*** Similarly agree on The Archeologist. The telling, not showing makes it feel dull. I've enjoyed some of Racke's works, but their oneshots are much more fun to read than this foray into long fic. Racke also has some strong opinions about not taking criticism, no doubt at least influenced by people calling them out for the constant telling. Later on there's a bunch of expies from various other works, which is incredibly jarring. It already disrupts the fic a lot by having a differently named character who is obviously a character from another work, but then making them the same name will constantly remind you that they're an expy. I also greatly dislike that the fic on FFN is a hidden Bloodborne cross. Nothing wrong about being a cross, but it's deceptive to not put it in the crossover category and to not mention it at all in the description.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

** linkffn(Lady Archimedes)

I got through The Arithmancer, but I simply can't stand the mugglewank in this series. Hermione is too OP and it just isn't fun anymore. Ron is also bashed entirely too much, to the point where he's just a side character. Forcing canon events is also not pretty (looking at you, book 5). There's some genuinely new stuff in this but Hermione being able to figure out everything, being "just friends" with Harry and having to deal with the terrible Weasley Twins dialogue and wank is too much.

Edit: dang OCD finishing it anyway

  Sequel to The Arithmancer. Years 5-7. Armed with a N.E.W.T. in Arithmancy after Voldemort's return, Hermione takes spellcrafting to new heights and must push the bounds of magic itself to help Harry defeat his enemy once and for all.

Is a Drarry fan fiction and is currently being revised. IT IS SO FUXKING GOOD! LIKE I CAN FEEL HARRY'S ROLLER COSTER OF EMOTIONS AND IT IS VERY INTENSE IN REGARDS TO FEELINGS.

Is very painful lol

I literally feel like this version of Harry and Draco is just /chef kiss/ & don't even get me started on Pansy❤

I believe they're 7 chapter revised and THE WRITING IS INCREDIBLE! THIS AIN'T NO SHITTY WRITING.

Y'all should really look into it.
