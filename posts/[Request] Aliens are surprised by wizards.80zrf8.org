I'm looking for a story where aliens come to earth (probably to invade) and are surprised by wizards. Story can be set at any time with any main characters. I'm okay with crossovers of any kind and stories that just use the HP world but have original characters (as long as they're well written).


** linkffn(8643565) has Liara T'Soni stumble across Harry and kinda adopt him. Sadly abandoned.

linkffn(10839027) is a Harry/Luna crack story where they go through the veil and wind up in Omega. Luna is a sex-maniac and the reactions she causes are comedy gold.

  When the true nature of the Veil of Death is finally discovered, Harry and Luna embark on a journey unlike anything they could have possibly imagined. An authorized reimagining of Lightning among the Stars. "f*ck this is good! and fun! I don't want to read the story this is based on because nothing shall distract me from this!" - papiliokaze

** There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/1/Harry-Tano][Harry Tano]]? Ahsoka Tano escapes the slaughter at the end of the Clone Wars and accidentally ends up on Earth from a long-range teleportation.

After adopting Harry, she eventually sets about helping to destroy Voldemort, introducing advanced technology to Earth, et-cetera. It's an interesting read, it definitely doesn't retread canon too much.

Yet somehow Harry has met Lupin and the Weasleys not 5 chapters in.
