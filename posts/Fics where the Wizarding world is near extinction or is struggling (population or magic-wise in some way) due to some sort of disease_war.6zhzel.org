So a friend of mine posted a prompt on a private board we occasionally use about a world where Harry Potter is one of the last remaining male wizards, as the male population was ravaged by dragon-pox and nearly all died (think black plague style disaster). As such witches now control the wizarding world to a large degree, and Harry Potters role has changed from savior from Voldemort, into a savior of the Wizarding world from extinction.

There were obvious holes in the general plot the prompt was pushing but it was a very intriguing premise and got me thinking. Are there any stories out there like that? Where Harry is one of the last remaining wizards due to war or disease and women control the wizarding world? It would be an interesting flip on the typical premise that Wizarding society is heavily male dominated and oriented.

So I am posting out of curiosity as to if there are any stories like the above described, or similar stories that deal with the Wizarding world near extinct or at least struggling because of a die off of some sort (of people or magic itself)?

I don't care about the rating although M+ is more enjoyable to me. I don't care about the pairings or style of pairing, except I would prefer no main character slash. Preferably complete but if its a good read its a good read. Thanks all! Oh and feel free to utilize the prompt or ideas in here to write something. Neither of us has time to write beyond 1 shots if we also want to read fan fics, even though we wish we could.


** linkffn(8629685) in the firebird trillogy much fewer wizard are born and all magical children of muggles(muggleborns and halfbloods) are female and the number of wizards keeps declining. So the society is controlled by witches and wizards are obligated to bond(magical marriage where the males give up a part of their magic) with at least two witches. Voldemorts cause is also a lot more symphatic even though, he is still very evil.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

*** I started this a while back and had high hopes, and then it just bombed in my opinion. But yes it is similar to the prompt/premise my friend posted up.

It's too bad there are not more fics that explore ideas like this.

  I was reading a story of the non-magicals deciding they weren't going to take it anymore - just exactly too late to really help. It fit a bunny that I had long considered. This is the start of a crossover - but I didn't write beyond this point. Anyone who wants to write a story based on this is welcome. This is done for my part.
