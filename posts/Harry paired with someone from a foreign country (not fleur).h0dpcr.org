A fact that always bugs me about canon is that during the fourth book harry doesn't really socialize with anybody from the two foreign schools. It would add a lot of depth to the story to explore the others cultures and differences in their respective wizarding countries. It would also be nice to see how it would affect harry.


** Unfortunately I don't have a rec but I would've loved to read him paired with a Rosier or a Lestrange. Both families are originally from France and fourth year is actually a pretty good set up and provides a lot of conflict.

*** But you can also make an OC character because we know barely anything about the people that came with those schools. I think it is a very good idea.

**** I didn't quite get what you mean by that. Do you mean it's better to make a character away from canon families?

** I am writing one, but it involves time travel(early Marauders era), and it's Fleur's aunt or Bellatrix, still haven't decided that.

But one of the things is exploring other cultures(he kind of travels around a lot), sadly, unlike my other favored authors(Tolkien, Martin, Gaiman, and Riordan) JKR did as little worldbuilding as she needed to do, so I am still worldbuilding it to make the cultures more diverse than regular(British but speaking other language and bluer) quite a bit of work, but enjoyable and working from home helps a lot.

As for a rec linkffn(13140418) has Harry with an east European girl(and Fleur and maybe Daphne) with a quite culture shock.

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the International Tri-Wizard Tournament) His Yule date is a Bulgarian OC. However, Fleur and Daphne are apparently love interests also, due to how aggressive Pavlova's family got.

There was some neat magic ritual stuff, and general world building in that one.

#+begin_quote
  Fic is crossposted from FFN, it is still being written and future updates will be added here too. A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. Story contains more detailed magic, politics, and more; it is a story of growth and and maturation. Harry is het and it may or may not be a multi fic.

** Only one of these is a Tournament year story, but you may like them anyway:

linkffn(Playmate by Yunaine). Gabrielle invokes a veela bond at the second task. It's not a good thing.

Harry Potter and the Transfer Student by Enterprise 1701-d is one of my favorites. The author removed it to make it into a standalone novel, but you can still find it on [[https://archive.org][archive.org]] (although I won't directly link it). Made-up country (Kiria) with a stratified society with formalized social interactions.

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] by Jeconais. Gabrielle invokes a veela bond at the second task. It's not a good thing. Post-Hogwarts, she enlists help from Ron and Hermione. Site login may be required.

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Happily_Ever_After/index/][Happily Ever After]] by Jeconais. Gabrielle pairing. Site login may be required.

There's another one I remember, but can't come up with the title. Harry leaves the British Wizarding World after winning, because they turn on him because of his power level. He has a deal that they'll leave him alone. He marries a native American woman, and his bosses eventually send him (against his wishes) back to England. When his daughter turns eleven, Auror Ron and Professor Hermione show up to kidnap her, because Wizarding Britain no longer allows magical children to stay in muggle homes, Harry's magical signature is warded, and his wife isn't a wand-type magic user.
