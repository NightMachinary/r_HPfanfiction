My brother has just dipped his toes into the fanfiction universe so he's a bit wary of AU and any ships other than HarryxGinny. I don't read a lot of that ship so I have nothing to recommend to him. He's read The First Day by LittleBird and loved it. Anyone have anything similar?


** *A Canon's Harpy*, linkffn(7768541)

*Children's Crusade*, linkffn(6989327), is interesting because it's dimensional travel and yet epilogue compliant. [[/spoiler][Basically, a Hermione from an alternate dimension asked the Trio+Ginny to defeat Voldemort one more time]] The story is quite emotional and the writing is great.

*In Case of Emergency*, linkffn(4625848), is an almost canon-compliant (Fred didn't die) smut fic with a plot.

*Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126), is Northumbrian's best postwar story.

** If you're trying to find a good example of a well written story, something that would endear him to the fandom, you're not likely to find it by searching harry/ginny. That being said, this is exactly the situation that got me into HPFF to begin with like years, so I can empathize.

I remember this being one of the stories I read ages ago, and there's a sequel. I remember liking it back then, but I cannot attest to it's quality: linkffn(5231591) - there's also a sequel

Something I can testify to of the quality is the often overlooked Death-gate trilogy. I reread it recently and it is still quite good. It starts with linkffn(2567446)

And, lastly, for something to read before you get jaded by the fandom as a whole, there is the Hero Trilogy, starting with linkffn(3994212). Harry literally travels to the end of the world and beyond to have his happy ending with Ginny.

  The Hog's Head is an unabashed romance that follows the lives of Harry and Ginny from the Battle of Hogwarts through the following year. Chapter One, "Faith," begins during the Battle as Lord Voldemort calls his truce. It follows canon precisely but from Ginny's point of view. My own plot, post-DH, begins with Chapter Two, "Anticipation."
