:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So this fic might have been taken down but it was one of my favorites. I was wondering if anyone here had it saved or knew where I could read it as i have forgoten the name too this might be a hard request... So it's basicly the myth of how Hades kidnaps persephone from a field to become his wife except Harry is persephone and Voldemort is Hades. Also James is Zeus in this one and very much a bad dad.

** Sounds like ObsidianPen. I can't recall the title but I know the one you're talking about. She writes beautiful, haunting stories, but seems to take them down on occasion and re-write them. Hopefully someone has a saved copy elsewhere.
