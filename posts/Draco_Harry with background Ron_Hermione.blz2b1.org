Or any good drarry fics?? I always see this pairing mentioned when the size and scope of the Harry Potter fan fiction community is mentioned, but I have yet to find anything I enjoyed reading. I'm super picky so gimmie ur best stuff. Also big bonus for good background Ron/hermione! Thanks!


** A few of my favorites of drarry. I'll admit sheepishly to not being a huge fan of Hermione so none of these have Ron/Hermione. Drarry is HUGE though so honestly you'd just need to search the pairing to find a bunch.

And if you don't like bottom!Draco, ignore every single one of these.

  Life after war is nothing like Draco expected. He only hopes he'll survive it. Especially when his friends are less than sympathetic.

**** The Devil's White Night is one that I read over and over. I love that they use Indian Harry and how they do the whole AU. ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ Harry going into an AU where his parents are alive is my favorite but none of them ever get finished!! If I come across any more I can remember I'll give them to you since you liked it!!
