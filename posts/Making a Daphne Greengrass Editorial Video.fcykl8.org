I'm working on a YouTube vid breaking down the little canon information we have about her and talking about how her essentially none-existent character became so popular through FanFiction. Points brought up are the Melting Ice Queen story trope, the wish fulfilment of male readers, the Romeo and Juliet angle of her and Harry and why Tsundere characters are so popular in Eastern media.

The script is about 3k words so far (6 pages!) and I have a handful of commissioned artwork of her and Tracey Davis being produced along with it. Progress is going well, if not a little slow, because it's one of a few videos I'm working on. Can see the final product ending up 5k. This reddit is referenced a handful of times, including last years favourite ship poll results and even a few commenters specifically (with due credit given of course).

Are there anything requests or suggestions of things I should add? A particular fanfic thats significant to you, or if there's anyone who knows relevant material they feel should be included? Looking for both personal experiences and landmarks of the characters surge of popularity. Chances are I've already covered it (my research has been fairly extensive) but if anything that will just give me ease of mind that I'm on the right track :)

I'll provide the link when done and completed so by all means bookmark/save this page if you're interested, though I'll probably give the video it's own post as well!

** Some comparison to fanon Draco. Drarry is, I think, still the most popular overall ship despite Draco remaining a complete shit to the end in canon. While it's true that we get a lot more detail about Draco than Daphne in canon, nearly all of it is immediately disposed of in favor of other fanfic when Draco shows up in fic.

** Hello, I was wondering how your project was progressing. If you still have the time to read through fanfictions for the depiction of Daphne Greengrass I would recommend linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House) starting from chapter 3. I think the author depicts really well how being friends with Tracey helped her and her family, in general, aren't complete fanatics of blood purity but she still shows some casual blood purism initially. The first year also shows some moments where her 'Ice Queen Mask' falls before she remembers to 'put it back'. I hope you are doing well in these times and can't wait for your video.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
