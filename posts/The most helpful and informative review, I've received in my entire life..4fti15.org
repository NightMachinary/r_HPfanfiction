That was all one reviewer left to me a couple days ago on a review. A period mark. Probably a mistake, but still...

There's also the one reviewer that gives the same exact review every chapter. "Great chapter and story. Please update soon." I call it copypasta reviews, but at least it is good...? There's a few reviewers who do that. Granted, they probably do it on other stories too...
