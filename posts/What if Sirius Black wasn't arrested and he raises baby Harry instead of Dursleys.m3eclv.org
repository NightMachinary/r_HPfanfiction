In an alternate time line where Peter hadn't betrayed the marauders and Sirius wasn't sent to Azkaban. After death of James and Lily, Sirius raised baby Harry and later told him of his wizard heritage and how his parents died. Sirius then becomes the closest thing to parents Harry had. He also raised him like a Chad how his father once was. He also tells Harry to look out for Snape the potions master in Hogwarts and tells him a tip to just call him Snivellus if Snape threatens him. Then Chad Harry on his 1st potions class when Snape scolds him for writing notes, say like, "OK... Snivellus". Imagine that look on Snape's face. I mean throughout the story Harry gets the same personality as James in his hogwarts years.
