These fics are frequently my favourite - where someone, anyone, puts their foot down and removes Harry from Privet Drive.

Well-written, reasonable length and not fussed about the rating!


** Harry McGonagall linkffn(3160475)

  Professor McGonagall has watched the Dursleys all day and can see what sort of people they are. When Dumbledore leaves Harry on their doorstep and disappears, she takes him away. HHr

#+begin_quote
  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.

** linkao3(Percy Take the Wheel)

It takes a bit for Harry to show up, but he basically gets adopted by the weasley's. There are some great moments between Harry and the Weasley family, even if it is not the main focus. It is one of my favorites!

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

  What if McGonagall had delivered the letter from the start as she had done for every other muggle-raised child? Why wouldn't she have wanted to check up on Harry when she loathed the Dursley's from day one? What would change when Harry has a new legal and competent guardian? Slytherin Harry. No godmoding. No Time travel. Might update 2021.
