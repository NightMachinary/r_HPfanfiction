** So this isn't fanfiction at all but one time I tried to read a book called Seatrain or something, and the author replaced the word "and" with the & symbol. I don't know whether it lasted past the first chapter, because I couldn't get past the first chapter. It was just too jarring.

So yeah, never do that. I don't care if it was published. Never do that.

*** That's weird! I can see it if it were in the context of a name like "Barnum & Bailey" where that's how it was actually presented, but just to use the symbol instead of the word in straight prose seems unprofessional. I think there's also a rule on numbers--when to use the word "eleven" vs "11". I'll have to look that up.

** Here are some of my more recent nitpicks/causes for rage quitting fics.

- Anything told in first-person narrative.

- Misspellings of character names or House names.

- When there are large chunks of text taken directly from the books (even when the author indicates it as such). Like yes, I remember these four pages of text, you did not need to copy-paste/transcribe them here.

- Super long author's notes especially on ffn when it is included in the body of the chapter and artificially inflates word count.

- Lately, I've read lots of fics that criticize Hermione for basically just reciting things from books without thinking for herself and I'm not sure I like that. It's been a while since I've read the books but I never got the impression that Hermione's intelligence was more like rote memorization.

** Bad grammar and some style. Can't describe the feeling well but there is a style of writing that stops me right there. I think it's when description are repetitive? No variation and short description. Really hard to explain.

When Harry (or anyone really but mostly him) lets himself get ridiculously bullied without any fucking resistance (same if there are some clearly obvious bullying or crime done and everyone just ignores it). I hate weak, crybaby, useless Harry. A bit on the shy side, not a braggart rebel ok but guh... just grow some.

Harem that are badly done (and it's clear the author couldn't chose one girl so he gave him all). There are harem fics which I liked but sometime it's clear it was just indecision.

American English words. English isn't my mother tongue so I miss some but when I see them I get irked to no end. HP is so bloody British that seeing American term bothers me... unreasonably so.

No it wouldn't. This is usually preluded by an awesome display of how great he is.

** Mugglewanking.

The vast majority of fanfics I read go as "Wizarding world backwards, muggles have uber technology wah wah!" And then try and justify this shit using things such as the usage of quills, parchment, robes, owl post. I personally think that Rowling included the quills and parchment for immersion and world building reasons - just to ensure that the new world is quite different from the other one.

Whenever I read a fic where the author goes on like this, I deduct points for lack of imagination. There are very few fics that avoid this trope.

*** To be fair, at least for the quill thing, it's actually shown to be inconvenient, isn't it? Dipping for ink every few words, ink splotches, etc.

I like to think that even the most basic magical quill is enchanted so that it's an amazing writing instrument, that they make a $1000 muggle fountain pen seem like a dried up Bic.

Are you talking about quills in real life or in the series?

If it's the real life case, then you should know that even ball point pens aren't free of ink splotches, let alone fountain pens. The cheaper ones will be bad whereas the more expensive ones are a joy to write with.

In the series, there are quite a few different kinds of quills, from the regular one to something like a Quick Quotes one that Rita Skeeter uses. I also remember students writing their OWL exams have to write them using quills that are spelled to be anti-cheating or something similar.

***** The point I'm making is that the average quill, the ones used by students, seems to be a genuine old fashioned sharpened feather. In other words, an absolutely shitty writing instrument.

The reason why people make fun of this is because it's laughable. I'd prefer to use even the cheapest pen that has been cracked and taped back together. So I like to ignore canon in this case, and keep the head canon that generic magical quills are, to use your words, a joy to write with.

The average quill is enchanted to pull ink directly from a nearby source, writes buttery smooth with complete consistency, alleviates hand strain, dries the ink instantly, etc.

Does canon actually say this anywhere? I can't recall. Also, you have to note that canon is basically HP's view on things, and canon HP is quite obtuse, as far as characters go. Pureblood or halfblood students probably do use the other kinds of quills, but canon HP probably never noticed.

In a 2500 word scene, the phrases "Harry's spectacles" was used no less than a 117 times. This and a scene that's overly descriptive for no reason.
