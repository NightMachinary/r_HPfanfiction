I'm talking about the FFN app, which lets you filter results based on specific preferences. I think AO3 has a similar mechanism in tags. How do you avoid the sheer number of cliches?

For example, my typical search is:

Published: <1 month ago

Sort by: Reviews

Search bar: -bashing -OOC -OC -betrayed -dark -grey -manipulative

Just my preferences. What are yours?


** Also remove as many alternate universe tags as I can think of. Regency, coffee shop, no magic, highschool. Fuck me the amount of original fictions but we stole the names.

** Sort by - update date, words - 100k+, and filter out Snape and Malfoy. Or Snape and Hermione.

*** I guess we are of the same mind. I filter out Snape and Malfoy as well. Or Malfoy and Tom.

** In AO3:

- Include Harry Potter as a character.

- Exclude pairings: all pairings involving Snape/Main Character. I used to exclude Snape as a character but people sometimes tag EVERYONE who appears and it narrows down the final list way too much.

- Exclude pairings: Harry/Draco, Harry/Hermione, Hermione/Ron, Hermione/Draco.

- Exclude tags: Modern, fluff, angst, drabble, and the many AU tags like coffee shop, soulmates, etc.

- Length: More than 10,000 if in the mood for something short, more than 100,000 otherwise.

- English language.

** so i sort by Date Published and then go to the last page, <5000, English, search term for something really specific, and then usually something really funny shows up, which is also a sign of the era. Fanatical Fics and Where to Find Them podcast has got me hooked on this weird old type of fanfic.

** Sort by update, words 20-40,000, English, I rarely use the genre tags but when I do it's usually Humor and/or Adventure.
