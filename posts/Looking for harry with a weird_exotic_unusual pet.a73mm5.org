  Years after That Kiss, Potter (and his new pet snake) appears again, this time as Hogwarts's Quidditch and Muggle Games instructor (what are Muggle Games anyway? Is this why Potter is swimming in the Great Lake wearing such a tiny pair of pants?), disrupting Draco's peaceful life as Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. It's bad enough dealing with one exuberant Gryffindor (Charlie Weasley as Care of Magical Creatures professor) on the faculty, and what's all the gossip about Potter courting Draco?

** Currently reading Harry Potter & the Soulmate Bond by Keira Marcos ([[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][link]]) in which Harry is a Parseltongue and thus keeps several snakes. There are vipers, runespoors, ashwinders, etc. No llamas unfortunately lol. Definitely trope-y and H/Hr, so avoid if you're not into that

** There is this one big long fic he keeps an Owl as a pet or something. Like no one told him proper wizard pets are black cats. Or mini-unicorns. Or enslaved servant elves. It was very weird...
