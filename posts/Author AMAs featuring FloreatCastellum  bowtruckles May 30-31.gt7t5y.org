*** My first fanfic account was made when I was... probably about 10? I used it until I was about 15. The stories still unfortunately exist out there in the internet. The less said about them the better.

I wrote because not all the books were out yet and I was desperate for more Potter. I think previously I had written little child stories, usually about horses because I loved Black Beauty and other horse books.

Then I stopped writing for a few years and picked it up again at the end of uni, but didn't actually really write anything properly until Not From Others, which I started around the time my mum was first diagnosed with cancer. It was a nice emotional release and something to write on the long train journey to go visit her.

*** I started writing fanfic when I was 12, not realizing that it was a thing other people did until I went on the internet, lol (I'm going to decline to say what fandom, but it wasn't HP). I wrote some original stories too through high school and college, but I think they're lost forever. I doubt they were any good.

But for HP specifically, I have Cursed Child to blame! I read the play when it came out, and immediately wanted to reread the series after that, which I hadn't done for years. After that, I just needed more of it and too many ideas were playing out in my head for me to not start writing them down.

The Romione fandom was so welcoming to me when I first started posting fic in 2017 which I'm so grateful for! So encouraging. I feel fortunate that nobody's been critical or discouraging since them.

*** I love writing Harry so much. ❤ He's my boy.

I don't really know why, but he speaks so clearly to me and feels really natural to write. He has the perfect balance of having some serious issues that can create some emotionally powerful moments, but also being reserved and resilient enough that I don't feel I'm having to write paragraphs of soppy angst with him sobbing and spiralling in despair. I also love his sense of humour and that can be savagely satisfying to write.

I don't like writing Luna. People ask me to write Luna all the time because she's very much a favourite character, but honestly I find her really boring to write. Don't get me wrong, I do like her as a character - I named my dog after her - but I actually find her quite flat. Her character can be summed up as "weird but in a nice, non-threatening way", and she just doesn't really seem to show much emotion in general. She's purely a device to help Harry's development and has none of her own. While I do like to flesh out characters and develop them myself, I just really can't be arsed with this girl. I also have a conspiracy theorist in my family and I find him exhausting too, so that may be part of it.

*** I love writing Ron. I relate to him the most of any of the characters in the series and it feels very natural to get inside his head. Ginny is fun too!

There's no characters that I particularly dislike writing, though some are more difficult than others - for example, I have to be in just the right headspace to write the twins. And some I'm just not particularly interested in writing, even if I like them as characters. Neville springs to mind, but even in stuff I write that takes place at Hogwarts, he's just... not really involved. Even though I think he's great!

** How do you plan your stories? I've been increasingly curious about this ever since I read a [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/perfecting-the-independent-harry-genre.38553/page-2][DLP post]] from Blorcyn about how he would write an independent!Harry story.

To quote:

#+begin_quote
  Pitch: When Harry thwarts Voldemort's return for the third time he realises that his life has a time-limit and he'll never be free to live outside Hogwarts until he ends the evil wizard, once and for all.

  Theme Premise: When a schoolboy who has been targeted by a terrorist organisation takes it into his own hands to hunt the terrorist leader down, he learns that no one man can change the world by himself.

  Narrative Principle: Harry seeks to defeat Voldemort actively across his remaining years at Hogwarts, squandering his resources along the way, until he learns his lesson and starts to build to his own strengths rather than challenge his enemy's.

  [...]

  Flaw: Harry thinks he can take on Voldemort by himself, because he's always reactively defended himself from Voldemort by himself.

  Psychological need: Harry needs to learn that what he can do as part of a group is greater than what he can do alone.

  Moral need: Harry needs to learn that being part of a group that cares about you means listening to other viewpoints.
#+end_quote

This way of thinking and planning was really interesting because it made explicit that which is generally subtext in my own planning, which historically is much more focused on /events/: how do I get the character from point A to point B. I have since tried to incorporate lessons from this planning approach though there is only a certain amount you can do that for a story which is already in progress.

Do you do anything like this? Fitting together character ideas like a puzzle, building your story around a kind of moral/thematic scaffold? Or is your process more organic? Or are you a "gardener" not an "architect" and you just put pen to paper and see where the story takes you?

*** I'm definitely more of a gardener - the one fic I planned in minuscule detail I found it a miserable experience and though it was well received it's not one I'm fond of. I usually have a clear idea of where I want them to end up and very often certain scenes I will plan out, and make sure to carefully drop in certain clues or foreshadowing, but I have more fun having a flexible approach so I stick to that nowadays.

*** More of a gardener for sure! Since I usually write one-shots, there isn't much planning involved - I just have a general idea of what I want to happen, the general theme, etc. For the multi-chapters I've done, I'll usually have a document containing the basic plot beats and maybe some dialogue that I want to be sure to include, but nothing as detailed or deep as what you shared. Underlying themes and character arcs are usually just all in my head. I'm always very impressed when people have very detailed, organized outlines, I'm too impulsive and impatient for that.

** I always find it interesting when people choose to pursue a single pairing. Have you ever found yourself tempted by a non-canon pairing? If so, what was so tempting about it?

Kind of related to this, how do you approach new story ideas?

When I think up ideas it's some story or situation that grabs my attention, and the pairings, if they exist, are chosen to further the themes of that story or situation. Do you start from the pairing instead, and then decide on a story that best shows off some specific aspect of their relationship? What is the hook that that grabs you when you think of a new story idea?

*** I do actually have a couple of non-canon pairings but they're for very minor characters and they're not... I don't feel that I'm changing anything in canon because they've been left relatively open ended. This is predominantly Scorbus and Deamus.

But no, generally I've never been tempted by AU. People kept telling me I would be but it's been years and I've not run out of canon stuff to explore and it's become sort of my niche now. I am mostly Harry/Ginny, but I've also written Ron/Hermione, George/Angelina, James/Lily, Percy/Audrey, and so on, and they all provide me with different dynamics to have fun with. Plus I have the next gen characters to have a bit more variety if I want.

In terms of the second question - for my long fics it's definitely plot based, although my writing is always fairly character based, so it's often a case of "how would Harry deal with ___?" and constructing the plot from there. For my one shots and shorter stories, it depends because so many of them I did based on prompts people gave me but it's usually because I want to explore a certain theme or moment that I think could pack an emotional punch/just be really fun to write. They tend to be very character based.

*** I'm not usually drawn to non-canon pairings that would break canon pairings, if that makes sense. Similar to Flo, I do like ones like Deamus and Scorbus where there isn't really canon evidence but it doesn't contradict canon. I haven't actually written any of them, lol, but never say never!

As far as approaching new story ideas... it really varies. 95% of what I write is for the same pairing so usually if I get a situation-based idea, I have to first ask myself if it even makes sense/suits the characters that I prefer to write about, because I don't want to force something that isn't true to them. Sometimes even if I like an idea, I have to admit to myself that it wouldn't work for Ron/Hermione and just let it go. But if it's a more character-based idea, then I'll try to let the scenario play out in my head. And if I can automatically come up with dialogue or lines, then it'll feel like something worth writing and usually that's when I'll open up an email draft on my phone and start furiously typing, haha.

*** Something I really love about Lemony Snicket's writing is how concisely he can say something really devastating or revealing. I'm very much a less is more kind of person, and I do try and emulate that to give my writing more punch. I think there's a temptation in writing, when you want to make characters suffer, to really go into a lot of detail about exactly what happened to them and exactly how they feel, when it's more interesting and engaging to let the reader infer.

I also love Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials - that level of writing is just... so beyond me, really beautiful. I had an excerpt from The Amber Spyglass as a wedding reading. Stunning narrative and a perfect example of a book that can weave in very adult themes into a child's perspective without the sort of dumbing down that you sometimes see in Rowling's writing.

*** I did surprise myself in really enjoying writing Snape when someone requested it, and wrote him a few more times after that. He's such an interesting character and while I would never describe myself as a Snape fan, I wouldn't describe myself as a Snape hater either. I enjoy the nuance and conflicting aspects of his character a lot, and there's so much you can do with acknowledging that the reader knows more about him than the character he's speaking to. It's also sometimes fun to indulge in his bitterness and angst.

My other controversial character I love to write is Hugo Granger Weasley. I deliberately write him as an obnoxious, rather difficult child. This was originally intended as a tribute to Adrian Mole but he ended up growing his own personality too, which is a perfect clash of Ron and Hermione's personalities, and possibly on the spectrum a little too as I took influence from things a family member did as a kid. Frankly I was bored with next gen kids that were all perfect and lovely and endlessly sweet, and I find him far more endearing as a more authentically annoying child. Some people love him and find him just as endearing and funny as I do but I get a lot of reviews absolutely appalled that I have written such an obnoxious child. That's ok by me, I completely understand why some people hate him and I don't expect people to get behind all my headcanons. He's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, just like kids like that in real life.

I've also really enjoyed writing Cormac McLaggen because he's just so smug and arrogant and it's fun to lean into that.

Are these characters controversial enough? I mostly just stick to the Weasleys and Harry, lol

Ron and Hermione don't get married until they're about 25, and then their pregnancy with Rose - completely unplanned - comes along a couple months later. This may be an unpopular opinion because Hermione does love to have control, but I think it's a great lesson for her that she can't micromanage every aspect of their lives.

Percy and Bill were the only Weasley kids to have “proper” (according to Molly) weddings. Everyone else eloped.

Unable to sell it, Draco has to live in Malfoy Manor for the rest of his life.

Hagrid lives FOREVER (or maybe not, but he lives a verrrrry long time). Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione visit him at Hogwarts and send him baby announcements and photos which decorate his hut.

  Hello there! I consider both of you very talented fanfiction writers, in terms of how in character your characters are, and how interesting the ideas behind your stories are; but beside that, I also consider your writing styles entertaining and able to convey feelings and emotions.

  So I wonder, how much do you feel your writing style has improved through the years? Did you actively work to improve your writing (like, reading articles about it, going to writing classes, asking for second opinions etc), or are you mostly self-taught? Which writing 'rules' you struggle the most to follow/you don't like, and which come more naturally?

*** I did do a writing class at the start of the year - sadly I never got to finish it because of Coronavirus, but it did lead me to write something original that will be published in a magazine this summer under my own name. I was also able to take techniques/methods from it to help me target areas I know I have a problem with - my over use of "said Harry excitedly", for example. I also got a lot out of analysing texts provided by the teacher and created by the other students - in general it was a lovely, supportive environment that I think really helped and I would like to do something similar again in the future when we're not all in lockdown. It also gave me a better grasp of rules that I think I understood at some level but had never really had set out for me so plainly before.

I think when I look back at NFO and Aurors I can see that I have improved, but I have to confess it was rarely from the criticism I received via reviews. In fact, there are elements of both stories I don't like but think I wrote trying to please specific reviewers, and I think a large part of my self improvement is that I've stopped trying to audience please as much. It's ok that I don't please people that wanted a super grimdark account of Hogwarts that year with militirisation and so on, because I'm never really going to be to that audience's taste anyway. I don't really care if fewer people read it, but I've found my audience has only grown as I've come into my own. It's a big part of the reason I drifted away from ff.net - to put it plainly, the audience was too massive and the nitpicking/entitlement from people who simply had different tastes to me was too much for my mental health.

The constructive criticism that has genuinely helped me has been from betas and community groups on discord, where it is usually more measured, well intentioned, and collaborative. I also think there's something to be said for developing an eye to reread your own stuff and being honest about it, thinking about the quality of the feedback (or the radio silence) and being self-aware enough to neither inflate your ego nor beat yourself up. Then... practice practice practice - I wrote an absolutely ridiculous amount last year. I feel like I was naturally going to get better through sheer intensity alone.

*** Thanks! My writing style has drastically improved over the years. I look back at fics I wrote when I first began writing HP fic in 2016 and I'm just so grateful I never posted them, lol. I think I'm much better at pacing, phrasing, and just having things flow more naturally. All of that I think just comes with practice.

I do strive to improve but in a very informal fashion, I haven't taken a writing class since college several years ago. If I come across an article with some good writing advice I try to keep it in mind. I don't usually use a beta, though for ambl I did. So I guess in that respect I would be self-taught, but I also have a degree in English which is a pretty formal foundation on which to build. So both, I guess, lol

As far as rules... well, I think there are very few hard and fast writing rules, there can always be exceptions and if you worry yourself too much about it, it takes all the fun out of it. Sometimes I do struggle to remember that I can and should just use “said” in a dialogue tag, it's always a little freeing when I take that to heart!

*** As long as I can remember!

Mine was about a dog (typical me). My mom still has it. So yeah, I always really liked creative writing assignments in school. It wasn't until junior high that I started writing short stories outside of school for fun, though.

You're one of a tiny number of authors who has published high-quality mystery fanfic in the HP Universe. I've written all sorts over the years but have never managed a decent mystery. Do you have a particular method for creating them? And what are your thoughts on Chekhov's Gun?

*** The Aurors is a funny one because at the time I had been watching a lot of Luther and I really liked how a major part of the tension and anxiety was that the viewer knew more than the cast in regards to what was going on, thereby dodging the usual smart detective gathering all the suspects and explaining how he deduced everything. It's easier to do on film of course when you can really show tension through a sinister shadowy figure in the background, but I think there are ways to do that in fic.

So, I revealed to the reader only who the killer was fairly early on. Some people love this, some people hate it - it had the consequence of a lot of my readers thinking my OC was dumb, because what was blindingly obvious to them was not so for her. But I think watching her and Harry accidentally stumble into a trap, skirting achingly close to the edges of the truth, and ultimately concealing enough of the villain's plan was a fun way to write some very tense scenes. I don't regret doing that - I think it would have fallen more flat if people had guessed who dunnit and I kept treating the reader like an idiot by pretending they didn't know.

For Aurors, I definitely planned it out very carefully and made use of the chekhov's gun principle - I had a whole wall of post-it notes planning each and every aspect of the mystery and plot, the different perceptions of each character and what they could possibly know at each stage, etc, etc. I think... after all that, I got bogged down in some details and missed a few others. Quick fix plot devices (which I still maintain are not used in canon in the same way they're not used in my fic!) became the bane of my life as reviewer after reviewer criticised me for not using them, I felt that I was sacrificing some characterizations for the sake of keeping my extremely delicate plot, and gradually it just sucked all the joy out of the fic for me. It was the most effort I have put into a fic, it ended up my most controversial, and it's the only one that I can't bear to reread. I still think about some of the more brutal reviews I got for it, and every now and then I still get very nasty messages about it. Honestly the experience was just miserable for me and it was a while before I felt comfortable writing again. This is strange because it remains one of my most popular fics, and there are certainly certain /scenes/ and ideas that I am proud of.

BUT then the idea for Hollow Ash came along. I took on board a lot of the criticisms of Aurors, and definitely kept some elements of planning - I listed certain clues I knew I had to drop in early, and I knew the basic arc I wanted to follow, but I took a much more organic/gardener approach. It was a much more enjoyable experience for me, I think it's a better fic, though it's not as popular. It takes a more traditional mystery approach in that the reader is not privy to scenes showing who the villain is, but I kept a slight twist in that I didn't make it entirely clear what the crime was from the start either - I wanted to avoid opening with the standard discovery of a body. But I think this helped me build up a creepy atmosphere that suited the psychological shift of my OC better, and was probably more representative of the scandi-noir and modern gothic horror that I happened to be reading at that time.

**** Thank you for the detailed answer.

I read The Aurors first and thought it was superb... must check that I actually left a review saying so. I must say I prefer mysteries where the reader is also left in the dark but this story was strong enough to overcome that.Hollow Ash was definitely a better story but they're both well worth reading.

Having been a beta reader for a couple of prominent authors, I'm well aware of the nonsense that gets posted on review pages. There are some useful comments but far too much is idiotic drivel that can be ignored.

I mentioned Chekov's Gun because it tends to be a divisive point in the genre. I can see it from both sides and wanted to know your thoughts, so thanks for that!

And a related question... do you use a hierarchy of canon? Like, some things are more canon than others (e.g. books > Pottermore > Twitter) or do you take a more all or nothing approach? I know Flo has a quite clever solution to CC's divisive reception, for example.

*** My love of a particular ship, for sure - I just needed lots more Ron and Hermione than what the books gave me and just started writing (and looking up fic too). I do enjoy reading AUs and have written some non-canon-compliant things too, such as a fake dating fic in which Ron never dates Lavender, but I truly love the canon! There's so much to work with already that I don't often feel the need to branch out. I'm so glad those 19 years between the last chapter and the epilogue are basically blank, because then everyone can imagine what they want.

To me, the only true canon is the seven books. After that, I just pick and choose what I like. I almost never write far enough into the future for CC to be a consideration but I don't envision Hermione as Minister for Magic, and I probably would just ignore most of the events of the play if need be. Pottermore... I like it as a guide, but if I write or read something that contradicts it, I wouldn't consider that to be “AU”.

*** No, I can't skip it. I know myself well enough to know that if I skip it, I'll never go back to it. One thing that has worked for me is changing the POV of the character if you can - I know that's sort of generic common writing advice, but it's been helpful for me. Sometimes you don't realize you're in the wrong perspective.

But if I can't do that, sometimes I'll change the approach as far as where I'm starting in a scene - if you start too soon before the action, it can feel like plodding through lots of exposition that you probably don't need. That said, I don't think you should ever really, really force it. If the words aren't coming, there's probably a reason and maybe that's just not the direction the story is supposed to go. It can help to take a step back and think of new ways to get to the ending that you want.

The fandom has definitely slowed and calmed during the years I've been active, so there's fewer fests and probably less engagement overall, which is totally fine. My expectations are usually crazy low anyway and it's important to remember that the last book came out 13 years ago and people have other interests.

I have also wanted to write a ‘Ron and Hermione go to Australia' fic, but those tend to follow a lot of the same plot beats and I think I would struggle to make it feel fresh even as I was writing it.

As far as pressure... hmm. I don't know! I guess I'd never post anything that I wasn't proud of (I only post like 10% of what I write), so it's probably more about meeting my own standards. But you really can't please everyone and quality is so subjective anyway.

I would actually love to write original fiction, I just need an idea 😅 I am still having a lot of fun writing HP fic so I'll be around for little while yet!

Hope you're safe as well. ☺️

*** Right now I'm reading Shadow Boxing by TauraNoma on ao3 - it's a Remadora fic but goes a lot into Remus living amongst werewolves in HBP which really slows that burn, and I'm really enjoying it.
