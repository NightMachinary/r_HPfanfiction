So I am looking for the first fanficition I ever read. It was in the summer of 2013 that it was last updated. It started with Harry being abused to the point he was almost killed by the Dursleys after fifth year. Then Snape and Malfoy come and save him and bring him to Lord Voldemort who turns out to be a good guy. It also turns out that Dumbledoor helped the Dursleys abuse Harry and took him away from his real parents Sirius and Remus and gave him to James and Lilly. Or he was placed with them by Sirius and Remus to keep him safe. Harry also ends up getting pregnant and on the train to Hogwarts confronts/gets confronted by some people who he then freaks out on. Any help is appreciated and I am sorry for any typos and formatting errors as I am on mobile and typing this really quickly.


** the first half of this sounded like a million different (identical) fics. but then the mpreg... well, good luck with the search
