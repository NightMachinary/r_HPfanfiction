Um I am looking for fics like wand and shield though preferably not abandoned. that is the only avengers crossover i ve read. Um pref no slash fem harry / male character is fine Thanks Also no Mpreg I dont even know why the fuck people write that. I mean seriously , guys are not supposed to get pregnant It is unnatural


** In addition to *Child of the Storm* linkffn(8897431) (which is probably one of my favorite fics out there, you might want to check out *Early Retirement* linkffn(10199392) and it's sequel *What Happened Between* linkffn(11510638). Both are a play on a female!Harry, and Master-of-Death!Harry and how that fits into the Marvel universe. Oh, and this Harry has issues resulting from the fact she can't die. Don't read the third story in the trilogy, pretend it ends with 'What Happened Between.' Just don't.

I'm also writing a cross over based on the MCU and how it existing in the Harry Potter universe may have changed things. This is me shilling *The Rezidentura.* linkffn(12334664)

#+begin_quote
  Cathryn Black returns to her retirement the day after the Chitauri have been defeated. But people aren't always as easy to get rid of as memories. Interlude to 'Early Retirement' and it's planned sequel. Read 'Early Retirement' first, or this won't make sense. Warnings for fem!Harry and mentions of suicide, sex, alcohol, and language.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.

#+begin_quote
  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

** Complete is a pretty rare card in this arena, and I'm actually hard pushed to think of an actually completed story. There is, however, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10477045/1/Harry-Potter-The-Avenger][Harry Potter: The Avenger]] by kb0. It's not fantastic, but it's a nice self contained story that doesn't fall into the 'there isn't really an end to work towards' problem that most HP/Avengers stories suffer from.

Or how about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8410168/1/Steve-And-The-Barkeep][Steve and the Barkeep]] by Runaway Deviant? Shorter again, but it's complete and once again tells a small scale, self-contained story within the events of the MCU.

When we start to look at non complete stories, it's a hell of a mixed bag. And the bag is mostly full of 'hurt/comfort' stuff that I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole.

It's far from completed, and it's still early days, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307781/1/Heroes-Assemble][Heroes Assemble!]] by Stargon1 is worth keeping an eye on. I just took a look at the author's page and it looks like they have a good track record for seeing things through to the end. Will probably end up being Harry/Hermione judging by their previous works.

If you're /really/ jonesing for some HP/Marvel and don't much care how many unnecessary words that means trawling through, then you could give [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9443327/1/A-Third-Path-to-the-Future][A Third Path to the Future]] by Vimesenthusiast a look. It's not MCU canon, though. More general Marvel, with the Avengers in background roles.

I'm sure there's others that I enjoyed, but most of the ones I could remember were fairly generic and didn't get past the initial introductions. Oh well. Do with these what you will.

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

** I went through a lot of these when I was having a stressful time a couple of months ago. Linkffn(12179062) Of Old Soldiers and Missing Wars is the one that stuck with me. Also, I may have choked up a bit :(

It's pretty different from the other crossovers I read. So, I guess not really like Wand and Shield. Did Wand and Shield have surprise!omegaverse? I forget. I was amazed how common that still seemed to be in this subset of fic. There's none of that here.

A cat-and-mouse game ensues when Stark's curiosity drives him to ever-increasing lengths to capture his invisible benefactor, who struggles with maintaining her distance.

** I liked it but you might not. It's finished, LOOOONG, and the sequel is being written. James Potter was Thor and after "James" is killed Odin wipes Thor's memory of it until Harry falls in 3rd year during the quidditch game and Thor saves him. Major crossover with a bunch of Marvel, DC, and other properties...Dresden Files, Stargate, and others, but it's primarily an Avengers story.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.
