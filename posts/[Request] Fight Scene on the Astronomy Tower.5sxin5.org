Is there a fight scene like this?

Your typical keep-X-character alive objective like in most games.\\
If you succeed in defending with minimal losses, this is what happens:

The walls of Hogwarts must hold while Harry channels ancient magic from the top of the Astronomy tower. The Lightning-struck tower becomes the tower from which Lightning arcs into the Death Eater forces.\\
Harry fights for a good time by channeling large scale spells like earthquakes/tornadoes/thunderbolts before joining the melee once he's already cut large swathes into the enemy. HP vs LV eclipses AD vs GG in terms of epicness.

I'm not hopeful but I'd love to see anything like this. CanAnyoneWriteThisForMyBirthday? :))
