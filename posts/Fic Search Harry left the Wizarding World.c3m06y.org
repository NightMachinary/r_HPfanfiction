:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a short one shot with Hermione looking for Harry after he leaves the wizarding world or something she finds him I think in native American land? he is married to a native American women friends with a shaman or something. Hermione tells him she will tell everyone or something along those lines and Harry ends up obliviating her.

​

I can't for the life of me find it again.

​

Thanks

  Seven years ago, those he thought he knew condemned him. Now the shoe is on the other foot. Slightly angsty. AU
