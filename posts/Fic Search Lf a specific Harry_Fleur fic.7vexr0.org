Hi, long time reader, first time poster on here (dunno if I've done it right, please advise me if I've made a faux pas) Lf a specific Harry/Fleur I read ages ago but I can't find it again. *it was on FFN *Fourth year *Harry was some sort of gazelle animagus *Krum pretended to have killed the gazelle and stuffed its head *Krum was nastier than canon *there were more than 3 tasks (one was duelling with staves I think) Cheers All!

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
