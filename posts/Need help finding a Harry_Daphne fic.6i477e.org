Harry gets cut by Buckbeak when he pushes Daphne out of the way. I read so many fics of this pairing earlier this year they've all sort of run together, any help is appreciated!

  AU: Post 2nd year. How will Slytherins Ice Queen react to this new Boy Who Lived? Harry comes upon a hidden will by his parents and finds out some well hidden secrets. He will now be in the custody of the Greengrass family. Some tension between Harry and Daphne is bound to happen. HP/DG pairing. Maybe some others, not sure. Mild Weasel bashing.
