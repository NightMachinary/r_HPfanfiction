I had a look through the wiki and didn't see anything like this, so I was wondering if we could make a page listing fanfiction websites and communities. Things like Sink Into Your Eyes, that website that Jeconais posts from, Spacebattles, etc. I don't know many of them at all but thought a comprehensive list might be useful for the community.

On that note, if anyone knows of such archives/small communities/etc could you comment below with a link and short description, please?

*** That's pretty cool and thanks for digging it up, but I still think there's a need for a wiki page for HP focused sites :)
