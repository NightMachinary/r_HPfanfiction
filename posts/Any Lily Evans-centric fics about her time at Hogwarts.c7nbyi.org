Does anyone know of any Lily Evans-centric fics that are set during her time at Hogwarts? Idc what ship, but I would prefer if romance wasn't the focus of the fic. I'm looking for longer fics, like 40k words at the least. They have to have good grammar and be well written. No genderswap fics, please, and no abandoned fics. WIPs are fine, so long as they are regularly updated. Thanks!


** linkAo3(glass of water by lyin) might be what you're looking for: more friendship than romance, very well written, longer and complete.

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

** It's not completely Lily Centric as it rotates POV between her, James, Snape, but I am really enjoying The Mapmakers currently. WIP.

  Before Lily Potter, there was Lily Evans. Before a martyr of the Light, there was a little girl that had to find her place in a world at war about her right to live. Lily Evans wasn't just a prologue or side note of other people's lives. She was the protagonist of her own story. This is Lily's story, told in small moments and oneshots.

** I really love Dirty Blood (linkffn(Dirty Blood)), but it is not just Lily, but her and her friends and the marauders equally. The updates take some time sometimes, but it is a great WIP that sets in her 5th year, even if to me personally Lily is at times the least likable character.

â€‹

Other than that I could put in a little self-promotion. I write a story about all of Lily's years in Hogwarts at the moment and how she navigates her life in this new world and the war and how it affects her relationships with friends, family, allies, enemies, and lovers (but the last point is relatively small still), right now I'm in the middle of year 6. If you want to, take a look. linkffn(Lily Bud by schak)

  [Marauders Era Year Five] It's 1975 and Hogwarts students are trying to focus on their schooling, but with fellow students practicing dark magic and friendships being tested, it's hard to ignore that their parents' war will soon be theirs. And yet, they still try, forcing light in the darkness and daring to laugh when others want to cry. After all, they aren't dead yet.
