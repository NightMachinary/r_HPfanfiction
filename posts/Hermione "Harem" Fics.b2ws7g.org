Well, maybe not harem, but more like a group of guys/men. I want all the males to be hopelessly in love with her, but it would be good if she stays in character, a know-it-all with subpar social skills that doesn't know what to do with all the male attention (at first). I would also like the fic to have a serious plot/message, for example, Hermione fighting pureblood superiority by converting ex-Death Eaters into her faithful boytoys. The males can be creatures as well, vampires, werewolves or whatever species Voldemort was later in life, but I draw a line at House Elves.


** Sorry for the shitpost

** I think it's a little too self-aware to be converting Death Eaters.

** Seriously, are you mocking my Request of a Harem for Ron Thread? Your Text is basically the exact same as mine, just typed for Hermione, with her negative Characterizations and its posted right an Hour after i did mine. Posting Mocking Comments in a Thread is one thing, but you did it with a New Thread with the same title as mine, just replaced the Name, so everyone can see you are mocking my Thread. If you are like this in RL, then you must have much Friends!

*** I didn't mean it as a personal attack on you, but a general commentary on many threads, requests and recs treating harem as a serious genre, in the sub that generally dismisses so many pairings as "not realistic", "disgusting" or "character *** would never!". But I'm not kinkshaming, you do you and all that.

As to why I posted this as a new thread, I am genuinely interested if such fics with Hermione exist. Why shouldn't they? If Harry (or Ron) can have his harem of busty girls with little to no personality, I want to read about Hermione and her group of sexy studs worshipping her (well, to be honest, not particularly, but it would certainly be interesting to see).

BTW, please don't call girls/women females, it's dehumanizing +as is majority of the harem genre.+

**** ok, then i misinterpreted your Text. But its still strangely Written and the partners are also not reallly realistic. Death eaters, Werewolfes....there are exceptions sure, but most of them wouldnt go with a Muggleborn. Also, since your text was basically written as mine and released just shortly after mine, i got the feeling you were mocking my request. If you had used my Nick or linked my request, then i probably wouldnt have replied like this...maybe with a bit of text adaption like "as .... requested in his Thread, im looking for ... in my Thread".

As for the females/males: that are just the sex/gender classes and Females is a generic term for Girls and Woman as males is for Boys/Man. I dont see any dehumanizing in using it. It would be dehumanizing, if i said "well, those strange living beings with Long Hair, long legs, no Penis between their Legs and strange Bags on their Chests. Oh, and they bleed once in a Month". The Term Female is a shortcut for Girls and Woman, like males for their counterpart.
