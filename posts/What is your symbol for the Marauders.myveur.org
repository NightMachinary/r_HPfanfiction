In your imagination, what would be your symbol for the marauders?

I mean there is obviously the map but I somehow feel it's not a real symbol as eg the deathly hallows symbol so I just thought I ask :)


** Not sure if this is what you mean, but I've seen a lot of people give them the symbol of all their ‚Äúpaws‚Äù together. Like you have a stag footprint, a dog pawprint, a wolf, and a rats. Like this:

But with the animals. I think it's meant to look like the foot prints that walk across the map but it's of their animal counterparts.

** For some reason the image in my head is three wands in a row tilting one way and a fourth wand crossing them the other way. Like tickmarks.

The Marauders always seem to be 3+1, after all. Three Animagi and a Werewolf. Three good wizards and Peter. Three guys with dates to the Yule Ball and James, who's going stag as usual because Lily Evans won't take a hint. (Sorry, couldn't resist the Stag pun.)
