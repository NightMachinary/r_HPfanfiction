Hi All!

I'm currently searching for this Harry/Hermione fanfic where Harry and Hermione are not together in the beginning, he's with Ginny. Ginny breaks up with him and he ends up at Hermione's doorstep in tears where he and her have comfort sex. Most distinguishing scene is where she leaves him a note in the morning saying she's not mad when he wakes up and realizes what he's done.

If anyone remembers the name of this fic, it's truly appreciated, it's been driving me mad since I still can't find it.

Thanks!
