The Interdict of Merlin comes from Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (HPMOR), and is a limit that Merlin put on dangerous spells, making it so they can't be written down or stored in any way, but can only be taught directly "from one living mind to another."

The fidelius is said to be a magical way to hide a secret in the "soul" of another person, such that people who don't know the secret don't even realize they don't know it. Even if they knew it before, putting it under fidelius causes them to, not only forget it, but forget they ever knew it. When the secret keeper dies, everybody who knows the secret becomes a secret-keeper.

(I've always thought it was a waste for JKR to create this concept with literal world-changing potential, and then the characters ONLY use it to create safehouses. She said it hides "a secret," not hides a location.)

Thus, we have a canon way to create a fanon invention. All you have to do is put the incantation, wand movement, and purpose of a spell under the fidelius, and it is now under the Interdict of Merlin. Nobody can learn it unless you teach it to them. When you die, only those you've taught can teach others.

You'd have to close the canon loophole that allows the secret keeper to write the secret down, maybe by adding a legilimantic aspect. Maybe your spell needs a specific emotional state that is difficult to describe in words, and needs a legilimens to demonstrate the proper frame of mind?

So what, you'd be able to make everyone forget how to cast lumos? All the unforgivables? Apparate?

*** I mean, are those secrets? Because I don't think the instructions for casting lumos or the unforgivables are secrets. The Fidelius doesn't hide ideas, concepts, or locations, it hides secrets. If everyone knew that the Potter's lived in a cottage in Godrics Hollow the Fidelius wouldn't have worked because it wouldn't have been a secret. The fidelius doesn't make things secrets, it protects things that are already secret.

*** In /Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/, the fact Tom Riddle was Voldemort was under Fidelius until the destruction of the Diary, and when Dumbledore and Kingsley Shacklebolt realized this was possible they experimented by hiding Remus Lupin's status as a werewolf. They task the super-smart-in-this-verse Harry to see if he could figure out the secret. He had all the evidence before him and came to the conclusion that Lupin was a vampire.
