*** So you're placed into a world of magic and your only act is to move Harry from the not-as-abusive-as-you-think Dursley's and possibly get Harry killed in the process, due to the lack of protection?

**** They were abusive. There's no scale, there's no slider, and there's no excuse. You NEVER leave a child in an abusive home, it doesn't MATTER if it's "not as bad as you think." They're still being abused! And that is sick and wrong, and it ALWAYS has to be stopped. It doesn't matter why or where, or what situation it is. You stop it.

And Harry wouldn't be killed after, because I'd move him to another continent entirely, change his name and his physical features with magic, and then put him with a random magic family in a small and random town somewhere. If no one KNOWS where he was moved, or that he was even moved at all, or that his name and physical features were altered, they would have absolutely NOTHING to go on to even TRY to find him. And for good measure, the Fidelius could be put on that new home too. Canon dumbledore's methods and solution wasn't the end all be all, it wasn't the only single option in existence, and it being an option that involved an entire childhood of abuse is UNACCEPTABLE.

No I am not going to be a Dark Lady.

***** There is so much wrong with your argument. One, Dumbledore would be immediately informed of Harry being gone because of Figg, that "random family" isn't very likely to accept a random child, regardless of if his name or physical features are altered Aurors, let alone fucking Dumbledore, will still be able to find him, and a Fidelus is far, far more difficult than you think. It took /Dumbledore/ to cast it on Lily and James Potter's house, for fucks sake. Add to that, you still need to tell someone his location, which is another means that you could be tracked.

Additionally, you seem to think Harry was being smacked around and beaten all the time. He wasn't. What the Dursleys did was bad, yes, but it's not like they were beating him bloody every day.

Dumbledore's methods may not be the best, but they're better than yours. You may not intentionally be trying to be a Dark Lady, but after kidnapping Harry Potter you would damn well be labeled as such.

************** There were a dozen different options to take than what happened. If they really needed him to be there for the blood protection, they could've imperius'd them into being decent people, or planted a confundus idea in them to be good like snape did to mundungus. They could have threatened them, or BRIBED THEM, maybe like "We'll give you a million dollars at the end of each year if, after monthly check ins with harry, you've treated him the same as your own child." And beyond that, they could have just had harry at hogwarts or something, right in dumbledore's office, given him a room! There were a million ways it could have easily avoided what happened. It DID NOT have to happen. But Dumbledore CHOSE to let it happen, he CHOSE to put harry there, and he KNEW. And that's unacceptable, and disgusting.
