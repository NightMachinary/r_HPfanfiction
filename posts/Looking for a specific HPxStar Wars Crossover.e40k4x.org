:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Here is what I remember:

Set during the Prequel Trilogy

Adult Harry

Harry removes the dark side influences from Count Dooku

Padawans start being able to do magic after Harry's arrival

The Jedi establish lessons in magic that Harry teaches

Heavy influence on different styles of lightsaber combat.

Thanks In Advance!


** Magic of the Force might be what you're thinking of, though Harry is not an adult at the start.

After a few a few setbacks he starts to gain control of his powers, only to receive another beating. Pleading with his magic to get him away, he soon discovers he has a great destiny and the family he always wanted.
