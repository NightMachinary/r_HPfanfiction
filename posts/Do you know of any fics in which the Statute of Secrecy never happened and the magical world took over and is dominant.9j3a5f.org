Hey,

I'm looking for fics in which the entire globe is run by wizards.

Plot beyond that --- ideally it would have Muggle main characters, but I'm open to anything really

Thanks in advance

*** In Sword of the Hero ISOS is absolutely a thing, though. RotW's description suggests the same is the case here. And even if this changes later in case of the Hero Trilogy it would be in the second part at the earliest, so it's at least 350k words of a very bad fic before reaching that.

**** RotW has the Statue of Secrecy. It's a 6th (5th?) year canon divergence. Wizards do take over the Muggles and the World. It's a great read with a Darker and unforgiving Harry. It's a Harry/Daphne with 2 more wives towards the end. Very slow but detailed beginning and a great 2nd arc. Highly recommend reading it, if you haven't

  The Hero Trilogy, Part One. After the tragedy of his fifth-year, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts and to a war that will shake the Wizarding and Muggle worlds to their very core. Peace rests on the edge of a sword, and on the courage of Harry alone.

  Far north of Mossflower, a settlement has taken hold in the ruins of Marshank. Here, the Crucible determines the righteous and the guilty- with a fight to the death between the two parties. One wildcat took advantage of this and turned the fortress into a deathmatch arena. This is the story of five wayward souls, trapped within a brutal culture.

  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.
