Hi i really want to read a fic where Hermione adopts a child dont care how old as long as there is loads of cuteness. Actually i don't care as long as the child is not Hermione's. Please make sure they are on the longer side and they MUST BE COMPLETE.

If you've by any chance encountered any stories where Hermione adopts young Tom Riddle put them down. MUST BE COMPLETE.

NO HERMIONE/RON SLASH OF ANY KIND SO TOTALLY ALLOWED

  An old house sits at the end of a lane. Abandoned and forgotten, no one would have guessed who was going to buy it... or how full a life that old house was yet to live. Harry/Hermione

** In the story linkffn(She Made Her Choice by DriannaHarper), the adoption is an important, but not the main, plot element.
