OMG. I don't usually care for Snape as a primary character, especially not Snape POV/main char, but this fic is just excellent.

It's got it all. An interesting but mostly true-to-canon Harry. Likewise with Snape and most other characters. Follows canon plot, but makes it interesting -- doesn't take too long dragging on with it, doesn't follow too close to the original so that it's boring.

Voldemort is defeated about halfway through, and I was a bit hesitant to keep reading as it seemed like the fic was headed towards "Lord Potter Black Peverell saves all of humanity at age 17 with his overpowered awesomeness and quick wit" but it's... just skirting that line. Like, the overdone bits are there, but it's so well done it isn't horrid, and better yet it is /believable./ Example excerpt that doesn't really have plot spoilers...

  “Now, the most important part of this lecture: do not /ever/ use primary feathers in your potions. Never.”

  Pershore swallows before asking, “Why not?”

  “Everyone, hold up your quills,” Harry instructs. “You're all holding a quill made from a bird's primary feather---no...no, only most of you are. What the---what is that?” he asks, pointing at Shimizu's fluffy pink quill. That feather did not come from any bird Severus has ever seen.

  “It's...a quill---all right, it's a plastic feather with a metal ink nib attached!” Shmizu admits, blushing. “I was terrible with a feather quill!”

  “Is that pink thing new to this term, this year, or have you been using it since you started school here?” Harry asks, still giving the feather an appalled look.

  “Uh---just last week. I got it over the holiday break,” Shimizu says.

  “Just checking. It means I can blame everyone except your Headmaster, then.” Harry shakes his head. “Listen. A bird's primary feather is ostensibly the most important feather to a species that flies. It is thrust, power, and control---a bird's hand, basically. Everyone else in this room is holding quills made from primary feathers from differing birds. We're magic-users, all of us, so the control that the primary feather lends to the bird is also lended to us when we use the quill. In more basic terms, it makes it easier to adapt to using a quill in the first place, and we can write for longer periods without our hands cramping up. I am not actually against your ink nib, just that fluffy pink thing you have attached to it.”

So yeah, he's over-educated and showing off in a lecture... but he's only brilliant at this one subject, not all of them + ancient Pictish magic and whatnot.

Not a fan of the romantic pairings that actually get "screentime" ALL being gay... why do authors do this? Drives me bonkers. But I like that the main characters themselves (Harry and Snape) do not have romances. So tired of sex scenes in the middle of otherwise serious fics.

Anyway, I'm rambling, anyone else read it? What did you think? Mark spoilers please, as I am only on Chapter 37 :)


** I didn't make it past the pirate ship last time but I need to go back and try to read it again because it's honestly really good! There are so many fantastic details but I really love Myrtle and also the little group that place bets on predicting the plots of tv shows

*Omg I'm so out of it that was the second string I was talking about LMAO

I enjoyed swung by seraphim too. There are definitely two parts to it, but I have to say I actually liked the second part of it because people deserve to have an /after/ to the crisis. In the end we're not actually here to just fic crisises and save the world but to do the actual work in living.

So maybe the second half is a bit self indulgent of the author but honestly that's fine. A good reasonable and not toxic Severus should actually get involved with the Muggle world and find things to enjoy and show Harry how to move on from the state of constant drama that Harry has lived his whole life.

I think we read and write fic for a lot of reasons and trying to look as fanfic the same as we would a novel isn't very helpful because sometimes we want to read about the after bit, the more mundane and sometimes far more difficult work of figuring out what we actually want to do with the rest of our lives.

I don't want it in every fic but this once I did like it. It wasn't even that well written, in that last bit, Severus is really OOC, but I don't care tbh. Sometimes I don't want things to be written perfectly anyway

as someone who has memory issues (even if they're completely different to what Harry suffers), and has dealt with my life being affected in different ways, such as the way memory really really affects things like personality and how horrid and annoying it is to be told how much you've changed, I /really/ like the premise of the story, and several parts of it were really interesting, and I was glad someone wrote it

** I liked it at first, but as it kept getting weirder, I lost my interest in it, didn't finish reading it, and now I wouldn't call it a good story. Like you said, the climax in about halfway through, and after it nothing interesting happens. I actually checked some Internet discussion about it, and I learned that the latter half of the story is totally pointless. That makes it the worst structured story I have ever encountered.

Also some details made it feel off. Seriously, what is the point of making Snape a Jew and Harry and Hermione quadroons if these things are absolutely inconsequential? I think the point of fan fiction is to expand the original fiction in ways that are meaningful for the new story. These pointless ethnicity reveals made me feel like I was subjected to some kind of diversity brainwashing, and it broke my immersion in the story.

All in all, I'd say it's a very well written story that was wasted because the writer wanted something in addition to telling a story, but this additional purpose made the story fail as a story. I actually felt a bit betrayed, because reading stories is the reason I am in this fan fiction corner of the Internet.

** I liked it for the most part, though I felt it dragged a little later on. I was worried it was going to be Snape/Harry and was very relieved when it was not. I didn't find Harry that close to canon, to be honest, but it was fine. I felt a little bit at the end that they were changing too many things about Hogwarts. I didn't like what they did with the squibs, it felt like a cop out.
