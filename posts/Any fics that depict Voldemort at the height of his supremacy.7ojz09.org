For example - in canon we repeatedly get told that Voldemort is merely a man - Tom Riddle. And the story revolves around dismantling the myth that he's less than human - he can be killed.

However, I'm way more intrigued by the danger Voldemort poses. Fair play that he can be killed - I think that his humanity makes his power all the more impressive. If the average person is afraid to even say his name, what on earth where his actions to achieve that level of infamy?!

And please don't just say "/The jinx on his name!"/ - because I feel like that's a cop out - there are infinite more interesting explanations - some actions he took that elevated him beyond, as Dumbledore mentioned, /"usual evil"/.

I'm immensely curious of any fics that explore Voldemort at the height of his supremacy where he's just straight-up stomping on people. Or if not doing that, just idly apparating into someplace and clearing it out without casting a spell inside of 10 seconds. I want a fic that "celebrates" that.

Can you recommend any?

As an aside - I'm currently in the early planning stages of a fic (<5k words so far) that will delve into this sort of thing. Is this something that would interest you to read?

** Some interesting fics I've read that relate to this:

  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6199615/1/The-Fire-Omens][The Fire Omens]] by Chase Glasslace.

This details the creation of the diary Horcrux from the POV of a teenage Tom Riddle. Mesmerizing prose (imho)

#+end_quote

This fic revolves around the premise that Tom is a good boy raised wrong. Time travel back to when he was first born, and the time-traveler raises Tom (now Thomas) in a way that celebrates his better characteristics.

A world where Tom Riddle couldn't kill his parents to create his first Horcrux. Instead he became a professor, a celebrated scholar with a specialty in immortality. Only 5k words.

Just finished reading this. It's absolutely fantastic, however it's abysmally short and unfinished.
