its summary makes it seem like average edgy lord potter-black story, but i like the author's other piece.


** It's very polarizing. I haven't read any of his other stories so I can't really comment on a comparison but i personally like "For Love of Magic" quite a bit.

First of all, it's most definitely not the typical edge lord Potter story. Harry is obviously OP and he uses all of his resources, including his title to his advantage but I never got the feeling to he just got by on inherited money and titles alone.

He can't just walk into the Wizengamot, proclaim his word as law and everyone falls over themselves doing his bidding as is sometimes done in the really terrible fics but he can use his fame and money to influence an incompetent Minister to an almost ridiculous degree.

Harry is ruthless, amoral and selfish but he's also strangely reasonable and almost likeable in a very weird way i can't quite explain.

If you have a problem with Harry being a dick, this fic is not for you and if you have a problem with explicit smut scenes you should stop reading after (I think) year 2 or 2.5.

That said, Harry isn't all powerful, he makes mistakes, he's not perfect at everything he does without even trying and there is an underlying plot that's slowly evolving into something more interesting than just Harry beating up Voldemort and laughing at the idiocy of the general public.

There's decent character development and if you take out the smut and the first few years of school it could even be considered somewhat philosophical (if you squint).

As a final warning: This is technically a harem fic but it's also kinda not. Harry is very much sexually active from a (too) young age and his interests develop in a way that is only reasonable considering the way he started. Actually, i take it back. It's totally a harem fic, they call it an open relationship but none of the girls actually sleep with anyone else (now that i think about it, the author is actually very self aware on this matter. This exact discussion between harem and open relationship actually gets brought up in one of the chapters)

--------------

This turned into a bit of a mess so I'll do a quick summary:

I like it, I think you should read it and if it turns out you don't like it then that's understandable and you should stop.

**** Ehhhh idk man; I wouldn't say that the girls sleeping with other women, who Harry is also sleeping with, is the same thing as them having lovers outside the relationship.

The latter is what Harry is doing, he essentially has two mistresses and a few friends with benefits, and none of the girls have anything like that.

***** I guess, but the way you put it kind of makes it sound like Harry is the only one going after other women, rather than the group also accepting random women to have sex with them all. Unless random sexual predator magical beings don't count as lovers, who knows what goes in that weirdo world. Fleur probably hooks up with other veelas, since they just have sex all the time, apparently.

** Eh. It's... an okay story, but Harry's characterization feels atrocious. Not because he's dark/edgy/evil/whatever, but because [[/spoiler][he turned himself into an edgy sociopath /accidentally/, with his magic. Which, you know, takes all of the interesting potential character development off of the table, and just makes it feel arbitrary.]]

By the end of the story, I basically just saw Harry as a set piece character, like a raunchier, more sociopathic version of Obi Wan: fucking girls (who happened to be vastly more interesting characters), teaching said girls all kinds of things about magic, and providing exposition about the world at large.

Noodlehammer's insistent habit of responding to sex-negative reviewers by adding more porn into the story was entertaining, too, but that can't prop up the literary value of the story, IMO.

** Honestly, I like it quite a bit. It's not high class literature or anything, but I felt it's thoroughly entertaining. I feel like it doesn't take itself super seriously, it has some pretty funny moments, and it's easy to read. It does have a large amount of smut, so if you don't like that you may not like it, but I wouldn't say it's the primary attraction to the story. Give it a shot and don't take it as either crack or super serious, just look to have a good time. There is such a place for a story like that, even if many would deny it.

** Like anything else it depends on your tastes and what sort of stuff you like to read. I found it an enjoyable read (haven't looked at it in some time, but its still WIP). It's starts off fairly generically like you say, but it builds into its own, and though in the 2nd half there is (rather a lot of) smut, doesn't read like porn, and the characterisation of Harry its quite well done in my opinion (in his interactions with Hermione etc.)

** It's pretty bad. It's one of those fics where someone would try and claim that it's one of those "chiches done right" stories, but it's really not. It's not particularly well written and is pretty much conglomeration of every bad indy!Harry fic. Some would say it's a "greatest hits" version of all the bad tropes, but there's nothing great about it. I think people just want an excuse to like this kind of fic, like some sort of justification for their tastes. When I was reading it, I was left wondering if the whole thing was done on purpose, like a tongue-in-cheek parody, but as I read more and thought about it more, I'm pretty sure the author was completely serious when writing it.

There's a reason that the indy!Harry genre is dead. This story just doesn't really do anything particularly new or interesting, and it does a whole lot of things that just seems like the author pulled out of a hat at random.

** Entertaining at times. Certainly does not make my top 40 list. A few interesting concepts. The plot sometimes seems tired and many characterizations are a bit cliche. Several plot holes and some things seemed to be rammed into the story on some fleeting fancy of the author without really being well thought through. That does not mean it is bad - it is not terrible - but would not call it a gem of any sort.

But I also greatly dislike harem fics, so that also impacted my opinion.

Edit: And it definitely gets worse as it goes on. I greatly enjoyed the beginning of the fic.

** its basically the author inserting himself into harry(he literally says that harrys personality is based on him) and turning the world into a au that is the easiest for him to become extremely powerful in. Harry does make mistakes but they cause stuff like him getting into puberty early and the author uses it as excuse to start writing a lot of smut when harry is 12/13, or they result in him becoming exetremy powerful after a moment where his life was in danger. Harry is also pretty edgy and attempt to justify why its okay to give someone a love potion when he knows the person is going to use it to rape someone. And also why its okay for adult woman to become part of his harem when he is 14.

That said the fic is okay and does have enjoyable moments, but after a while I just started to skip over a lot of part(especialy the smut) and stopped reading it at all

I read around half of it before I couldn't take it anymore. If you're still in Phase #2(see my relevant post), then you'd probably enjoy this story if you are alright with harems and a shitload of smut. It's a very polarizing story.
