** In linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) there isn't that much focus on the struggles with Voldemort. It's really about Harry and Hermione coming into power, discovering great (and terrible) things about magic etc. Just doesn't have much Hogwarts action.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** i want this to be updated so badly, sometimes i think about writing more for it myself. but i have no idea where the story is going, so i know it would be an abomination, at best. then i think of writing something similar, or maybe just with the meritocracy aspect and the magic challenges bit, but i still can't think of what more to make it an actual story, you know? and then i've forgotten all about it, and i see someone link it, and i think, holy shit, its been 7 years?!? i still hope it gets updated someday.

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

** This would be a plausible story for anyone except the trio or anyone close to them. Or perhaps in a different time period entirely.

Additionally, you'd have to get around the fact that that kind of story would be /boring/ without /some kind/ of conflict. Sure, writing about such topics could definitely be entertaining. Putting thoughts to paper, writings rules - or a lack thereof as sometimes magic forces you to do - and whatnot... but that doesn't make a particularly interesting /story/.

Of course, someone could prove me wrong. It's likely been done at some point. Unfortunately I don't know of any and my only contribution to this thread is to criticize the idea like a little bitch. <3

*** Too much of a canon rehash for my tastes. You remove Horcruxes but everything stays the same. Have Bella break out of Azkaban and kill dozens of people, have Narcissa Malfoy or Andromeda Tonks fight a custody battle over Harry with the Weasleys (they have the better claim). Have McNair as Care teacher instead of Umbridge in Hogwarts. Have Hermione build a Harem. I don't care at this point, just don't go the "we change all these fundamental things and yet the same shit happens" road.

***** I never got the Molly love. I'm German and here it is a criminal offence not to report child abuse. Molly was told that Harry was starved and locked behind bars and she threatened Fred and George with the same. I do not believe in the whole Potion Queen Molly thing but the arrival scene permanently put her on my shit list. And it gets even better/worse. Harry gets starved again and all she does is send food. Instead of you know, calling the DMLE or the police.

Arthur's ignorance of muggle things was supposed to be funny but it really just a tragedy how he can lead a department and not bother to do basic research and his enchanted car is a testament to his own double standards.

******* In my opinion you should never read the translated version over the original one if you understand both. I significantly improved my English by reading Clancy's works and A song of Ice and Fire, so I might be biased. As for learning the language, the translation is good with the exception of the second title.

They translated Chamber of secrets to Kammer des Schreckens, which means chamber of horror. You'll find a couple of these changes throughout the series but besides being confusing they don't change much.
