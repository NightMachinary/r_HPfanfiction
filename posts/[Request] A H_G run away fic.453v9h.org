I recently read Without a Trace linkffn(Without a Trace by potterfan2008) and enjoyed the concept so I'm looking for any stories where Harry and Ginny leave the wizarding world for some reason and either others are searching for them or they have to eventually come back for some reason. It could be one or the other leaving and the other searching for them but I'd prefer they both have to run away together.

The only two things I ask is that it's a Harry/Ginny pairing and they don't leave because Ginny was raped and couldn't face it. (I saw one like that during my own search and wasn't really a fan of the concept). Also a completed story would be nice but it's not a deal breaker.


** +Only+ First one I can think of that is H/G is linkffn(The Unbreakable Vow by Ash Darklighter). No updates since Feb. 2013, and they leave because [[/spoiler][Harry's magic gets damaged by Voldemort right before he destroys Voldemort's body, and Percy tries to force Ginny to marry Draco]]. Even though it is probably abandoned, it has 37 chapters, so at least there is a bunch of stuff there.

**** I just remembered that linkffn(Perilous Journey by sbmcneil) exists, and it just updated in October, so it's probably still going. By the same person (just a different username) as Without A Trace.

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128050][Bonds of Blood and Magic]] has Harry and Ginny go into hiding during what is supposed to be Harry's seventh' year. They disappear just before Bill and Fleur's wedding. It's one of my favorite stories, actually.

Related: I'm currently writing my fic as well, and it has Harry, Ginny and Sirius running away from the Ministry. I'm currently 25000 words into it and I'm going to be dividing it into three parts. The first part is now about halfway done, and I hope I keep enough interest in it so that I can finish it completely. If all goes well, I want to start publishing this spring.
