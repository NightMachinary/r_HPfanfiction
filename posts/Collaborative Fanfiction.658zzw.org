In present day Hogwarts, what if /you/ could leave your mark on it, and write an epic tale starring your own character?

*** *Hello, witches and wizards of Reddit!*

Are you looking for a group of passionate, dedicated fans who love Harry Potter? Have you always dreamed of a simulation of going to Hogwarts, casting spells, meeting new friends and going on adventures? Tired of waiting hours to get a reply on your roleplaying posts? Want to attend classes, play quidditch, and meet cool people, all in the same place?

Well, this is your letter of acceptance to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelHogwarts/][r/ModelHogwarts]]! Join a magical world just beginning to unfold, on reddit and [[https://discord.gg/56z6GMM][discord]] (yes, in order to join, you *need a Reddit and a Discord account.* It takes two seconds to make them and if you have questions we'd be happy to answer them). Have a live chat with your professor in their office, or watch as quidditch game unfolds right before your eyes! Brew some Veritaserum, finish that essay on the Goblin Wars of 1812, and go stargazing up on the astronomy tower at night.

** *What's unique and awesome about Model Hogwarts:*

   :END:
1) Everyone starts off as a first year. Everyone gets to starts in the same classes and no one gets a shortcut to being a seventh year. This is awesome because everyone gets the same experiences, and you and your class will become even closer because you all remember the time that dragon nearly devoured your classmate in Care of Magical Creatures. We also make it easy to graduate. A year is fifteen weeks (two semesters and a week break in between) and all you have to do is pass two classes. With the support of your classmates, prefects and teachers all rooting you on, you're gonna ace that test on mandrake properties! You also get to chose how many classes you want to take. Are you the next Hermione Granger? Don't worry, we've got you covered with a time turner so you can take all five classes. Are you more like a Neville Longbottom? You can just take two and still pass the year! We understand everyone has different priorities and classwork isn't always on top.

2) You get to choose where you get sorted. We're not gonna place you in Ravenclaw just to get an even number of students in each house (cough cough Pottermore). We want you to thrive where you'll do best, and find a social environment of like-minded students. Because of this, you get to choose your house, and once you do, a whole world of opportunity emerges. House parties, study sessions, quidditch teams, and more are awaiting you, so throw on that Hufflepuff scarf and get ready to drink some butterbeer.

3) We're new. This is great, because you're gonna get the chance to leave your mark on Hogwarts. Wanna be a prefect? Wanna start a chess club, or a book club, or even a flesh eating slugs fan club? Hey, we won't judge! Model Hogwarts is ripe with opportunities, but still is developed enough to give you the structure to succeed.

4) It's easy to join. We don't have a whole different site that you have to create an account for and remember to check the url every so often. We use Reddit and Discord, which are already developed sites and are easy to use! If you're already on reddit, why not add this to your subreddits?

5) We want /you/. We're not picking you from a bowl of applicants, you're picking /us/. So ask us your questions, and we'll try to help you. We want Model Hogwarts to be the best experience it can be, and provide students with as many opportunities as possible.

We're still looking for a few professors. We want engaging, passionate staff, and so we really wanted to open these positions up to everyone interested. If you want to join the team, you're welcome to fill out [[https://goo.gl/forms/rVVZynwUTsCA8Hjv1][this quick survey]].

If this sounds interesting, and you would like to join as a student, obviously we want to provide you with as many class options as possible, so hang in there until next week when we post a class sign up list. For now, there's still a lot you can do if you're interested, however.

Send us a picture of what your character looks like, or what music they're listening to right now! We can't wait for you to find a place that will always be there to welcome you home.


** A fascinating endeavour! Here's a bunch of questions:

1.1) +How many people are involved in maintaining the project? How many people are involved in worldbuilding?+ I'm guessing 6 people so far.

1.2) How deep are players expected to poke at the world-building and lore?

1.3) Are the players expected to meta-game to build the setting and\or discuss its construction with the project hosts?

#+begin_quote
  Have a live chat with your professor in their office
#+end_quote

1.4) The host would have to have a rather thorough design notes for their subject's “rules” in the setting for a live event like this to hold true, no?

2) What's the timeline of the setting?

3.1) What is (not) allowed for players to do?

3.2) How much is a player allowed to interact with another player's character, especially without the collaboration and\or approval of the other player?

3.3) If not too much, how are you planning to maintain the illusion of the “multiplayer” aspect of the game? If as much as --- for the characters --- realistically possible, how are you planning to stop potential griefing without breaking the 4th wall? The professor and prefect characters can not be expected to be omniscient, after all.

3.4) What about vanilla!canon stuff that'd be easy to abuse due to its OP nature (Imperio, Obliviate, Polujuice, Legilimency, Time Turners, etc)?

4) What happens if a player stops participating in the project halfway through? Does their character mysteriously disappear from the school, become a background NPC that's “supposed to be there”, something else?

5) What are the limits for character background creation (e.g. “just a muggleborn” v.s. “a pureblood family heir” v.s. “heir of Slytherin+Gryffindor”, etc)

6) Are essay-type homeworks expected to be actually written? If yes, how many words on average are they expected to be?

#+begin_quote
  Expulsion on 4th Offence for: Disrespect to School Employees, Misbehaviour in the Classroom, Failure to Follow Reasonable Requests, Harassment / Bullying, Participating in or Provoking a Verbal Altercation, Use of Discriminatory Slurs, Spamming
#+end_quote

7) In-universe, a punishment system like this looks rather draconic. I'd suggest “putting the players in jail” instead: their characters would be given “detentions” for a given period and the player would be unable to control them. The last one isn't an in-universe offence at all. Maybe change it to “disruption of peace” or somesuch?

#+end_quote

What's a Transfiguration Alphabet and how's it supposed to help with actual transfiguration practice?

In either case I'd like to wish you luck and good experience with this test-drive.

*** Thank you for your lovely reply!

1.1) What a insightful guess :P In addition to the initial team, we have a Herbology professor now and a part-time Charms professor who are both on the world building team, regardless.

1.2) We really want to keep this an open world, so if people are interested in classes, we'll expand our offering there, or more interested in roleplaying, quidditch, events, etc., etc., we're going to grow and change based on user interest.

1.3) This week is an initial setting up time until classes start. During this week, we would like to get a lot of student imput during this week, and this can include world building or chat ooc if they'd like. After classes start, aside from the ooc chat we're going to stick to a more in character approach.

1.4) The rules are otherwise flexible, apart from staying in character. If something comes up, we'll deal with it and adapt, of course. Any contributions to the rules would be welcome, as well.

2) It's in present day (with the ghost of Dumbledore as headmaster. It's all quite mysterious really...) One might say it's uncanny how they all disappeared or were replaced by the time Albus Potter was starting school... (Albus starts school the year after this one, canon-wise. Each semester is eight weeks, there's a week between semesters and three weeks summer break)

3.1) More detail is in the [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zAd2iKfwXSgfWJvgV84ppYNO7B3xFopaRPKrmwSm8X4][code of conduct]], but basically follow redditique, don't give yourself excessive powers because everyone starts as a first year, and be polite. We'll deal with niche problems on a case-by-case basis otherwise.

3.2) You need permission to cause another player to make an action. For example, you can throw a snowball at me in Hogsmeade, but you cannot make me throw a snowball back. And if I protest that I wasn't in Hogsmeade at all, then you would have to delete/edit what you originally said. Based on this structure, we'd like to encourage collaboration.

3.3) Yes, problems arise when professors/prefects cannot be everywhere at once, but we'd like to encourage students to screenshot events that go against the code of conduct and owl (pm) them to staff. We also hope to improve our bot to combat spamming and other transgressions. Also, if a student gets four warnings, typically they get kicked. We want a welcoming inclusive community, and if someone can't respect that, we'd rather keep order and sacrifice the size.

3.4) Everyone starts out as a first year. Unforgivables are not canon-ly learned by this time, and it would be extremely hard to brew those potions. If someone is taking (or wishes to take) actions that may be seen as controversial, they should talk to staff. Timeturners have all been destroyed, and we're not counting Cursed Child as canon.

4) The student either becomes a background NPC if that seems like the appropriate course of action (if they never had much multiplayer action to begin with) or if they were involved, they will be transferred, expelled, or mysteriously disappear depending on the character/plot.

5) If someone want to be the heir of Slytherin, we won't stop them, but we're not granting anyone any special powers. At this point in history, no werewolves or vampires are allowed in Hogwarts either. The ministry has improved the trace so although purebloods might have more knowledge of the theory of spells, everyone is practically on an equal level.

6) It depends on the teacher. The classes are all going to vary, for example the professor teaching History of Magic teaches AP History irl so it's going to be a very challenging course. Transfiguration, on the other hand, also focuses mainly on theory but will be a much easier workload with participation being 70% of the grade. Potions will focus more on practicals, and branch out from theory, etc. etc. Your professors should make this clear to you when signing up, or you can owl (pm) them with questions (this was the main purpose of the "have a chat with your professor in their office). However, I can see a paragraph essay being submitted if the character wants to. It depends on your character's work ethic also, and we won't say no to longer essays if you feel passionate.

7) Spamming was merely an ooc way to be clear, but thanks for the suggestion, perhaps we'll list that with spamming in italics. We'd rather expel students who break these rules. Obviously, saying something in character or minor aggressions won't be counted but if someone repeatedly breaks school policy with multiple warnings and consequences, we'd rather not have them on the server.

8?) The transfiguration alphabet was shown in the movies, and I think it's similar to ancient runes? Tis not my specialty but the transfiguration teacher is very skilled and I'm sure she would also be open to questions and more knowledgable about her topic than me :P

Thank you for the questions! They were quite helpful.

**** Re: 3.3 and 3.4, most of canon magic is easily exploitable. Is there anything stopping me from just saying "I wingardium leviosa my class mate and throw him out the window. He dies." Or, "I stub my transfiguration teacher from behind as she is helping another student, and ten take my transfigured needle and stab it through her eye. She dies," etc. Magic is rife with methods for abuse and every child is running around with a deadly weapon.

Sure, I would be expelled, as you say, but you can't really just make up a reason the teacher isn't dead. If you retcon it to such a way that I didn't do that, then you have no reason to expel me. I always like finding exploits in games and seeing how the devs react to them, so even though I wouldn't actually do that, I'd like to know what the reaction would be if I did.

***** Thanks, and yes, there is a system now put into formal writing because this is a great point. If your action is meant to harm or alter someone, physical or magical, it becomes a duel. Duelling has got a separate system of rules based on ability, knowledge, and luck, and a Professor would beat any first year, for example.

****** Ah, but first year on first year? Or in a couple "years," fourth year on first year? You learn unforgivables in fourth year, apparently, so could fourth year me offer to tutor a first year and then spring a surprise duel on them and just obliviate them of, well, everything (think Lockhart)? Or just Avada Kedavra and then leave.

******* There's a system for duels which largely prevents this, and unforgivables are mainly about emotion and state of mind so however unlikely it is for a fourth year to learn, it would be near impossible to teach a first year. Yes, maybe by the end of first year, a first year could stun another one, but nothing of long lasting damage, and nothing lethal. I doubt that a troll would actively participate for all seven years until they could kill off their classmates. Even Harry couldn't perform an unforgivable in sixth year and he showed great strength of mind. Hermione, an extremely gifted witch learned obliviate in seventh year, so this also shows the difficulty of these spells. If this becomes an issue as students progress, we'll add a rule nullifying these actions, but like you pointed out we'd rather not pretend things didn't happen and not be able to give consequences.

********* Oh yeah, well, advanced spells are limited, and if you haven't formally learned a spell in class, it is unreliable while using it while dueling usually. It's a valid concern, and someone quite clever could probably get around the system, but it's unlikely anyone would be killed, and if they were they could make another character, and the fourth year would be expelled.
