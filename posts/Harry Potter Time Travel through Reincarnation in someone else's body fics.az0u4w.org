Ok so I realize this may be an obscure request... but it's worth a shot to ask.

Looking for a time travel where Harry travels back in time. Preferably no longer ago than the Marauder era or Voldemorts school year era. But it could also be as little as 1 year back. However instead of becoming an "OC" in that era effectively (like Harry just inserted as a new character into the past), instead he is reincarnated into someone else's body (an example would be Harry Potter taking over Sirius's body) effectively taking it over.

Armed with the knowledge of the future to be, he then makes his choices and the story progresses forward. Harry could be dark, light, or grey, but he should not be overly canon-like and due to the nature of his time traveling from the future, I would hope he has some sort of skill in the past (even if it's simply knowledge) and won't just "skate by".

So ANYTHING remotely similar to that basically is what I am looking for.

I would strongly prefer some sort of romance be included but no "main character" slash please if possible. I also prefer mature oriented fics (authors willing to include violence, smut, or darker undertones without reservation, provided it fits the story).

I LOVE time travel fics so if you have any really good quality ones to recommend that are not quite what the request is about, that's ok too.

Thanks!


** Following.

I suggest the works of Tsume_Yuki.

*** Interestingly, this is one of the fics that inspired this request, although it was neither as long as I wished nor as mature oriented as hoped considering its "themes". Regardless, was worth the read.

So I have read it but thanks anyway :) However, I am curious because you mention "works" as if he has done more like this. If so I was unaware of those. Any in particular?

**** I think it's on ao3 though and probably slash. I dunno if I'm right tbh, I read so many fics I might be mixing the authors up.

The biggest thing that would put you off is from what I remember, is that they're all short pieces, offering a taste of what could have been a full course meal.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

*** Ah. This fic. You know, this actually inspired me to make [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/67l4vj/what_are_some_dealbreakers_that_make_you_click_x/][this post]] last year.

Like, I understand that this is a humor fic, but Dumbledore's evil scheming in the beginning of Chapter 12, specifically calling Hermione a mud blood, pairing up Harry and Ginny with a life debt orchestrated by allowing Ginny to be possessed, and all the greater good talk, just ended any chance of me going any further with it. I mean a grown up version of Harry Potter demeaning, embarrassing, and degrading a 12 year old Ron Weasley was pretty out of character, but combined with Dumbledore's spiel?

That was a little bit too much for me.

idk, maybe the fic gives more context and it will turn out that it's all to make fun of those tropes, so I'll read a bit more of it, but the bashing and characterization of those characters were just really out there and over the top.

**** And was a monster on the same level as people like Bellatrix(?). This guy literally killed people for their stories, and for those saying erasing memories isn't killing them, it kind of is. Your essentially erasing a pretty big piece of them(after all, the pieces sell books) which means that they are not the person they were which means your killing that identity. He's viewed as an idiot, but to me he's a monster who deserves everything he got in canon.

*** I am aware of this one and its been on my "to read" for a while. But I have yet to get up the energy to read it because:

- A: It's Gilderoy Lockhart (eww)
- B: Its rated T (which concerns me based upon the premise)
- C: Harry still exists and I was concerned how the author would depict Harry seeing himself.

Honestly, the only reason I still want to read it is its depicted as "Humor" and I do like funny crack fics at times.
