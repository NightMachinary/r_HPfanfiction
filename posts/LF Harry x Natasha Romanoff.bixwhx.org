As title suggests I'm looking for fics with this pairing. Have read most of them with ffn's pairing option when choosing filters. So any obscure ones or ones that I may have missed would be greatly appreciated. Also no fem!harry please.


** Probably the best one is linkffn(12649217). It's styled after Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

Even though it'll probably never be finished, I still come back and read it once in a while.

  The best love is found in the most unexpected places in the most unexpected people. (Inspired by Mr. & Mrs. Smith) (Rating for possible future chapters)

  Harry has been through a lot yet there are some perks to being as gifted as he is. So he's not going to just sit back and let the world shit on him. He's going to best the absolute best. First few chapters are hard to read. Get past those and I promise it gets better. Also, I know the beginning sounds very cliche. It's explained later so try to stick with it. M for bad stuff

***** “First few chapters are hard to read” Why put that there instead of changing the chapters? Doesn't give me a lot of faith in the fic to be honest.
