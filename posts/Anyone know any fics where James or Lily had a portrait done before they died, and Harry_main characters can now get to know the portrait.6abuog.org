Failing that, portrait!Sirius also. Most portrait characters I've seen in fics have been from the distant past, or old second cousins and grand-uncles and the like.


** Linkffn(yes, I am Harry's brother) had a portrait of Lily that was painted before her wedding, so it lacked crucial plot knowledge.

** linkffn(1875189) was an interesting variation on portrait fics. YMMV on the rest of the story (and the unlikely friendships that form in it), but I found it pretty neat. Arsinoe's fics always had a way of drawing me in, no matter the main characters.

Just note that it was written /before/ the series was finished, which accounts for any discrepancies with canon.

Edit: Didn't see the deleted reply in this thread that has this fic as a recommend until after I posted.

*** I'm glad to see it recommended though, I'd known the title but didn't realise it was an Arsinoe fic. I love her work, so I'm definitely reading this one now :D

** Oh, I remember seeing this concept when I read linkffn(Harry Potter And The Bonds Of Time by Vance McGill). I wouldn't say it's a major part of the story at all, but it was there!
