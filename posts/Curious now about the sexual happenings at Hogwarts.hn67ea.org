  Are the fanfictions far far off or was Hogwarts way tamed down for the audience?

It really depends on the individual. I knew a girl who was openly asking pretty much everyone about sex, masturbation and the like as well as her own experience at age ~14. I also knew a girl who waited two + years (18-21) before she slept with her boyfriend. Same goes for guys, some are basically Barney Stinson and aim to fuck everything that moves, others went through their entire education without as much as making a female friendship. There's plenty of middle ground.

So for Hogwarts, you'd probably have some who sleep around, some who look for long-term relationships, some who aren't interested at all and some who aren't lucky when it comes to relationships. The castle presents the opportunity though, some 300 teenagers and 10 adults makes things rather easy, and the amount of room there is (the grounds, abandoned classrooms, storage rooms, bathrooms and so on) helps as well.

** Actually there were about 1000 students at Hogwarts.

** I think a lot more than snogging happened in those broom cupboards, but I don't think that's the case for Ron.

I also think Hogwarts was tamed, but not entirely for the audience. JKR either kept Harry from truly dating for the sake of the trio or she just struggled with that side of a super famous, teenage jock. That's not to say Harry should have been having large amounts of sex, but there's a middle ground between that and how she wrote his teenage years.

*** Just because there's supply doesn't mean that there's demand. Because I don't see Harry going for the "Romilda Vane" type, even if he could have.

**** That's not what I meant. A "What happened to Bromance" thing is highly unlikely given Harry's personality. What I was getting at was there's a middle between him having sex with every girl who trapped him under the mistletoe and him avoiding/turning /all/ of them down or only seeking out 2.

** Well Hogwarts was majorly toned down as the books were written for kids up to young teens not older teens or adults so therefore the concept of sex in the books was toned down by the author to snogging as the upper limit. But come on. Hogwarts had to be a hotbed for sex (unless there was a real magical reason not to partake).

Consider you had kids age 11-18, at a co-ed boarding school for ~9 months of the year ( over 2 month summer break, over 2 weeks winter break). Where there were so few adults they had to have 13 pairs of older students patrol the school at night (head boy and girl, and then boy and girl prefects for 5th, 6th, and 7th year for each house).

I know when I and my various friends started having sex and it was well within the "years" covered by Hogwarts. Imagine having access to empty classrooms, secret passages, large school grounds. Then add things like the Room of Requirements etc., and little adult supervision and I'm sure I would have started much earlier than I did (which was still very early).

So unless the school and grounds were charmed to lower/reduce/restrict everyone's libido, or everyone was potioned at meals, or everyone was told how detrimental to their magic/health was premarital sex then Hogwarts had to be awash in teenage hormones.

I would also expect that sex crimes would be high unless somehow the school protected against it what with love potions, confundus charms, and obliviation. Especially when you consider the spawn of deatheaters was taught to look down on everyone else, and if they want something it's their right to take it. Add Dumbledore's everyone deserves a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 500th chance and I see little in canon to stop someone from following that path.

You would hope the adults would take steps to prevent that kind of thing but considering they took no steps to stop firing hexes in the hallways, or to stop bullying I doubt they did anything to protect the students from sexual assault.

** I went to a real-world boarding school of the same age range and about the same size. I remember there being /one/ pregnancy in the five years I was there. I suppose it's possible some were hushed up but none were ever visible, no girls mysteriously disappeared. There were plenty of relationships, but hardly any teenage boys boasting to their mates about losing their virginity, so I think it's reasonable to say that there was far less sex than most outsiders would think.

*** How avaliable was birth control? Because I think that this would be a rather significant factor.
