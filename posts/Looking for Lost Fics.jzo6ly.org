:END:
Hi, there are a couple of Hinny stories I read a long time ago but can't seem to find anywhere. Does anyone know the titles?

Here are the plots.

1). Ginny is possessed by Voldemort even after the chamber. She is enrolled in Beaxbatons but runs away. She is brought back home and falls for Harry. Meanwhile, she has learned wandless magic and become powerful.

2). Harry is a healer and Ginny is a curse breaker. They meet at a Muggle railway station and fight some kind of zombies.

3). I only vaguely remember the plot but the prose of this fic was fabulous. It's summer and Harry lives with Weasleys. He gets a black rose or something which is very ominous. Meanwhile, Ron keeps pushing Harry towards Ginny.

I would be grateful if anyone knows them.

Thanks.
