Immortal!Death!Harry gets summoned to an alternate world where his still-very-much-mortal self has yet to defeat Voldemort. They immediately develop a "relationship" based on the fact that Alive!Harry is the only one Death!Harry can actually touch without instantly killing them, and their relationship consists of - /gasp/ - hugs and hand-holding.

  A strange child has become interested in an even stranger lady. She comes and goes as she pleases, but his fondness for her always stays the same. He may be scrawny, but he would get her attention.
