Do we know for a fact that veritaserum does actually compel the person who takes it to fully answer the question or is it simply that you cannot lie while dosed? All the time in fics we see that people have to excuse why veritaserum isn't your go to in every criminal case from the reasonable ethical argument "you shouldn't force someone to self incriminate" to the weaker "but but occlumency exists therefore we don't know whether its working" (not what occlumency does). Could the real reason veritaserum is never used in trials is that it's perfectly possible for the person on trial to answer "I don't wish to answer that" after all that /is/ truthful.

Sidenote: in the case of one Crouch Junior we can say that a combination of his elation at the resurrection of wizard Hitler, his plans success and veritaserum all in totality led to him babbling his plans if we are to follow my above thesis.

This is canon. One reason Veritaserum isn't used in trials is because occlumency is a defense against it.

The answer to your question is both. The drinker is compelled to answer the question and cannot lie unless they are skilled in Occlumency.

*** I do still think that the defence should be able to ask for Veritaserum during trial. Just like lie detector tests in real life, it's not completely foolproof but it would at least (hopefully) lead to further investigation into the alleged events.

Source? Because I'm fairly sure canon never even approaches the topic.

***** I actually disagree slightly with this interpretation, as a grammatical/structural matter. Harry makes two separate alternative suggestions: Legilimency and Veritaserum. Dumbledore counteracts each separately and in order: Slughorn's Occlumency talent is the response to the suggestion of using Legilimency, and his carrying of an antidote is the response to the suggestion of using Veritaserum. I don't think you can legitimately infer from this that Occlumency is also relevant to Veritaserum.

Edited: what I mean to say is, I don't think you can legitimately infer from this that /Dumbledore is implying that/ Occlumency is also relevant to Veritaserum. His reference to Occlumency is a response to Harry's suggestion of using Legilimency.

***** Thanks, I'd forgotten about that scene. I do think it's pretty clear that Occlumency is the defense against Legilimency while the antidote is the defense against Veritaserum, though.

*** Fair enough on the canonicity although that's the kind of thing I would most likely change for my own headcanons, bc in all honesty I find it hard to square 'clearing the mind and focusing' with 'being drugged up so much you would spill your innermost secrets' as for the snape quote again, touch√® but I'm starting to think I should have tagged this as a prompt for an alternate version of veritaserum functionality lol, that quote comes across more to me as one of shapes "bottling glory" brags rather than 100% accurate

*** I don't think canon ever links Veritaserum to Occlumency. Occlumency is just the opposite of Legilimency. One helps you block your mind against intrusion while the other intrudes on your mind. Veritaserum is a potion that makes you spill secrets (whether through questioning or just like alcohol rendering you unable to keep your mouth shut is unclear) so completely different animal.

** it should also be noted, on top of what everyone else is saying, the term 'truth' is VERY subjective and changes depending on the individual.

If a person truly, and honestly, believe a lie, no matter how insane, he will tell the lie under influence of the truth potion. Basically if you gave an actual flat-earther a truth-potion, they would tell you the earth is flat.\\
That is another reason why it is unreliable as hell.

** Occlumency isn't even the only way to deal with Veritaserum: The subject could be Memory Charmed to recall events differently than they actually happened, maybe Confunded (not Conf*o*unded!) into believing a falsehood, or perhaps even Imperiused to say whatever their puppet-master wants them to say. I'm pretty sure there's also stated to be an antidote in book 6 (thus why Dumbledore can't just dose Slughorn to ask about the Horcruxes).

** The problem with Veritaserum is that it doesn't provide /objective/ truth. Someone dosed with Veritaserum can only ever provide the 'truth' as the they know it, perhaps even worse, it might only provide the truth as that person believes it.

Aside from that, the issue with things like Veritaserum and Pensieve viewing, is that in the magical world, seeing is not believing. With Transfiguration, Illusions, potions like the Polyjuice and even time-travel, the simple fact of the matter is that someone can't ever be certain that what they saw is what actually happened.

That's not to say that truth potions and memory viewing isn't useful, it's just that they aren't the slam dunk that they might appear to be.

** I think that /pure/ Veritaserum can be fought with Occlumancy in a kinda U can use it to not answer at all. But headcanon says and I'm pretty sure I read that somewhere is mixed with a sufficient powerful babbling potion U would be compelled to say /something/ and then the Veritaserum kicks in and that /something/ is true.

An from what I remember out of canon it would make sense.

** As I responded to another user, occlumency is never linked in canon to veritaserum. There may be an explanation of why it's not more often used... Kruschev for example said that Stalin would often get people really drunk at his parties so that they'd start spilling their secrets so he used to drink a lot to develop a tolerance to alcohol. I think something along those lines may be an explanation. Furthermore BCJ was under Imperius for almost 12 years and then spent another pretending to be someone he was not so his mind could have been quite weakened.
