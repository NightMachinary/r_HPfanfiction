Do you guys happen to know some fics where Bellatrix goes through the hardship of getting a redemption ? Not fics where she's good from the start but where she has to redeem herself and clearly work for it. (I kinda like the redemption trope if well written)

Pairing does not that matter, if there is any.


** I like her redemption here. Sheâ€˜s young, so she's not too far gone yet.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
