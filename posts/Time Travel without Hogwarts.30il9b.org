I was wondering if there are any stories where Harry (and/or others) are being sent back / send themselves back in time, but /don't/ go to Hogwarts to repeat seven years of things they already know. Thanks in advance!

Summary: Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours.

Fairly interesting fic, in which harry goes to the past to kill voldemort when he was a baby, after the wizarding world is destroyed in the wizarding war. He ends up fighting in world war 2 against grimdenwald.

Summary: Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3928184/1/Destiny-Redefined][Destiny Redefined]] is awesome. It is post epilogue and unlike any other time travel fic I've ever read. Even the mechanics of time travel are different.

There's also /Wastelands of Time/, which is quite good but has very little to do with canon. You can pretty much replace the name of the characters and it reads as an original story -- I would hesitate to call it a /Harry Potter/ fanfic at all.

** There's "Time Heals All Wounds", a /superb/ Bellatrix/Hermione fic, but I won't reveal any details.
