It's a common trope in fanfiction that Sirius Black's lack of a trial was a serious miscarriage of justice, and as soon as he gets one, he'd obviously be freed. But from what we've seen of the wizarding criminal justice system in canon, I don't think a trial would have made any difference.

Hagrid is sent to Azkaban during the CoS fiasco, because the Ministry had to seem like they were doing something

#+begin_quote
  "Look, Albus," said Fudge, uncomfortably. "Hagrid's record's against him. Ministry's got to do something - the school governors have beenin touch -"
#+end_quote

Bagman gets a trial, and gets to speak in his defense, but seems to get off mainly because he's a popular Quidditch star (although he was actually innocent).

#+begin_quote
  “Yes?” barked Crouch.

  “We'd just like to congratulate Mr. Bagman on his splendid performance for England in the Quidditch match against Turkey last Saturday,” the witch said breathlessly.

  Mr. Crouch looked furious. The dungeon was ringing with applause now. Bagman got to his feet and bowed, beaming.
#+end_quote

During the trial of Crouch Jr and the Lestranges, there doesn't seem to be any opportunity for Crouch Jr to defend himself--Crouch Sr levels the accusations against him, the jury votes, and he's sent to Azkaban.

#+begin_quote
  “Mother!” screamed the boy below, and the wispy little witch beside Crouch began to sob, rocking backward and forward. “Mother, stop him, Mother, I didn't do it, it wasn't me!”

  “I now ask the jury,” shouted Mr. Crouch, “to raise their hands if they believe, as I do, that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban!”

  In unison, the witches and wizards along the right hand side of the dungeon raised their hands. The crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for Bagman, their faces full of savage triumph.
#+end_quote

There could have been more to the trial off-screen, but according to Dumbledore, there was never any conclusive evidence of Crouch Jr's guilt at the time:

#+begin_quote
  “Then Mr. Crouch's son might not have been involved?” said Harry slowly.

  Dumbledore shook his head. “As to that, I have no idea.”
#+end_quote

Then at the end of GoF, Crouch Jr is summarily executed on the order of the Minister, with no judicial process at all. We know he's a loyal death eater of course, but it still doesn't give a good impression of the wizarding justice system.

Everything we see of the justice system suggests it's very arbitrary and capricious. There's no due process, and no magical verification of truth by veritaserum/legilimency/pensieves. It's never explained why they don't use those things--perhaps they just aren't reliable.

So what would have actually happened if Sirius was given a trial? He may have been too depressed to even try to defend himself, but even if he tried, he had no evidence. "You've got to believe me Crouch, I wasn't the secret keeper, it was Peter, who's secretly a rat." For all Sirius knew, Peter accidentally blew himself up, and his story could never be verified, until he realized Peter was hiding out with the Weasley's.


** If Sirius was given a trial he most certainly would be found guilty.

Like they literally found laughing, surrounded by a bunch of corpses, with over fifty eyewitnesses proclaiming to have seen him cornering Peter Pettigrew, who called Sirius out for betraying the Potters, before seemingly exploding and from whom they only found pieces, that is in addition to the evidence Dumbledore gave about being told that Sirius was the secret keeper of the Potters.

Like even if he tells his story he has no proof for it and he would have to reveal himself as an unregistered Animagus which is punishable by a sentence to Azkaban.

Yeah, admitting to a criminal act that you have concealed for a number of years already is not a great start to a defence which rests entirely on the premise of "you should take my word on this, even though all the witness evidence is against me".

The wizarding legal system isn't great, but even if Sirius were given a fair trial to the standards of Muggle Britain, he's going down. The only way he's getting out of it is producing Pettigrew as evidence.

#+end_quote

There is no way any of these things could be used positively during a trial in a world where mind control and memory manipulation exist :

- Unbreakable Vows (in canon at least) can only be used to make a promise for the future. You can Vow that you won't kill someone, but you can't Vow that you didn't kill him in the past.
- Veritaserum can be bypassed. You can manage to ingest the antidote before replying to the question, use magic to block the potion in your throat, or even transfigure the potion into plain water the moment it touches your lips (according the Rowling anyways).\\
  And even if you can't do any of that, the potion only force you to say that you think is truth. If you kill someone and then got Obliviated of the crime, you can say you didn't do it even under the potion.
- Pensieve and Legilimency have the same problem. Someone skilled enough can modify his memories to change the truth.

The problem of Sirius (outside of all the incriminating evidences) is that he is believed to be the secret right hand man of Voldemort. Any other proof other than an alive Pettigrew (and even then I wouldn't like his chances) would be ignored with a "The Dark Lord must have taught him some of his tricks, we can't believe this".

****** I think unbreakable vows could still be used. Just vow to only say the truth for the length of the trial or something like that. There is still a chance that it would not work if a person was oblivated before and only thinks what they are saying is true but at least it would probably make the jury unsure and they would investigate more. Also in Sirius specific case he went from the crime scene straight to prison so if they would assume he was obliviated it had to be one of the probably few ministry people who had contact with him. And checking if that was the case can‘t be that hard. Also, if Sirius had the chance to explain himself there is a good chance that at least Dumbledore would have believed him or at least considered him telling the truth. Not sure what Dumbledore would do then but it has to be worth something.

******* An unbreakable vow isn't actually unbreakable. You can break it whenever you want, but then you die. It's not like the Aes Sedai Oath Rod where you're literally incapable of breaking the oath. So if you enforce the witness oath with an unbreakable vow, you're basically giving them a death sentence for saying anything even slightly untrue. Word something badly, just because you're nervous, and you don't get a chance to correct yourself. You're already dead.

******** I think there would be a way to phrase the vow so that a person does not drop dead the moment they accidently say something slightly untrue. Maybe it would be enough to let them vow that they don‘t intentionally lie or say something untrue. Then there wouldn‘t be the danger of dying because of a simpel mistake. Also they could first vow and then take veritaserum so that all they have to do ist follow what the potion wants them to say. Would be rather stupid to fight it in that scenario. Or let them vow to take veritaserum and not fight or influence its effect. That means they could not accidently say something untrue and die plus they also could not intentionally lie.

****** Rowling is such a retconner. She just didn't think a lot of things through very well and then has to come up with ridiculous explanations for it later. Obviously they should have used veritaserum and a pensieve. No matter their flaws, if you get enough people to be questioned under veritaserum and/or submit penseive memories, it will all add up. It would take a massive cover up for dozens of people to all have their memories modified and/or transfigure the potion, etc. Sure, it could happen, but that's not a good reason to not use every tool for finding the truth available.

*** I'm not sure it's that clear-cut. I think a lot would hinge on how good of a legal counsel -- or whichever way people can defend themselves -- he got. Also on how many favours he could call in resp. people he could bribe.

For starters, the Imperio defense is a thing, of course. Black is not a lesser family name than Malfoy. But even assuming he wanted to present the truth as a case, there are openings. Sirius didn't blow up the street, Peter did. Consequently, it's not his magic and his wand that was used, and we know you (or at least Dumbledore, for the former) can check that.

The eyewitnesses were Muggles, any counsel worth is pay is going to get /that/ bit of evidence discarded. Another important question is who cast the Fidelius. It's never said, and neither are the specific mechanics explained, but if you could get an expert to testify you can't at the same time cast it and be the Secret Keeper, you only need another witness stating that Peter was a near-squib, ruling out the possibility of /him/ casting the charm, and you've got another crack in the narrative.

Then, of course, you need lots of witnesses describing how James and Sirius "were like brothers", and that Peter was always just a tag-along, so that the framing is right. Helpful would also be a reference that no /other/ convicted Death Eater knows of him, considering he was also cast as "Voldemort's right hand". Etc. pp. It's definitely an uphill battle, but I don't think it's absolutely impossible.

Really, the most important thing any legal counsel or representant has to do is to *keep Sirius' mouth shut*, so that he doesn't go confessing "it's all my fault" because of whatever exasperating Gryffindor martyrdom is going on in his head (or alternatively laugh like a loon and look like Bellatrix).

***** Sure, but now -- just as you do -- you are arguing the case. Which already is a step up from "there's nothing to argue". And they don't have to convince everyone, just a majority. Or even less than that, if they can bribe the rest. And really, we have the perspective of hindsight. But at the moment, before the fact, the assertion "Sirius Black betrayed James Potter" isn't really more outrageous than "It wasn't Sirius but Peter", since no one knew anything about Sirius other than that he was James' best friend.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if in a hypothetical trial, even in absence of /any/ defence, some Wizengamot members voted to acquit.

For the sake of playing this through:

#+begin_quote

Yes, well. This assumes you are concerned about the /truth/. If you are already using that defence, the trick is produce enough paid-for expert testimony saying that works, enough to convince enough votes in your favour, that is.

#+end_quote

Indeed. Which is why it's not an acquittal guarantee, but one block to build a case. And Peter's wand would certainly be invaluable. Word-of-god is, I think, that the wand doesn't go anywhere when you transform; so you better be able to transform without it and put it somewhere safe beforehand, or have a form where you can do that afterwards. So if Rat!Peter didn't carry away his wand in his mouth, it even should be at the scene.

#+begin_quote
  Why would they?

Because it's /Muggles/. When /Hagrid's/ opinion is "never notice nuthin, do they?", a panel of old purebloods can't possibly think that Muggle testimony is in any way admissable.

Can't argue this, as we don't know. Need another expert to testify it can't be cast by the people involved in the hidden secret, maybe. In any case if there is some mechanical reason that helps it should, if not, make one up and hope it helps.

You are not thinking like a lawyer, which is probably the bottomline for this exchance. The point is not what's /true/. Not even in Canon the point is what's true, because Sirius factually is innocent, obviously. The point is to present a credible story -- credible enough so that it beats the /other/ credible story of "Sirius betrayed his best friend" for enough Wizengamot votes to escape convinction. "Peter was stil one of their closest friends" is what /we/ know. Everyone else knows shit all. Get Madam Rosmerta in there saying “Pettigrew... that fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at Hogwarts?” (PoA) and some random paid-off students casting a negative light on him. This works, far better than it should.

#+begin_quote
  Snape actually mentioned how only Voldemort knew the identity of every Death Eater, considering that he was a spy Dumblerdore and the Ministry would also know this.
#+end_quote

It's not direct evidence in any case, since they hardly could attest he /wasn't/ something, but it's just one more more chip in the story the other side presents.

And obviously, if a deal could be struck with Dumbledore before the trial, if /he/ could be convinced, somehow, then chances are suddenly much better. It's probably even easier to convince Dumbledore on circumstantial evidence that Sirius is innocent than the Wizengamot, because that is basically what happens in PoA. So this should really be the first step in any defence -- convince those that are sympathetic to you, and whose word carries weight, to speak in favour of you.

As for Headcanon, one of the few tropes I agree with is that there must be /some/ form of legal representation. Most of the world uses either Roman Law or Common Law, so there is legal representation, of course. I think, traditionally, in Shariah courts there is not, but it's definitely the exception, and the presecutor has a different (not adversarial) role. In any case, even there it's not forbidden.

Snape describes Occlumency as 'The magical defense of the mind against external penetration.' a potion that attacks the mind and forces them to act in a certain way definetly falls among that, Rowling also confirmed it.

  The number of people in the series who are capable of doing wandless magic at will is zero. Not even Voldemort or Dumbledore are capable of this - they do every spell with a wand.
#+end_quote

Thats false, wandless magic has been seen used many times in the books, not only by Dumbledore but also by people like Quirrell, Lupin and even Tom the owner of the Leaky Cauldron. Its simply much more restricted than magic with a wand, but since there is an entire school in Africa where people learn magic that way in addition to wand magic, its reasonable to assume that a wizard like Sirius could use it.

** My main argument for Sirius isn't that he should get a trial, it's that the leader of a semi-secret vigilante group should really interrogate the supposed spy in his organisation on exactly what information he's given to the still-free, still-active Death Eaters that could just wait for the Order to lower their guard, then go after them all. Just leaving him in a cell, trial or no, is real stupid.

Also, mind-control is a thing, and apparently a popular thing at that. Unless the whole 'trying to kill Snape with Remus' thing switched Dumbledore off Sirius permanently, then it makes sense to at least check if your seemingly-secretly evil friend/comrade is actually secretly evil or just mind-fucked.

The only reasonable argument I've heard for Dumbledore not pushing for a trial is fear that Sirius would bribe his way free and get custody of Harry out of the deal, since Dumbledore believes in the Blood Wards at Privet Drive.

** There is a huge difference between incompetent and biased courts and complete miscarriage of justice. And there is a difference between trial in times of the war (or nearly post war), and the trial in times of assumed peace.

Besides:

- Hagrid's case: yes, this is completely horrible thing comparable to the Sirius' case, except I always thought it was meant only as a window-dressing, and that Fudge expected to do exactly what he in reality did: let him go when the crisis finishes. But, yes, this is horrible unlawful injustice.

- Bagman's case: I would say that this case was actually quite alright. Yes, jury is biased towards famous people, but that's reality of the trial by jury (no, I won't get into fight between trial by jury and trial by judges discussion; there are advantages on both sides). Moreover, I haven't heard much about any strong evidence supporting the claim that he was Death Eater. So, the only thing going against him is that he was a gambler and altogether unpleasant person, which is not crime.

- Barty Crouch Jr.: this is very bad, obviously, and quite probably he shouldn't be thrown to Azkaban for life, but on the other hand, he actually most likely was guilty (assuming he was caught somewhere in the vicinity of the Longbottoms' house, which I have always believed was the case), at least as an accessory to something which he had to know could end up in torture if not killing, and he was a willing member of the illegal/terrorist organization. Yes, it was serious miscarriage of justice (everybody has right to talk to his defence, conflict of interest between a judge and defendant), but nothing on the level of Sirius' case.

- Summary execution of Barty Crouch Jr.: on the other hand, I have nothing good to say about this one. Fudge should go straight to Azkaban for life for the murder by abusing his authority without passing Start and without collecting £200.

- Harry's hearing for the use of underage magic: yes, I don't like it (especially statement “Laws could be changed” should make immediate stop to his political career, and he should be thrown out of his office immediately), but it is worthy to notice that even with influence of Lucius Malfoy, Harry was in the end declared innocent, so even Fudge on the peak of his career was not able to go openly against justice of the case.

My conclusion is that if the Sirius trial happened, he had to be declared innocent, and of course he would be screwed but not allowing him compensation for his years in Azkaban and perhaps some other minor harassment, but I cannot imagine him not going free.

Even if escape from prison was a crime punished by execution, it would be no way legal for a random police office just shooting such escapee. He would have to be comprehended, rearrested, brought to judicial authorities, and then perhaps executed in the government sponsored way. The Kiss on Sight order was possible only because Dementors were hard to control (even though, theoretically they were perfectly under the control of the Ministry in PoA, they still almost killed Harry couple of times), but there is no way how it could be legal for the government official to actually brought a Dementor to place where the prisoner was already apprehended (not mentioning it was a school full of kids), and who needed to be interrogated.

#+end_quote

Quite. Or rather, there is no formalised process. There /can/ be all that, but sometimes there isn't. It's very individual. I've always been a fan of the approach that the Wizengamot, as a body, doesn't really have any specific rule or function. It can do whatever it wants. If they get together and decide by majority you're a criminal, then you are.

Of course, this also works in reverse. I don't think Sirius needs a trial to be freed. He just needs to be freed, and that's that.

.

As for the Ministry, they seem to have a fairly extensive power issuing decrees. The way I see e.g. the Hagrid situation is that they can ship him to Azkaban, and if he doesn't like that, he can take it up with the Wizengamot, which certainly has the ability to overrule that ... which is to say, that /would/ be a way for him if he wasn't Hagrid the half giant, and people actually cared enough.

Otherwise, even if someone can testify that Pettigrew was the secret keeper or as all those Indy!Harry fics love to do if the Potters will mention that Peter was their secret keeper, that's great and all, but Sirius isn't just in for betraying his friends to Voldemort, he's also in for mass murder.

A lot of fics also just have Sirius take Veritaserum when he gets a trial, but if it were that easy there would be no one in the wizarding world who is ever wrongfully convicted. The imperious defense from canon would have never worked if Veritaserum were 100% reliable, so if we assume the people in charge aren't morons it means either Veritaserum can be circumvented somehow, or isn't allowed in trials or something similar.

** I think there's a chance he could have gotten off, despite the seeming weight of the evidence against him.

He could have testified under Veritaseurum (possibly backed up by pensieve memories) that he was innocent, and about Pettigrew. Even if Pettigrew escaped, and keeping in mind that veritaseurum isn't foolproof, Lupin could corroborate that they were animaguses, as could potentially Snape (though Snape might lie to screw over Black if Dumbledore didn't force him not to, and Lupin's testimony as a werewolf probably wouldn't carry much weight). Ultimately, Black doesn't have to prove beyond all doubt that he's innocent- he just needs to plant enough doubt about his guilt for a majority of the Wizengamot to have an excuse to vote not guilty. He's from an old, rich pureblood family- my guess is that would be enough to get him let off if there was any reasonable doubt as to his guilt.

The main thing working against him is probably the fact that in the immediate aftermath of the Potters' deaths and then Pettigrew's atrocity blowing up a street full of Muggles, people will be out for blood. They can't drag Voldemort into court and condemn him, as he's apparently dead. If they can't get Pettigrew either, Sirius makes a convenient scapegoat to sate the public's desire for action and vengeance, to hold /somebody/ accountable for the atrocities of the war, and to prove that the Ministry is serious about cracking down on Voldemort's followers.

That and the fact that Black was wracked with guilt at the time, and probably didn't make much effort to defend himself, much less to use a family heritage he loathed to do so.

In most fics that treat the subject a bit seriously, there is a lot of circumstantial evidences against Sirius :

#+begin_quote
  Like they literally found laughing, surrounded by a bunch of corpses, with over fifty eyewitnesses proclaiming to have seen him cornering Peter Pettigrew, who called Sirius out for betraying the Potters, before seemingly exploding and from whom they only found pieces, that is in addition to the evidence Dumbledore gave about being told that Sirius was the secret keeper of the Potters.

When Dumbledore is evil, it's easy because he needs Sirius away from Harry (and possibly the gold from the Potter/Black) and when Dumbledore is good, it is him (I think) who made the fidelius charm and don't know about switching the Keepers, so he has no reason to suspect anything. Sirius being broken by the betrayal doesn't help

The only thing I see that could innocent Sirius would be his memories, but it's easy to imagine Death Eaters like Malfoy blocking this defence because they don't want /their/ memories to be viewed... and yeah, he would still go to prison for being an illegal animagus (don't know how long)

It's canon that Sirius believes that he received no trial. It's also canon that Dumbledore "gave evidence" of the fact that Sirius was the secret keeper. So it sounds like some sort of quasi-judicial proceedings were held in which evidence was presented in Sirius' absence.
