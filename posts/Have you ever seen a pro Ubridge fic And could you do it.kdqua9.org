I have seen fics that redeem, justify, or are atleast favorable to literally every character except Umbridge. Granted in some of them the characters are so out of character they may as well be OCs but that's besides the point.

But how would you do it? Could you?

As for me I'd keep her unpleasant personality but have that get in her own way & have her make actual improvements to Hogwarts.


** Junior Inquisitor, if memory serves correct. A story with a brilliant premise and a horrifying execution.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

** I read one that was /sort of/ pro-Umbridge? The basic premise was that somehow Umbridge discovered Harry with the Dursleys when he was still a kid. Because of how badly they treat him, Umbridge petitions for custody and gets it.

Even though Umbridge doesn't treat Harry super well, he still prefers her to the Dursleys because:

1). He's given good food, a bedroom, new clothes, etc.

2). He's provided with opportunities to learn about Wizarding society and magic.

3). Umbridge sets clear rules for Harry's behavior. He knows what will get him punished and what will get him praised. This framework (as Umbridge-like as it is) makes him feel secure because he feels like he has more control over his environment and what happens to him.

At first, Umbridge doesn't care about Harry at all except for the positive attention she gets from being Harry's guardian. As time goes on, she /does/ end up having /some/ affection for him (albeit it's a long, long way away from unconditional love, it's at least some kind of positive interaction, which he didn't get from the Dursleys.)

So while I wouldn't call the story pro-Umbridge exactly, it's not anti-Umbridge either. I'd say it takes her personality, as portrayed in the books, and puts her in a situation where that can actually have a somewhat positive impact, if that makes sense.

I'm sorry I've forgotten the name of the story, but maybe someone else will know. It's definitely worth a read.

** The story The Real Us by Seel'vor on fanfiction.net (can't direct link story due to rule 8) has Umbridge being friends with the marauders and actually being one of the "good guys" who acts like a bad guy. Eg her sending the muggleborns to registration camps is actually sending them to vacation camps to protect them.

** Don't remember the name of the fic (I think it included "Inquisitor" but was not "Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitor"), but it had Umbridge infiltrating Fudge's inner circle on Amelia Bones' behalf. She gives Harry Veritaserum and is horrified at what she learns.

** I think you'd have to tone down the child torture but you could depict Umbridge as in over her head trying to:-

- Teach, for which she has no training or aptitude.
- Investigate Dumbledore's secret society which, from her point of view, uses Hogwarts as a recruiting ground and has infiltrated the Auror department.
- Control a school of children whose parents are preparing for civil war. In canon the Gryffindors are far more violent than their opponents (e.g. Montague/vanishing cabinet).
