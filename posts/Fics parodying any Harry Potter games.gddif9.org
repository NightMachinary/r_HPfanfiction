For example, a gamer fic using the mechanics from Hogwarts Mystery. Or maybe a fic featuring the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Bean_Bonus_Room][Bean Bonus Room]] from the original games


** Ron just becomes a guy running around shouting “a bean!” all the time.

*** It's still better than Ron bashing.

Harry keeps dropping pillars on Quirrell's head.

The classes involve a death course (Much better than Masteries, Hogwarts provides all the training needed to get started as a dark lord.)

**** The death courses will need an obscene amount of jumping an convenient ledges to collect a specific number of an item that is irrelevant to the spell taught. When completed, the student will immediately gain all knowledge of the spell.

Naturally, Harry is always sent in first.

Furthermore, should he enter the library for whatever reason, Percy Weasley will attempt to subdue him. This rule only applies to Harry.

****** Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (PS2). I'm pretty sure there was a convenient hole to crawl through that took you to a bathroom with Fred and George selling stuff for beans. Speaking of currency, Harry also becomes an avid collector of WIZARD CARDS which can be found in random chests throughout Hogwarts, Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley that can only be accessed via an obstacle course and using spells that Harry just happened to be taught 20 minutes ago.
