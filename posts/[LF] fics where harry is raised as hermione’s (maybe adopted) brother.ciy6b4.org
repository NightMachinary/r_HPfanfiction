  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.
