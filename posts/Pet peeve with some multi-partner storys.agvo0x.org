It might just be me but in some fics that shows Harry head over heels with a witch when Suddenly she says “Oh, here is my secret lover/girlfriend.” And he just like ok that's awesome! I just can't imagine a normal response like that in any scenario in which he is ok with his love interest being with another person. It just makes me cringe when I read that, it (to me) makes the character seems just wholeheartedly weak.


** I can't really get behind a "reveal" like that either.

Knowing /one/ threesome relationship, I can only say that if it works it A) grows out a mutual bond of friendship and B) depends on not double, but at least quadruple the effort necessary to make even a normal 1 on 1 relationship work.

I'll get behind some sort of forced "I have to have X wifes" thing because its stupid, and I sometimes like stupid. However, I'd wish there would be a fic out there in which that conglomerate of wifes creates extreme tension, just a plethora of conflict. Lets take a Lord Potter fic, for example. He has Daphne, Hermione, Tonks, Fleur and Susan, for good measure. First conflict would just instantly be how the household is led. Daphne would insist on houseelves, Hermione would go apeshit on that decision. She'd be overruled by the mostly wizard-raised women, but Harry then decides in her favor because they are best buddies. Daphne then uses her seat on the Wizengamot (because of course they have that) to go against Harry and says no to houseelve rights legislation. And so on and so forth. Just absolute chaos.

** I enjoy a multi story from time to time, but the emotional part of the relationship is often not handled well. An explanation of why the multi is necessary is generally handled okay. Lord of multiple houses, soul bond, marriage contracts, binding healing ritual, etc. All offer a reasonable explanation of why the multi exists in the first place.

However I rarely see a story that portrays the characters dealing with this unconventional relationship. All too often we see a short inner monologue and a character saying “it's not what I dreamt of as a little girl, but it's better than not having you at all” or something similar and all is right as rain. No jealousy, bitterness or resent. Especially in more serious fics this is a big oversight.

*** I'd argue that the justification used is often unnecessarily complicated and bashes real polyamory. A lot of stories would be greatly improved if you ditched the "pureblood culture" pretense and had the relationship develop out of a deep friendship and not because some archaic law tells Harry he has to marry two girls.

I mean, what do you think will, in most cases, be the better Harry/Hermione/Tonks story, a 17th century marriage contract butting into an established relationship or Tonks living with Harry/Hermione for a few years after the war and they slowly grow closer?

That being said your suggested version of a realistic setup would also be something I'd be very interested in reading, but I've not really seen anything like that. Most of the natural multi stories (that don't force people to be in a multi for one reason or another) tend to make a bit of a mockery out of the thing.

****** Yes, but alcohol does just fine for that. I mean, suppose after the war Harry and Hermione are living at Grimmauld and gave one of the rooms to Lavender because she was treated badly for being a werewolf. After a year or two they get drunk one evening and wake up with Lavender naked in between them the next morning. There would probably some awkwardness, but as long as no one regrets what had happened (and assuming some bisexuality), it would not be unreasonable to have a repeat a few days/weeks later, and another one, and another one, and oh crap, they start to develop deeper feelings for her.

I mean, that route would require some existing friendship, but it is way more believable than the "Oh, I have to marry two girls I don't know. Thankfully, with the power of my magic cock, this will not be awkward at all."

***** I have to admit that it is incredibly rare. I can see it happening through a hurt/comfort route after the war, but there is not really much to fall back on.

The best example I can give is "Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass", which masterfully builds up to a Harry/Tonks/Hermione triad and it doesn't even has the actual relationship in it (it is pure Harry/Tonks, everything else is supposed to be in the eventual sequel).

** Generally Multi-stories suffer from poorly developed characters. Most of the time, the various girls are reduced to little but one or two interests and traits as opposed to being deep characters. And their looks are closer to 12/10 than the average because heavens forbid Harry has an average looking GF.

The situation you describe does not come up in the kind of stories I read, probably because I'm not touching anything with Death Eaters in it (I saw it hinted at in several stories with Draco Malfoy as tagged character)

**** I mean, most of the time you start to like the average stuff or the quirks of someone when you get to know them better, so you do not have to make the love interest unreasonably attractive in order for the protagonist to fall for them.

Take Hermione's untamable hair as an example. I'm pretty sure that she does not like it and it would generally not be considered attractive, but at the same time, Harry basically grew up with it and it would be one of the things he immediatly associates with her. It might very well be an unattractive trait, but one to which he is attracted. You can make the same case for odd hairstyles/-colours or protuberant eyes.

** IMO, to have a multi relationship fic to work, either has to be done with humour, as a crack fic OR it has to be a part of a AU where those kind of relationships are established/accepted/known to happen from time to time.

​

No matter how well written it is, a fic where Harry marrie many girls because he is "Lord of Many Houses" is not good enough explanation in my mind, and will only work for me if its a comedy.

​

So, yes when I see a fic trying to be talen seriously and coming up with "soul bond" or "multiple" pairings, it is a red flag for me because I know that 9 out of 10 of the times, the author will not justify enough, explain enough or even deal with the emtional aspects of such relationships and well, i am a sucker for characterization.

​

To my money, the Cult of Dionysus is one of the few fics where the multipe pairing is at the core of the plot and it makes lots of sense taking ito consideration the A.U and Harry´s powers:

Polyamory is a thing in real life, but from what I have heard, two established couples getting together is more common than triads. And that results in very different dynamics than you would expect.

Also, it is very rare if you want something deeper than a third for a threeway from time to time.

**** Polyam is kind of a mixed bag. As someone who has been in a polyam relationship for near about five years now, and involved in the culture for just shy of ten, the relationships an individual polyam person has are as unique as the person having them. There are couples that get together with another couple; there are couples who choose to date a third person (or three people who all agree to date each other); there are individuals who have two (or more!) separate relationships with people who are not dating each other (often called V relationships); there are people who have relationships that, when mapped out, look akin to spider webs of connections (often called open polyam).

If I were to venture a guess, though it's taken from anecdote and personal experience, not data, is that there are more V relationships and open polyam relationships than true triads or sets of couples dating. None of these types of relationships are all that rare though, especially amongst people who already identify as polyamorous.

** I think my biggest issue with multi/harem stories that involve Harry is that he never strikes me as someone that would remotely be into that sort of lifestyle. Luna might be the closest I could see showing those tendencies, but Harry seems really loyal and focused. Additionally, given the family situation he grew up in, it strikes me that he would want one partner with a bunch of kids. The only positive influence he had to witness first hand even up through Hogwarts as a couple were Mr and Mrs Weasley, and that is a couple that was very strongly into each other. The only other positive influence would have been his own parents by way of stories/pictures, and they two seemed very into each other only. The stories of James only ever having eyes for Lily strikes me as something Harry would take to heart and want by virtue of wanting to connect more with his father.

So it always strikes me as odd when you see things like "Harry/Fleur/Hermione/Ginny/McGonagall/Tonks/SusanBones/HannahAbbott/Pansy/Bellatrix/MrsWeasley" as the relationship or whatever. Additionally, the common pairings I tend to see (I mostly read Harry/Tonks fics, as I find that pairing the most balanced and equitable of all the major characters, plus the idea of Tonks with Remus is a little creepy, imo) involves females that strike me as people who would never be interested or accepting of having multiple partners. Hermione doesn't strike me as someone into having multiple partners. Neither does Ginny. Or Fleur. Or any of them if Fleur is one of them, given her Veela nature.

It also bothers me that like, half of all Honks fics are Harem fics.
