I'm looking for stories where Harry gets to Hogwarts, not as a famous hero, but as an orphaned boy looking forward to his magical education.


** This only kinda applies, but since nobody has replied to you yet, I figured I might as well. Harry isn't the BWL, but he still grows up without his parents and with the Dursleys, thus he knows nothing about the wizarding world and nobody treats him as a famous person. It's pretty good, though really dark. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11585823/1/The-Art-of-Self-Fashioning]])

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  In an alternate universe where Harry really did vanquish Voldemort as a child, Harry is sorted to Slytherin. Tired of trying to get along with his housemates, Harry spends his first Christmas at Hogwarts with Hedwig in the Owlery. There, he makes a friend who will stay with him for the rest of his life, and eventually become so much more.

  Massively AU. Assume nothing. Harry Potter is born into a very different world than the one in canon. A world where the Greats of history walk among mere men. A world where power is all that matters, and young Harry Potter is a commodity desired by many.
