** Well, there is Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived. (I can't link because I am on a work computer sorry). At first, Hermione seems fine, but she gets more ruthless as it goes on and the war heats up.

*** Best non-magical AU, but she's not fine right from the start as she 'gaslighted' a serial killer into committing suicide when she was still 11:

#+begin_quote
  And wasn't she a violent criminal? Hadn't she gotten away with murder? Hadn't she been remarkably unremorseful about it? Maybe she really was a jay. Maybe she really was a dangerous, violent monster. Maybe her parents were better off well away from her. Maybe Jenny would hate her if she knew what Hermione had done to find and stop her murderer.”

** Just a suggestion, but you should take out the link to the fic. I'm pretty sure Anti-Heroine has a bunch of underage stuff and you're not allowed to directly link to it bc of that.

  someone mentioned a fic where Hermione's parents are mob doctors and had a dentist practice as a cover up
#+end_quote

I think it was me who wrote that one liner, but I have yet to find a fic featuring her parents as mob doctors.

On the other hand, Grangers are secret agents in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spygirl][Harry Potter and the Spygirl]], linkffn(10959290), and Hermione is anything but 'normal'.

Its author is specialized in writing BAMF Hermiones, such as:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994)

More BAMF Hermiones:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/Escape][Escape]], linkffn(11916243): Harry and Hermione run from a marriage law and clearly direct the war behind the scenes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]], linkffn(12614436): Adorably dark Hermione summons demons and allies with Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]], linkffn(11463030): Super!Hermione carries the war almost by herself.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance][Resistance]], linkffn(2746577): Another super!Hermione carrying the war on her shoulder.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): Badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are thrown into another dimension.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive.
