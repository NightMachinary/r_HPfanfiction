I can't remember the name but Harry cheats on Ginny with Hermione who is with Ron. A few details I remember about it are that Harry and Hermione both work at the Ministry. I think Harry is head of Magical Law Enforcement at the time. They first get together at Harry's house and if I remember correctly there is a time Hermione and Ron(could be Ginny and Harry) have a party and Harry and Hermione get together in the basement; I remember there being a party haha. It's an M rated fic.


** Unlike a Sister.

Sadly it hasn't been updated in a long while. I liked where the author was going with it.

*** I don't remember when Harry and Hermione got together in the basement when they had the dinner party in Unlike a Sister. But, I do think that's what the OP is looking for.

**** This is definitely the fic. I'm probably confusing that part with a different fic.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry told Ron he saw Hermione as his sister. Now Hermione is in danger and Harry's feelings for her begin to change dramatically, jeopardizing everything he once knew. An Epilogue compliant fic. Rated M for sex and language.
