If they're just recordings, there's no point for them to be in the spooky secret department of the ministry. They belong there though if the orbs themselves contain the power of prophecy! When Neville kicks the prophecy and it breaks, Harry no longer has to be the one who lands the final blow, and Dumbledore tries to assassinate him because he's just another horcrux now. Meanwhile, Rookwood pales as he hears Bellatrix tell him the prophecy was broken, because he's sure as hell not telling his lord that anybody can take him down now.

When the Ministry Six break all the shelves of orbs, it scrambles the future and seers around the world stop being able to make predictions. Just a random idea that popped into my head.


** I mean, the point would be for filing and reference purposes - that way everyone who's the subject of a prophecy goes to one place that's under the control of the government (meaning the government can also hear the prophecies). That would be my logic.

But I do like the prompt. Could make a fun 'try to escape the DoM and everything goes wrong fic' or a longer term 'things start to unravel over the next few years' fic. Definitely hope someone picks this up.

Everytime a prophecy is recorded, it solidifies the future a little bit more, which spreads the cause of Order, thus weakening Chaos.

The Ministry Six recieved Blessings of Chaos in the wake of the battle at the Ministry for ruining the plans of Order by all six of them casting reductors into the prophecy balls.

Other than Snape - who would never be able to admit that he overheard it to anyone else - nobody knew of its existence. Why didn't Dumbledore keep it a secret and tell nobody? (Other than, for plot forwarding purposes). I suppose Dumbledore might have done it in case he died, for continuity, but there should have been other ways of achieving that.

** Could have a fic where Voldemort shows up to the Ministry Battle early and makes an offer to Harry. Break the orb and release them from the prophecy and he will spare Harry and his friends from the coming war, assuming they remain neutral. With the prophecy orb gone Harry will never become a true threat to Voldemort. This is a good deal to Voldemort because at this point he still believes nobody else knows of his horcruxes and so while he would technically be vulnerable his horcruxes would still ensure his immortality.

At least, that's what he thinks. As it turns out, magic doesn't like lawyers and people who play off technicalities.

**** No it's not. Canon shows that.

Dumbledore is not the coldhearted bastard people made him. We see that in Goblet of Fire after Cedrics death:

Page 583

#+begin_quote
  ‚Professor,‘ Harry mumbled, ‚where are Mr and Mrs Diggory‘

  ‚They are with Professor Sprout,‘ said Dumbledore. His voice, which had been so calm throughout the interrogation of Barty Crouch, shook slightly for the first time. ‚She was Head of Cedric's house, and knew him best.‘
#+end_quote

We also see in Goblet of Fire, that Dumbledore started planning Harrys survival the exact moment when Voldemort came back:

Page 585

#+begin_quote
  ‚He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's', Harry told Dumbledore. (...)

  For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's eyes. But next second, Harry was sure he had imagined it, for when had returned to his seat behind the desk, he looked as old and weary as Harry had ever seen him.
#+end_quote

We also see that Dumbledore cares for Harry (and for his people in general) in Order of the Phoenix - he is not perfect, but he cares:

Page 762

#+begin_quote
  ‚Voldemort's aim in possessing you, as he demonstrated tonight, would not have been my destruction. It would have been yours. He hoped, when he possessed you briefly a short while ago, that I would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him. So you see, I have been trying, in distancing myself from you, to protect you, Harry. An old man's mistake...‘
#+end_quote

Page 768

#+begin_quote
  ‚I was trying to keep Sirius alive‘, said Dumbledore quietly.

  ‚People don't like being locked up!‘ Harry said furiously, rounding on him. ‚You did it to me all last summer‘

  Dumbledore closed his eyes ad buried his face in his long fingered hands.
#+end_quote

and also Page 768

#+begin_quote
  ‚My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but I realised. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters - and many of them are almost as terrible as he - were still at large, angry, desperate and violent. And I had to make my decision, to with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone for ever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure, too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you.‘
#+end_quote

Dumbledore was sure that Harry would survive and only the fragment of Voldemort's soul inside him will die if all goes according to his master plan. The fact that he knew is evident from his conversation with Harry at 'King's Cross Station' in Deathly Hollows:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore - His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survived, so do you and so does Voldemort's last hope for himself

  Harry - And you knew this? You knew - all along?

  Dumbledore - I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good.

  Dumbledores plan always was to have Harry survive and not die. However, an important part of the plan was Harry willingly choosing 'death' - to save everyone else. Only in choosing death and choosing not to duel with Voldemort, could Harry have killed the portion of Voldemort's soul inside it and also Lily's lingering protection which protected them both. This is also evident from the following lines -

  Harry - But I should have died - I didn't defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!

  Dumbledore - And that, will, I think, have made all the difference.
#+end_quote

The willingness to die without defending himself had to come from Harry. If Harry knew beforehand that letting Voldemort kill him would not harm Harry, the whole protection would have been lost. Harry had to be willing to accept death for the sake of everyone he loved - we see that in a scene following:

#+begin_quote
  ‚You won't be killing anyone else tonight,‘ said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other's eyes, green into red. ‚You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people‘

  ‚But you did not!‘

  ‚--- I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?‘
#+end_quote

So with his plan Dumbledore not only has saved Harry but all people fighting on his side. Dumbledore was manipulative, he made mistakes - but he was never cruel and he never would assassinate a student - he even tried to help Malfoy - a boy who was tasked with killing him!

Dumbledore literally had no other choice if he wanted him alive! Sirius, the man where he should live was at this point to the knowlegde of Dumbledore either a Death Eater or dead. So Sirius wasn't an option.

The other friends of James and Lily that are canon were Remus (a werewolf), Peter (a weak wizard) and Marlene McKinnon (dead) - the Death Eaters were all out to get Harry. Dumbledore didn't knew if there was more than one traitor in the Order. So every wizard or witch in the Order could have potentially been a traitor (willingly or unwillingly).

Did you ever ask yourself why he asked Hagrid of all people to bring Harry to the Dursleys? It was because he was Half-Giant and so most spells are useless against him and he never would willingly joined Voldmort (and Voldemort wouldn't have taken him).

Even at Hogwarts were Voldemorts followers or at least children of his followers. Dumbledore was powerfull but he wasn't a god. He couldn't have been everywhere at the same time and again he didn't knew who else were traitors. The only place were Dumbledore knew that there wouldn't be a Death Eater in disguise were a Muggle-Place. In combination with the blood protection the Dursleys were literally the only place where Harry could reach age two. So yes, it was a shitty choice but it also was also the only choice that would guarantee Harrys survival.\\

The Tonks have literally no connection to Harry or the Order. They only joined the order in the second war because Moody was Tonks Mentor at the Aurors.

And Moody, while a fierce fighter, was caught in a suitcase for one year because Barty Crouch, a wizard who didn't have a wand for over a decade, overwelmed him. Aside from that: Moody worked for the Aurors so he had a major target on his back. There we haven't even talked about that he surely wasn't suited to raise a child with the heavy sighs of PTSD he showed in canon (Paranoia etc). The Death Eaters caught the Longbottoms - same would have happend to Moody if they had a reason like Harry Potter to go after him - and so Harry wouldn't be safe there either because: no blood protection.

*********** first, the blood protections aren't the be all, end all you apparently like to think they are. Dobby, Sirius, and the Dementors all proved that. all three of them reached Harry. while he was on Privet Drive.

second, as for having a target on their back, name one wizard in Britain, other than possibly Dumbledore, that has a bigger target on their back than Harry? Moody's enemies hold no relevance, they'd probably try to kill Harry regardless.

as for the security, you telling me you don't think Dumbledore would put up a Fidelius/other wards on the house if Moody did take him in? Moody would likely insist even if Dumbledore didn't. he's a paranoid bastard. and yeah, maybe he isn't the best suited to raise a child, but he's a lot goddamn better than the Dursleys. a rather low bar to pass, to be frank.

for the Tonks family, i don't actually recall if they sat whether or not they were involved in the Order during the first war or not, though it does also bring me to the Bones Family also being an option. even if Amelia never joined herself, she knew about the order through her brother, and you can't tell me you think she was a threat to him.

as for Dumbledore, Flitwick, and McGonagall being to busy, or worried about the students, my answer is the same: House Elves. Dobby proved they can stand up to full grown wizards when someone they care about is in danger, i doubt any half-trained kid would prove much of a threat.

there's also a few other options that came to mind as i was reading this: The Flamels, and Newt Scamander.

The Flamels have an even bigger target on their back than Harry, and they've survived for over 600 years. taking him in would change nothing for their situation, but would give Harry access from a young age to one of the finest minds of the wizarding world. you're telling me Dumbledore couldn't have asked a favor of his former mentor?

and from all accounts, Newt Scamander is a hero on the same level as Dumbledore or Harry himself. might also be interested due to Harry's talent as a parsletongue. i've never actually watched the movies, but that's the impression i got of them, anyway.

No, the blood protections don't mean that Harry couldn't get hurt - if they were, falling of a broom or getting eaten by a spider in Hogwarts wouldn't also have been problems and that would have been very boring for a kids adventure series. Harry still could die due other things. That's the reason why Dobby, Sirius and the Dementors could reach him. None of them were Voldemort or his followers. Sirius and Dobby were on his side and the Dementors were sent by Umbridge who, while horrible, wasn't a follower of Voldemort.

But neither Voldemort nor his Followers could pass the blood protection. If they could they wouldn't have waited until Harrys leaving in Deathly Hollows.

That is my last post in this discussion because we obviously don't agree. You see Dumbledore as a evil man, I see Dumbledore as a man who made mistakes but in the end meat well.

#+end_quote

Somewhat unrelated, but I have a couple of fic drafts involving an idea regarding uncertain futures and divination. Basically, I had a theory that Seers (and Centaurs) were going about trying to see the future all wrong. They were all trying to see what *will* happen - except quantum mechanics makes knowing the future fundamentally impossible. Enter an OC who understands this and tries divining the future based on what *might* happen. And in a variant of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the less he is certain about the future, the more he can know about it. Thus, rather than getting a cryptic poem with multiple interpretations, he effectively gets a spreadsheet of clearly defined options and the probabilities that they occur, which he can use to great effect.

I also had an idea for a whole secret society of seers, where if you get good enough at divination but want to be great, you inevitably wind up divining information about them. Your initiation test is simply being able to find their base of operations despite the diet fidelius charm that they have hiding them. Afterwards, you belong to what's basically an international spy organization that steals information from the future to profit in the present.
