Exactly what the title says. I find myself rooting for this outcome when I read fics where Harry was taken in by Voldemort and never see it.


** Following. I'd love to see one like that.

Author has some moments of questionable grammar, but the premise and plot is absolutely amazing. I highly recommend this story regardless of its flaws. Does include some bashing though - some tasteful, some not.

  Voldemort never killed Harry, instead he killed his parents and kidnapped Harry to raise as his own son against Dumbledore and the light. Dark/Slytherin Harry. Eventual M rating.

** I remember one where Harry befriends a snake while at the Dursleys, the snake teaches him magic and turns out to be Voldemort.
