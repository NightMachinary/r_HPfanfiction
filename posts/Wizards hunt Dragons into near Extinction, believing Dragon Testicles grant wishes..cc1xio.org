Just before, or early into Harry's time at Hogwarts, a few influential purebloods overhear a conversation that two Muggleborn are having. Lacking any knowledge of Manga or Anime, as those are Muggle things, they do however hear about "Dragon Balls granting wishes, if 7 of them are gathered together" and this ends up spread through the world, and Dragons are hunted into near extinction, attempting to get wishes from the Dragon's testicles.

Bonus points if that's the power the Dark Lord knows not, and Harry somehow manages to make it work, and gets a Wish to defeat Voldemort.

** Dragons go Jurassic Park and change genders, or go ASOIAF and become gender neutral(male and female as required)
