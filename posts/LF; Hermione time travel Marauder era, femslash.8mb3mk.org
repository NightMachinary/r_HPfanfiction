Rereading “Roundabout Destiny” and there's a scene where Sirius is asking James if there is something between Lily and Hermione. James says he doubt it and that Hermione would have been snotty about it and danced around the common room and put hickeys on Lily's neck and that she was very possessive over the things/people that is hers.

Makes me want to read a Hermione in the marauder era (and the Marauders playing a big role in the story) who ends up dating one of the girls (specifically Lily/Alice/Andromeda). Would be awesome if she was James's sister and dated Lily before her brother. At least 40 k wording please

Thank you!

** I think that there are a couple Hermione/Bellatrix stories during that time, but despite liking that pairing I've yet to find a decent story with it. Sadly, most are angstfests or have Hermione join the Dark side.

*** I know! But sadly I've read almost all Hermione/Bellatrix stories, or at least the ones where the summary interests me.

And I was really hoping for some Hermione/Lily suggestions, but sadly there are non.

****** Definitely. All you need to change (in famfic at least) is her being disappointed at what Voldemort had become after she was broken out (snake like, completely obsessed with some bloody prophecy), her running into Hermione around Grimmauld Place, and a couple of beers.

From there on, it really depends on your writing tone. Lets say that you want Bella sneaking into Hogwarts for some quality time. You could write about the danger of detection lurking behind every corner, the worry of one of Hermione's friends finding out... Or you write about those meetings, the passion and longing involved. Then one night, Harry follows Hermione to the Room of Requirement and when she doesn't come out after half an hour, he goes in. So he opens the door and sees Hermione straddling the face of another, tied up woman and is really surprised when he finds out whom his muggleborn friend is facesitting.

It's really the writers choice what tone a story takes.

******* If I were a newbie to Bellamione fanfics, then I might go for that kind of thing, but since I'm not, I'd skip that kind of plot when searching for new fics just because it's not all that realistic.

Canon Bellatrix is a fanatic. I don't think you can change someone like that willy-nilly. They usually have denial goggles as deep as the ocean on their face and their ears deafened by mufflers which sing a choir of songs about how glorious their leader is. As much as being a fanatic sounds like a terribly overdone Hufflepuff, that's what she is through and through and you just can't change up that loyalty without some drastic personality changes.

That's where the angst usually comes in.

Since you can't change the fanatic too fast to be canon, the second party usually has to suffer their whims until said fanatic gets through character development.

If we're speaking of AUs, then maybe I'd agree that it's possible (heck, I can even think of a vague plot bunny somehow), but so far, nobody wants to do it without the angst.

******** It's just, most of the Harry/Bella stories manage without too much angst, but Hermione/Bella is drowning in them. Give me something like the first half of "Delenda Est", just with Hermione.

********* Harry and Hermione, as Gryffindor as they are, have very different personalities.

Harry's a bit laid back and Hermione's a bit intense... minus the 'a bit' part.

While Harry/Bellatrix can get away with married bickering, when it comes to Hermione/Bellatrix, they come across as too similar to not have a bit of a rivalry going. It'd be a relationship of constant one-upmanship (which, in my point of view, is also a source of angst), so it's hard to imagine them in a Delenda-esque kind of way... that or the angst is just so normal for the Bellamione ship that it's just hard to imagine them without it at all.

********** I think it is mostly your second theory. There are thousands of stories where any "Dark" side of Snape or Malfoy are ignored for shipping purposes, and even quite a few where Bella was an unwilling Death Eater (loyalty potion bullshit), yet when she is shipped with Hermione, she is the batshit insane, fanatic Death Eater and nothing else. I would be fine with an AU, yet the closest thing is "Murder most Horrid" with its atrocious undercover plot.

*********** Well, to be fair, Snape and Malfoy weren't stuck with the insane fanatic card in canon. They're easily redeemable since, technically, they were cannonically redeemed.

Bellatrix was only shown to be a terrible person, even until she died. Making a Hermione/Bella fanfic is like making a fanfic out of RebelliousF!Harry/Umbridge (which is very disturbing, but the circumstances are the same), so I don't think it's all about the angsty stereotype of the ship.

I haven't read Murder most Horrid till the end. Murder mysteries aren't my cup of tea. Best I could do was about a quarter-way through, so I wouldn't be a judge of that.

We only see her post-madness, never as a teenager. She might have been a completely different person. The possibilities for AUs are endless.

************* /Shrugs/ There's a bunch of time travel fics already up ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9184589/1/Turn-Time][Turn Time]] being my favorite). Despite the fact Bellatrix isn't corrupted by insanity in most of those, they're still angst'd up to the gills. It's official, you just can't get rid of it. Bellamione is just not meant for fluffy moments and healthy relationships.

Heck, just for the sake of doing the impossible, I'd probably make the angst-free fanfic myself if I wasn't such an unimaginative dolt. Alas.

  After an accident with a stolen time turner, Hermione Granger found herself stranded in a very strange time, from a past that was not hers. Learning the differences and similarities turned out to be a very risky task, as she got herself far too involved with a central piece of the board, a woman familiar yet like none she ever met before...
