Hello!! I'm looking for stories that cover Next Generation's 7 years in Hogwarts. It doesn't matter if it's a series of fics (one book per year) or it's just one long story. I've already read two Albus Potter series, Global revelation(and the others) and Dungeon of Merlin mist (and the other six).I would appreciate your help very much! Thank you!!!

â€‹

(I have also read stories from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1467604/PotterFanSteve]] , that are just 1 story, but very long)


** linkffn(11600979) and the rest of the (in progress) series for an action/adventure style one focused on JSP

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11600979/1/][*/James S Potter and the Heart of Hogwarts/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6772486/SGTwhiskeyjack][/SGTwhiskeyjack/]]

#+begin_quote
  BOOK 1/7: A series following James Sirius Potter in the style of the original books. Rumours of violent desecration of sacred magical artefacts arise as James begins his first year. As safe as Hogwarts once was, nothing can protect him when the threats come from within the walls. Especially if they are after the mysterious and powerful Heart of Hogwarts
