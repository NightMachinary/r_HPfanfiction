Literally the title. I don't mind if there are lemons/limes, but that shouldn't be one of the main selling points of the fic. No slash please.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. It has been rated accordingly.

** Hey! If you're into third generation fics, I seriously recommend you this one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5204912/1/Butterflies-and-Hurricanes][Butterflies and Hurricanes]], by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1371630/KaryInTheSky][KaryInTheSky]]. In my humble opinion, it's so well written that you might enjoy it even if you're not a fan of that specific ship. And the good news is that the author came back after eight years to finish the sequel!
