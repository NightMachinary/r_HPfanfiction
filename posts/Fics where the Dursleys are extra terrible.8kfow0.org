Reading fics where the Dursleys are particularly awful to Harry is a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine


** The one and only, linkffn(Catechism). Although it would be a stretch to call it pleasure of any sort...

  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** *I do not recommend this if you cannot stomach explicit R rated stuff, but this fic made me truly want to murder the Dursleys.*

*A word of caution.* This fic goes into child trafficking in a truly horrific way that uses them for sexual play. It is in no way a â€˜pleasure' kind of read. It goes into depth of details trauma and does not shy away from the explicit details. The author themself hates the topic but wrote this fic in order to reveal that *this* is the harsh reality for some kids. It is truly sickening but sends a message at the same time.

The main characters are Harry and Draco.
