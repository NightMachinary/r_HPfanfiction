  In 1993, GIlderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.

  The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discover" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.

  Other consequences are not short term at all.

** “Blindness” by AngelaStarCat is one of the most fascinating hp fics I've read. I adore it, and I was grateful that the author completed it, due to her RL challenges. It's an exceptional fic. If there's underage sex in it, I either didn't notice or Harry and Hermione were close enough to 18 that I didn't care. It's not as if they were shagging like rabbits throughout the story. Whoever made the comment regarding the one sex scene in the story, and how horribly vulgar yada yada. . . . our oh so Christian subreddit . . . Blah blah . . . . Give me a fucking break. Really? Have you never noticed 1) the copious amount of profanity on this subreddit, or 2) the number of requests for smut on it? I can't stand it when people who read fanfic and who lurk on social media platforms like this one, play the self-righteously indignant card, particularly when it's clear that the individual didn't read the fic. Except to skim it and tell everyone who bothered to read their comment, exactly where in the fic this abomination can be found. Please. The author wrote an excellent and original story, which would be fascinating to discuss. Maybe the Book Club rules need to be tweaked, if “Blindness” is being labeled as smut.

The rule does not forbid smut in general; only sexual or suggestive content involving minors. There's no room for interpretation here - “Blindness” literally has a scene depicting sex between two underage teenagers. Whether it is an "excellent and original story" or not has zero relevance.

Blindless hints at legal sexual activity between two people.The irony of censoring one story while promoting one with "Graphic Depictions Of Violence", "Major Character Death" and "Discussion of Past Child Abuse" tags is quite incredible.

The policy is meant to cover things like that odious story Overlord Vulcan, not Blindness. Ultimately it's your sub so you get to interpret the rules but from the reactions here it's clear most people think you're going too far.

** Although Blindness is no longer on the list I very much urge people to read it. I find that the first half is incredibly moving. The unique story, the way Harry and Hermione connect with each other is fantastic. The way they handle their disabilities and build a relationship is outstanding. Also a lovely Dursley depiction in this story, especially when contrasted to the almost callous reaction of the wizarding world at first.

The latter half is still good, but sadly strips away some of the great buildup we see in the first half. Although still very interesting concepts (especially around the Hallows) are explored we do enter god mode Harry territory and that kinda nullifies any handicaps that make the beginning of the story incredibly intriguing. The god mode also means that a lot of the sad things that happen in the story aren't that impactful. It felt to me that the author was looking for a happy ending and shied away from truly dramatic things happening. Bringing Hermione back from the dead was good for the happy ending, but I found myself wanting to see where the author could take the story if she stayed dead. The feutus wasn't brought back and that did create tension for sure, but it felt like punches were being pulled. Which is in line with my biggest gripes with this story that dramatic and sad plot lines are setup in the first half, but broken down to a more happy ending in the second.

For me this was the best completed fic of 2018.

**** Not happy maybe, but a lot of tragedy was very much mitigated. Their handicaps don't matter at all anymore, Death no longer matters (mostly), anyone opposing him no longer matter. The end has a degree of sadness in it for sure. It is after all not supposed to be a happy story.

Maybe it's more the disconnect between the two halves of the story that I feel. One about two youngsters growing up with disabilities, having to find their own way in a magical world with unlimited potential that rejects them. And then the second half a story about Super Harry trying to find answers about fundamental questions about both magic and life and death. I loved the questions explored in the second half of the story, but I would be very interested in a complete story in the tone of the first half.

Swung by Serafim seems to have an OK start, but I'm a bit dubious about it holding up for over 300k words?

Edit: If you like to see Harry working with Snape more closely, there's a very good arc of that in linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions).

** Okay, I read both.

Blindness--it was good, nice original concepts with the magic and giving Harry challenges to keep up with his extreme power. I didn't love the development of his relationship with Hermione in the last few chapters because he basically gave her 0 emotional support and made tons of huge decisions without her. Yes, he has sex with her when they are both 17, but I didn't mind the suggestion that two 17 year olds might be doing it offscreen. I mean, I did attend high school...

Swung--this author has a great turn of phrase that makes the story pleasant to read. The arc towards defeating Voldemort was well-written (of course Snape and Harry's collaboration would lead to Voldemort being defeated with a potion!) and I highly enjoyed the potion-brewing and ingredient-gathering scenes, along with the extremely tense "Snape spy" scenes. Nitpick: how did Voldemort not immediately die of White Fire? You *can't* tell me the dude isn't cursed. First of all, he has a Dark Mark at the very least, and having your soul fractured by dark magic is surely a curse.

Other thoughts:

- At the beginning of "Swung" everyone, and I mean everyone, spoke their dialog with the identical snarky Snape/Harry voice. It was a little tedious. Over time, the author improved at developing different voices in dialog, even giving Snape and Harry different voices. Of course, even at the end they'd have the most stodgy character say something snarky/profane/OOC just for the lulz.
- After Voldemort is defeated, there is no real narrative arc. I found myself skimming through wedding after wedding. I can't fault the author for wanting to write happy fluff about their favorite world/characters, but that didn't mean that it worked tonally with the first half of the story or that I really enjoyed the ride.
- I love a lot of the side character pairings in this, especially the slash ones.
- The moments of tension that occur after Voldemort's defeat were sprinkled at random. Yes, I know that in real life, you're going about your life when random tragedies happen and resolve. But fiction has to make more narrative sense than real life! *wedding* *wedding* *Snape is poisoned* *okay back to the weddings*
- The characters often seem to share some kind of telepathy with the narrator/author/Snape. For example, Snape thinks of Jade as being similar to a hummingbird and never mentions it and everyone starts calling her Hummingbird Girl. Then in the last chapter everyone and their dog shows up because they all somehow know that Snape and Harry should get together. Even if you had this opinion of your friends, would you really show up at their house to stage an intervention? LOL
- Jade's motivations never made a ton of sense. She had a lot of potential as a character, so I don't want to bash on her too much, but yeah.
- Snape's obsession with the endlessly recurring "wrong bloody House"/"senile sorting hat!" lines... may... have strongly contributed to my "houses aren't important" rant here the other day... that's all i'm sayin...
- The author kept trying to shoehorn in the idea of impropriety between teacher/student as an awkward joke in the beginning of the story. It was cringey. I feel like talking about wand grip etc. would be so commonplace you would have to be seriously pervy to think of it as an innuendo.
- I loved the magic house! I wish the author had done more with the isolated house elves and the ancient portraits as being unique/plot driving. Lots of opportunities there.
- If I ever read the word "politic" again it will be too soon.

** I read Blindness a while back, and it's definitely a worthwhile read. I thought the pacing was off a bit at times, or maybe I just felt there was too much focus on 'patterns' and making patterns, changing patterns, etc. I get that it's central to the story, but there was just a bit much of it at times.

The original characters were good, if a little one dimensional, and the Canon characters divergences all made sense and were true to character.

Harry was definitely !SuperHarry, but it didn't trash the story, and there were worthwhile conflicts and resolutions. Some unique or interesting takes on how to handle the usual fanfic clichés that have to be handled as well.

Overall, would recommend as a good fic to read.

** Swung by Serafim is one of the best fics I read last year. For everyone that does not read slash, I urge you to make an exception, it is very mild and some of it is subtext only (at least that's how I perceived it) and the story is very well-written. I often dislike Snape (in Canon and in most fics), but I love his portrayal here. The character development that Harry goes through whilst relearning everything and getting to know all his friends again is extremely well done.

** I hadn't wanted to post my thoughts until after I'd finished Swung by Serafim but I'm still only on chapter 25 with no belief that I'll be finishing it any time soon so here goes.

First Blindness. I read this story as it was coming out and thought it was brilliant to start with. The way the story handled Harry and Hermione's individual development was believably done, and when they got together it was really quite sweet. The first stages of Harry's experimentation were interesting and engaging. But that's where things began to go wrong. Once you've reached the point where Harry can bring people back from the dead you've already lost most of the tension. Then the story spent ages building up the Lady Luxe as a mega baddie only for her to be swatted aside with no bother at all. And then it ends. I don't think I've had such an anticlimax reading a HP fanfic. Sure there have been stories that annoyed me because I thought the author made the wrong calls at the end but this one left me with a sense of "meh". It's rare that I remove a completed story from my alerts list without adding it to my favourites, but this one made me do it.

And as an aside, I'm a huge fan of progressive rock. Yes, King Crimson, you name it. But even compared to a genre that gave us "Tales from Topographic Oceans" and "The Revealing Science of God", the chapter titles are pretentious to an outrageous degree: "The Carbon Black Flesh of Living Shadows" and "Yellow Petals in Golden Firelight" would have had Jon Anderson rolling his eyes and calling AngelaStarCat pretentious.

It seems like there's a decent story in Swung By Serafim but I haven't got to it yet. Others have mentioned the tedious song lyrics but there's other things that seem included just to pad the story out too. And then it's page after page of people bantering and not advancing the story. [[/u/evolutionista]] has made the point that everybody starts out sounding exactly the same. Having got to chapter 25, that's still the case. In a group dialogue scene I can't tell who's speaking until you reach the "said X" part of the sentence, which is simply poor: each character should have their own voice.

It's quite a funny story in places. The banter is largely tedious but each character manages the odd genuine witticism at some point.

But seeing that I've reached chapter 25 and I'm only just over half way through, I simply can't be bothered any more. I'll probably finish it at some point but I'd rather read other stuff at the moment

*** LOL, I was definitely rolling my eyes at some of those chapter titles, even as a fellow Jon Anderson fan...

In addition to Harry quickly getting to the superpowers stage of his experimentation in Blindness, I was disappointed that the authors took such an interesting road with Hermione (traumatic brain injury/lingering intellectual and speech disability) and then basically cast it aside after one or two chapters. Then she's back to being regular Hermione with the occasional stutter for flavor. I really wanted to see how Hermione would deal with those challenges in the long-term and it was disappointing that the premise of her disability was discarded so soon.

** Swung hooked me in the beginning. An intriguing plot I hadn't seen before with reasonably likeable characters and interesting developments. Couple things that bugged me though and led to me not finishing. 1) Angsty interactions that feel forced and don't suit the characters 2) Not using contractions in dialogue. This unreasonably bothers me. 3) Characters agreeing too much and out of context for apparently no reason. Groupthink? Everyone always starts using the same phrases in dialogue. 4) Too much fluff. 5) Childish innuendos by supposed adults

Blindness on the other hand is incredible. Magic system is fascinating. Story pacing worked for me. Characters, while flawed, felt realistic. Writing is beautiful. Overall 10/10. I've read it twice now.

It felt like originally the author was going to add more and then they decided not to, so it has a meandering ending. It's an interesting view into the characters lives, but I almost would have liked it better if it had ended with Harry going "I don't want it back!" And fade to black.

*** I loved it up to Voldemort's defeat - it seemed to fill a lot of canon plotholes and the characterisation and dialogues were excellent. But after the defeat, I found it very slow and meandering. It could have been 20 chapters shorter IMHO.

** Ok this thread finally got me to actually read through Swung by Serafim. I tried it a while back and bounced off the beginning of it; the stuff with CDs and music lyrics and Harry being a honey badger animagus just made me think it was going to be terrible. I'm pleased that I was wrong and I actually did enjoy it for the most part.

As someone else mentioned, the prose is very smooth and makes for an easy read. The premise is unique, the deviations from canon are great fun, the character interactions and slow growth of the friendship (and, we presume, eventual relationship) between Harry and Snape are very well done. Some of the plot stuff didn't make sense to me in the moment, like the whole thing with Sirius meeting Voldemort, or why the potion they used to kill Voldemort didn't just kill him right away, but I could excuse that since the pacing was solid and there was plenty of tension.

Then Voldemort dies and the story just keeps plodding on. I get it. The author isn't telling the Harry Potter and Voldemort story, they're telling the story of Harry and Snape, and they hadn't yet reached the end of that. The problem is, there's just not much left after Voldemort's death. There's no real driver to the plot, they're just kind of going around doing their thing without any real tension or conflict. It doesn't help that there's a sudden OC who appears out of nowhere to take over large parts of the story for no real reason. She's... I don't want to use the term Mary Sue, it's super overused and I'm not sure it's quite right here anyway. But she has a lot of the earmarks--everyone loves her when they meet her, she has a super cool and unique way of dressing (and everyone loves her hat), she has a tragic backstory, she has her own special accent, she has special powers (despite never studying magic, she can do tons of stuff trivially just from knowing Latin), she gets adopted and eventually marries a fan-favorite canon character. I dunno, I liked her in her introductory scene, and the bit where she dresses Snape was fine if a bit too long, but then she just took more and more space in the story and it was like, really?

I don't want to end on a down note, because the first portion of this story really was a blast. Flamethrower's writing was solid enough to pull me through a few minor missteps along the way, and I certainly don't regret reading the story. Good pick, glad I pushed through and finished it.

*** Pretty much my feelings exactly on the fic. The inclusion of song lyrics were... well... I'm sure it seemed like a good idea to the author at the time. I mean we all have songs where we're like /yeah this gets my mood exactly/ but that doesn't mean I want to read through whole stanzas of 90s emo music. I tried reading the first one and skipped the rest.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

** I know I'm late but I needed to comment on Swung. I was very invested in the story at the beginning, but it really devolved into my favorite tropes. Triads, song lyrics, Snarry, Wizengamot manipulation, overpowered Harry (no explanation of his sudden eidetic memory?), forever young potion? The plot development was compelling enough to make me want to see it through Voldemort's death, but after that I skimmed a lot.

*** No they're both 17. In chapter 15, there's the line "Harry was turning seventeen in only a few months" and there's a suggestion from her mother that Hermione is also 17 ("Jane herself had done far more than crawl into boy's laps when she was seventeen.")

** OP violates the very rule they quoted in their post. /Blindness/ depicts sexual acts between minors:

I removed the scene because it's so obscene, but it happens in chapter 16.

This is but one of numerous instances. It might not be graphic, but it goes beyond suggestive, as is the wording of rule 4.

I'll thank you to keep such filth off our Christian, family-friendly subreddit :^)

As I can't delete the bots response or anything, I will post a large warning sign above the fic.
