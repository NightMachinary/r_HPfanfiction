:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I thought I would be able to find this fix easily but is seems to be impossible to find. It's a one shot where harry gets pulled into an alternate dimension where, if I remember correctly, his parents are still alive. He struggles because everything and everyone is different but finds some unexpected comfort in snape hating him, cause at least that is the same in every dimension.

Anybody know which fic I'm talking about?


** It's a bit too vaguely described to give a recommendation. There are a bunch of au fics where Harry's parents are alive and Snape hates him.

  From a future in ruin, Harry used Dumbledore's time device to return to the past, to find a changed world. Unsure of what has remained the same, Harry must deal with an different world. Not your cut of the mold Harry Timetravel fic Harem, x over cameos
