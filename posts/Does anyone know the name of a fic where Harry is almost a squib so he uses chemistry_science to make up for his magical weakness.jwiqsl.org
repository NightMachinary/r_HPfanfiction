:END:
I can't remember the name of it, but from what I remember everyone is sort of impressed with Harry despite him sucking at magic - he is very competent and manages to defeat Voldemort and the Death Eaters using wit and chemistry/potions. In the fic he has an animagus form where he turns into a small animal - I think it was some kind of rodent like a gerbil or squirrel. The finale takes place in the ministry where its just Harry and he has to outwit all of the Death Eaters and Voldemort. He manages to singly kill all the Death Eaters in a horrific way and he also kills Voldemort in a an epic battle if I remember correctly - I think it was quite a violent fic. Also, I think the ministry are scared of him for his "power"/chemistry abilities (they think he's the next Dark Lord or something). In the end after he defeats Voldemort there's a scene where the ministry put him in chains and he escapes using some sort of chemical reaction. I think Harry and Hermione also get together at the very end? Does anyone know the name of this fic? I'm pretty sure I read it on ffn.net.


** In linkffn(12388283) there's a final ministry battle/escape from chains and Harry's Animagus form is a mongoose. I don't remember Harry being a squib.
