I recently joined Wattpad to expand my horizons. I have been a Fanfiction.Net user for years so the change has not been well for me. So I am requesting any interesting fic that can be found in Wattpad.

AUs, time travel, dimension hopping, harem anything is ok by me. Any pairing is welcome with the exception for Slash and Harry/Ginny.

I am simply looking for good fics to introduce me to the world of Wattpad. Thank you!


** Try AO3 instead.

*** YES. Tbh in my opinion wattpad has the most fanfics that match the writing quality of what I produced at age 12 of all fanfic sites. Ao3 is great.
