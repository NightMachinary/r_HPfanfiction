:END:
Looking for ficw where Harry is good at potions. There is one I remember where Snape has assigned Harry multiple potions for detention, and also has a Slytherin working on remedial potions. Harry manages to help the Slytherin out as well as complete his own potions.

Are there any more such fics, wherein Harry is good at potions??

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
