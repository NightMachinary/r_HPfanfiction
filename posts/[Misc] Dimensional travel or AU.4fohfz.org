** If it has become so different, why not just make it original?

** Good ideas, but extreme AU needs lots of work.

Also, I don't think making Harry go back to 11 years is a good idea.

**** Then probably no time travel at all.

You have to explain how a Harry Potter could exist in such an extreme AU in the first place.

If there was no Hogwarts or Dumbledore, how would James and Lily get together? Was the Muggle world also different?

** I'm not going to touch on the difficulties of extreme AUs as others already have. But for the issue of Harry's memories, you could find a reason for him to lose those memories during the dimension hop, then slowly regain them through some method or another.

In your Remus example, Harry might remember that werewolves existed in his world, and that his third year Defense professor was one who nearly killed him, but he can't recall /who/ the professor is or the extenuating circumstances around the incident.
