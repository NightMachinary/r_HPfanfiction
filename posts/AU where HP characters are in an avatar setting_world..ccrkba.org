Not a crossover, but where the characters in HP are benders. (Bonus if Harry is the avatar.) I read some pretty great ones like the one by the Sorting Cat and a Jily oneshot where Lily was the avatar on AO3 by cgner (I think.) Any other stories? Thanks!

#+begin_quote
  After finding a torn comic in the trash when told to clean Dudley's room, four year old Harry Potter puts it together with some odd things that have happened around him, and concludes that he's the Avatar. - Not a crossover so much as a fic in which Harry Potter is convinced that 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' is a historical documentary.
