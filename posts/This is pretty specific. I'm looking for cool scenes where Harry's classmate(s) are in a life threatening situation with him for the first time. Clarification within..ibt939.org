Teenage Harry has been through more than his fair share of hairy situations. He may not be overly powerful, but when shit hits the fan and your more typical teenager is understandably panicking, Harry can keep his cool and get things done. People who had always dismissed the rumors surrounding Harry never saw this side of him before.

That kind of thing.

This fic has a scene that's roughly what I'm looking for and made me interested in requesting this. Linkffn(Kid by evansentranced). Starts in the second half of chapter 3.

 

Any recommendations?


** Hermione gets pulled into one in Linkffn(Unfound Door)

Quite AU

  A Potion's "accident" turns Harry into an eight year old, and Draco Malfoy intends to kidnap him. But Harry's a passive-aggressive, revenge-obsessed little bastard. Maybe Draco will wait on that whole Dark Lord thing. POVDraco, pretty AU.
