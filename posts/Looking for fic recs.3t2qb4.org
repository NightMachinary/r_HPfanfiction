Hi! I'm looking for fic recs, specifically stories that doesn't involve Harry being with Ginny or any other males. There are many good slash'es out there but that not what I'm looking for now. Like stories where Harry realizes that Dumbledore isn't the trusting grandfather he thought. Manipulation a or bashing is fine, actually preferred. Any sort of pairing, as long as it's not slash or Ginny. It has to be good writing, have a good plot and at least over 80k wording. Marriage tics, inheriting Lord status etc are awesome, soul bonding, going back in time and doing things different, him breaking away from Dumbledore or/and some of the Weasley's, stories like that.Can read some Harry/multi, as long as it's not more than three girls, cause when it's starts getting M rated I feel like I'm reading a porn story. Feels like I've read every thing that catches my eye on Ff.net, or at least tried to. I'm picky so if I can't get into it the first five chapters I usually stop reading.

Thank you!
