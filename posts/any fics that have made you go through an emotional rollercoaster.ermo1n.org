in all honesty it's been such a long time since i've read a fic that made me go: "wow, i can't believe it's over."

i'm willing to branch out and read more stories with different tropes and such.

plus, i read 'handle with care' by the magicians wish and i am still not over it like 6 months later. ðŸ™ƒ

just some recs if you have some.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621?view_adult=true][The Man Who Lived]] is a brilliant emotional rollercoaster. Slow burn Drarry, and original characters that you will find yourself deeply caring about, it's one of the best stories I have ever read. You will laugh, you will cry - and you will get a proper story hangover after the last word is read.

** It's me and so I must paste the link for Meaning Of One: [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54]]

The only good Hinny Soul-Bond and the best fanfiction I've ever read, though it's sadly abandoned/in hiatus.

To quote my review on Part One; /I get seriously emotional when I read this. You're able to make me laugh, cry, tense up, forget to breathe, and make unbearably happy, much more than the original books ever did for me. I was legitimately scared during the third-floor corridor. Ginny's triumphant entry into the >! Quidditch Pitch !< left me with an absolutely stupid grin on my face. McGonagall >! comforting Ginny after the nightmares in the Hospital wing !< was heartbreaking. I feel just as disappointed >! in Molly as Arthur is !< after that Christmas debacle. I could go on and on./

Then there's this one moment in Part Two that comes out of nowhere, yet just fits so well. Honestly, the author was a genius for thinking of it. The effects of which led me to cry on */13 seperate occasions./*

Spoiler for what that moment is. >! Harry get's petrified by the Basilisk. And since, Harry and Ginny are bonded, it is not a fun time for anyone. !<
