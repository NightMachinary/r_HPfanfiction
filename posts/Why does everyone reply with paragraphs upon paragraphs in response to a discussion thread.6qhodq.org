** Because sometimes there are a lot of arguments to be presented. And then the second side presents counterarguments for those arguments and possibly adds their own arguments. Add to this quotes etc. and it's natural that posts will become long.

No.

Because they're having a discussion and aren't on Twitter to do it.

I mean, seriously. If you can't read a 500 word reply, then don't bother with discussion threads. You're obviously not interested enough in their opinions.

** ü§ê this is the "zip your lip" emoji. I found it amusing. Reddit is tiny on my mobile so I found it necessary to explain in detail what it was so everyone would understand.

** [[/r/HPfanfiction]] isn't Twitter, Facebook, or Snapchat, where posts are a sentence or two, if words are included at all. Do you really expect everyone here to reply with one or two sentence answers when engaging in a discussion about something? We're not here to be concise when discussing something. We're going to analyze, debate, and talk about it - not just say "I like it! Hope you publish the next chapter soon!" or something equally unhelpful. Discussions are not meant to be short when it comes to literature.

If you want everyone to reply in a sentence or two, create your own subreddit. Nobody is going to change because you are too lazy to read posts in their entirety.

How long does it take to read 500 words? A minute, two or three at most?

** I feel your pain as some explanations use far more words than is necessary. HOWEVER, this sub is about fanfiction where people read and write stories that are paragraphs and pages and chapters and thousands of words, (sometimes millions) long. The average user of this subreddit most likely has a higher tolerance for long and wordy discussions.

There is probably a subreddit that only allows emojis.
