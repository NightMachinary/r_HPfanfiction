** Being able to summon people and their body parts would invalidate literally every non-AoE combat spell and canon plotline, ever. Sorry, but that's a really dumb idea mate.

I am, however, of the opinion that the tickling charm can do as much or more damage as the cruciatus if sustained.

Imagine a group led by the terrible Light Lady Luna, who has her followers torture enemies by tickling for hours until they grow insane enough to join her ranks. Others, she tickles until they become blubbering humdingers.

*** You seem to be labouring under the delusion that accio can't be blocked. It's not Avada Kedaccio, mate.

**** It's not a projectile spell, and you can summon things from great distance and without knowing exactly where it is; QED, Harry summoning the broom in his first task.

If it works like actual accio does, then it's much more deadly than Avada Kedavra could ever be.

And if it can be so easily negated by other means to the point of making it impotent, that means that it's not all that creative in the first place if there are already countermeasures in place.

I love how this started out as me pointing out all the flaws in being able to summon people... and now I'm being mocked for my criticism of it, by you rationalizing ways you /wouldn't/ be able to summon people.

Do you not see the lapse of logic here?

I stand by my first comment, which was pointing out the flaws in OP's idea as stated, without this post hoc gishgallop.

***** I mean, just because you can't see a jet of light doesn't mean it's not a counterable spell. Your issue is that you lack creativity, friend. You're acting as if this idea exists in a vacuum where nobody would do anything to figure out how to counter it after the first time someone does it.

The question isn't ‚Äúwhat basic spell can you use to cheat life‚Äù, it's ‚Äúcreative uses for a spell‚Äù. That doesn't mean it has to be able to carry every fucking fight ever.

****** I'm not the one that lacks imagination, it's you people that have failed to think it through.

I responded to the idea of being able to "summon Voldemort's eyeballs" with accio as we know it, because that kind of spell interaction is world-breaking.

Now you and others say, "well, okay, you can't /actually/ do that because X and Y" in response, and say I lack imagination or some shit.

Like, okay. Fine. Then what the hell is the point of talking about it and using it as an example? If there's a well-known counter it's not creative, if there isn't a well-known counter it's fucking OP.

Why even defend this stupid idea from the obnoxious sore that is OP, when he made it abundantly clear that there's no other interactions he gave thought to?

How about actually considering things that make sense within an internal world instead?

This whole thread is completely inane.

******* Tell me, does the existence of protego mean that every other spell that isn't Avada Kedavra is worthless in a fight?

No? Hmm, why would that be... ü§î

**** How is it "stupid as shit" lmao?

My point of it being stupidly overpowered and invalidating a majority of offensive spells stands, as does the point of it absolutely fucking up any possible plot or story cohesion, when anyone can summon anyone; canon or fanon, it doesn't matter.

It's like, cool, let's just have people summon Voldemort's heart! But then why didn't they use it on Grindelwald? Why not on every villain before, and vice versa?

I only brought up canon because such a spell and interpretation of magic would twist the HP universe to be completely unrecognizable on every possible level, if you actually stop and use your brain to consider the impact it would have across the hundreds of years. You literally wouldn't have Harry Potter, Dumbledore, Voldemort, or anyone else.

But yeah, I'm the one writing "stupid as shit" things.
