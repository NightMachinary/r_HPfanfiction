I have seen this turn up in lots of worries lately, especially ones involving American witches and wizards where they prefer the term "mundane". To me this has never made much sense as the word mundane is a synonym for uninteresting so actually is an insult.

*** So it's canon that 'Muggle' is a insult/offensive term?

** Mug, meaning gullible person

Mundane's etymology is 'of this world'

** Same reason why any other term is considered derogatory I imagine.

** There's nothing to back up that it's offensive in Canon. It was probably founded when the idea of America having a significantly more advanced magical society than England, and that the rest of the world had moved on and used more 'dignified' terms. Mundane really isn't much better, but I have seen norm used before, as well as nomaj (before fbwtft came out).
