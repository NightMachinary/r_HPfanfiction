I remember very little about the actual content of the fic in terms of plot. However I remember the fic opened with an expository passage about reasons why wizards consider Muggles inferior, one of them being differences in personal hygiene.

The fic is rather old. I'd say published between 2006 and 2010.

  Hogwarts brought home the immense differences between the muggle world and the magical. No plumbing, no electricity, no modern conveniences like toilet paper, no heaters, no insulation, no cell phones, no television, no video games, and on and on and on. You'd think that the magical world could benefit from all of this, right?

  Contrast that with food that can't go bad, wash basins where the water stays perfectly pure even if you wash shit off your hands in it, chamber pots that not only immediately destroy your waste but clean you completely as you stand up, and shower "pools" about a foot deep that surround you in a vortex of water, ripping any and all dirt off your body and make any massage setting on a shower head seem pointless.

  Compare radios to a wizarding wireless system that could relay information from its broadcasting center directly to the local units without actually broadcasting all over the place, old family albums to pictures and portraits that moved --and sometimes talked, and post to the ridiculously fast and accurate owl mail system.

  Sigh in envy at beds and robes that always maintain whatever your body considers a comfortable temperature and the fact that a first-year's charm would instantly banish sweat and nullify body odor and bad breath; for that matter, a second-year's charm could immediately clean your clothing, making washing machines pointless.

  Despite the lack of focus on personal entertainment, we wizards are a pampered lot; I'll never complain.

  I wasn't really exposed to it in my first year, but I've since come to understand why purebloods associate muggles with the word "filthy." Compared to wizarding society, muggle society is dirty and unsanitary. If you stop and consider exactly how much effort that the muggles put into being sanitary, that's really saying a lot. Even the most sterile hospital room can't compare to how clean the wizarding world is. No matter how fast the Internet gets, it's not worth the headache of dealing with computers when I can reach anyone, anywhere, with Hedwig in about five minutes tops. The communication mirrors I possess make cell phones look outdated, and I'll take Pensieves over video cameras any day.

  As I quickly realized looking around Hogwarts in awe, it wasn't the wizards that need to catch up with muggles; it was the muggles who need to catch up with wizards. They've been doing nothing but catching up all along.

Unfortunately the fic isn't very good in more general terms. Very annoying montage-like presentation.

**** The mirrors could be considered superior for the time of the books (and when the Marauders were using them) which was the 90's. Wizard's had Skype in the Seventies.

**** The internet and other communication technologies are often simply a medium to indirectly experience things without being physically present.

Social networks allow friends to keep in touch without having to meet in person.

Phones/video chat allow people to talk and see each other without having to meet in person.

People consume sports media in place of attending sports games in person.

People consume travel media in place of travelling themselves.

People look at cute pictures of animals in place of having animals themselves.

Etc.

Most of these are for two reasons: it's inconvenient to travel, in terms of time and effort, and it's financially costly.

A world with instantaneous transportation rather removes the need for indirect access to experiences in many cases, because you can directly experience things with minimal effort. I imagine most wizards would regard internet-dwellers with pity, forced to live vicariously through the experiences of others rather than living for themselves.

The one area where the internet has the edge on magic is accessibility and search-ability of information i.e. research tasks.

*** Especially if you consider the not-to-distant past and the life span of wizards. There will be wizards with living memory of Muggle cities full of shit and horse carcasses.

(Of course, from what I understand of Newcastle, there are teenage Muggles with memory of the same).
