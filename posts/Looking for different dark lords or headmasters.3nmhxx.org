I'm looking for stories which have a dark lord that isn't Tom Riddle, or stories where someone other than Dumbledore is the headmaster, either through dimension travel, time travel, or just plain AU.


** Newcomb's linkffn(What You Leave behind) has Aberforth as headmaster. It's a great read.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

#+begin_quote
  A fluffy, slightly silly, one-shot set in an alternate universe where Alastor Moody replaces Albus Dumbledore as Hogwarts headmaster as school winds down for the summer holidays in 1975. A couple of scenes of that, and then from the 1975-1976 Hogwarts school year. Warning! Characters not necessarily adherent to canon. Rated M, to be on safe side, for occasional pithy language.

**** I'm not a fan of HG/DM, but I personally thought the AU-ness was interesting enough to ignore the uncomfortable pairing, and the pairing wasn't so bad, due to unusual situations.

If you're interested, give it a try. I wasn't sure if I'd be okay with it, but I'm glad I tried. For me, watching a sane Riddle and grumpy Harry made it worth reading.
