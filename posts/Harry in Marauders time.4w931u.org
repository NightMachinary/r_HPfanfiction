** Do you want fic, where he is recognized as Harry Potter or just being there and going to Hogwarts under a different name.

Anyway, I got those in mind:

Waking up in 1972 in his ten year old body, Harry has to figure out how to stop a war without anyone finding out who he really is. Time Travel, UP FOR ADOPTION!

** I would like to read stories where a more adult Harry goes to '70s & became Hogwarts teacher/auror/unspeakable, especially Hogwarts teacher. Would love to read how an author writes his interactions as teacher with marauders, Lily, Regulus(Especially Regulus character never fully developed in any fanfic), Snape, Lucius, Black sisters etc. You can add Nevilles parents, Luna's parents too. Shame that there's very few in this category & the very few are there, rarely well written, most tends to cliches. Delenda Est had some potential in this category but it was completely wasted.

Harry as students, there's few good stories, most of already them are mentioned here. Here's another one: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Turning of the Sun by Lord umbrex) - not essentially marauders but 70's. Most marauder era fanfic tends to cliches, slash etc.

linkffn(5511855)

linkffn(11233445)

linkffn(9762328)

linkffn(10968346)

This is one of my favorite tropes. All the good ones are incomplete though. Most of this genre is angsty poorly written shit. There are the best ones.

Edit: Don't disregard Throwing Out the Script because of the description. Its some of the best writing you'll find in fanfiction.
