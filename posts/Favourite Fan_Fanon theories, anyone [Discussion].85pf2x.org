** I've been proposing this theory for some time: the Books were a test and PR campaign undertaken by the British Ministry of Magic. Its original goal was to identify Muggles' response to the concept of Magic. Needless to say, the results vastly exceeded its most optimistic expectation. Not only were the great majority of Muggles happy with Magic, but those involved in this campaign made billions in profit off those gullible Muggles.

While key outcomes in the Books were not altered, actual details of that conflict greatly differed. As often the case in history, winners were highly praised, and losers mercilessly bashed.

That does not explain Albus Severus

***** But that's mostly due to the actor, same as Draco Malfoy. Remove those and you are left with a petty guy who, intentionally or not, fucked over an entire generation and made an innocent child's school time hell because he didn't get the girl and an ignorant boy with very few redeeming qualities.

*** Something like this can be easily disproved, however, by the lack of contact since the books wrapped a decade ago. Imagine this whole world exists, hidden as described, and wants to make contact again. There would have been no better time than that first month after book 7 to have Harry Freakin' Potter make himself known as a /real person/. Everyone and there mother would have been ecstatic, and the series was still on everybody's mind as a cultural phenomenon. Now, though still hugely popular, it's left the consciousness of the world the way it was before.

I love this theory cause like everyone fantasizing this world is a favorite pastime. But this was a much more fun theory when the books were being put out.

**** No one said they want to make contact again. The book series could be to gauge Muggle reactions to the existence of magic should the Statute of Secrecy breakdown.

***** But then they read fanfiction based on the books, and they realized "Letting these people know that magic really exists could lead to the most horrible holocaust imaginable."

**** Why would they want to come out again?

As I said in my comment, the Books were originally designed as a test. They found out most Muggles were fine with magic, but a significant portion still wanted them dead, so they would have to stay hidden for the time being.

On the other hand, /Harry Potter/ has become so popular that Muggle Potterheads are now publicly flashing their wands, and real Wizards can now wield their wands in public too, as long as they don't use flashy spells.

** I dunno if it's a fanon theory or anything but I always sorta wanted to write a thing where Harry Dresden was actually Harry Potter after becoming an auror and growing sick of the ministry.

So he takes his investigation skills elsewhere, and becomes the wizard PI in Chicago. I think it'd be a fun link, but no idea how to effectively link the two universes and not make it slight one of them as they have completely different views on magic.

*** Usually when it comes to crossovers I just prefer having Harry magicked into the new universe where he either adapts to the new rules of magic or has some measure of his own native magic available to him. Considering how overpowered HP magic can be, it's a delicate balance.

So after growing bored with the tediousness of an actual job, Harry goes on an adventure with Luna Lovegood to find the Crumple-Horned-Snorcack who then uses its special magic to send Harry to the Dresden universe.

Or something haha.

** The protective enchantments on Hogwarts are the reason that in two murder-by-basilisk campaigns, Voldemort only managed to kill one student.

Though I might be biased, as this is my theory.

*** Y'know, I kinda like that theory, but I always thought he was Petrifying rather than killing /on purpose/, at least in 1993 --- that he remembered Myrtle's murder had nearly closed down Hogwarts, and, not wanting that, had /arranged/ for the Basilisk to only open her eyes when the prospective victims were looking at a mirror, so as to still create panic while keeping his beloved Hogwarts mostly in the clear.

*** I agree, but I think that rather than bother with the ritual he would have just built himself a Philosopher's Stone once he'd won the war and could take the time to do so. This has an additional benefit in that he could also use it to keep Nagini alive forever, eliminating the main glaring flaw of a living Horcrux.

** The golden snitch in quidditch chooses who it wants to win based on the team's performance or something like that. Sometimes a particularly good seeker can catch it even if the snitch isn't favouring them, but it ensures the game always lasts the right amount of time and the team who wins usually deserves to. So chaser performance impacts seeker performance, in effect.

Character-wise, I like to believe that during deathly Hallows, Percy Weasley was secretly trying to help muggleborns and saved some while trapped in the Ministry before he reconciled with his family.

**** Cheers! I've read it and plenty of the other Percy-centric stories. His character has been interesting to me lately, probably because it seems like he has a lot of character growth but it all happens off-screen in the books.
