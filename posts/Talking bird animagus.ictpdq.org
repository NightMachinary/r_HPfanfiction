I've got a plot bunny stuck in my head. What if someone's animagus form is some form of talking bird (such as a parrot)? How hard would it be to learn to talk as a bird? Would their voice sound anything like their human voice? If their animagus form is a kind of bird that don't normally talk, would they be able to talk if they tried? How do birds talk anyways? Do talking birds have some sort of anatomy difference from non-talking birds, or are they just the only birds that would actually try to imitate speech (that's off-topic, but I really want to know.) ?


** So there are definitely a lot of things you could google here, but the one thing I do know is that talking birds tend to have more agile tongues than non-talking birds (see ravens - they can technically talk, but it's harder for them bc of how their tongue is attached). Other than that, some birds are just smarter than others and there are lots of cool videos online about the process of how birds do the speech things.

So, yeah, I'm pretty sure any animangus with a form that lent itself to making human noises would be able to talk, because if the animal /can/ talk, it's mostly intelligence and education as barriers to it not talking.

** Fred and George are magpie animagi in one of my fics, and yes, they can talk in their animagus forms. I thought of making them scarlet and gold macaws, but figured that canon animagi were animals commonly found in Britain, so I'd better stick to that category of animal for British wizards.

Parrots sound like the person they're mimicking. For example, you teach a bird to say hello and it'll sound like you. But, if your SO teaches it to say "fuck off"... that particular phrase will sound like your SO.

This is effected by the species, however. An Amazon or an African Grey would be much better at mimicking the voice exactly compared to a conure for example, whose 'voice' is usually more... gravelly, I suppose. Garbled.

Parrots can mimic things other than voices too - such as the fire alarm, the phone ringing and a fire truck siren lol.

Another bird that's rather good at voices is a raven (and likely some other members of the crow family). Magpies too, I'd assume.

I'm not sure if there's an anatomy component, but the trait is certainly linked to survival.

** In Canon, Animagus are wizards who managed to transfigure themselves into animal, while keeping their human mind. So I'm guessing that most Animagus would be unable to talk while transformed, because their animal form physically can't pronouce human sounds.\\
But, just like a primate should be able to use sign language (as long as he knows it of course), I don't see why a talking bird Animagus should not be able to talk (though whenever he would be able to speak with his "human voice" is another story and may depend of its specie).
