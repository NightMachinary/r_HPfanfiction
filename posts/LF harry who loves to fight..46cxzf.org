Well.. Im back for more harry Potter. I really would love to read, a harry who loves to go into battle. Im thinking like Madara from Naruto levels. It would be a competent Harry, at least.

Speaking of Madara from Naruto, I would love to read a scene that described a duel like a dance.... or when Harry and Voldemort are about to cross wands and an epic battle is about to take place, for one of the two to say something along the lines of "We dance now." *first spell is cast* that would be epic...

but anyway, What I want is a Harry who loves to fight, is damn good at it, and preferably is complete with 80k words. sorry for the long post


** The recently finished Linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) features Harry as a "Battle Mage", a special subset of wizards feeling the drums of war each time they fight. It also features competent fighting and no bashing, which are huge plusses in my book.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

** It's a short oneshot, but it's always been a favorite, and I've always hoped to see someone decide to complete the thing throughout 7 years and onwards.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6913210/1/The-Duellist][The Duelist]] by Johnny Farrar. Where Harry takes the midnight duel in firstyear seriously and more- Draco and company actually show up.

** First thing that came to mind for this is linkffn(Only Enemies by leave this world). In it Harry and Bellatrix have a long-standing professional rivalry when it comes to wanded combat.

  In the aftermath of the Final battle a misplaced spell sends HP and Bellatrix to an alternative world. It holds everything each of them have lost to the war and yet they find themselves inexorably drawn back to each other. HPBella done right.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) has an overly competent Harry, who is very, very good at magical fights. He has a bit of battlelust as well. Not the duel as a dance part of your request, but still has good fight scenes

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** My Darkness/HP will have a very belligerent and eventually well trained Harry but since he's just starting at Hogwarts, his big battles will come very distant in the story and for now, while he's got a beginning base for combat, he's still unblooded.
