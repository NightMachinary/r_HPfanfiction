** Not exactly what you're loooking for, I vaguely remember reading a fic where Blaise Zabini (male) was referred to as an "Animation specialist"... might've been Harry Potter and the Year of Discord. It's H/Hr: you'll find it on Portkey.org.

EDIT: My bad - it's on FFN :) linkffn(Harry Potter and the Year of Discord)

** The animation charm is /sooo/ underrated. I mean really, an exceptionally powerful wizard like Voldy or Dumbles can literally transfigured a dragon and animate it. Instant dragon army, anyone?

  What if Severus Snape had taken Hermione Granger under wing secretly during her time at Hogwarts? What if Draco Malfoy really wasn't the bigot he let everyone think he was? (Follows canon mostly up until the end of GoF, and then detours off into AU territory w/Severus as father figure)
