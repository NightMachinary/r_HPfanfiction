So way back when I remember reading this one fic, titled ‘Light Up the Sky' by troublemaker-in-chief on ff.net, but it was never finished and was last updated in 2012. Basic premise of it was that Harry supposedly died, but was actually just kidnapped and got raised/trained by Death Eaters with other kidnapped children and the war is still going on all the while.

I really liked it for the premise and character exploration, but I've never really seen many like it since that I've liked. Anyone know of any fic in which Harry (others could or could not be included- doesn't really matter) was raised by any of the Death Eaters and how the books could have gone differently because of it?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1034541/Kurinoone][Kurinoone]] on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] has an amazing, completed, and partially rewritten series in regards to this. Honestly it is one of my all time fanfiction favorites.

​

1) The Darkness Within, 2) A Part of Me, 3) Deepest Reflections

  A rewrite of the first part in my Dark Prince Trilogy. What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? Book One of the Dark Prince Trilogy.

  Prophecy brings nothing but ruin, and half a prophecy is even worse. Lord Voldemort is neither fool nor weakling; he vows to break away from the prophecy's accursed magic. He is ready to defeat Albus Dumbledore at his own game. After all, Harry Potter is just a boy. AU, sort of Mentor!Voldemort.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  After the infamous massacre of the Potters, young Harry Potter went missing. It doesn't really help that years later he turns up again, a bit darker, stranger and more erratic than anyone had hoped for. But Harry hardly cares, in the end it's his decision on which side he will fight; dark, light or no side at all. Eventually HP/LV... of sorts.

  The first time Harry became a snake slithering through a forest, he thought he was dreaming. But he soon realised that in fact he was switching bodies with a magic snake. A very special snake who swiftly became his childhood friend -- for when he came back to Privet Drive after body-swapping things were always better for him. Harry & Voldemort friendship, pre-Hogwarts, Dark!Harry.
