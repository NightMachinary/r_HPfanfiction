What are the best stories you know with uncommon parings? Harry MC preferred but not necessary, I'm open to anything but really like to see pairings made possible by time travel.


** linkffn(6814375) George Weasley/Millicent Bulstrode and absolutely hilarious. Background Harry/Draco and Hermione/Pansy.

linkffn(12747797) Hermione/Regulus Black, time travel, just completed! This author does a lot of rare pairs.

Both of these are complete, the first has a sequel WIP that is mostly Draco & Harry so far.

*** Just finished Oblivion yesterday...let's see...

Good points: Interesting take on an unusual (impossible in canon) pairing. Time travel did not result in super!Hermione. Kudos to the author on writing a complete story (abandonment is in my experience the biggest barrier to good fanfic).

Points I didn't like: Highly explicit sex scenes. Granted it's tagged 'Romance', but I would have preferred a good deal less "showing" and more "telling", as it were. Time travel mechanics never really explained or explored, which is understandable since the time travel is merely a plot device, but I would have liked to read more about what actually happened there and how and why.

** Uncommon. Hmmmm....

linkffn(Finally 17! by 976grpc) is Harry/Rose W

linkffn(Aren't Little Girls Made of Sugar and Spice? by Jagged Epiphany) shows its age, but its Harry/Alicia

As to uncommon made possible by time travel?

Neither of the above are time travels unfortunately, the only two that really come to mind is the classic Delenda Est which is Harry/Bella as would the abandoned Passageways.

linkffn(The Disorder of the Phoenix by Jacob Apples) which I think is a pile of garbage but gets recommended around here occasionally is Harry/Tonks and only occurs because of the time travel.

linkffn(Retrograde by Knife Hand) is Harry/Amelia time travel that fits your criteria. Quality is not great by any means.

I've got a couple other "rare pairs", these two however involve Neville/Malfoy's Sister and Neville/Pansy. Let me know if you want me to link them.

**** I absolutely loved the first 5 chapters, until the author tried to force the pairing too much. The setup and introduction was well done, but as soon as Harry/Tonks became more important than anything else I dropped the fic.

The best part of the fic in my opinion is the way Professor Harry rebuffs Ron/Hermione's friendship. I felt like this was really well done and remained in character for all involved.

Perhaps I was a bit harsh; we all write and grow.

*** I was impressed by the first half of Delenda Est. Would /not/ have expected to enjoy Harry/Bellatrix, but the author pulled it off. It helps that the time travel means we're dealing with a wild Bella, but not yet driven insane by Voldemort + Azkaban. Good enough that I favorited the story, and I don't do that often even when I enjoy something enough to finish it.

The second half of the story, unfortunately, felt to me like it lacked conflict. Which was a real shame, because there were plenty of plot hooks that the author /could/ have used to present a real challenge. But instead, it went Mary Sue. :(

Still, the first half carried it.
