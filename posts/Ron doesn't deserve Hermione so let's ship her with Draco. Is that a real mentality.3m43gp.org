I'm not much of a Dramione shipper, but I've heard a lot of anti-Dramione people bash the fanbase for saying that Ron isn't good enough for Hermione, yet putting her with Draco makes more sense. Is this actually a real thing that people say or is it a stereotype that's been given to them?

Ding ding ding winner.

I also think your point about the epilogue is great. (All the following is totally my personal opinion.) I actually dislike reading epilogue compliant fics that go with non-canon pairings because I dislike the canon-pairing-crash-and-burn. I much prefer DM/HG stories that draw their source of tension from somewhere else... You listed so many great examples of a source of literary tension!

**** On the epilogue point:

At least in canon-compliant fics I read, it's nice if they have an amicable parting with the canon couples. It just keeps it from almost being silly and devolving into [canon partner] bashing for a while or throughout the whole fic. (Though I do understand that some fics use the bashing as an important plot point.)

** I like shipping Hermione and Ron. But I prefer Dramione, why? Not because Ron doesn't deserve her. Since when do people need to have the same type of personalities/interests/level of intelligence to function as a couple. Yeah Ron is a bit of a dolt, prompt to anger and all that, but he and Hermione still make a cute couple and are of course a more realistic one than D/H.

So why do I like Dramione? Not for the romance, romance alone is usually boring. No, that's because they are a good storytelling device. This romance (or actually any one between a Muggleborn and a Bloodpurist) allow the plot to delve into characterization of Draco's belief, understanding of the other, rejection of Blood Purism, all that. I do not ship them for the sex or the result, but definitely for the journey. I hate when Draco actually don't hate Muggle/was always in love with Hermione from the start. Because the writer has then completely misunderstood the goal of such stories.

So yeah, are they people saying "screw Ron Draco's better!", certainly. Is that representative of the Dramione community? Hell no. I guess that people that do that are a bit like the people who mix Tom Felton and Draco into one person if you see what I mean.

*** Good post! The reason why the HP fanfiction is so big is because JKR created a fantastic world to lose yourself in, with almost endless possibilities for stories. The whole "four houses" is so good, because it allows for so much conflict, forbidden relationships et cetera. All those Gryffindor/Slytherin pairings are so popular for the same reason Romeo and Juliet is still so popular. It's just so much fun to read stories where the main character has to choose between their family and friends or their love interest.

The only thing that binds Hermione and Ron is them both having Harry as a friend, that's not a basis for a relationship. Opposites attract, but you need common ground for a relationship.

As for Draco, I explained some of that in the comments there, and more in another comment in this thread. I do think he needs redeeming, but he has things in common with Hermione (like his intelligence) and positive aspects that Hermione hasn't been shown not to care about.

I "attack you" because OP asked if there are people who truly think Draco would have been a better match for Hermione than Ron. The thread's issue is a personal one, and you obviously hold that sentiment.

You are right, those are fictional characters we're discussing, and you badly misjudge their character, which is truly the issue here. You deride several characters for showing certain traits, while completely ignoring the same traits in characters you glorify. The fact that the reason you give for a Hermione/Draco pairing (which obviously includes sex) is "redeeming", is the basis for the argument I made that you are interested in Draco for sexual reasons, because he shares a lot of his traits with characters you dislike such as Ron (and your aversion to his relationship with Hermione), who you don't seem to think warrants "redeeming".

In essence, what I'm saying is that the problem here is your own psyche, which you project into characters, rather than the fault of any fictional characters.

******* I don't think I ever gave sex as a reason, I've read good stories which never went further than a kiss and I've read good stories where the sex was merely vaguely implied at parts. I have however given specific reasons why I like redeeming them. They have traits that I think could fit with Hermione, in addition to the cause of there negative traits being something which can lead to a good story.

Severus Snape, though intelligent, is an incredibly broken man in canon, for a variety of reasons. Having him put back together like in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2290003/1/Pet-Project][Pet Project]] makes for a great story to read.

Draco Malfoy from my perspective was an indoctrinated child, and he certainly acted the bigot as most people I've known to be indoctrinated with bigoted views (including myself) as a child. He also shows signs of being artistic and being very intelligent. Having the war and the things he's seen and been forced to participate being the final trigger to break from his indoctrination is not unrealistic at all in my opinion. A story that then deals with the fallout, him building a new internal worldview after the ideology that guided him fell away is interesting to read for me.

What reasons does Ron have in your opinion that would make it interesting to redeem him? His inferiority complex that is mostly fueled by his own behavior as far as we can see in the books? If you can link me a Ron/Hermione story where he is redeemed in an interesting way I'd probably like to read it, but most stories shipping them just go with canon. And frankly their romance in canon is a farce and it sucks.

I don't hold the sentiment of OP's statement. I don't ship Hermione with Draco because Ron doesn't deserve her, I like reading interesting romance/drama/adventure/fantasy stories with an intelligent female lead and an interesting and appealing love interest. Ron doesn't fit that last part (in canon, and most fanfiction), but plenty of other characters in fanfiction /do/, and some characters in canon have more potential than others.

PS: If you wanted to use sex appeal from the movies' actor as a motive for the pairing, look at sevmione, [[https://youtu.be/xP06F0yynic?t=19s][Alan Rickman's voice]] is way above Tom Felton's appearance in terms of sex appeal.

******** Well, what can I say, I think that everything in canon points to Draco being witless, entitled, and overall a terrible person who everyone would hate having around in real life. I seriously don't see how anyone, especially Hermione (who he bullied for years), would want to take a "pet project" to redeem him.

I won't give you a good Hermione/Ron story because generally, I don't like either of them, and don't really like reading romance (especially not in fanfiction). With all my dislike for Ron, his bad traits are much less prominent than Draco's. He doesn't go around stealing people's property, bullying his classmates, creating "Potter Sucks" pins, trying to get animals executed, and certainly doesn't endanger everyone in the school while trying to kill Dumbledore with the most harebrained schemes. And he DOES work, his grades are above average, he just happens to be surrounded by people who are far above the norm.

Can we just focus on this for a bit? Seriously - well said.

Ron and Harry were both "above average" students. E means Exceeds Expectations: it is /not/ a 3.0 GPA, nor is it a B grade GCSE. It's what it says on the tin. Ron was chosen as the male Gryffindor prefect, while Harry was also considered. Bearing in mind that they've likely broken more rules in a year than Dean, Seamus and Neville could hope to break together in a few, there has to be something more to being shortlisted.

Grades, perhaps?

As far as I can see, between imitating Parseltongue to functional fluency and Stunning Death Eaters without incantations, Ron is at least on Draco's level in terms of intelligence. He's also got a wicked sense of humour.

I personally dislike reading Hermione/Ron fics, because I dislike a lot of Ron's traits most of the time when he's written. Not bashy traits, just, he's often written as someone I would not like in actuality. Sometimes he gets great character development though! We see much, much more of his personal mannerisms and beliefs and habits than we do Draco, which isn't a point in his favor.

I do enjoy the occasional Dramione, but I have to be in the mood for serious drama. Because this is a ship that has to have one hell of a journey to have a chance at working. And usually that comes from tropes like stuck together or marriage law, but not always. I'm in it for that drama filled, angst ridden, belief questioning roller coaster ride.

** Let's see how I can do this without writing an essay...

I'll start by happily admitting that I am a Dramione fan. I am also someone who is rather fond of Ron despite him being a giant childish git quite often (although, who *hasn't* been a childish git as least once throughout the books?).

I will confess, though, that I began as a Harry/Hermione shipper and that, if it weren't for the movies, I would have remained a Harry/Hermione shipper. It was Tom Felton, his chemistry with Emma, and that brief glimpse of Draco crumbling apart in HBP that had me questioning my ship and had me looking towards Draco.

Draco was, I have to admit, a typical one-dimensional, spiteful, and close-minded, bully for the first five books. Every image we get of him is focused on his arrogance, sneers, hate, and Pureblood elitist mindset. But, we never saw any other aspect of him. We never really got into his mind until HBP. In HBP, we saw him falter, we saw his home, saw his reactions to Charity's death, and we saw him finally begin to question what he believed. We saw him slowly becoming a man with his own thoughts, beliefs, and path. This Draco, the idea of a man who has changed, a man who made his own way and pulled away from the brainwashing of his father, is an appealing, complicated, and fascinating character to me. It is this Draco that I imagine as being with Hermione. This Draco who has become open-minded enough to interact amicably with a "Muggle-Born", but who still retains enough arrogance to engage in snarky remarks and witty banter with Hermione. It is a complicated relationship that would face far more obstacles than Ron/Hermione. I will admit, who doesn't love a good girl changing the bad boy type of relationship every now and then? This complex relationship can be far more intriguing to develop and can create a more compelling story to tell. I also feel that, if Draco had properly matured and broken away from Lucius (who I think should have died in DH), I think that he would have become an ideal partner for Hermione. They seem to almost balance each other out and I think that Draco, when he decides to love, loves to a fault and will be forever loyal. Therefore, their relationship, in this situation, feels more natural and less forced. To me, they just seem to fit. But, it still requires that Draco make these drastic changes to himself.

Ron, on the other hand, had a far more positive relationship with Hermione throughout the books. However, I never could imagine him being in a romantic relationship with her. To me, their relationship felt very platonic and amicable; like a brother and sister. The way they argued, the way they talked to each other, and the overall way they treated other felt familial in nature. So, when Hermione kissed Ron in DH and when they were shown married in the Epilogue, my first thought was not that Ron doesn't deserve her, it was simply that the relationship felt unrealistic and forced. I just didn't like it, despite liking both individuals. It wasn't a matter of whether or not he could have a proper conversation with her, it didn't matter how rich or poor he was, nor was it about his intelligence. It just did not feel like a real, complex, and loving (romantically) relationship.

I think the problem with some shippers is that they focus solely on Ron's negative personality traits, like when he snapped and ignored Harry throughout part of GoF, or when he abandoned his friends during DH. It is these moments that has these people thinking "Ron isn't good enough," but they forget to look beyond those parts. Harry, too, snapped at Hermione, and Hermione has also done things to piss off Harry and Ron (PoA - Firebolt). But, I also think that this is a stereotype given to them; while not every Dramione fan makes these claims, those who do tend to be a very vocal bunch. It is like any other stereotype we see in the media.

To conclude my long-winded response, if Draco had never shown signs of a more complex personality in HBP and if it weren't for Tom Felton being so damn sexy, I would have shipped Hermione and Harry through and through. But, Draco became fascinating to me and I felt that he and Hermione could make a very interesting match. It was not whether or not Ron deserved Hermione, it about how real the love felt, and while their love was very much real, it came across as a platonic rather than romantic love to me.

TL;DR: Dumbledore's beard was equally as awesome as Merlin's and I think they should have a beard-off.

*** That was incredibly well thought out, and you made so many points I agree with. One thing I'd like to add though was when I watched the deleted scene from CoS when he and Lucius are in Borgin and Burkes, where we see them interacting as father and son. As a kid I was like "he's a snobby brat who needs to get what's coming to him" but when I witnessed that little glimpse of their family-workings, my opinion shifted to "with a dad like that no wonder that kid is such a little shit." Just adding in my two cents.

*** The problem I have with the Dramione ship (not SHIPPERS, just the ship in general) is that I just don't see Hermione realistically forgiving this reformed Draco enough to start a relationship with him.

He bullied and antagonised her for five years of her life. Five of her most formative years at that. Hermione was always written, in my eyes, as someone who puts a lot of stock in justice and fairness, and has a firm set of beliefs, bordering on a stubborn personality.

I still haven't forgiven the people that bullied me ten years ago when I was 12, for Christ's sake.

/edit/ - realised this is probably a result of my tastes in fanfic setting, which tend to revolve around the time that the characters attended Hogwarts, so to me Draco only has 2-4 years to change and Hermione has even less to forgive him. Which, let's face it, is actually an unreasonable timeframe for an arc like this.

**** I wholly agree with that, which is why I tend to have her witness his changes. Hermione and Harry, I feel, have always been open-minded and more forgiving than someone like Ron, who tends to hold grudges.

What I always remember is that the man Hermione falls in love with is the Draco of the present, not of the past. I have one fic I'm working on where Draco does apologise, in a Malfoy-eque fashion, and she responds by saying she could never forgive him for what he did, but she is willing to move forward and not let the past forever cloud her thoughts.

We often forget that these characters are young teens. And teenagers can be very cruel and self-centered to the point where they don't have much empathy for people they don't identify with. This is why we see cliques.

I think Hermione would be willing to listen and to move beyond the past, but that doesn't mean she forgives the young Draco. She is merely focusing on the adult, mature Draco instead.

I will add that I was also bullied quite a bit as a child and as I grew, I understood that kids can be cruel, but they are also immature, naive, and close-minded. And I feel that Hermione may be inclined to think along the same lines.

Sorry for the essay. I do agree that she will not be likely to forgive, but I feel that she would be willing to look forward rather than forever in the past.

*** This is pretty much how I feel! I think thay JK should have stayed away from romantic relationships altogether. The forced feeling of Ron and Hermione's relationship is how I feel about Harry and Ginny's also. It's like JK knew that she wanted Hr/R and G/H to be together, but neglected to really make all of us feel strongly about them as couples. (For example, it seemed that all of a sudden Harry was protective of Ginny, but it also could have been a brotherly protectiveness, imo). If you take out the relationships, I think the last two books would have been better and I really like a /little/ ambiguity in my endings instead of these definitive answers about who they married and their kids' names.

Ironically, Felton first auditioned for the role of Harry Potter and Ron Weasley: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Felton#2000.E2.80.93present]]

In my opinion, Felton has greater physical resemblance (tall, slender, almost green eyes) to book Harry than Dan Radcliffe.

****** I agree that Harry/Hermione isn't really a thing in canon, but I don't like Ron/Hermione. When I was younger I liked it, I liked how Harry and Hermione both married a Weasley, it was just a nice ending to the story. However since 2007 when DH came out I've re-read the series every Christmas and each time I do I end up disliking the Ron and Hermione relationship more and more. Harry Potter as a series has always been very important to me since I was a lonely 10 year old that found friends in these characters. Once I grew up and developed a better understanding of relationships I can see that these two characters who I love are horrible for each other and don't fit at all. I really dislike reading R/Hr for this reason. I think Harry/Hermione works in fanfiction but it requires certain criteria to be met. Mostly I prefer stories that don't fit these three together at all, however I hate when people pair any of them with Draco and Snape even more than I hate when they are paired together.

******** I just find difficult to find anything Ron and Hermione have in common that isn't Harry related. My head canon has Ron and Hermione going on a date at the end of HBP and coming back laughing about how they needed to take Harry with them the next time. I think it diffuses the flirting/tension between Ron and Hermione that built since GoF without hurting the group integrity.

Also I agree with you about Harry and Ginny being a pretty good match. I think Ginny represents family which is Harry's greatest ambition. I think most people don't have a problem with H/G so much as they have a problem with the protagonist ending up with such a poorly fleshed out character.

And yeah, amiable discussion is great.

**** Whatever you think of Draco, he is fairly intelligent in canon, at least in the [[http://hipsterkankuro.tumblr.com/post/122709641654/draco-malfoy-in-the-books][books]], they dumbed him down a lot in the movies. Not cunning at all though, I think he's mostly in Slytherin on ambition.

Can you imagine people that identify with Hermione while reading the books might appreciate that trait? Add to that that he was forced (mother was threatened, he's literally found crying in sixth year regarding the situation) to the 'dark side' even after being indoctrinated all his life and you can see the openings for a romance story based on redeeming a guy with a troubled past. Very appealing indeed.

Ron on the other hand is a walking example of an anti-intellectual, him and Hermione (who adores learning and knowing things) are fundamentally incompatible with this.

Plus, it's actually quite difficult to get rid of deep-seated beliefs.
