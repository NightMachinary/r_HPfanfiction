So, this is basicely just me complaining a lot about specific things in hp fanfiction in general (the fandom, not this subreddit - which is rather nice.

Firstly, its seriously turning me homophobic, i have 0 issues with gay people IRL but i dont enjoy reading about them in a main pov fashion (i have no issue with gay couples in stories in general, just not with the main protagonist involved). See awesome story, epic lenght, good writing - aaaaaaaaaaand its HPDM and in the garbage it goes.

I dont know why theres such a huge part of this fandom (or fanfiction in general) that seems to really like slash. And while harry + draco is at least understandable the endless SS/HP, LV/HP, lucios malfoy/HP, even fucking vernon dursley/HP is just disgusting. But ok, people have weird taste which i can sort of life with, if they just mentioned it.

Why are there endless trigger warning everywhere, yet at least 50% of slash stories seem to just forget to mention that suddenly harry gets banged by some dude halfway through the story, with no reason at all plot wise. Its just there for the sake of itself. 50000 words read and having to stop halfway through is just infuriating.

But enough about slash, lets talk about strong or powerfull Harry, it seems like endless fics have the format of: 5% introduction, 85% training, 10% one final fight which is trivial because of all the training. Not to mention that it makes no sense at all, some schoolkid with books he can conveniently find in his school library can after a bit of classes suddenly take on one of the greatest wizards of all time, and totally beat him.

Theres a reason why almost all stories of children beating the big bad evil involve a lot of luck and chances and heroic moments, not just the kid suddenly becomming stronger then the big bad evil, marching up to him and just beating him in a normal fight. Thats because that makes no sense.

On the topic of training, if your protagonist spends 50k words learning a specific spell or becomes an animagus that better serve some point in the story, to often harry learns something which takes forever and then he never ever uses it. Its totally pointless.

Next up, and this is a bit unfair, people not knowing how to write dialogue annoys me so much. You have this great start into the story, all the dursley stuff is handles very well and then harry meets his future friends, allies or enemies - and it all goes down the drain. 11 year olds speaking like they are holding a lecture, monologues going on for pages and so on. At some point that just becomes unreadable.

All Lord Potter, Black or Peverell stuff, or if any significant time is spend in Gringotts with specific mentioning of how rich and influent harry now is, totally kills a story for me. Also politics, i dont think i saw more then maybe 2 or 3 fics doing politics in a way that make sense or was fun to read. This is especially horrible in slytherin!harry fics where he gets his 11-14 year old "friends" to do political manoeuvres which increases his influence that much, just stop it, ffs.

Why is Hedwig always named Hedwig?

I also really dislike the over the top Molly bashing or making Dumbledore or Voldemort to incompetent. If you dont like Ron thats fine, but making Molly into this evil mastermind just doesnt make much sense. And if the super villain in a non comedy fic is still a joke theres no suspense in the story.

Which in general is a problem, no story bar romantic one (will they or wont they) actually is very thrilling, they can be very fun to read. But the "omg what is going to happen next, are they going to make it?" factor is missing almost all the time.

Theres much more to go on, but ima stop for now i think, just had to get all this off my chest. Probably will post more in comments.

Feel free to disagree, hate or agree. Or post what you HATE to see in fics.

*** To be fair, though, in some stories it really doesn't make sense for her to be called that way; heck, I remember once trying to read a story in which there happened to be a moment when Lucius bought Harry an owl and /he/ named her “Hedwig” (suffice to say, the fic ended up being rubbish later, but yeah, why the heck would Lucius use that name?). But no, gotta have the stations of the canon.

It's one of the few compliants from this post I can somewhat agree with. But it's to fanfic authors rather than to us, so I can but shrug.

**** The white snowy owl of Harry Potter must be named Hedwig, no exceptions.

I'm sure that is a cosmic law with some severe punishment in the afterlife for those who break it.

No, but honestly, if I read "snowy owl" and that animal isn't named Hedwig it feels weird to me. I rather Harry gets a different breed of owl, or a different pet altogether, but that is such a small detail... I can't bring myself to care overly much in all honesty.

** What bewilders me is why almost all the fics where Harry has some kind of creature blood (whether potion accident, animagus traits, inherited by a parent) or curse(vampire,werewolf) that inevitably means he needs to find a fucking MALE mate (to do what exactly!? ಠ_ಠ MPREG! (╬ ಠ益ಠ) Sure that makes sense, ABSOLUTELY NOT!) and be sub/dom (Seriously?! What happened to your human mind and free will? Did you have any in the first place at all?). Are these some kinky fantasies or for 'special' people, because certainly aren't good for plot building.

I mean come on! Magical being! Awesome racial traits like any fantasy game! You are an high elf with high reflexes, agility, grace, sight. There is a culture hidden from the magical world in its own realm with its own magic, traditions, weapons, armor.

But unfortunately you turn out to be submissive male and need 100 mates to fuck you in the a** and chase after you like some kind of mindless animals. And for some reason you are OK with that and like it because the transformation has stripped you from any rational though. Oh and that world that your race belongs to, too bad but it's not there! Your racial traits? Congratulations, you never need to use them, because your mate will do everything for you and you are his weak submissive *****!

Why can't you concentrate on the cool part of being a vampire or werewolf?! Why does having creature blood and having some awesome animal features need to mean you are a furry? Why does it need to be some kind of sick perversion of a romance where there is no choice and instinctual 'attraction' (more like free will destroying obsession) rules everything, in fact why does it even need to be an obligatory romance in the first place? Why the hell are male Harry and Malfoy/Snape/Zabini/Greyback(WTF?!Why?! T_T) mates?! It doesn't make any sense at all! Attraction based on instinct should be towards the opposite gender unless you are a snail hybrid or something, and it certainly won't be towards Harry's most hated people.

But that rant is going nowhere. There are usually warnings (thankfully!) and I can skip those fics.

What ticks me off is that fanficion is being flooded with low quality slash (trash!) that doesn't make any rational sense plot wise and that almost all creature blood fics have people of the same gender paired up, or have an obligatory pairing at all. Can't the magical world scorn you for your traits /hum/hum* Dolores /cough/.

I just want more supernatural magical beings that act like their lore expects them to. Some diversity in races that doesn't start with overly helpful goblins (house elfs) and end in gay vampires. Stop ruining my childhood T_T. I've lost almost all respect for vampire!elf!werewolf!Harry.

OK this was a pointless rant. But I've vented and I guess you're not alone? I usually don't care if the fic is slash, but when everything revolves around that and it doesn't make any sense I just can't stomach it. Usually if the story has good enough rational plot I'm fine with it as long as it isn't a central point to the story.

** More ranty stuff:

Screw harry/many, harem fics are all horrible. And its really annoying if you read a good romantic story, build up is great and finally the 2 get together - only for harry to start banging other girls a few pages later, and his main pairing obviously is super ok with it. I dont even like this in smut, but in "normal" fics this is just atrocious.

Same if theres to much sex in the story, if you are writing a proper story lemons are totally not needed. If theres something very important happening in between - sure, write a sex scene. But if its just porn for the sake of porn its horrible.

Also, but this is quite personal, i hate slytherin!Harry who is super nice, befriends hermione and neville and is just an awesome guy who is liked by everyone. It doesnt fit at all.

*** Yah, I hate harem fics, too. Poly is fine, but harems put me off.

Smut, as with anything else, should either progress the story or reveal something about/develop the characters. It should also be used sparingly, so as not to become trite. That's just my opinion, of course.

Also, I agree with you on the whole Slytherin!Harry thing. He doesn't have to be bad/evil or anything, but I always find it odd when he's portrayed as this giant teddy bear who wants to help everyone.

** YKINMKBYKIOK, basically.

I understand what you mean, there are a LOT of fics out there that aren't my cup of tea. Thing is, no one is writing specifically for me, so that's kind of inevitable. I tend to find an author I like, then I check out the fics that /they/ bookmark because I can assume we have some of the same tastes. That always opens up a few new stories I didn't know about.

Also, be a bit more open to tropes. I don't like Lord Potter either, but if I find a fic that features that I might stick with it because it has some other plot element that I do like. I have a few tropes that I just refuse to deal with whatsoever (de-aged fics fall under this), but I've learned to be flexible with some of the others.

***** Which is why i made a rantpost about it, if people like gay stuff - go ahead and like it. Im not telling people not to write slash, but now and then i want to be angry about it being everywhere.

But deep down inside me when after 200k words old voldemort starts going down on 12 year old harry without a warning anywhere i just want to take the author and punch him into the fact and tell him to be a disgusting fuck elsewhere.

I dont want to read about gay couples, i just dont - most people dont. In "normal" literature that is pretty much accepted and thus 99% of books released are heterosexual or nothing at all. I dont mind it being there but so many interesting reads are ruined for me by this.

I like (usually horrible) wrong bwl stories, dont know why but i do, but whenever anyone ask for them you get saving connor linked, every single time. And it looks like an amazing read, dark but good harry, its long, its interesting - and its full of HP/DM and thus i just get angry when i see it.

This doesnt transfer into irl, i have nothing against gay couples outside of the internet, but here it makes me mad. And thus i made a rantpost about it. Fuck slash, fuck it with a stick.

****** Yikes, what kind of fics are you stumbling across? That sounds horrid. Yeah, everyone's got the right to rant. I'm not seeing as many slash fics as you seem to be finding, so I dunno.

One thing I could suggest that you may have already done is to find the authors that you like and then check out the stories that /they/ have favorited. Usually, that opens up a few other authors I may not have found before and I can keep going on and on like that for a while. Also, AO3's filtering and tagging system is by far better than FFN's when it comes to this, so maybe play around with that.

But I know that you came to rant, not ask for advice so I'll stop there. ^{-^{;;}}

If that were true then slash wouldn't be so rampant in fandom, don't you think? Frankly, I think the reason there's so much slash in fandom is because there's not enough queer romance being published--not because it isn't what people want, but because it's still seen as "high-risk" and "niche-writing," and because there's still a stigma attached. It has nothing to do with the fact that people don't want to read about it. I mean, the most popular romance fic on AO3 is a slash fic with over 529,699 unique hits. That's over half a million hits. That's a lot of people.

I think it speaks for itself that most fandoms are dominated by slash pairings, don't you?

Take this subreddit and look at the poll at the pront page, its about as PC as it gets, people are extremely left on the political spectrum, not relgious or in other ways "backwards" thinking - yet even here most people dont want to read slash.

Its the 1.5-10% of gay people and teengaged girls wanting yaio.

*** There's lots of lengthy slash stories without smut, though most tend to have at least one sex scene, however brief. I personally don't mind them. What I hate is when there's a sex scene every other chapter (sometimes every single chapter). That's when I lose interest (unless the fic is otherwise excellent, in which case I'll skim over the smut).

There's nothing wrong wish sex scenes. Slash authors tend to overdo it, though. Like, I enjoy a good sex scene as much as the next person, but there's only so many ways you can write two (or more) people screwing without it getting boring.

You know, I've been reading fanfiction for over a decade and I've never, ever come across a fic with surprise!slash or surprise!sex. Like, ever. In fact, most authors seem to go out of their way to warn for potential/eventual slash just so they won't get flak from people who don't like it.

Now, het? Het is an entirely different story. I can't even count the number of fics I've read that turned out to be het fics with little to no warning from the author. I like het, don't get me wrong, and I read a lot of it, but I'm really picky about the het ships I like/fics I read and I hate when it's sprung on me out of nowhere, which /always happens./ And god forbid you message the author to ask why they didn't warn for het romance at the beginning of the fic (or at least as soon as they realized the fic was heading in that direction). Let a slash author pull a stunt like that and they'd find themselves the target of a flame war.

A plotty 100k fic that has hints of slash gets slapped with a "BEWARE OF GAY!" warning label by everyone, but a plotty 100k fic that has explicit het is considered gen and anyone who complains about it is scoffed at for being "too sensitive."

The only people who don't find slash normal are homophobes.

"And for good reason" is utter bullshit. Newsflash, queer people exist everywhere. Queer relationships exist everywhere. And they--/we/--have every right to be represented in both mainstream and obscure media the same way heterosexual people and relationships do.
