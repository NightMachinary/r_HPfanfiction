** That's sort of the premise of linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter), but he /does/ die each time. It's just that he gets better; specifically, he resets to an earlier point in time, though he has no control of the process.

***** The website that does them (FF2Ebook) doesn't really work reliably with FFNet anymore - the FFNet admins changed the security on their site and bots are struggling to work around it due to the way they access the site to download fics.

It's just something we gotta be patient about. Someone will adjust their downloader bots to make them work properly again soon enough. :)

** "Get off of that unicorn, you foul creature!"

The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry---unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry.

"I'm not afraid of you. A troll, a dragon, and a 200 foot fall couldn't kill me, so do your worst."

When Malfoy and Fang, who were unable and unwilling to keep up with Harry's enthusiastic pace, finally reached the clearing, all they found was a very dead Harry Potter and a sad centaur, who turned to face them.

"Not even the stars can fully account for stupidity, it seems."

***** His superpower is actually his accelerated healing ability. It was what allowed him to survive the surgery to put the adamantium (the fictional indestructible metal) along his whole skeleton and give him his classic claws. I always found that so interesting about him. You think it's the claws that are his superpower but they're not. I'm not an active fan of superhero stuff these days but I remember getting up early Saturday mornings as a kid to tape X-men cartoon episodes. ðŸ˜‚ Am I ageing myself with that comment?

****** Huh. I did not know that it was healing and not the claws. You learn something new every day. :)

And I honestly have no idea if you are aging yourself - I only vaguely knew that there were superhero cartoons, but I have no idea when X-Men cartoons would've been made specifically. That could've been yesterday, could've been decades ago.

My exposure to superheroes is basically second-hand internet knowledge, the first avengers movie, whichever spiderman movie had the green armoured dude in it, the first season of the Arrow tv series, and the Logan movie - I also have vague memories of a friend introducing me to a spiderman videogame back in the day, but I don't remember anything about it beyond swinging through the city.

Superheroes are really not something I engage with at all, unfortunately. :)

**** They mostly heal, except if the wound is on the neck, I think? tbh that was kind of a plot hole, the one guy Duncan sliced across the voice box never healed right. And if they lost a limb, it stayed lost, but I always thought if it was near them when they revived it would reattach. It varied greatly, they could die by explosion and be fine in five minutes or five hours, they didn't take long to heal fully.
