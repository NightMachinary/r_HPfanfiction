Summary:

"Succorbentis?" Malfoy asked quietly, his face immediately hidden by that insufferable mask. "You have Succorbentis?" Silence. "You know it's an incredibly rare disease, right? You know it's incurable, right?" Silence. "...No wonder you're in denial."

Incomplete but around 300k words. Quite sweet, and I just finished it about five minutes ago. This has quickly risen to the top of my favorites list - the other two competing for top spot is the story of lupin /marauders that is still unfinished (cannot remember the name for the life of me, but it's frequently recommended in this subreddit), and A Marauder's Plan ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]]). I just can't decide which of the three I love the most.

  Stelena, AU, all human. When you know you're going to die, are you strong enough to live? When you accept your fate, can you open yourself to the possibility of it being altered?
