I'm fairly sure that the title sums up exactly what I'm looking for...

You know how halfway through Prisoner of Azkaban, a Kiss-On-Sight (that is, authorizing the Dementors to Kiss Sirius Black immediately if they find him) is issued by the Ministry of Magic? Remus Lupin mentions reading about it in the Daily Prophet?

   :CUSTOM_ID: section-1
   :END:
Does anyone know any fics that diverge from canon at that point, to make the issuing of that order thoroughly backfire?

For example, Sirius might be legally owed a trial to, at minimum, confirm his identity before being punished for escaping, and the kiss-on-sight order violates that, or it turns out that the Dementors are blind (as per canon) and can't actually identify Sirius, leading them to Kiss several innocent people, or the fact that Sirius never had a trial (or at least was never allowed a defense) and the attempt at what's essentially an extrajudicial killing makes the Ministry look extremely bad?

*** Amelia Bedelia has joined the Auror forces. Sirius suddenly finds himself getting his first kiss in 15 years. Eventually, they end up falling in love and marrying. Their children destroy Hogwarts when they eventually end up going.

Point of divergence is not Sirius, but the trial before 5th year, but it should check all your other boxes.

*** Mm...not really.

It's funny, but it relies on 'what new plot device can we introduce to ruin Fudge's day' a lot rather than having things arise from an initial set of assumptions.

And I very specifically want mid-third-year, when the Dementor's Kiss is authorized...

  What would have happened if Harry had been convicted by the Wizengamot after defending himself from dementors before his fifth year at Hogwarts? Humorous! Followup stories on Sirius Black plus Cornelius Fudge's attempt at becoming a dark lord.
