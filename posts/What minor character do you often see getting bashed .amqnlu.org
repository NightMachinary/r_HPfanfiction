**** As [[/u/duplaja][u/duplaja]] points out, canon says that Luna had most of her possessions taken from her.

That said, she's never described as being forced to walk around Hogwarts barefoot--that was only in the movies.

So, her bullies are obviously clever enough to knick things that she isn't using or possibly won't need right away or can easily claim that Luna lost them herself.

She's also never described as being physically harassed--I've see a fair few fanfics where Luna is severely physically bullied. Given that she's outnumbered by her housemates, it wouldn't necessarily be hard for this to happen, but it doesn't appear to be the case in canon. They steal her things, and possibly destroy homework assignments, but, unlike Slytherins, they do not cast jinxes on her.

****** *Bisexual lighting*

Bisexual lighting is the simultaneous use of pink, purple, and blue lighting to represent bisexual characters. It has been used in nightclubs as well as supposedly in studio lighting for film and television.

*** Did we ever see Lockhart successfully cast any spell in canon? We know he can cast obliviate, but even the one time on-screen(so to speak) he failed at it, due to Ron's wand. I don't think he even succeeds at casting anything during the Dueling club. The rest are definitely exaggerations though.

Besides, comedically-incompetent-Fudge is at least a definite step up from evil-secretly-Voldemort-supporting-Fudge, which is also something I've seen and is much more "Fudge-bashing" than any amounts of incompetence.

I get what you're saying, but in terms of narrative role, Umbridge is the figure of authority holding on to her position to feed her personal vices, and in the process ignoring the long-term greater good.

So is Realistic!Fudge, except that he's literally the Minister instead of just supporting the Ministry, and that his vice is greed rather than control-freak-ness and sadism.

Sure, but these fics will make a mess of whatever they touch. Tropes aren't bad per se. (Though I'll grant you that some of them /invite/ badness more readily than others; it's certainly harder to do Evil!Ron right than it is to do time-travel right, to take two well-known tropes of which the former is far more hated than the latter.)

In point of fact, I write a (comedy) fic with a laughably incompetent Fudge, but it's got nothing to do with steamrolling him for easy wish-fulfillment, and hasn't got a single Magical Lordship or hyphenated protagonist name in it. And lo and behold I've gotten nothing but praise for my take on Befuddled!Fudge when he was mentioned in reviews.

****** You definatly make a strong argument, but here's the thing. A realistic fudge could always be reasoned with given strong incentives. Umbridge on the other hand, given her personality, would never ever give in to Harry.

I bet you as soon as canon Fudge sees that Harry has a billion wizengamot seats from his last names that he would support Harry.

Why?

Because Harry can keep him getting reelected and that's all politicians care about. He's not actually cruel and wanting to inflict pain on his enemies.

********* Yeah, but bumbling short-sightedness accounts for that too. I'm not saying that my Fudge is a paragon of lawfulness, to be clear. Just that he's not so much actively malicious as completely out of his depth and only too happy to jump to whatever conclusions nearby advisors (whatever their motives) make to him. I have little doubts that a certain helpful Senior Undersecretary saw how worried Fudge was about --- /everything/ --- during the /Chamber of Secrets/ debacle, suggested Hagrid's arrest, and Fudge didn't really stop to wonder if it was in any way logical or ethical.

*** Well, it's not just the Voldemort thing (though it really didn't help). He's also got one of the worst lines in all of canon about the Ministry needing to be seen doing something during the CoS as a justification for arresting Hagrid. His ministry puts dementors around Hogwarts for suspect reasons (they clearly were ineffective at stopping Black from getting out of prison), and then he's clearly linked to Umbridge. A lot of that isn't something that we can say 100% that he was responsible for, but he represents the Ministry of Magic and all of its worst aspects to the reader. He's portrayed as being willing to do anything to preserve his political power, which is very realistic for a politician, but given the at-time satirical tone of the HP series it isn't much of a jump to go "well, anything, you say?" into a nude Fudge committing weird rituals with walruses in broad daylight in Diagon Alley.
