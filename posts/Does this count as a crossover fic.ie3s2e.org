I've been thinking about writing a HP fic with a focus on elemental magic. A lot of it would be inspired by Avatar: The Last Airbender. But no characters, systems of magic, or plots from it would be used in the fic. Just an emphasis on elemental magic.

Edit : thank you all for the advice! I'm not incredibly familiar with crossover fics and I just wanted to make sure!


** If it's possible for a reader to understand and enjoy the fic without knowing anything about ATLA at all, and none of the characters show up, it isn't a crossover, it's just inspired by ATLA.

** I wouldn't classify it a crossover. I only count it if characters show up either actively or as something that happened innthe past

** Then no, not a crossover but inspired by or from the events of TLA
