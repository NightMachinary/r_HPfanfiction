And when the "family" hears little cousin Hermione is being bullied at her new school? It's up to cousin Vinny "the Mug" Falcone to make sure Hogwarts shows his little cousin some respect. Capiche!


** More like the Grangers are mob bosses masquerading as dentists.

** I don't know about the Falcones, but I love the idea of mob daughter Hermione:

- Why is she so careful to follow rules and procedures? Because where she comes from, failing to gets you caught and jailed at best and tortured and murdered at worst.
- Learning about the mind arts and Memory Charms makes her alternately giddy and paranoid.
- A few days after Draco turns them in during the Norberta escapade, he's found beaten to a bloody pulp. A note is found next to him, which reads "snitches get stitches". Naturally, Hermione, Harry, and Ron all have ironclad alibis.
- Assuming she is still in Gryffindor and Draco still challenges Harry to a duel:

  "He's conning you, Harry. I'm not gonna let you go meet him."

  "What're you gonna do? Tell a prefect?"

  "What kind of person do you think I am, Ronald?!"

*** "You know why Hermione took your Firebolt, Harry. She hates Quidditch."

"Now, hold on just a minute, Weasley. While I'm not a fan of balls and hoops, catching Snitches is right up my alley. But for your elucidation, I'm concerned that the guy out to whack you might have set up a Vitelli Surprise on your ride, capisce?"

"Can you translate for us, Dean?"

"She says she thinks Black rigged your broom to explode. Also, she doesn't like Quidditch, and implied that she tortures police informants."

"Thank you, Dean."
