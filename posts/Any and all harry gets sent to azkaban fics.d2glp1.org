Sounds interesting and I'm sure it's been done to death. Any good ones?


** If you want a fic about what happens when he gets /out/ of Azkaban, which is where most of these fics end, I'd recommend linkffn(An Old And New World) by Lens of Sanity. That version is a wip edited reupload of the original completed story.

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane. Still, it's the only game in town...

** Haven't read a lot but linkffn(7713063) has probably one of the best plot-settings among a lot of fics.

** I won't mention the couple of old ones I know to save you the pain of having to read them. They're... Special. Very much so.

However, linkffn(Griffon Reborn by Yrtria) has one of the better examples of a trial I can think of, and is quite good at the recovery part even if it is quite sadly abandoned.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13020316/1/The-People-You-Trust]]).

The best Azkaban!Harry I've read. Minimum bashing, the trial makes sense, and I love the Trio interaction here.

  Harry never killed or tortured anyone, yet they convicted him for the crimes and sentenced him to life in Azkaban. His friends believe him guilty, the Ministry is more corrupt than anyone realizes and Voldemort is closing in. When the Order comes across info that only Harry can help them with, they need to furlough the prisoner for his help. Can they trust him? Can he trust them?
