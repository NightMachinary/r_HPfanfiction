:END:
Said don is driving in downtown London and sees Petunia slap Harry, and has his thug "rescue" him at gunpoint. They go to a counterfeiter for fake documents, who turns out to be Remus Lupin. Sirius escapes Azkaban and ends up working for the Don after accidentally stopping a skim operation from another don.

** Not your requirement, but there is also 'The Uncle' on ao3 where Remus himself is the don.
