Ok, so I haunt Harry and Snape or Harry and Hermione stories. So strange a thing is happening, Umbridge sympathy. Fics where Severus is in love with her or Harry is really her son, WTF is going on?

I don't get it, why is Umbridge now a sympathetic character?

** I would personally take it as a literary challenge to redeem a character so already entrenched in the minds of readers as a terrible person.

I have no desire to do such a thing as I believe Umbridge would still find a way to be a frigid bitch if magic didn't exist.

Agreed. A good author likes a challenge.

** There's a lot of stories. There are a lot of authors. There's been enough time that it might be getting difficult to think of something that might not have been done, or done much.

If there can be stories where Snape gets sympathy, or a personality makeover, Umbridge can as well. All it takes is a few well placed compulsion charms and ignoring her background on Pottermore. Now you've got free reign to give her whatever personality you like. That's the easy part. Hard part is doing it well and finding a still suitable but not evil personality.

**** That's what alternate universes are for. I do agree- some of Severus's traits can be used in a good storyline that make him not what he turned out to be. And I don't see Umbridge having any good traits. But if you create a storyline where the personality we see in canon is a false personality implanted by someone else to use her as a tool, well you've got something to work with. I just don't think it'd be easy to do well. If her canon personality is /really/ her, I'm not going to be able to suspend disbelief if the author is trying to give her a redemption arc. I can see someone trying, though!

**** I thought about it for a moment, and found an avenue of semi-redemption that seems very plausible. Umbridge has an obsession with Fudge and the Ministry. She will do anything to keep them safe and in order.

Imagine now, that she is somehow actually convinced that Voldemort is really back and is threatening her ideals. Imagine her now, directing that hate and bitchiness towards him. Like, sending the dementors to Voldemort instead of Harry... hehe.

I've never seen anything like that obviously, but I just had the idea and it seemed hilarious but interesting at the same time.

***** In canon, Umbridge's ideals ALINED with Riddle's. She was oh so happy to live under him. Umbridge has no compassion, no sympathy, she is a sociopath who doesn't care who she has hurt, kill to get her way.

****** I know about her views in general, but I was talking about the ideals mentioned on my first paragraph.. Aka her obsession with order, the ministry and Fudge worship. In canon, she loved Riddle's ministry cause it turns out the coup was too slick - in the end, he turned out to be THE government anyway.

I just described a different scenario. Maybe unlikely, but plausible. (And fun.)

  All he could see was the vision from the dream he'd had. Dumbledore falling back as the wand slipped from between Snape's own sweaty fingertips. The Dark Lord in his pleasure, torturing Umbridge once he found her. Her mangled body hung suspended beside Harry Potter's motionless one in the Great Hall as she screamed in terror for Snape to save her, but, as usual, he was too late.

** linkffn(Junior Inquisitor) has an almost likable Umbridge. She's a character who is very motivated by her own self-interest and will do anything she thinks will protect that, so if her self-interest aligns with that of another character, like Harry, I can see how she could become an ally.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

** I don't have any particular love for her, but I also don't have much hate for her, either. I just found her character to be an unrealistic caricature of a real person used by JKR solely for the purpose (augmented by her connection to Fudge's mostly off-screen incompetence/antagonism) of putting the Ministry at odds with the conglomerate of Harry/Dumbledore in winning over the hearts and minds of Hogwarts students (no Umbridge -> no DA -> the past 4 years of being an isolated, moody brat come bite Harry in the ass by having very few people actually willing to fight at his side against Voldemort/Death Eaters/Snatchers/et al).

**** Again, not saying I like her, but she's simply too evil to be realistic. I mean, Blood Quills alone? Ridiculous. Though the whole Muggleborn affair does hark badly to all of the internment (Jewish, Japanese, etc) that's happened over the ages.

As for the American (I'm assuming you mean the GOP) candidates, I just don't believe Trump's persona (I'm still fully convinced he's trolling, I just don't know *who* is being trolled at this point). As for the others, most of them will get weeded out, and whoever passes the primary will then have to move to the middle for the general election. Not terribly in love with our political system, but despite how being tied up in bureaucracy slows down all efforts to effect change, this slowdown thankfully effects bad decisions as well.

***** Umbridge didn't care she was torturing people, specifically children, she sent Dementors after Harry, whether to kill or just scare into using magic. She is an example of what a Sociopath is, people like her exist. Voldemort was the more fantasy element yet still he has a basis in reality, the psychopath.

** i never thought she was that unlikeable, and i always imagined she was just what all wizards are like, most of the time. each time a character pops up they act all annoying just like her: those hufflepuff dicks in cos, percy, any aura not in the order, most ministry people, every slytherin, even a few griffs like cormac or whatever his name is, cedric and his daddy. 99% of wizards are umbridge's, most even dress awful, right. she just got more air time. the ministry has a giant golden statue expressing her views, and apparently everyone works there and no one is complaining.

oh, and hermione is basically the same character but with muggle morals. like a lot of characters her actions are all umbridge but her most quotable moments are all dumbledore.
