I honestly want to read some fics where Harry and crew (Ron and Hermione along with Neville, Ginny, and Luna) go on adventures outside Hogwarts during their years there. Maybe with the use of Thestrals again or the Floo network. Just as long as where they are going isn't related to the Horcruxes and such.
