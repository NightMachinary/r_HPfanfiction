So I have seen fics which are basically Scar Horcrux kills off baby Harry's consciousness, and possesses the body of Harry, I have seen fics where Scar Horcrux possesses a more matured Harry Potter intermittently, and I have seen fics where Harry kills the Scar Horcrux (every Indy!Harry ever). What I haven't particularly seen, is a total role reversal. I want to see a fic where Voldemort completely takes over Baby Harry's body and grows up at Private Drive, but because of the wording of the Prophecy, is unable to actually kill Harry's consciouosness, and thus Harry grows up and matures solely in Voldemort's mindscape, directly affected by Voldemort's thoughts and emotions during his formative years. I feel like it would be really interesting to see something like that, and as HarryMort gets older, he begins to get possessed by the actual Harry, who by this time is completely fucked up mentally. Are there any fics which do this? Did I give a plot bunny to anyone? Any problems with the scenario?


** Not a bad idea at all but, well, if you go by the premise that we're mostly products of our experiences, then the actual Harry would not be very different from the real Voldemort because "Harry grows up and matures solely in Voldemort's mindscape, directly affected by Voldemort's thoughts and emotions during his formative years".

If you give more importance to innate natural personalities, you could still achieve this same effect by having HarryMort be a combination (and fusion) of the two souls and so get part of Harry's natural personality too.

*** That's a fair point. I was just trying to think about what would happen if a kid was exposed to say Voldemort's surface thoughts and emotions, but only rarely the memories and motivations. Voldemort might be thinking kill everybody, but underneath that thought he has tons of memories and life experiences leading to those thoughts, as well, as well as the maturity to know when to do it. But Harry doesn't have any experience in the real world, besides what he might glimpse of Voldemort's memories every so often. The effect being a very unstable kid, without any understanding of cause and effect, and all those attributes that you need for life. Voldemort, evil as he was, has that. But if Harry grows up like that, and begins possessing the Scar Horcrux back, I could see him start trying to kill people without distinction, until Voldemort pushes him down again.

** Not really quite you're looking for, but linkffn(11065365) takes just about the weirdest route with the whole Scar-Horcrux plotline. You see, Harry is semi-accidentally killed by the Dursleys, but stays behind on Earth thanks to......Lily's sacrifice, protection, something something... so anyway. His body becomes a semi-sentient inferius, while his ghost hangs around as a ghost; one decides to go by Harold, the other by Harrison. Except Harold the Inferius is really Harry, whereas 'Harrison' is the scar-Horcrux who was so confused by the traumatic event of the death that he has forgotten his Voldemort-life and only has Harry's memories. When the Letter arrives, at any rate, Harrison starts possessing Harold so that they can pass for a still-living Harry.

It's weird, weird, /weird/.

  Harry Potter died on December 4th,1987. He was buried in a mausoleum the Surrey Graveyard. Now, his ghost and his corpse are two entities. When Harrison the Ghost and Harold the Zombie get a letter to Hogwarts, Harrison hatches a plan. Watch as these two masquerade as one of the living, and will anybody find out? No pairings yet. AU. Undead!Harry. Rated T for mentions of violence.
