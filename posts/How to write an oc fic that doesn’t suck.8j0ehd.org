** Do NOT give your OC "flaws" that are just cute. Also, no informed flaws. Is your OC hot tempered and does not think things through? Show me! Show me how this screws up her life ( even if just a little bit). Is she a shy wallflower? Show how this affedcts her life ( and not just by others being "mean to her") .

Have consequences happen. No matter what action, good or bad, your OC does not exist in a vacuum, what she does will have consequences.

Let her be wrong! Everybody nakes mistakes once in a while, your OC is allowed them, too. And people are allowed she is an ass for doing something they disasgree with without THEM ering an ass.

Give her a good supporting cast and realistic interactions with them. Again, your character does not exist in a vacuum.

If canon characters exist in your story try to present them fairly from as narrator's point, though it is fine if your OC does not like them. ( f.e., she can think McGonagall is prejudiced to her because of how strict she is, but YOU have to rermermber that this teacherr is the "strict but fair" type when wtiting their interactions. )

Make the story actually interesting.

Hold off the "political manipulations" or "romance" stuff till your characters are older.

** Fuck up the OC's life. For every good trait, give him a bad one, for everything good that happens in his life or with his goals, give him a kick in the balls later. How bad or how good these traits and events are of course depend on your story, and just how cruel you can be, maybe even killing him or her off in the end.

It sounds cruel, but it's for the best. It's too easy to make perfect but two dimensional OCs.

** 1. Try to distance from OC. Is there, actually, more plot than just her life and contribution to canon events?

2. Make her believable. Not a plot device/author proxy, but a character that can act in her own and contrdict your wishes. Well, better do it with everybosdy, but main char in particular. Run through her past year after year. Any events that will give her non-standard reactions to smth? (You dont need to mention those events, of course)

3. Add /something/ new. A thing that will truly make it \not\ just another one. 3.5. and really, /really/ try to /do/ it. Not to turn into a grave in a cemetery of frozen fics. 3.75. list all details that bug you in canon(eg, time-turners) and cliche traits. do not allow them to be here, except intentionally and in a right way.

** Are you worried about your character or plot? OC fics usually get a bad rep because the character is a Mary Sue or the long lost sister/brother of the mc which is incredibly over used.

If your worried about the character you need to focus on making sure she is developed as much as possible. I like to start with one thing my character excels at. Then I list three things they are horrible at- not cutesy kind of things, ie being clutzy in an endearing way. It's so overused at this point. If they are clutzy, then maybe they get embarrassed and try to cover it up by saying they meant to do it, or maybe they have a disability that makes them less coordinated. This helps steer you away from the Mary Sue trap. This can also help in establishing their personality and shows they are not perfect.

From their I determine where they are at in life at the start of the story. Do they have a job? How old? Are they popular? What kind of lifestyle do they have? Who do they live with and where? Knowing this helps me come up with their history, because it forces me to think of how they got to this point and what made them the way they are.

Lastly, I would have at least a vague plan or idea of where you want the character to end up by the end of the story. If they grew, overcame an obstacle, viewpoint/values have changed, etc. This part can also help you in planning out your fic. Knowing where you want to end up I think is a great way to get the rest of the story planned, and make sure you don't go off in random directions and create plotholes.

Sometimes, I'll also write ficlettes or oneshots before getting to the main story. It gives me good practice for writing the character, and the stories don't have to be long.

NOW, if you're worried about writing a fic that is bad, you are not alone! I agonize over my stories and spend hours editing and rewriting before I post.

But a few pointers would be: make sure your grammar and spelling is double checked- this can be a huge turnoff for some readers. Don't be afraid of bad writing- the first draft is all about getting the story out. The polishing comes later when you edit. If you really want a second opinion on your writing, you can also get a beta. They will proofread for you, and some are willing to help you bounce ideas around if you get stuck. Lastly- have some kind of outline or plan. How detailed you want it is completely up to you, but I believe it is vital for longer fics.

If there's anything specific you want to know, I would recommend checking out [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] too! It is a great community of writers/readers, and a great place for advice on writing. Browse the topics, there are quite a few on OCs.

Write what you want to write- if your heart just isn't in it, it will show. For the record, I think it sounds like you have a really good premise!

** Make sure that there's a plot happening that doesn't revolve entirely around her presence. Not even Harry did the /entire/ thing himself, and there was a sense that people were talking about things and thinking about things that weren't immediately relevant to him.

Give her strengths and weaknesses, and demonstrate what they mean for her day to day life. She could be very smart, but if she works herself into a mess for tests and exams then her results may not show it...so what does that mean? If she sometimes speaks without thinking, what does this mean for how people view her?

Make it so that other people know or understand things she doesn't. Let her be wrong sometimes, let her misunderstand and make mistakes.

Give her interests. They don't have to be huge, just...little things that add colour. Something as simple as Dean's West Ham poster pinned up in the canon dormitory would do. Maybe she has a collection, or a favourite book, or some little thing.

** Write the story you want to read. You are your own target audience. People who don't like OCs aren't going to read your story no matter what you do so don't worry about it.

** Write your OC as an actual human being, like characters should be written. Don't make them perfect, unflawed human beings that appear in the story and make everything better through OC power,

** Go all in or all out. If you want to get involved in the main story, do so, don't just have you character make friends with Harry Potter but then have everything play out exactly the same as in canon.

If you don't want to get as involved in the main plot of the series, stay away from it, don't try to recreate the same thing just with "the next Dark Lord", Voldemort is an antagonist unlikely to reappear for a while, yes while Grindelwald was around Voledmort was already amassing power, but it took him twenty years to actually do something. There aren't just a myriad of extraordinarily powerful dark wizards who plan to take over the world, waiting for their turn. Your character shouldn't be the centre of everyone's attention either.

As for the daughter of the dark wizard trope, try to relate it to something that exists in real life, the daughter of a criminal for example, try to base people's assumptions on that. Not everyone will care. Some muggleborns will have no idea as to the importance of this. Basically, Hogwarts is a big school, it would be unrealistic for her character to be rejected by absolutely everyone. Of course it's possible people will have inbuilt prejudices and will think badly of her if she does anything wrong, this can work for interesting drama, but basically, don't make that her sole defining trait nor the only thing people will judge her on. Is she well spoken and outgoing? People will likely associate her less to her father in that case, while they will react the opposite if she is a withdrawn slytherin who has difficulties forming meaningful relationships etc.

** DON'T make your story canon except your OC is there. If the story is just the "Golden trio + 1" then there is very little point to reading it.

DON'T write your story just so you can pair your OC with a canon character. Pairings should be the product of a story, not the other way around. People can get away with this to a certain extent with non-OC protagonists, but very few people want to read a story which is solely about an OC romance.

DON'T make your OC good at everything. They should have strengths and weaknesses, and to a certain extent they should not outshine the strong characters of canon. An OC should never be stronger than Voldemort or Dumbledore, but it could certainly be plausible for an OC to eventually be better in the one thing they are best at, such as potions/enchantments/etc.

DO remember that other characters have their own motivations and ambitions. Things should be happening in the background in your story, and the world should not revolve around your OC. Your antagonists (and everyone else tbh) should be active rather than reactive.

DO make sure that your character has plausible motivations. An OC raised by purebloods is not going to instantly become best friends with Hermione on the train and give a long speech to Draco about why racism is stupid.

DO make sure that actions have consequences. Unless you are aiming for canon-compliance from a side point of view, then canon should be completely derailed early on in the plotline. There are very specific events that lead to Hermione and the troll/Harry in the forest/chamber of secrets/Voldemort's resurrection/etc and if you force these events to occur anyway then it looks bad.

DO explore the HP world with your OC! OCs give you a lot of freedom to write without being stuck into canon. Look into aspects of the wizarding world that we don't see in canon. We see very little of the average life of the daily wizarding family, as the Weasleys are not exactly typical. Considering how much fanfiction exists, unless you try something new and interesting you are not going to attract a lot of readers.

** The biggest thing for me that you need to be aware of is what are people expected to know? One of the biggest issues with Fix-it fics which often have ocs is that the OC has solutions to problems that don't exist yet. The methods they use only make sense with hindsight meaning either your character is a divination prodigy or has knowledge they shouldn't have from an in universe sense. An example would be if an OC discovered in their first year that Scabbers was far older than most rats live to be and instantly worried that Scabbers was an animagus. There have been something like 12 registered that century, that as an option would be far, far behind, thinking the Weasleys look after him well or even that he might be a special type of rat.

** Give your character a canon name. No matter how well you write, many people will read "OC" in the summary and think "Mary Sue", dropping the fic before they start reading out of reflex while they'll eagerly click on "Daphne Greengrass, daughter of a dark wizard..." (Or Tracey Davis, Fae Dunbar, etc.) Fortunately, HP provides you with a lot of "characters" that are nothing but names (like Greengrass), so you can pretty much adapt any character to a canon name..
