For one of the two stories I want to write, there isn't much of a conflict because Tom Riddle never became a Dark Lord. I have been thinking about what could serve as an alternative conflict to make it more than just a slice of life and exposition story. I am considering Herpo the Foul.

What is known:

Herpo the Foul created the first Basilisk, was a Parslemouth, and created the first Horcrux.

800 B.C. to 500 B.C. (Ancient or Archaic Greece.

Ekrizdis lived on (and possibly created) the island and fortress of Azkaban. Lured muggles to the island for horrifying experiments. Island was infested by Dementors. Implied that Dementors were known about before discovery of the island. Dementors were the least horrifying thing found on the island. 1401 AD to 1500 AD.

Dementors have very little effect on the Death Eaters and other dark witches and wizards. Voldemort calls them his natural allies.

Theory/AU Canon:

Herpo deliberately created an animal with venom that could destroy a horcrux, either as a backup incase he wanted to die, or to combat anyone else who might use his technique in the future.

The creation of a basilisk is related to the ability to speak to snakes. Creating a basilisk gives you and your descendants the ability to speak to snakes, or only a parslemouth can create one to begin with.

Herpo's horcrux kept him alive and he has changed appearance and identities throughout history to continue his experiments in to absolute immortality.

Herpo created Inferi. Intended to be perfectly obedient and capable of defending themselves, they would be a superior vessel for a soul shared than an independantly minded living creature.

Herpo created dementors modeled after poltergeists. Where a poltergeist appears in places where emotions and energy have soaked in to a building over time, and reflects the emotions contained there, Dementors are created similarly by despair and misery. Herpo created dark places (like Azkaban) to fuel their creation. The desire being to bind a piece of his soul to one of these creatures, then let it breed and multiply, preserving his soul as long as misery exists in the world.

Herpo took the identity of Ekrizdis at one time, continuing on with his dark experiments.

Herpo may have resurfaced as various dark wizards throughout history.

Herpo is still alive and still pursuing a more perfect form of immortality.

Suggestions?

**** It's worth noting that the Flamels aren't history's only alchemists, just the ones most famous in the wizarding world. Paracelsus, Newton, Fulcanelli, the Rosicrucians and the Invisible College. So you've got a secret cabal of more ethical immortals in a silent, invisble war against Herpo through the ages...

** I like this theory quite a bit, though I kinda prefer Dementors to occur just as naturally as Poltergeists, or perhaps even be an evolutionary offshoot of Wizardkind rather than fully unnatural spirits. (I also hold the headcanon that Herpo was not only the inventors of Horcruxes, but also the man who discovered that regret can unmake them, and therefore that he redeemed himself in the end and moved on. But that doesn't mean I couldn't lay aside that belief for the sake of a great AU such as that which you are proposing.)

Also, not to poke a big gaping hole in what I assure you is a theory I quite like, but... "bind one's soul to a Dementor" is kind of like granting custody of your pet canary to your pet cat. It doesn't sound very clever, is what I'm saying, to entrust your soul to the only beings in the universe known (or at least theorized) to have the ability to destroy souls. A better motive for your Herpo to create them might be that, like Basilisk Venom, they are a failsafe against a rival who'd try to use Horcruxes --- since a Dementor can presumably still suck out the soul of someone with a Horcrux, it just wouldn't make a very satisfying meal, so to speak.

Either way, the question remains of why, in the canon timeline, Herpo would have tolerated Lord Voldemort, and, indeed, even allowed some of his Dementors to swear allegiance to /him/.

I've seen a very well-thought-out variation on the second option, where Basilisks are the reason Parselmouths are so feared. Because /anyone/ can hatch a Basilisk, but unless the breeder can order the hatchling to close their eyes immediately and then tell it not to bite you, then they are /done for/. Hence Parselmouths are the only ones with access to the magical equivalent of a nuclear weapon --- not in the sense that they're the only ones who can make one, but in the sense that they're the only ones who'd survive the blast. All a Parselmouth needs to bring the Wizarding World to its knees is ambition, a toad and a chicken egg. /That's/ what everyone is scared of.

*** Draft 1 had dementors as a more physical being acting more like an FMA:B Homunculus mixed with an Inferius and a Horcrux. It would act as a sentient but obedient container for the soul shard, but also seek out and consume other souls to fuel it's own immortality.

After more reading about what is known and what other fanfics have done with dementors, I think a more poltergeist resistance is most appropriate as well.

** Well, you seem pretty keen on this Herpo the Foul idea, but just as a more general point, it should be remembered that you don't necessarily need a big bad uber powerful dark wizard for conflict. The first four books had plenty of conflict without a resurrected Voldemort. Aside from that, there are plenty of genres you can write that have different kinds of conflict: e.g. the boarding school genre, where the conflict focuses on a school rivalry, or the crime/murder mystery genre, where the conflict is based around solving the mystery rather than defeating someone powerful.

Who said "resurrected"? It doesn't matter if he's resurrected or not, Voldemort is still essential to the conflict of three out of those four, and his existence is still key to character's actions in the one dubious exception, /PoA/.

Your point that one can perfectly have a good story without a central Big Bad is of course well-taken, but I don't think any of the canon books ever did that.

*** I am still open to that path, mostly because I would need a solid reason why this conflict never appeared in the same timeline with Voldemort.

** Dumbledorian radicals want power to mugleborns.

As everyone knows, mugles and mugleborns are gold standard to progress and change. Wizarding britain is stagnant, conservative society that just do not apreciate all the fine things mugles have. Therefore wizarding culture must be destroyed and its traditions subverted.

As everyone knows, mugleborns are few percent of magical population. They flocked to grindelwald and now they flock to dumbledore, grindelwalds best friend. They are trying to destroy everything we hold dear, they despise us, our culture and our traditions. They can´t have what they want by democtratic means so they infiltrated our schools to brainwash our children who became fifth column in our institutions.

** What if Herpo bred the Basilisk in an attempt to try and figure out how to make his horcrux immune to it? Like some sort of spell-crafting in hopes of eventually perfecting his stake to immortality, since Basilisk venom isn't the only venom deadly enough to destroy a horcrux.

Maybe at one point he'd hear a rumor about how goblin-made weapons are impervious to it, and tries to steal this goblin secret to the detriment of the wizarding world's relationship with the goblin race?

*** I could get behind that. Would flesh out an ongoing shadow war between Flamel and other alchemists and Herpo's twisted method of immortality.
