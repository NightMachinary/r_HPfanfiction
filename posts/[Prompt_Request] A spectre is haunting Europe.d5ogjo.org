The ghost of Karl Marx, Frederich Engels, or a communist Voldemort, take your pick.

I have read Harry Potter is a Communist.

Edit: The title is a reference to the communist manifesto and this is meant as a humorous prompt.


** Can I go with the ghost of Trotsky? He comes back to revenge himself on Lenin and all his followers who perverted the Revolution - and also on the capitalists who still haven't been revolutionized at all.

*** Yes!

That'd work perfectly.

I just saw that line and thought, wow this needs some sort of ghost crossover.

** linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) features Voldemort as Wizard Lenin, if you haven't read that.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
