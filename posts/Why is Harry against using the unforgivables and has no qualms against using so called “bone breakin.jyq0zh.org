** Harry isn't against using the unforgivables. He tries and fails to cast the Cruciatus curse against Bellatrix in OoTP, against Snape in HBP, and then he succeeds in casting it against Carrow in DH. He uses the Imperius Curse in DH too. The only unforgivable curse he is implied to be against is the killing curse.

**** I know you meant in fanfiction because Harry doesn't use bone breaking curses or organ liquefying curses in the books. My point still stands. Harry isn't shown as being against all three of the unforgivables. In some fics, he's only against the killing curse, which isn't even the same as being against murder. Usually these sorts of curses allow the author to explain why Harry's enemies are incapacitated in a way crucio or a stunning spell wouldn't achieve. The writer wants the enemies to stay down, but they don't want to use Avada Kedavra. If you don't like it, leave a review on those stories.

***** I disagree with your last point. If you don't like it, don't leave a review on those stories. Move on and try to find fics that better suit your tastes. Authors generally don't enjoy having people complain about the direction they took their story in the reviews and "I don't like it" isn't exactly meaningful critique.

****** That's fair. "I don't like it" is an awful review. My phrasing was off. I meant to say, if the OP wants to know why an author wants to make Harry use bone breaking curses but not unforgivable curses, they'd have to ask the author (in a polite way, not something like "your idea is dumb"). We can speculate all we want, and people have provided some suggestions, but I'm not sure what the OP's post was supposed to be - an actual question, a rant, a critique on the concept.

******* I definitely agree with you there. No idea what OP is looking for. It sounds like they're complaining about something they saw in very specific fics, which none of us can answer obviously since we didn't write them and don't even know the context of these occurrences.

** I assume you are referring to fanfiction because in the series, Harry uses both the Imperius and the Cruciatus and there is no mention of a bone breaking or organ liquefying curse. The reason I could assume a writer would use such curses is to make a character they don't like suffer as much as possible (maybe even die) while maintaining a morally superior Harry who won't use the Unforgivables (even though at that point Avada Kedavra seems merciful).

** One explanation I saw in another fanfic was that using the Unforgivables builds up necroenergy in a person that causes them to go insane. The other curses do cause people to die or get badly injured but don't have the insanity side effect.

** Occasionally, fanfics like to expand the list of unforgivables, but in general I agree. Entrail-expelling curses, eye exploders, skull crushing... others like to rationalise with the “no dark magic exists you could wingardium someone into a shredder” theories, etc. I get the impression that nearly all of these can be reversed somehow, whereas unforgivables cannot, and that's why they are unforgivable. Although I wouldn't like to see a reversed entrail expelling curse

** To be entirely fair, in most of those stories where Harry uses bone-breakers and other gruesome spells, Harry isn't exactly portrayed as being a nice person - and the reason he uses those curses instead of the Unforgivables usually boils down to "Unforgivables are illegal, full stop. The curses Harry uses aren't /nice/ or /less dark/, they just haven't been made /illegal/ in that manner".
