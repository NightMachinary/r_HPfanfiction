** Best one ever is probably [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/What_Would_Slytherin_Harry_Do][What Would Slytherin Harry Do?]]

It involves an actually cunning Harry, rather than someone who just goes around smirking and thinking about how Dark he is.

Non-linear story telling, though.

*Summary:* As per the Hat's decision, Harry gets Sorted into Slytherin upon his arrival in Hogwarts - and suddenly, the future isn't what it used to be.

Harry isn't exactly friends with Draco, but it is one of my favorite fanfictions.

*** I just finished this after reading it for a week, and now I can't wait for more! I'm a bit nervous it though because it hasn't been updated since last August : ( Have you been following the author and their updates for awhile? I had to give up on "The Life and Times" by Jewels5 for now because her updates take so long.

**** I started reading it ages ago and the only update I've seen is the most recent chapter. But she says she's still writing it, so I take her at her word. The quality is such that I am willing to wait, though it is understandable if others are not.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/What_Would_Slytherin_Harry_Do][What Would Slytherin Harry Do?]] Probably not exactly what you're looking for, but it's an enjoyable fic that has Slytherin!Harry. Series of one-shots detailing, well, exactly what the title says.

Also going to second [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On_the_Way_to_Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]], which is easily the best serious Slytherin fic I've read.

** [[http://dragongirl16.livejournal.com/95485.html][Faith]] by dragongirl16 /(Harry gets transferred to Slytherin during the course of the story.)/

*Summary:* What if the wizarding world turned it's back on Harry? Who will stay true? Who can he turn to? What will he do?

*Warning:* It has a lot of graphic violence. Possibly also rape, or implied rape. It's been a while since I've read it.

*Pairings:* Harry/Draco. Neville/Blaise.

*

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3535620/1/][Insane Asylum Escapees]] by RuneWitchSakura /(Incomplete)/

*Summary:* This is a series of oneshots that involve Harry believing that everyone in the 'magical' world is insane. Starts with Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall getting Harry, instead of Hagrid, and goes in random order from there. Involves much sarcasm from Harry.

*

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/811088/1/][Not Myself]] by Saerry Snape

*Summary:* COMPLETE. AU fic. Harry Potter is left as an orphan on the streets of London. Yet when he finds himself in the home of a family of wizards, he finds that he's a wizard. And not just any wizard...

*Pairings:* Harry/OFC. Hermione/Draco. Ginny/OMC.

*

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving_Connor][The Sacrifices Arc]] by Lightning on the Wave /(Link is to part 1 of 7)/

*Summary:* AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

*Pairings:* Harry/Draco. Others unknown (I'm not very far into it yet; H/D is the only one mentioned thus far.)

*** Urgh, Sacrifices Arc.

It's a chore to read. An almost physical struggle. An uphill climb. A repetitive plot which doesn't advance in 3 million words. The issues that are being struggled with in year 1 are the same issues being struggled with in year 7. There is no character progression. At all. There are multiple character "breakthroughs" after which you think "finally, enough with that shit already". But then the author goes straight back to the previous plot point.

The author is a one-trick pony, and that trick is extreme angst.

The writing is literally dripping with overly emotional melodrama. The characters are all ridiculously one-dimensional and many of them are caricatures who behave in very unlikely ways.

The magic is crap and full of gimmicks. Further, it's contradictory. By virtue of birth Harry apparently should be able to wtfpwn most wizards via overwhelming them with his power. And yet we often see him in conflict with non-Lord-level wizards.

The magical creature plot is the same boring Harry "friend to all creatures" Potter. Newsflash: I don't care about goblins or centaurs or house elves.

Every story drags on far too long with so much filler it's unbelievable. The climaxes are always protracted - sometimes lasting the same length as a short novel - and so lack any sense of urgency, except the urgency the reader feels just to get to the end of this crap already.
