Fanon often says that Dumbledore could have forced a trial for Sirius in his capacity as Chief Warlock or that he could have overruled Fudge at the end of PoA, hell he is even portrayed as a judge when we know that power rests with head of DMLE or the Minister.

As far as I understand it Chief Warlock is like that guy that yells ORDER! ORDER! in parliament. He maintains order and mediates debates nothing else


** I had an AU prompt idea once that played off the fact that "warlock" originally meant "oath-breaker" where the original role of the Chief Warlock was to break magical bonds or oaths that were no longer desired or were impossible to fulfill. In particular, his intervention was needed for magical divorces and resolving life-debts.

Rowling wizards and witches being what they are, they kept giving the Chief Warlock additional responsibilities and eventually forgot what the job's original purpose was.

** Well the simple point with Sirus is that Dumbledore had no leadership position whatsoever in 1981. We've seen the Death Eater trials in the pensieve and Dumledore is just one of the "jury", not leading the proceedings, which is done by Barty Crouch Sr.

In POA Dumbledore also refers to having given evidence against Sirius, so it appears that some kind of summary proceedings were held in Sirius' absence, again likely under the control of Barty Crouch Sr.

I honestly doubt that Sirius being sent to Azkaban without a proper trial was illegal or even a secret. Summary justice appears to be relatively common and accepted in wizarding Britain.

You mean the Speaker. That position has quite a lot of power, even if all recent office-holders have chosen to exercise it in an even-handed manner. The Speaker chooses who gets to speak in debate, he can suspend members, and he can cut off debate and have a motion put to a vote.

*** Well yes but he can't overrule the PM on anything right?

**** Yes, he can, within his own area of responsibility - namely the functioning of the House of Commons.

He can't overrule the PM in other areas - he can't overrule the PM's policy decisions, or his decisions of who to appoint to the other ministries for example.

** He has exactly as much power as the plot requires. Rowling never told us details about how their government works.

*** This.

Hell, we don't even know how the basic Wizengamot works, other than the fact it's a merged judicial and legislative branch.

** Im pretty sure that if he had the power to keep snape ( a MARKED death eater) out of Azkaban, he could have had the power to get Sirius a trial (at the end of the first war) or at least visited him at prison to ask him questions ? Or enquire about how the whole thing happened ? Surely he knew Sirius had no trial, wasn't he at least curious about why, and how he told the secret? To whom ? Was it to Voldemort directly ? When ? I mean sorry but Dumbledore just assuming Sirius told it is so dumb. Yes he thought he was secret keeper, but honestly even if he was really a death eater he should have been questioned, asked to give names, etc.. So yes in my opinion Dumbledore was very much a hypocrite. Im sure he wouldn't have bothered with Snape if he didn't know he would need him later.

** When I say that Dumbledore should make release of Sirius possible, then he would even need much real political power. Considering that both /Magna Charta/ (with right of every Englishman to have “trial by jury of one's peers”) and /Bill of Rights/ (which include /Habeas Corpus Act/) should be grandfathered into the Magical Law from the English Common Law, it should be enough for him just to request the transcript of his trial. And yes, I cannot imagine that whatever really the Chief Warlock means, his powers should include at least the right to see transcripts of trials (if they are not public documents anyway).

When it wouldn't be found, Sirius should be automatically released (or if the worst political corruption happens, at least be given the trial). And I don't think there would be much opposition to it even from the darkest parts of Wizengamot, because the precedent of a member of a powerful family being thrown to Azkaban without a process, couldn't be something anybody would support.
