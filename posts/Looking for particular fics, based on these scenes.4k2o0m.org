I've read these fics a long time ago and, for the life of me, I cannot remember their titles. They're all HP/GW. I can give you a scene of each and that's it. Hopefully, someone knows what they are.

1. After the Final Battle. Harry and several others are helping the Ministry complete their Death Eater files. The losses suddenly hit Harry and he gets upset and runs out to speak to Dumbledore's portrait but Dumbledore isn't there. Harry, then, disappears elsewhere, to his own home - Potter Manor or something - and wants to kill himself. Dumbledore eventually talks him out of it.

2. After the Final Battle. Harry has difficulty sleeping, terrible nightmares, and spends the nights on the Burrow's couch. Arthur finds him and reassures Harry he'll watch over him. Harry admits to feeling weak and a coward because he doesn't want to sleep. Arthur tells Harry stories of the Weasley kids when they were young until Harry falls asleep. Arthur later comments to Molly how shocked he is that Harry could feel that way about himself.

Those are the two I'm currently searching for. If you know them, please let me know. I've been trying to find them for a while now.
