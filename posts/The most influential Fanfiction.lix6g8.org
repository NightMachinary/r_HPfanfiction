What is in your opnion the Fanfic that had the greatest impact on the Fandom? A Fic that popularized or introduced a trope or ship that became a common theme in many later Fics?


** I would argue that, although it isn't the first of its kind, /Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past/ is easily the most influential Peggy Sue fanfic.

This is the one that really took off with a time traveler going back after the War had ended to save everyone.

Neville's gaining confidence, Hermione's extreme intelligence, Malfoy being powerful--that's all in here.

It might not have introduced Manipulative!Harry, but it definitely contributed to it--though I must say that I don't really mind it in NOFP because, among other reasons, NOFP's Harry genuinely cares for his friends and there's plenty of scenes where he just spends time with them as friends.

** Those who were around before this probably can pull up some other examples, but I think Phoenix and the Serpent was one of the first huge fantasy AUs in the fandom. It's incredible that it still holds up these days despite being published in 2002.

I think Boy Who Lived played a big part in making the WBWL genre as popular as it is now. And Prince of Slytherin has just exploded the combination WBWL - Slytherin Harry genre, as well as the Sandersonization of Harry Potter magic that's really popular these days.

**** Brandon Sanderson is an author who has made some really amazing hard magic systems. I'd definitely read recommending his Cosmere works if you like fantasy.

He also wrote three “laws of magic” that are basically meant as guidelines on how to devise and use a magic system. I think this is mainly what the idea of “Sandersonization” refers to - basically stories that fit closer to these guidelines/Sanderson's general style of magic.

** Rosswrock's Power of Time. It basically created the indy!Harry genre as we know it. A lot of people for some reason treat Harry Crow as the origin of the genre, but the party had already been going for 7+ years before Robst showed up. In fact, in many ways I'd mark Harry Crow as the point where indy!Harry writers started to run out of ideas and instead just started producing Harry Crow clones ad infinitum.

Sheer popularity of Harry Crow and most people entering Fanfic tend to be Harmony shippers at the beginning leads them here.

And then the number of tropey things stuffed into Harry Crow owing to its size kind of makes people to think so. It incorporated a lot of things into the story.

**** Regarding Power of time, Harry was a bit too overpowered for my taste, also, it had some character bashing I didn't like. What made the story awesome in my eyes was the worldbuilding. There's so many details and so many wonderful ideas, I really envy the authors imagination as I can never have too many details and stuff that enriches imaginative worlds. It takes some time before the story develops but then its very exciting. I also loved the Hinny stuff because it was fluffy and cute and wholesome. Also, Harry develops a friendship with Neville which I liked very much.

**** Intdy!Harry - Basically a Harry who is generally not just up against Voldemort, but up against a manipulative Dumbledore who will do whatever it takes to make his "Greater Good" a reality, which generally includes making Harry's life miserable as possible so he'll be willing to sacrifice himself to defeat Voldemort. Most of these end up with Harry being unreasonably competent, and Dumbledore acting like a petulant child every time Harry disagrees with him.

Harry Crow is a particularly popular fanfic where Harry is adopted by goblins and becomes something of a Mary Sue. I like the fic, but even I have to admit it's a cliche storm.

** I think a lot of the tropes we see were particularlypopularized (not so much actually introduced) in the explosion of fics around 2002-2004, when fans were still waiting for OoTP to come out. This is one of my favorite eras, as authors weren't as constrained by the limitations introduced by books 5-7. Most of the fics I remember (vaguely) from that time were on livejournal/insanejournal.

But this is also when ffn really took off with HP fics, so you get fics like /Betrayed/ and /Redemption/ (both 2003, I think), which introduced the "betrayed Harry sent to Azkaban" trope, or /Realizations/, which I think popularized a number of different plot points. Meanwhile, this seemed the golden age of shipwars, so we get lots of early fics that helped set standards for a given pairing (e.g. Cassandra Claire's stuff and the /Faith/ series for different versions of Draco/Harry.) /Psychic Serpent/ came out around this time, and I remember people being crazy for it, but I didn't like the first few chapters and never went back. I suspect it had considerable influence though.

*** Yes exactly! This was one of my favorite eras too. There were so many different archives, and so much excitement and diversity in the fandom - writers could use their own imaginations to take the future in any direction they wanted. There was no epilogue, Sirius and Snape were alive, no one had heard of a horcrux or a hallow... It's funny to remember that there was a time when people argued over whether Blaise was male or female!

Another author worth mentioning is Maya, who wrote in the same era as Cassandra Claire. She had a huge, lasting influence on Draco's fanfic characterization - he was only a minor character in the books then - and it's not too much of an exaggeration to say she originated the Slytherin apologist trope. (None of her stories are online anymore but you can still find them around, and they are still great.)

*** as someone who got into HPFF in 2017 (and has read a bit about what the fandom used to be like), the HP fanfic world has changed so much that a lot of those influential fics from the 1990s and early 2000s are now obsolete. Probably only a small fraction of writers/readers these days were around those days and are unlikely to have read many of the really old famous stuff, since those sites are dead.

I'm not saying that most tropes can be traced back to that stuff, it's just that that's not the stuff that's actually influencing writers these days. As many old tropes as The Prince of Slytherin conglomerates together, I'd argue it's still more influential on the current generation of fic writers than the Draco Trilogy.

**** Whether today's writers know it or not, they are influenced by those older works, though it's very unlikely they've read most of them. Those works originated, expanded upon, and popularized the tropes and cliches (“fanon”) that are still around now. Obviously there have been changes and developments (e.g. the publication of the later books in the series!), and many other great and influential fanfics have been written since then (themselves influenced by the stories that came before them). Still, though, the echoes of Maya's and Cassandra Claire's characterizations of Draco, for example, still can be seen in many of today's stories, just as all Severitus stories stem from the challenge issued by the original Severitus (an author) in 2002. Just because someone writing a Severitus story today doesn't know where the term came from doesn't mean the influence of that original isn't legitimate! Even the effort to avoid cliches and tropes is a recognition of their existence and influence.

ETA: If you, like I, had been reading HP fanfic since 2002 (other fandoms as well, but I've never stopped reading HP), the direct evolution from the earliest stories would be apparent. Of course, I don't read everything - I have preferred pairings, types of stories, etc. Today's fanfiction is quite different from 2002's in many ways, but nonetheless, the fact that, for example, Maya's Draco seems so cliched - when she was pretty much the first to write him that way - is evidence of the continuing influence of her writing.

** just to sidetrack , the impact of a good author who would build a world and leave good infrastructure for future authors to build on is immeasurable - I don't remember who is the first real author to embrace the Ancient and Noble House trope but without that all the political intrigue and dramas would have never gotten off the ground - the part about how there was a political nobility with real power rather than just every one being a wizard of equal rank , just disparate wealth - Remember when the character of Sirius Black and the Ancient and Noble House of Black was not well developed, he married Arabella Figgs of all person in Betrayed - versus all the intrigue about who his bride or even groom is in the context of him being the heir , disowned by Walburga/kept on by Arcturus/new White Sheep of a political dynasty - say what you will about Radaslab and his depiction of excessive sex , without this world building of the definition of Ancient and Noble house politics the events of Not Normal and especially Harem War would be impossible

(Just a sidetrack, before Timothy Zahn's iconic work in creating Thrawn and Coruscant , what we had were episodic character based comic book in prose form trash like the Adventures of Luke Skywalker, Lando Calrissian, Han Solo that was not only not G for word of George (Lucas) Canon, struggled even to be be C for Continuity Expanded Universe canon - if you want to read bad Star Wars fanfic those would be good starters - end sidetrack)

I read the early pre-DH fanfics for a lark but generally ignore off any fanfic , especially incomplete ones, that was written pre 19 July 2007 (i remember because I actually bought that one book that single day and read it)

** This may be a controversial opinion, but the monstrous abomination that is *My Immortal* can definitely be considered an influential fanfiction, if only because it tells you what not to do.

Now, before you raise your pitchforks and ready your hate comments, think about it. We now know what a Mary Sue can do wrong and what consequences it might have, namely hate comments, massive infamy etc etc. I'm not saying its good - in fact, its horrible and I hate it from the depths of my genderfluid little heart - but it definitely taught authors what not to do when writing.
