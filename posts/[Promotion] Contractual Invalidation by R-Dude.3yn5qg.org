** As a person who read several bad marriage contract fics before, I found this one a very refreshing read. It's a subversion of the trope, done with excellent characterization and great overall writing. It borrows some recognizable aspects of the marriage contract trope, but twists them in a completely different way.

The twist? Instead of being angsty and mopey when he finds out about the contract, Harry is rather... opportunistic about it. Of course, he is rather annoyed about it at first, but he later decides to use it to his own advantage.

In a sense, Harry's a bit of an ass/jerk in this story, but that's one of the reasons I like it so much. Also, he's much more ambitious than in the canon, willing to actively take steps to figure out his problem/opportunity(?).

I also really like the characterization of Ron, who is a side character in the story. Sadly, it's very rare to see a good characterization of Ron in fanfiction, especially in the marriage contract trope. One of the tragedies of fanfiction is that they robbed Ron of his humor. In this story, he's funny and easygoing (as he should be), but also sharp and calmer. It seems that all the characters aged well from their school years (have I mentioned that this is a post-Hogwarts story?)

The story is also quite humorous, although some of you might not appreciate it as much as I did.

Overall: It's a great subversion of the clich√©. Very well written and enjoyable, the story has the potential to be one of the best rom-coms the fandom has.

*** Having just finished it, I agree.

I also liked the story 'Uncle Harry' by the same author.

**** I enjoyed that story as well. Also, his Frozen/HTTYD is also very well written, so you may want to read that too. I haven't read most of his other stuff though, mainly because I don't know anything about DC.

** It feels too incomplete for my tastes. I like it, but only as a beginning in a larger story.

*** Yeah, it's still only chapter 1, so there always is a possibility that the story might turn downhill. But, having read the author's other works, I don't think that'll be the case.

**** Thanks for the rec, I enjoyed it a lot. Enjoyable writing style and a good crack at subverting the trope. I appreciate a lot when a writer doesn't try to explain everything to the reader. We're not told wjat exactly happened woth Ginny and that is fine. Length wise, I think it is fine as is. I like the mystery of the ending. EDIT also, I loved the good-guy-Ron
