** While she's sans cause in this fic, she's definitely quite, quite psychotic. There's a fic inspired by it with the codependence turned way up too, but I can't remember the name of that one currently.

I think I've got a few more as well, but I don't remember their titles and it's four minutes past midnight here in Blighty and I'm exhausted. I'll hopefully remember to keep looking in the morning.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** Somewhat similar to what you want: linkao3(brilliant but scary).\\
Fair warning though, I recently found out from an AN that they made her non-muggleborn which kinda put me off the fic.

  Hermione Granger is special. She's always known it, really, even before she received her letter that informed her she was a witch, and even before she could do the little tricks that kept away the bullies and left her time for her books. It was too bad, of course, that she had never met anyone quite as special as her, but she was hoping that would change now that she was going to a right and proper school for witches and wizards.And she wasn't wrong, because the moment she laid eyes on Harry Potter she just knew he was very special indeed.

  They say you always have a choice and I had chosen. I would fight! I was ready to face life with all its ups and downs. I would follow the path of a warrior, not popular but necessary, as I had been part of the war for years. Every year without fail Harry, Ron and I would fight for our lives. Was I, Hermione Granger, a good person and would I still be good after everything was done and finished? This is my story beginning at the end of the holidays after Year Four (GoF), and in the end you'll have to decide if my actions and my decisions were the right ones! HG with SB, DM, SS and LM; HP will play a bigger role as the story progresses!
