I really like the character of Neville from both books and films. Unfortunately I've not found many fics where he features as either the protagonist or at least a very prominent supporting character. Can you all recommend me some fics where Neville is featured heavily?

I have no issue with slash or the majority of pairings but I'd rather not read fics where romance of any description is the main focus.

Hogwarts fics are good, I don't really read many post-war fics. Time Travel shenanigans are fine by me.

I'm looking for fics where Neville is or develops into a strong character, at a slightly more accelerated and in-depth way than his canon character arc.

Example of one I enjoyed (incomplete) is linkffn(Becoming Neville by Jedi Rita)

** There's always "The Lions of Gryffindor," which is about Dumbledore's Army during the war and is a lot better, and more in-character, than "Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness." linkffn(7421306)

I really liked "Not Quite a Maia," a LOTR crossover where the unlikely duo of Neville and Molly Weasley end up in Middle-Earth to try and take Gandalf's place in the Fellowship. It's been taken down from FFN, but I found it on Fictionhunt: [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4838629/1]]

  Neville's seventh year at Hogwarts presents many challenges, but he is his parents' son. This was originally written for the springtime gen exchange on livejournal. Thank you to kennahijja for beta-reading.
