** While this is an interesting prompt, how and why would researchers be researching slowly? As in they just give up their own lives to commit to research? Or just start doing experiments except they're done at 2x speed? Are all their years researching just condensed into a neat 5 minute montage by some magic that Tom does?

I dont need to immortality, I need answers.

*** Maybe the researchers are limited by lack of funding. Imperius some people and they no longer care about funding.

Confund researchers who are researching something else such as dinosaur bones into contributing to gene research. Not enough money to hire them? Imperio!

Sciences colleges suck? Imperio some good researchers to do the teaching, then imperio the graduates. Maybe even use a Pensieve or something to copy and insert memories of years of training into imperio'd researchers.

Or he could steal the Philosopher's Stone and make gold to fund it all.
