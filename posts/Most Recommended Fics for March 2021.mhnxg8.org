  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.\\

#+begin_quote
  “Harry Potter,” comes the soft, sibilant hiss of a voice he has heard in his dreams, in his nightmares, in his waking hours for years.  Slowly, carefully, Harry twists over and pushes up onto his hands and knees.  He stays there, short breath fogging in front of his face, and his pursuer lets him.  Harry has no doubt of that; he's being allowed this respite. This small moment to catch his bearings, heart pounding in his ears, blood singing. “It seems I have finally caught you.”\\

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.\\

I think we've discovered a flaw with your methodology, because I am pretty certain that most of the "recommendations" for this fic came from the author making a self-promotion post every time she posted a new chapter, which was happening several times per week for a while.

*** These are technically the fics that have been most linked by [[/u/FanfictionBot][u/FanfictionBot]] , so if she used to link it using the bot then it's natural.

**** Right. I'm not saying that your data is wrong, just that the method you chose to collect the data is easily skewed, even if it's not being intentionally abused.

That being said, I do think that your method is the best one available, and there's probably not a good way to filter down to only the "real" recommendations. Maybe ignoring the link if the call to the bot came from a post tagged as Self-Promotion. Though it's been a while since I last looked at Reddit's API, so I'm not sure how feasible that is. And even then, if an author links to their fic in the "What are you writing" threads each week (which is a completely reasonable thing to do), that would still skew the results. Though without actual numbers, it's hard to say how much that skew would actually matter.
