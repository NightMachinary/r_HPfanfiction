I realize there's probably no chance for me to find this, but I'm requesting help anyways. I'm looking for a fanfiction where Vernon sneaks into the wizarding world, and proceeds to single-handedly destroy the Horcruxes and take out Voldemort. Something about it just seems awfully amusing.


** That sounds HILARIOUS.

** Damn, if magic worked like in Pratchett stories, all it would take to wipe out Voldemort is one single Vernon Dursley who does not believe in magic to nullify Voldemort power when near him... and kill him with a punch!

Like hydro-mages in one of Pratchett stories who can float above water because of how strong their aquaphobia is.
