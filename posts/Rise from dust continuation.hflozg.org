Rise from Dust was one of the earliest fanfictions that I read and I got instantly hooked on. I have no idea why the writer abandoned. This is kind of a request from anyone willing to pick up where it was left of in PoA bit and try to do justice to the idea.


** I really liked that fic too but I always assumed the writer wrote him/her self into a corner with the fact that each of Harry's best friends was in love with him.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.
