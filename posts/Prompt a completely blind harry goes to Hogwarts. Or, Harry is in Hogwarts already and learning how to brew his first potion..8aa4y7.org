You can pick eeither one. Harry going to hogwarts completely blind or Harry already is in hogwarts, he's blind and having his first potions lesson.

REQUIREMENTS:

Snape must be nice. Ron/Hermione can either be nice or nasty to Harry,that's up to you. There must be equipment or ways/spells that help harry along. The story must be as realistic as you can make it. No Harry using magic to see or anything like that. He must be blind and using magic to aid him not make him have super powers. The story can be as long or as short as you like.

Bonus points:

Harry either learns a little bit about Braille and how to read it, (with the author using actual braille code to show that he/she did the research.) or learns about screen readers and what they can do.

I'm aware computers/laptops don't work in Hogwarts but in this story they do.

Unless you don't want them to and can find a way around it. That might be interesting to think about.

Someone has to be nasty to Harry and his friends have to stand up to them or Harry can do it himself.

Sorry if this isn't written using the correct formatting, I tried to follow an example I read but could have got it wrong. I've read some blind harry stories and while they're good, they're either incomplete or not realistic, as in Harry sees in the first couple of chapters and then the story continues as if nothing is wrong.

There's one good story that depicts blindness correctly, where Lupin is giving harry cain lessons.

Oh and if you're interested, I'm blind. I can see lights and shadows.


** I get that, as a blind person, this is more of a personal request for you than something that makes sense in-universe. But I feel like I should point out that if Harry became blind he would simply be healed by magic? Or in the worst case be given some fake eye like Moody has.

Also, the impact of computers working at Hogwarts would case a chain reaction of consequences that is far too big to be ignored or shoved aside as an afterthought.

*** Easy solution: Harry got blinded by the Killing Curse. Dark magic wounds don't heal (see: Moody), and if the damage is deep enough I can see how an eye like Moody's won't work, because the damage of the curse would be "blindness" and not "lost an eye".

** hey. what's up, blind girl here. unsighters unite? xD i tried reading that "blindness" harry potter fic that gets recommended here and it actually offended me with the whole "harry's blind but wait he actually has magic eyesight so he's cool" shit. if you want to write a blind protag, do research and respect the disability itself, don't cop out on the concept and throw it away as soon as you can cause it's too hard or whatever the reason was. which i get, you know. it's hard for /italics/me/italics/ to describe how i experience the world myself, and i'd probably not do too good a job if i tried writing a fic with someone like me as the protag. still, respect? stick with it? please? awesome.

*** I agree it is sort of a cop-out in terms of plot and premise of the fic, but it's an interesting question where to draw the line of "use magic to aid you". Wouldn't the best kind of aid be something that replaces the functionality of sight in as many aspects as possible? I think Magic would be pretty lame if it were limited to the same kind of things Muggle society has (Braille, an equivalent to a cane, etc). The concept of using magic as a kind of sonar to 'see' in some fashion strikes me as pretty imaginative.

Maybe this is a similar issue as in the deaf community where some people apparently oppose cochlear implants? "How lame, now the kid has something equivalent to conventional hearing, he should be properly disabled, because being deaf is so awesome!"

*** Unsighted people unite! I'm not exactly sure why we're uniting,, I'm not even sure if that's a word but hell, let's do it!

Yeah I agree that righting a blind character will be very hard for someone who can see or even for someone who is blind. It's hard to get into the persons head but that's what makes it rewarding isn't it?

I don't get offended by these stories, some of them amuse me and others make me think, yeah! That's such an awesome idea! Then the story ends up not being finished.

I don't think harry should just be able to use magic to see. I'm a Brit but I'd think perhaps Harry would have to go to the US to learn as the Magical world in the UK seams quite behind the times.

Although I did read one story where Harry was blind and went to a RNIB like place in London and he had a floating device that guided him. I dunno if i'd use that personally, what if it's to slow?

The RNIB is the Royal National instetute for blind people. It's a charity and a shop all in one.

*** Honestly? It was all written without much thought. i've read a lot of fan fiction and since this is the fan fiction subreddit for Harry Potter, I thought I'd give people something diffirent to read and write. Okay, if Snape needs to be as he is in cannon, how will Harry learn potions? Or is there a school for blind wizards out there? If so, what is it all about? Who made it, what makes it different? As for why bring laptops or computers into this, have you ever tryed writing with a Perkins Brailller? Those things are heavy, loud and take a lot of practise to use, plus you can only do one thing with them compared to a laptop. It doesn't have to be a fic at all, just a small idea. I just thought it might be interesting.

***** I see where you're coming from. Yeah a braille spell would make sense but you logicly cannot fit braille onto everything. For example, let's say I have a box and this box is small. ON the box is written Brads box of tricks. Open with the circle facing the top. Inside this box... and the instructions go on to tel you what is in the box. There's no way that could all fit on a box in braille, in print yes but braille cannot be made smaller. So use an enlargement spell, right? Nope, What happens if you enlarge the box and the box gets ripped or something. Hey, I just thought about something; If you enlarge a box, or paper or something like that would it not wrip anyway as the attams and things like that that make it up would be streched too? As for potions not being interesting, that's because most people skip over it. What about the smell of ingredients, the texture,, the slimyness/not slimyness of some. Remember, this isn't cannon, anything goes in fan fiction land and I mean anything... The fics i've read... Let's just say there was one involving Harry and the sorting hat...

Or would he learn it in school as he could function properly? Another thing I'm considering is that Harry's Hogwarts teacher could use a spell to translate the braille for themselves and maybe translate what they write to braille. Though that would seem a bit op so maybe harry could use one of those quills that writes what he says since they're cannon as Rita Skeeter uses a variation of them.
