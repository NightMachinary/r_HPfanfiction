** Technically, it means he is the receptive partner in anal sex.

In far too many fanfics, it means he is weak, juvenile and ‚Äúneeds‚Äú a stronger partner to take care of him. Far too often this means men old enough to be his father such as Snape, the older Malfoy or Riddle.

The idea that it might simply be a preference is rarely stated.

***** I mean, in real life or in a plot-focused dramatic fic, you'd be right, but let's be honest with ourselves here -- if a fic is tagging who's a top and who's a bottom, odds are it's written for the smut above all else.

** If you have to ask, you're too young to know. Lol

Basically it means he's getting penetrated instead of doing the penatrating when talking about sex.

However, it's also used to denote who the more submissive partner in the relationship is.

**** Yes, except for in the genre of romance fic where the /characters/ are two boys or two men, except that the one designated as the bottom or "uke" (for the anime/manga version) is supposed to be a stand in for the female reader, who is imagining herself as a man.
