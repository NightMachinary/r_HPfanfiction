** I think I need to reread the story. I honestly have no idea who is who at this point.

**** I'll be honest, I completely forgot about this story till I got the email notification today. And what a pleasant surprise it is. Though I agree with you on the point that I too need to start from the very beginning of the story to make sense again.

** I like this new chapter a lot.

It's nice to see Voldemort back in action and Harry make his moves.

** Can someone give me a brief overview of what this story is? Is it worth starting?

*** It depends on what kind of story you prefer. Emperor is pretty far removed from standard Harry Potter fanfiction, with a cast that is either mostly OC, or rather different from their canon counterparts, due to the premise.

A good part of the story revolves around warfare, while politics and intrigue play an increasingly large part as the time goes on. If you've read/watched GoT and liked that, I think you'd like this story as well.

** I swear to God, I just checked it recently thinking that since January was close, it was time for Marquis' annual update.
