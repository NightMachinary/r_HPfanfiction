  The Battle is over. The War is done. Hermione lives, but she is far from safe in a world where Voldemort rules. She was supposed to die, go out fighting like Harry. Or face execution for her defiance, like Ron. Instead she was given to one of the Dark Lord's followers, a reward for his loyalty and an eternal punishment for her existence. She has met Antonin Dolohov before. He remembers her, has thought about her since their duel in the Department of Mysteries. She will soon see how deep his obsession runs.

*** This is very popular. I keep seeing fanart for it, but I've never really cared for romance fics. Should I start this one?

**** I've only listened to a couple of chapters and I needed to take a break because it's really tough. So far it seems pretty convincing. I'd say you should.

Now that I've satisfied the condition for commenting on this post. Isn't it incredibly stupid on part of voldemort to allow death eaters to have magical people as personal slaves, muggleborn or otherwise. That's exposing fence sitting death eaters (in context of fics like this) to people with ideas that are dangerous to Voldemort's regime. It will be better to either detain them or blackmail them from afar or even let them flee, so death eater can rule in peace or some semblance of it.
