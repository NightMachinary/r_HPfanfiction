* Introducing... Author AMAs!
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: introducing...-author-amas
  :END:
I am /so/ pleased to be bringing this new series to the subreddit. Approximately once a month (as scheduled allow), the mod team will host some authors for an AMA. These authors will come from all corners of the fandom - canon writers, AU writers, novelists, one-shot champions, and everywhere in between. We are looking to host *all corners* of Harry Potter fanfiction, because it is all of that make up the fandom.

With that, let me introduce a few ground rules.

1. Remember the human. These guys are people too! If you don't like their stories or disagree with their ships, this is *NOT* the place for it. Fanfic writers do this for free, after all, so be respectful, kind, and courteous with their time.
2. Authors can refuse to answer any questions. If your question is skipped, just leave it alone and move on.
3. Do not spam the thread. We want everyone's questions to have a chance to be seen.
4. Follow all subreddit & reddit rules. Don't break policy, please!

* Our first AMA will be May 30 & 31!

*** AMA stands for "Ask Me Anything" , in the style of [[/r/IAmA]] . So we have authors who have agreed to come to the subreddit for a Q&A type session, basically. You can ask a question in the comments and they will be able to go through and answer everyone's questions.
