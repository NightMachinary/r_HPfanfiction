Possessed Ginny got the Diary back by breaking into Harry's Trunk. I want to see Harry give the Diary to Dumbledore. "Professor this thing is scary, it's sentient" and Dumbledore deals with it as a non evil Dumbledore would, finding out about the Horcrux, and destroying it, and announcing that a Dark Artifact was the one causing the attacks.

A "Butterfly Effect" style one change means everything changes, ideally.


** Correct me if I'm wrong, but Dumbledore only finds out about horcruxes after harry destroys the diary in book 2.

I wonder if Dumbledore would cast fiendfyre on the gryffindor sword or some other very powerful dark spell because he wouldn't have access to basilisk venom. The only reason the sword could destroy horcruxes was because it had touched basilisk venom.

I mean for sure one could toy with the idea and a ton of things could change like arthur doesnt win the ministry lottery and so Sirius never escapes.

However, unless someone dies in the chamber of secrets after harry hands the book over, I realistically dont see the books playing out much differently. Except maybe Lockhart not losing his memory.

But Dumbledore still doesnt have slughorns memory and so doesnt know how many horcruxes there are.

*** Dumbledore having a still active and not killing him Horcrux, he might get more out of it, pushing him to basically nomoral Imperio Slughorn into giving up the real memory, and go Horcrux hunting (as Harry is young/useless at that point) Voldemort might not have put the withering curse on the ring horcrux til he was revived. Plenty of changes you could make by giving Dumbledore the diary whilst it's still a Horcrux

**** I like to think that the whole of cannon was planned by Dumbledore to happen the way it did, because he wanted Harry to love a lot of people, and then die for them, there-in passing on his mothers blood protection to all the people he died to protect. Having a dozen or so friends from the DA immune to Voldies magic would make ending the war a matter of course, after all.

But then, he didn't plan to find the Resurrection Stone in one of Voldie's Crux, and it brought back the years he spent with Grindlewald searching for the DH. He knew he got the Wand from Grindie in the end, and he knew ‘about' the Potter Cloak as well. The moment he saw the Stone, he put the last piece of the puzzle together, and he put on the ring before he thought about it. The Withering Curse doomed him to death, so he added becoming the MoD to the plan for harry.

Edit: Sorry ‘bout that. People kept interrupting me and making me stop typing part way through.

*** Do you think the sword could absorb fiendfyre? I think fiendfyre would destroy it, myself, I know it's goblin-made but surely it's not completely invincible.

**** Apparently fiendfyre is on the same level as basilisk venom, but semi-sentient.

*** The difference would be no basilisk venom available and probably no free Dobby.

** My own fic has Ginny end up petrified by the basilisk (Voldemort's control was broken), and Dumbledore finds the Diary in her hands, interrogates it, and disposes of it with Greek Fire.

He also uses the Diary to send Lucius to Azkaban.

  There was no way Lily Potter would let her son anywhere near her sister, so she told Dumbledore about her cousin in America. After Halloween 1981, the Fentons gain another son. Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or Danny Phantom and related media.
