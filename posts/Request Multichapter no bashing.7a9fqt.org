I'm sick to death of Dumbledore and Weasley bashing. I'm looking for any fics where they aren't bashed. I'm also looking for stories where Hermione isn't perfect. Now I don't want her bashed of course, I just don't want her written as perfect.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione unless it's AU or written believably. Any other pairing is fine. Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

No overpowered or extremely smart Harry. A little more powerful or smart then he was in the series is fine, but don't make it crazy please.

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Would rather not have rehash unless it's something different from canon in some way.

Any rating is fine.


** linkffn(The Accidental Animagus), maybe? Off the top of my head.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

Hm, I disliked AA because of the whole rehashing thing. Harry / Hermione and Dumbledore are all completely different, yet the story seems to really force canon events.

**** True. I like it anyway, though. As I said, it was just off the top of my head.

  OotP AU. Dark magic, Death Eaters, politics - and in the middle of it all, Harry Potter. Tested against enemies old and new, he learns that power requires sacrifices, revenge, doubly so. No slash, no bashing, Crouch Sr is alive. Book One of Dark Triad Trilogy.
