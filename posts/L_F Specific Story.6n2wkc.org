Sooooo I'm at work, and I remember a story where Harry has to lead the first years across the lake, and I think he does a lot of mentoring for the younger students as well. I'm blanking on the name of the story...but I remember McGonagall tearing into Ron and Hermione for shirking their duties in order to follow "Malfoy". 6th year story btw. Any help ...er, helps.


** Aha! Found it! Rise of the Wizards if you must know. Forgot how to link.
