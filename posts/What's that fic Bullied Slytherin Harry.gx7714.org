I'm pretty sure it was on ao3, but I read it a few years a go. Harry was sorted in Slytherin and everyone, including the Slytherins bully him. His only friend is Hagrid. If I remember correctly, he gets into detention with Hagrid and becomes friends with the unicorns. He regularly visits the unicorns, who all love him. There's all these different colored unicorns and at one point, some of the unicorns give him the tip of their horn. Last I read it, it went up to fifth year, where Umbridge did her bitch shit by trying to frame Harry for stealing unicorn horns.

Sorry if it's not a helpful description! I'm new and desperate!
