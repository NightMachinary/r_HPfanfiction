A really weird way to write the title, I know, but I couldn't think of a better one. Essentially, I'd like to see fics where Harry and/or Hermione are around Muggles who know or knew them pre-Hogwarts. So, Harry could run into kids from Primary School, Hermione could be at a Family Reunion (or also Primary School), etc.

I tried to google for Harmony fics at a Granger Family reunion, but most of what I got were Apologist!Draco-Hermione fics where the two just condescended their way through how magnificent and pretty Draco was. I don't mind the pairing if it's done right, but those fics were just... not.

Any pairing, slash or not, any trope, etc. I'd just like Harry or Hermione to be involved and for it to be a good fic. Picnic Panic by LeQuin is a good example of the sort of thing I'm looking for. Or the Summer Nights challenge by MarauderbyMoonlight.

** I really like linkao3(12951165) for its a nice happy/melancholy combination.

From the above suggestions I really like the first one, but the second one seems to be a rather stupid Ron-bashing.

*** I hate bashing as well but the amount of teeth rotting fluff after the bashing part is what made me a fan of this fic, so much so that I read it every couple months or so. If you can I will recommend you push through, you won't regret it unless you hate sweets

He's drunk in that scene. A lot of people are /very/ different when they're drunk. And Ron has also been known for speaking without a filter, especially when under a /foreign/ influence.
