Need a new fic to read. I love heavy romance stuff. No slash but harem is ok. Heavy fluffy romance is particularly appreciated. Any pairings are good. Prefer harry centric as it does t feel like a Harry Potter fic if it doesnt focus on his pov at least mostly.

Still in progress, semi regular updates

Sirius raises Harry, a lot of adorable childhood scenes, great Sirius pairing with OC. Good childhood romances for Harry.

Still in progress, regular updates.

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54][The Meaning of One]] is... Well, in a way they're not old enough for it to be romantic, but having someone share your every thought and sensation can't help but be an intimate experience. Having each other as a support network helps them in many ways, but makes them vulnerable in others. They're never alone, they always have each other's back, but they can't be flying at the same time, or their shared vision makes them dizzy. They have to co-ordinate their eating or face really weird mixed flavours. And that's nothing compared to the mixed /feelings/ of the other Weasleys about having Harry in Ginny's head...
