Because it just occurred to me that it's silly to dance around the subject of the diary and Slytherin's basilisk using exact words.

"Dobby would like to tell you that there is no threat at Hogwarts this year whatsoever. There is no plot to slaughter muggleborns, there is no plot to revive He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and my master, who is not a Malfoy, isn't involved in any wrongdoing in the slightest. If hypothetically you encounter a cursed diary that bewitches whomever writes in it, Dobby has nothing to do with it and nor do the Malfoys. And the legend of the Chamber of Secrets is just a legend. I can say all this freely, because my master hasn't forbidden me to say anything. Because said master isn't doing anything wrong."

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

***** I dunno, I see zero reason why they couldn't be, if done in time, and it wasn't lost due to a curse. Moody's undoubtedly was, and the knife Pettigrew used was likely enchanted in some way, since Harry scarred.

I realize it's purely speculation though.

Eh, even if not, if Pettigrew went into the ritual expecting his hand to be regrown, that would undermine "flesh of the servant, willingly given". (Probably anything that happens /after/ the ritual doesn't matter, because Voldemort wouldn't be so stupid as to make the continued existence of his body reliant on Wormtail's continued loyalty.)

******* He did expect it to be fixed though - when Voldemort asked for his arm, Pettigrew held up the chopped off one, when Voldemort wanted the Dark Mark. And after, he reminded Voldemort "that he promised", prompting Voldemort to create the silver hand. So he clearly already knew there would be a replacement in one way or another, from Voldemort.

********* No, thus fulfilling the sacrificial requirements. Pettigrew knew he would lose his hand, and he also knew Voldemort would give him a replacement. So he knew there was no chance of growing it back, but that could be because the knife was cursed, or used in a very dark ritual, and thus, doesn't disprove the theory that limbs can normally be regrown.
