Pretty much all HG/FD I've read were set post GoF or post-war, are there any good ones set during the tournament? Only non-abandoned/completed fics please.


** Yes please, give me some. I'll wait.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione can see, in this small infinite moment, exactly where the sun that the world orbits around is replaced and in its place stands this girl; all bright teethed smiles and full laughs as she sits there surrounded by her friends, they themselves surrounded by admirers like meteors orbiting the planets that orbit the sun. She is the sun. AU: Fleurmione. GoF

  Dusk of Summer takes place during Hermione's fourth year at Hogwarts, the same year that Fleur Delacour visits the school in hope to compete in the Triwizard Tournament, and the same year they begin their love affair. This is an alternate universe, so possibilities are limitless. I must apologize for the terrible summary, but there's quite a bit more information inside.
