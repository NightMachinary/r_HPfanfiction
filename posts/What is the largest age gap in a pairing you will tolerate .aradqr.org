** I never cared for large age gaps in relationships as long as both are consenting adults. If they aren't, age is more important for me, but mostly just to the point where teenagers date other teenagers, not teenager/adult, student/teacher or similar.

De-age fics (be it from potions or time travel) have me mentally consider them whatever age they end up being, because doing anything else gets awkward fast (my headcanon in that case is that they're mentally whatever age they are, just that they have memories from when they were older, just like you can imagine yourself as a child as an adult, that doesn't make you one, or vice versa, in real life as well). Thus, teenage HGRL/HGSS romances or similar doesn't bother me in HG time travel fics, nor the implied age discrepancy in Peggy Sue fics in general.

Does that mean that you'd only accept a romance between a time traveler and their young classmates if their mental maturity levels are roughly the same?

I was thinking of a particular fanfic in which Harry travels back to before his first year and ends up in his 11 year old body. He keeps all of his memories and the mental maturity of an adult, which, in my opinion, makes it creepy that he spends all of his time chatting with children who are mentally and emotionally not on the same level. He becomes Ginny's penpal with the intention of laying groundwork for romance.

To me even "the waiting game" is creepy. A person who has the mental maturity level of an adult should never have romantic feelings for a child.

The time traveler can still feel love for the /adult/ person they remember in the other timeline (which would cause the time traveler to feel grief and miss that person), but those feelings of romantic love should not be attached to the child of the same name who lacks all the shared experiences, thought processes, and emotions of the adult romantic partner.

** The older they both are, the bigger the gap can be in my mind.

When it comes to Harry at the age of 16/17, I think Tonks is pretty much the upper limit. When we're dealing with adults, I don't have a problem with an age gap, but I'll be a bit more careful with how dominance is portrayed between two people with vastly different amounts of life experience.

** I really like time-travel pic so am happy to read or write stories that pair up Harry and Hermione with people like Remus or Sirius if there isn't a massive age-gap due to time travel/trope/whatever. See Cartographer's Craft as a great example of this.

Otherwise, it truly depends. I'll be convinced to try and read most things if it makes sense and the writing is good and everyone is over the age of consent (16 here in the UK).

** Depends on the maturity. I don't care if it is a two year old and a forty year old if the two year old is as mentally developed as a thirty year old.

In the same logic, I would be against a twenty year old mind/body being with a forty year old body with a two year old mind. That two year old mind can't give consent even irregardless of the age of the body.

The issue of molestation has nothing to due with the age of the body. Rather, it is the age and development of the mind. A child's mind can't give consent. A forty year old's mind can give consent. In a work of fiction, the age of the body and the age of the mind aren't as stuck together as they are in modern reality. I wouldn't call it rape if a member of a married couple of 85 years took a potion to turn their body into that of a six year old.

To get to the actual question, that depends. Any age difference during puberty can be an issue due to how rapidly the power/maturity dynamics change. A 12 and 18 year old is a very different thing that a 22 and 28 year old. I can't give a reasonable answer here without someone asking a more direct question just due to how vague it is. The question becomes even more vague when I have no idea of the mental development of the two or more individuals.
