A lot of fics break the statute as a way to â€˜improve' society and I dislike the idea of doing that The statute could Sort of like the mist in Percy Jackson where muggles see magic and just rationalize it away like we're wolf are just large wolves Wand firing blasting spells is a rocket launcher same thing with electronics they just shut down as if affected by an emp

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
