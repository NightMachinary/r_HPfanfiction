** linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) is an adventure story where Harry ends up by himself in 1978 and through a variety of reasons, ends up joining the war for his own reasons. He does not go find his parents.

It has its dark moments. It gets very tense and Harry has to live with the consiquences of his choices. He learns not to trust Dumbledore.

It is one of the best stories I have ever read. It was amazing. I laughed, cried, was absolutely terrified by the end. There was amazing character development, great OCs. Just an incredibly written story I cannot reccomend it enough.

There is a slash pairing HOWEVER: It is minimal and is there to serve the story, develop character and insight tension. It's very well done. The pairing doesnt come in till half way through the story (chapter... 30ish?) so you can read up until it and leave it if you don't want to read it.

Just a suggestion ðŸ˜Š

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance)

A very original take on independent!Harry; no bashing, no Ron, Hermione a nonfactor after 2nd year; not many tropes, as it is AU after First Year and doesn't follow many plot points you normally find in fanfics. Basically - ravenclaw!Harry, adopted by nice muggles, things go wrong and he leaves Britain, goes on a revenge quest, comes back to Britain to follow through on those plans.

More villains than just Voldemort. Dumbledore is neutral-ish; well-meaning, but not a huge part in the later story. Gritty realism, creative magical combat. H/Susan Bones pairing. Sequel is up and ongoing.

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.
