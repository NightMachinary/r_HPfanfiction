It was one with no magic at all. Harry was abused heavily. The blue hair incident was a chemical reaction that was blamed on Harry. Hagrid was there, but he was a friendly neighbor who interrupted a beating and took Harry to the hospital where he died. The train to hogwarts was actually the way to the afterlife. I believe the title had something to do with Angel's Tears, but I can't remember for sure.
