Simple as that, I remember reading a couple of good fics with that premise in the past, so I was wondering if you guys could make some recommendations.


** I don't remember if I've read this one (I think I have, but it's been in my archive for years), but this was my immediate thought:

** The Marauders' Companion was a good one. It got taken down, but you might be able to find it if you search for it.

** These get taken down super, super fast, as they're basically copyright violation. You can't quote the entire text of the original work in your fanfic! The author hopeinhell used to have some up...not exactly good, but the best of that particular genre, anyway. Grammar and spelling errors still abound. There was also...qwest something...who wrote some, I believe. The only "read the books" fanfic without any spelling or grammar errors in it was /A Little Light Reading/ by Dullastacks, but it features Snape, not Lily, and was never finished. It's also been purged entirely from the Internet, and the author has a tendency to yell at anyone who dares to try and repost it. There is also a community on fanfiction.net dedicated to this type of story that I will refrain from linking.

** The only one I know with the marauders ist linkffn(Harry Potter and ? (Sorcerer's Stone)). The auther paraphrase the quotes to dodge the copyright claim. He had the story up to the middle of PoA (befor he changed the quoting as it was taken down). Wheter it will keep up know, we'll see.

I give an honerable metion to linkao3(Struggle To Salvation). It is NOT with the marauder. He does not quote the book but gives the number of line (so you either have a really good memory, or have the books with you). I personally dont really like the story, as he made some changes, has an overall weird storyarc and pushes an weak abused Harry pretty hard BUT the story is currently in HBP, so yeah there is that.
