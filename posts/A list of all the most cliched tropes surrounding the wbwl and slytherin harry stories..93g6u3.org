** Remember to discribe Daphne Greengrass as 'Ice Queen'. Draco Malfoy has stormy gray eyes. Snape's hair is soft and shiny, his nose is 'Roman'. Stupid Animagi. Several. At least one is a Phoenix. A familiar. Either black phoenix or snake. Suddenly Harry has muscles because of Quidditch. Everyone wants him and he srews everything that moves.

Where did that even come from? "Steel-gray" (or "silver") are cringily-overused, but accurate. "Stormy" on the other hand would imply /dark/ gray...

** The Slytherins are noble souls, bullied by the evil Gryffindors, beset by ignorant mudbloods, and they are a family, defending each other against unprovoked aggression from the other Houses.

Every Slytherin is also a master politican at age 11, already planning - cunningly! - their and Britain's future by making alliances (Not friendships - that's for the bullies in Gryffindor!) with each other.

Blood matters. JKR was wrong, your family matters and your blood grants you special powers if you're a pureblood. Marrying a mudblood means ending your family power!

Only the Slytherins are versed in Wizarding Culture. Everyone else, pureblood or not, are savages and barbarians and know nothing about their culture. Mudbloods can't learn it anyway.

*** I honestly do feel bad for the Slytherins. They really do get the short end of the shaft; everyone expects them to be evil and join Voldemort. This preconception is really quite dangerous, Heaven forbid that not all of them are that way. It doesn't help that canon did little to correct it. As much as I love Ron (and Hagrid) in canon, he falls victim to this as well.

Perhaps Voldemort would have had a harder time recruiting them if they weren't already thought of as evil. Self fullfilling prophecies...

**** The thing is, we never, ever see a good Slytherin in canon. We see bad Gryffindors (McLaggen), Bad Hufflepuffs (Macmillan and Justin during book 2, and their reaction in book 4), and Luna getting bullied certainly implies bad things about Ravenclaw, but where are the good Slytherins? The ones who support Harry? Who tell Draco to shut up when he sprouts his bigoted slurs?

You don't need to feel bad for the Slytherins in canon since they do not show even a hint of not being solidly behind Team Bigot, or even Team Death Eater.

***** The opposite also applies. Just because we do not see a good Slytherin does not mean one does not exist. It is this line of thinking where we make assumptions that we should not make.

As to your second point? It isn't fair to characterize people like that at all, that's just plain awful. Just because they do not show definitive proof of "goodness" does not mean we should hate them or look down upon them. Since we did we assume the worst of people, especially when they have done nothing to deserve it. A sorting into Slytherin does not mean you are a bigot or Death Eater; I'm not going to make an assumption based off of a sorting of all things.

That's the same as holding every German citizen responsible for the Holocaust. I certainly don't believe every German citizen during that time period was evil. Do you?

Remember this is from Harry's POV as well. We don't know that every or even most Slytherins followed Draco; Draco is just the most prominent as he appears most often in Harry's life.

The good people are good, the evil people are evil, /but it is not fair to say that the idle are evil./ Just because an average joe happened to be a Slytherin doesn't make them evil. If an average joe that was a Hufflepuff did nothing we wouldn't think them evil? Why does the Slytherin deserve that label?

****** Lmao, this answer is getting downvoted.

This answer's mentions a major plot point of all WBWL stories, that is why Harry doesn't stop Malfoy when he spouts his bigotry at muggle borns. There is something called Slytherin House rules, in which House Unity is always the first and biggest rule. So even if Harry disagrees with Malfoy he cannot argue with him in front of others of other houses. By downvoting this answer we classify and ally ourselves with the James Potter and WBWL Potter who we say are prejudiced towards Slytherins.

Fear. If you don't follow the rules Government has made, cops will drag ur ass to prison. Same principles here. If you don't follow the house rules that everyone is following and agrees to, you get hated, hexed, bullied, etc.

It's one thing if you are an underground faction or a spy, and another if you are just allowing it to happen to save your own neck.

Lmao, Slytherin Common Room is literally like an Underground faction. And Harry allows bigotry because he literally is a firstie and will get hexed, bullied if he doesn't agree with the rest of his house. Its called Peer Pressure, its not made up and is a real world phenomenon just like the one I have mentioned previously.

********* The problem with your response is that the House Unity clause only works if they are the supreme authority. They aren't - they are still children. Teachers and Dumbledore are. Plus if Harry is vocally against it, he also gains support from a good chunk of the school.

You are tipping the balance way too hard towards the students and towards each house. And, Harry has never let bullying, hexing, or peer pressure push him against his morals. It's literally the reason his hand was cut up so much in the fifth book.

And allowing innocent people to be hurt to save yourself is complacency and downright makes you an accessory of the crime through knowledge but inaction.

** Also, a short script I had posted on the topic a while ago, which contains some suggestions:

/[In the Great Hall, some time after */Harry*/'s name comes out of the Goblet of Fire...]/

*Harry:* /[standing on a table]/ Listen up, everybody! /I SWEAR ON MY ---/

*Dumbledore:* No, Harry, don't! If you prove your innocence that easily now, you will ruin all my well-constructed plans to sacrifice you to the Greater Good after stealing all your money and giving your precious bodily fluids to the Weasleys! I just said all that out loud, didn't I...

*Grindelwald:* /[from Numengard]/ What the hell, man?! First, you're all "Yes, Gellert, let's take over the world for the Greater Good." Then, you leave and come back to hex the crap out of me because you don't like Greater Good any more, and stick me in this here cell. And now, you're all for it again. Make up your mind, man!

*Dumbledore:* Shut up! /SILENCIO!/

*Grindelwald:* Also, even ordinary skilled adult wizards, but particularly mighty ones like ourselves, don't need to enunciate simple spells like --- /[is silenced]/

*Hermione:* Wow, Dumbledore is so great and honest and powerful! I totally believe everything he says, because I am totally incapable of disobeying or disbelieving any Authority Figures or Books or Books of Authority Figures. Harry, you shouldn't make a Wizard Oath, even if it will solve all your problems, because Dumbledore says you shouldn't!

*Harry:* No! You were always holding me back with your helpfulness and studiousness. Without you, I would have learned All the Magic myself, becoming worthy of my heritage as Lord Potter/Black/Gryffidnor/Slytherin/etc. ---

*Sirius:* Hey, I'm not dead yet! /[is ignored]/

*Harry:* --- but I am through being led around and manipulated by manipulative manipulators (who manipulate)! /I SWEAR ON MY MOTES/ that I didn't put my name into the Goblet! /SO MOTE IT MOTE! [waves his wand, producing */Motes*/]/

*Random Spectator #1:* Wow, those are really big motes! I don't know what to think now!

*Random Spectator #2:* Harry must be a Very Powerful Wizard to produce such ginormous motes!

*Luna:* I think this mote is trying to build a nest in my hair. I am surprisingly OK with that.

*Dumbledore:* Noooo! Harry has gone Independent! I am foiled!

*Harry:* Well, looks like I don't have to do the Triwizard anymore. What should I do now? I know, I'll start a harem!

*Hermione:* /[to */herself*]* Wow, I want Harry to be my Authority Figure now! /[to */Harry*]* Can I join?

*Harry:* Sure.

*Hermione:* I am ever so glad that I don't have to think or do anything for the rest of this fic!

*Random female student #1 (or Tonks):* Can I?

*Harry:* Sure.

*Random female student #2 (or Tonks):* Can I?

*Harry:* Sure.

*Ginny:* Can I?

*Harry:* No! The Weasleys betrayed me!

*Ron:* Only a little.

*Harry:* Except for the Twins. The Twins are still cool. But not Ginny.

*Ginny:* Nooooo! /[runs off crying, brews Amortentia, accidentally feeds some to */Ron*/, and the rest is NSFSanity]/

/[Meanwhile, elsewhere...]‚Äã/

*Draco:* Professor Snape, where are we going with these brooms?

*Snape:* Mister Malfoy, if I were to appear in the same scene as Potter at this point, I would be humiliated by him in a duel---if I were lucky; and something similar goes for you. Therefore, we shall exercise our Slytherin virtue of knowing when to make an expeditious retreat, by making an expeditious retreat.

*Draco:* But... But I never got to confess my forbidden love for Hermione!

*Snape:* Neither did I, Mister Malfoy. Neither did I. Alas, you can't always get what you want; and neither can I. /[clenches fist]/ Only Potter can!

** James and Lily suddenly turn into psychopathic child abusers and either abandon Harry at the Dursely's, or completely ignore him in favour of the WBWL (usually named John for some reason).

Both James and Lily suddenly care immensely what the public thinks of them and spend an inordinate amount of time attending parties and similar events, taking the WBWL with them but leaving Harry at home.

Usually either Sirius or Remus is the only one who even notices Harry, everyone else is fine with completely ignoring him.

Dumbledore seems to spend more time visiting the Potters than a man with three important jobs should.

James has a completely unhinged view of Slytherins and will want to disown Harry when he is sorted into Slytherin, but either Lily or Dumbledore stop him.

Despite receiving extensive tutoring from the best scholars and instructors money can buy, or even better, taught by Dumbleore himself the WBWL is still a worst wizard than Harry, usually laziness is the excuse.

The Weasely's are always close friends with the Potters, with Ron and Ginny acting like creepy stalkers towards the WBWL and ignore Harry. Only Fred and George seem to give Harry any attention at all.

I might come back and add more if I can think of anything, been a while since I've read any WBWL stories.
