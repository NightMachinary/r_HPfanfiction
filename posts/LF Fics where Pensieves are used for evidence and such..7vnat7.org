Going over the tv tropes page I started thinking. Why can't the ministry just get a pensieve from Harry and see Voldemort's return. I know there is the whole "accuracy" part but I think it would still be worth a try.


** I had my Aurors use Pensieve evidence in my story "Patron" - including comparing Pensieve evidence to find out if someone was obliviated.

It's used exactly as you want in the one-shot "The Greatest Minister of Magic".

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
