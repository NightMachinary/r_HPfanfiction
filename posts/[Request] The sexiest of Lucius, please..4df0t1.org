I want Lucius at his most powerful (or his sexiest, same thing). I don't care who he's paired with, I don't care if he's paired with anyone. He doesn't even have to be the main character of the fanfic, just part of it. Give me your recommendations, pull from fics you read ages ago if you need to. Smut is appreciated but not necessary at all.

^{P.S. I've already read everything LaurieLove has to offer.}


** Duinn Fionn aka geoviki has written some really good Harry/Draco fics where Lucius is casting a long shadow. Try A Thousand Beautiful Things.

I also like "Left my Heart" and "Surrender the Grey" by Emma Grant. Scheming Death Eater Lucius with questionable connections. Lucius only shows up in the second part (Surrender), but you need to read the first part (Left) to understand what is going on.

** Found another one that I dimly remembered - best sexy Lucius first person POV fic ever.

Heartsease by Slytherincess.

** I don't usually read anything with Lucius as a main character, but Lomonaaeren is one of my favorite authors and thus...

Linkffn(11757553)

Linkffn(4359350) - This is actually a fic where Lucius is not physically powerful, but his strength of will and determination is definitely showcased here.

  HPDM slash. Nothing in Harry's life has gone the way he expected, and that includes being the mediwizard assigned to treat Lucius Malfoy. But he's Harry; he can deal with this. And he can deal with Draco Malfoy's nonsensical flirting, too.

  HPLM slash. Two years after the war, and Lucius is back in power as if he's never been gone. Harry, tired of denying his own power, decides that he might as well enlist Lucius's help to change the Ministry. Updated Wednesdays. COMPLETE.
