** The first fanfic I ever read was linkffn(More Than Familiar) because someone posted about it being a horrible fanfic in [[/r/HarryPotter][r/HarryPotter]]. It's a weird mix between horrible and hilarious. They both become animagi and are in a relationship with Hedwig. Who also ends up being an animagus, but that doesn't make it any less weird.

*** well that was definitely an interesting read, and now I question whether or not I find Hedwig attractive as an owl... so there's that.

**** There was another story in that thread (I think) that was HagridxHedwig, except Hedwig wasn't an animagus. So feel free to go look that one up, I don't plan on trying to find it again. Bad enough the images are burned into my mind.
