** I mean, I don't necessarily recall spotting any signs from anyone in particular, but if I absolutely HAD to pick out a character I might guess Colin.

As in, if Rowling said she intended him to be gay all along, I'd buy it immediately without doubting her.

Because, I get that hero worship is a thing. And maybe the dude just likes taking photographs of people, but... y'know. Wouldn't be shocked if there were some Harry polaroids hung above his bed

******* Well as a bit of a disclaimer here....the fic I'm writing isn't a "happily ever after" nice romance. It has its moments certainly. But I'm telling a story of the darker side of the aftermath of war using Harry's character, and telling a story of moving on from a first love using Colin's character, and what I have planned is pretty dark. But. There is no taking photos without consent/blackmail/anything of that sort, so there's that at least.

** I never got that vibe from Dean or Seamus. But Colin Creevey? I could totally see it. I ship him with Jimmy Peakes.

I also think Remus was bi, and he turned his feelings for Sirius onto Tonks. I don't think Sirius was gay or bi, though. He edges toward asexual with a slight preference for women.

** I love this sub, but homophobia here is extremely grating. Why else would people feel the need to downvote any gay/bi headcanons that aren't Colin Creevey or some footnote characters (and even them) in the thread that specifically asks for them?

Anyway, Harry is bi, he notices good looks of other male characters in a way that suggests attraction, but he probably wouldn't figure his sexuality until at least his 20s or maybe even 40s, when all his kids are at Hogwarts.

I also kinda see Lavender coming out later in life (if we assume she survived Greyback) and admitting that all those public makeout sessions with Ron were a desperate attempts to convince herself and others that she's not gay.

I headcanon Charlie as gay, and maybe also Percy, though in Percy's case, it would be the deepest closet ever.

**** Harry's perception of young Sirius in the Pensieve, Cedric, even young Tom Riddle.

I don't state it like it's fact, I'm answering the question "who could have been bi/gay and why do you think so?" I'm not saying JKR wrote it that way, but it's an interpretation of the character that doesn't contradict canon.

And no, I don't see why gay/bi headcanons should be downvoted, especially in a thread that asks for them. I didn't mean my comment, actually, downvote that all you like. But at the time I posted it, almost all opinions except for interpreting an unthreatening creeper comic relief as gay were downvoted. As is the post itself, and any slash pairing people ask for here. Take of that what you will.

** Remus is bisexual. My evidence is that in the fifth book, he and Sirius give joint gifts to Harry, which is a very couples sort of thing to do (Harry also lists "Sirius and Lupin" at least a dozen times in that book- they're obviously spending almost all their time together). Also, this would explain why Remus and Tonks get together. When Sirius dies, Tonks, who is Sirius' cousin (her mother is Andromeda, who was the daughter of Sirius's father's brother (ie first cousins) would grieve with Lupin, which would lead to comfort sex/feelings and a conflicted relationship. But eventually...they officially get together.

​

Harry is very much bisexual as well. The way that he describes certain male characters (and obviously female characters) shows that he has feelings for more than just girls, but he grows up in a very heteronormative environment, so I see him as discounting his romantic feelings.

​

Draco is very much obsessed with Harry and constantly tries to get Harry to pay attention to him. I could see Draco as being firmly gay but hating himself and knowing he can't ever be out because of the expectations on him from his family. I imagine him marrying some random other pureblood and having a child being very much a function of basically being set up with someone else who was "approved" but not sharing any actual physical affection with her.
