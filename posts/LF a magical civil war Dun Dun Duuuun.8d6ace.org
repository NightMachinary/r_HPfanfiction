After the first wizarding way the corrupt ministry of magic allowed death eaters to go free. Muggleborns, half-bloods and blood traitors were furious. Realizing the ministry was run by corrupt men/women and in the pockets of death eaters the muggleborns, half-bloods and blood traitors started a civil war to over throw the corrupt government. When Harry Potter enters the wizarding world at the age of 11 he enter a world at war. Anything along this lines where the good guys try to over throw the government and start a civil war would be interesting to read.


** Linkffn(divided and entwined) covers this pretty well, although it starts in year five, I think, so it's later than you're looking for. There's a lot of military style training on the part of Hermione and the others. It's Hermione focused and pretty dark, all in all.

*** Hogwarts was close to blow up in early chapters, but the author decided not to go down that road, so the situation there was defused later.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** That's interesting. How would Hogwarts work? Will there be another school for loyalists (assuming that Dumbledore is a rebel, but who knows how he would align).

Is Hogwarts a constant battleground? Are the Houses split between loyalists and rebels?

*** Simply make it some kind of independent entity, like a city state or something. There's a lot to be done with something like that.
