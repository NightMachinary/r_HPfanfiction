(Please not Goblins)

I've been on a bit of a raised by somebody else kick lately, and looking for some more great stories. I really adored "The King's Indian Attack" and "The Daring Win" - are there any more great stories with unlikely parental figures? More Sinistra would be amazing, but maybe I'm just partial to Nectere's characterization lol.


** Linkao3(The Child of Azkaban by LonelyHarvest)

Premise: Lily and James set it up so Harry would be magically sent to Sirius to take care of him in the event of their death. Unfortunately, Sirius is in Azkaban. Harry grows up in a prison, surrounded by Death Eaters, but with Sirius. It's strange, but cool.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

*** Sure! Oddness is just a wish, I'm mostly just looking for some AUs caused by not growing up with the Dursleys though! Most of the ones I've read have been raised-by-Grangers, so Sirius is still unique!

  AU. An escape from Azkaban has called for drastic measures to be taken. Five-year-old Harry Potter is taken from his relatives' home and relocated with two of his parents' remaining friends. No slash.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487/chapters/31624473][the dogfather]] by hollimichele) is a really good muggles + Sirius Black raise Harry.

In linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675297/chapters/36416946][Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]] by The_Carnivorous_Muffin) Harry gets part way through his childhood with the Dursleys before Diary Riddle adopts him.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16594244/chapters/38889167][Spoonful of Sugar]] by widdlewed) has a Harry raised by Death.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4608288/chapters/10502271][Proud]] by SummerLeighWind) is very interesting in that Harry is raised just by Vernon, not Petunia.

  Death is omnipotent. As such, it should be of no surprise that they're able to retain the memories of various universes, or multiple timelines and lives lived. Because of this, everything is different, and yet very much the same. Death will only allow one mortal to Lord over them. It just so happens that this universe's Harry Potter needs a more...hands on approach. ----aka that AU where Death becomes a parental figure for a young mute Harry.

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home.
