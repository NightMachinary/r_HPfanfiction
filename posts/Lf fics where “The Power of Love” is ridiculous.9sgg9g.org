**** I've come up with a satisfactory headcanon - Quirrelmort burned by Harry's touch because they had been drinking unicorn blood to prevent Quirrel's body from burning out. There was indications that Voldemort's possession of animals near his hideout in Albania resulted in burned out husks of the animals being left behind, to the point where even rats wouldn't venture near him.

Yes, the protection from Lily is what caused the damage, but it wouldn't have been more than a static shock if they weren't screwing around hosting two complete, active souls in one body for so long.

** Not Power of Love but linkffn(Larceny, Lechery and Luna Lovegood) has a different very ridiculous death for Voldemort. The rest of the fic isn't any less ridiculous.

** linkffn(The Girl Who Loved) and its sequel lnkffn(Violence Inherent in the System) do eventually feature Riddle being "killed" in a very fitting, but utterly ridiculous, manner.

An alert though: the first fic is excellent, but the sequel is only average. If you're only interested in Riddle's defeat, this probably isn't worth checking out.

** It always bugs me when authors legitimately make fun of the "power of love" thing because it makes me think that they kind of missed a huge theme in the series. Sorry for the small tangent.

*** As a kid I loved the idea and the theme, though as an adult I am far more skeptical. Like, was Lily the only one to die for her kid? There's one theory that makes me feel better about that, which was Lily was the only one who could have survived because Voldemort wasn't there for her. But then Harry supposedly gave a similar protection when he died in the forest which would invalidate that. Besides, Voldemort isn't actually defeated by love. He's defeated by a wonky wand.

**** Yeah, he's not defeated by love as much as he is by his own act of granting someone mercy and his lack of understanding about how magic works on the fundamental level.

There's an explanation somewhere about how the whole thing with Lily boiled down to the fact that, because of Severus's begging, he gave her honest mercy, of the “do not fight me and I will not kill you” kind, which she then transferred to Harry by offering him herself in his stead without trying to fight (since that would have broken the deal on her side). Thus, once he killer her magic itself ensured that he could not hurt Harry.

This one plays very well with the other stuff you see in the series, such as Dumbledore commenting that it was old magic that did Tom in, and with it being fitting for someone like Tom to reach for power but ignore the nuances of the very thing that brought this power into being. Plus, if this happening required both honest mercy from him /and/ the other side dying without fighting first, I think it's a good enough explanation as to why we've not seen it before.

Harry's offer in the forest plays well with this one too, if you assume that either he ever actually indented to spare them if he got Harry or that magic was already fed up with him and took his intentless offer to work anyway. But the last book is a weird thing anyway, so I wouldn't be surprised if some people just gave up on trying to make it make sense.
