I'm looking for that kind of absurd, contrived mystery fic still keeping a good plot. Any thing that has the same kind of athmosphere will also do. Should be weird and awesome.


** The Death Gate Trilogy linkffn(A Ring of Gold)

A pre-DH mystery story where Harry disappeared after beating Voldemort, half the story revolves around trying to figure out what is happening in the shadows.

The Prisoner's Cipher linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher)

A crazy/evil Harry post-war (slightly AU), the story mostly revolves around Hermione trying to discover what went wrong with Harry to turn him from the paragon of good to a cackling maniac.

Edit: Also want to give a shout out to The Aurors linkffn(The Aurors) by Floreat Castellum. Harry takes on a partner as an auror and they investigate a series of attacks/murders on former sympathizers of the Death Eater regime. She also has a sequel that is sporadically updating (see the town hall meeting for info on that).
