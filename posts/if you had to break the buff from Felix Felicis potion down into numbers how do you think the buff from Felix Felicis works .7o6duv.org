I would say it gives a boost of 150% of the max possible luck. so if luck has a maximum of say 1000, Felix Felicis would boost you up to 1500 luck no matter what your actual luck is so it gives more of a buff to some one with no luck over someone with max luck.


** A collective of 300 or more prescient spirits explore the near future and guide you to take actions based on your goals in mind when you drank the potion.

Gets really interesting when two people using Felix operate in the same area. Worse if they're working at cross-purposes.

** Obviously the potion just makes it so you roll crits on all your checks for the duration. Rolling a nat 20 on all your checks would make you SUPER lucky.

** how does a luck stat even work. does it just boost every probability? does it increase loot? What kinda numerical system are we talking about here.

I think Luck just helps you succeed in all endeavours by helping the person pick favourable pathway through the circumstances.

lets say there is 200 paths to take each being number between -100 for the worst path and 100 for the best path

A person with 0 luck could get a roll between -25 and 25 so they have 50-50 chance of picking a good or bad path but the danger or good fortune they will find on the paths are minor.

a person with 25 luck could get a roll of between 0 and 50 so they would not not pick a dangous path but they are not going to get any great rewards on any of the paths they pick

75 luck would roll between 50 and 100 they have a change to get a path with good reward all the way up to the best path

76 and up you would roll between 51 and 100 they would pick between 49 paths with the amount of paths the person could pick going down by 1 for every point in luck over 75

100 luck would roll between 75 and 100 they would likely to pick between 25 of the best paths

and some one who had drank Felix Felicis would roll constant 150 and pick the best path every time

and a person bitten by a Mackled Malaclaw would probably have -75 luck until the venom left there system meaning they could only roll between -100 and -50

**** That feels slightly flawed to me - after all, Felix Felicis doesn't make you an omnipotent god, just lucky. Maybe if there was the default roll of +25 to -25 and then each effect rolled their own number to change that?

Malaclaw would be a -1 to -50, giving it a chance to completely heck over luck without guaranteeing it, Felix would be +1 to +50.
