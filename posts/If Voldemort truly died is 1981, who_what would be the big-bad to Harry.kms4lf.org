** If Voldemort truly died there would be no story. He is as integral to the books as Harry is. He is the reason Harry is important in the narrative, and not just another war orphan like Neville.

**** Without Voldy freeing him, he will still be a imperiused dummy being fed by Winky .. on the one side you have dementers feeding on all his happy memories and the other having your father repeatedly imperius you until your free will erodes .. tough to choose.

**** I would think that Voldemort being truly dead would preclude the horcruxes from existing, so most of CoS should be out.

But PoA would be mostly the same, and depending on what Barry decides to do, GoF may or may not be pretty similar too.

***** I could maybe see POA if I look sideways. But Goblet of Fire was directly a Voldemort plot, as was COS (as The Letter said, true death = no horcruxes) and HBP and DH. The entire series was built around Harry's tie to Voldemort. Remove that tie and you've removed the plot.

That said, if OP is writing fanfiction just come up with something else. It's fanfic. OP can do whatever they want.

****** As long as the Weasleys still when the drawing, they still end up in the paper, so Sirius still sees Peter and tries to break out. Butterfly effect aside, PoA should be the mostly the same.

For GoF, I forgot that Barty was freed by Voldemort and didn't just escape at the world cup. So yeah, it wouldn't be the same.

******* Would Peter be with Weasleys though? why would he stay in the country at all? it's assumed that Peter is hiding out as a rat in Britain to wait until Voldy comes back. He would like escape the country .. he has the perfect cover, he is widely known as dead.

The DE elements would like splinter without a leader .. Malfoy is clever, financially & politically powerful but he is not magically powerful enough to hold on to all the factions that likely exist.

******** Was he waiting for Voldemort though? I don't think there's any indication that any of the Death Eaters really believed Voldemort was still alive. I think it's more likely that he realized Voldemort was still alive from hearing Harry and/or Ron talk about their encounters with him their first two years.

********* Isn't the dark mark not fully fading a thing in cannon? It tells them that he is still alive in some capacity. Why would he hide as a rat when everyone thinks he is dead ... no one is looking for him, he escaped Britain in search of Voldy when people knew he is still alive, if he knew his master is really dead he would escape the country.

********** I know Snape mentioned his mark growing darker in GoF, but I'm pretty sure that's the only canon mention of it fading or darkening in canon.

But even if the mark did fully fade when he died, the Death Eaters would have no way to know that the first time around. Unless Voldemort told them beforehand, but the fact that they all seemed to have believed he died suggests that he didn't.

**** I guess that depends on your definitions of “truly” and “died.”

My take is that there is a core Voldemort splicing off pieces of himself. None of those pieces is Voldemort in the same way that if I cut off my nose and find some way to keep it alive, I could die and my nose could still live.

If the core of Voldemort dies in 1981, Voldemort is dead. If his soul shavings possess/merge with other people, we have new entities. This is especially true if the new entity ends up being a merge of the two or a warping of the person.

If you want to purge all references to Voldemort, your next best entity for him to conflict with is probably the Ministry. But since they won't conflict over Volds rising, it might have to be over the treatment of half-breeds, creatures of near-human intelligence, or muggleborns.

Outside of that, I assume you're making up a new big bad out of whole cloth.
