I'm looking for fics where multiple people all go back in time, preferably more than 10.

  Harry was really not sure what was happening. One thing was certain, he did not like one bit of it.With the help of the Time Turner they had been able to rescue Sirius from the Dementors, but the Dark Lord's faithful servant was still able to escape, setting in motion a terrible future. Fawkes hastily decides to intervene before Hermione can return the Time Turner, sending five Hogwarts students back in time to their younger bodies. But do they possess enough foreknowledge to create a better outcome?

  During a publicity stunt, Harry and five others are sent to another world where a well timed Stupefy made all the difference. As Harry looks for his peers and a way home, another Harry investigates the odd arrival of his doppelganger.

** I have read a fanfic that somewhat follows this premise, but it only focuses on the adventures of one of them(Harry). 5th year, Ron and Hermione are arguing about History class, Ron yells out something, and Professor Bins hits everyone(Gryffindor/Slytherin 5th year class) with the dust that is inside the Time Turners causing everyone to go to random times with Harry ending up in 5th year with the Marauders. I don't remember the name, but if I find it i will link it.

** I haven't read it myself, but linkffn(Far Too Many Time Travelers by Lord Jeram) is often recommended in threads asking for humor/crack fics.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.
