I've only read (part of) 'Harry Crow' and there are some parodies of this tropes such as 'Harry <Whatever> and the Senile Old Fool'... but honestly I don't come across such fics even by accident. So what's the big deal with them? I've seen in the past a few Ron and Ginny bashings but they were not glaring... and then some people took it to extremes but I always assumed they were a joke. I've seen evil Dumbledore but in most cases he was the final villain and he appeared competent.

So now I wonder... where do all these posts come from? Is it such a common setting or are people just falling for the internet trolls like so many fell for the 'My Immortal' writer?

***** I would never presume to just not like any trope, because surely even the silliest of things can be written well. My problem with Indy! Harry for me is a combination of several things.

1. Obviously Indy is by definition OOC for Harry, so you need a real and substantial and fitting reason for Harry's character to be very different.

2. As different as his indy nature is, if you change all of his character traits, then you are just writing an OC. Ocs don't bother me at all, but when they are wearing a canon characters name and skin they are jarring to any thoughts or memories or knowledge I already have going into the story.

3. When you make a Harry into an Indy! Harry, you need a force for him to be striving for independence from. The default choice is a manipulative! Dumbles. He's one of the main sources of supervision and control. And this could even come off well, if Dumbles is written to be controlling and manipulative, but then what? The brash, uneducated, and general menace to everyone who doesn't serve him: Indy! Harry has to out maneuver, out wit, or out fight the 100 year old Chief Warlock. Who at this point has to be dumbed down to Wiley Coyote levels of incompetence and arrogance.

4. Perhaps the previous pitfall is avoided... Indy!Harry isn't strictly independent, just independent against Dumbledore. He has a patron, or a coach, or some form of leadership. It's given him the heads up in his battle with Dumbles, or the Weasleys, or heaven forbid the Potters. Now we have the true story line. Usually, it's time to start thinking of Voldemort. Because a teenager fighting against one ancient and all powerful wizard isn't quite enough. This Harry has spunk. (At this point 95% of the IndyHarry stories have failed my most basic standards for story telling, and unfortunately the few that didn't, crashed and burned around here). Harry needs a solution of Voldemort. Voldemort is a dangerous duelist, he is tethered to earth by horcruxes, and he has a connection to Harry. Any one of these is a problem far exceeding the knowledge and capabilities of an independent teenager, so how do you solve them? Well according to Indy!Harry writers, a combination of Deus ex Machina like a super giant magical core(shudder), a special horcrux finding and destroying ritual, secret Parselmouth spells, a training montages, a muggle squadron of SAS soldiers, and more common of all, the extreme dumbing down of any and all enemies, again to Wiley Coyote levels of incompetence.

The problem is in the formula, by definition, an Indy Harry must rebel against the established powers that be. So he must simultaneously turn some of his canon presumptive allies into enemies or nuetrals and can't learn from them or gain their strength. Then he has to turn around and use his teenage brain to over power his true enemy, the strongest wizard alive. If he gets too much help, then it feels like he didn't do anything and wasn't the hero. Which is a big nono for Indy!Harry writers because (I presume) most of them are writing Indy!Harry as a partial self insert ego exercise.

Wow, I'm sorry about that rant, I must have been holding that all in.

Umm... to each his/her own...

****** Your Third and Fourth points are I think pretty fallacious. You're blaming fanon when canon does pretty much the same thing. Do we need to talk about the fact that Harry defeated Riddle just by being there? Do we need to talk about Rowling Deus Ex Machina, author fiat, and at many times lazy writing plain and simple?

Riddle and Dumbledore are supposed to be geniuses, yet we never see Riddle did anything remotely smart, nevermind genius level (GOF plot has to be probably one of the dumbest plans ever devised by a villain). Same thing for Dumbledore who spent the whole series making blunders that even average Joe wouldn't make, with simple common sense. As bad as Dumbledore bashing is, they are many reasons why his character is so cleaving. Canon Dumbledore is either incompetent or not as moral as people claim him to be. The total inconsistency of his character (because Rowling went from Children's book to YA, and failed the transition) is the main reason why people bash him so much.

So in Canon, we have cartoonish villains and incompetent adults all around (it's part of the children's book tropes) who dropped the ball when they weren't passing the idiot ball amongst them. We have children and teenagers who save the day/world with plot armor, Deus Ex Machina, etc... Yet you don't mind at all.

It always baffles me when people do that.

But yeah to each their own.

******* Well you seemed to have missed the entire point.

I said, I don't like this fanfiction trope because it always boils down to these same issues(while leaving room for the possible exceptions that I havnt found) and you respond with, 'yeah, well canon does these similar things, therefore your critique of Indy Harry is wrong, while simultaneously right?'

Not to mention your understanding of canon is just that, your understanding of it. And one that appears to be heavily coloured by fanon simplification. But I'm not here to debate canon, I was just trying to air my personal grievances with a fanfiction trope and why I think almost all of its iterations fail in my eyes.

So next time attack the argument, not the one you want someone to make.

As for my understanding of canon, it's not an understanding at all since it's precisely what happened. That you like so much HP and consider Rowling a good author is up to you. Doesn't change the fact what I said is pretty accurate.

I never made a double standard, as it is you who seems so insistent on comparing the HP books to this fanfiction trope.

I'm sorry to tell you this, but I'm not talking about the story telling in canon, I'm not comparing the decisions made by Rowling to fanfiction, and I'm not declaring my love for HP or Rowling's writing prowess.

I was merely pointing out my issues with the Indy!Harry trope, and pointing out why I have never loved an Indy!Harry story.

As to the supposed accuracy of what you said, I don't doubt that you believe that. But again, you are welcome to any understanding you so choose of the books, and Il keep my own.

This is a good point. The summary typically gives away exactly what type of story is being written. Of course, there is the occasional guilty pleasure fic with a decent-good summary to fool you, but even the 1st chapter will give it away. So I'm always curious about the people who come here to complain after getting deep into a story with blatant hints in the 1st chapter. Like I've complained about Junior Inquisitor going off the rails, but even then it was clear I was going to get good guy bashing a few paragraphs in.

** They were more prevalent in the past, as others mentioned - but I think part of it is that there's still a good number of them and that (as most fanfiction is) they're not usually that well written. They're certainly not falling for internet trolls, people were/are doing this trope honestly.

The posts on here tend to be from people who read a lot of fanfiction and are frustrated about there being so much of that - along with, IMO, a good helping of negativity being satisfying to write about and sticking in our heads a lot longer.

Some of it too is that this sub has a very different demographic/opinion than the fandom at large, which leads to it being a good spot to vent in some situations - prominent ones that come to mind is Weasley/Dumbledore bashing, Lordship Potter, and Hermione. Personally I don't really enjoy all the bashing of tropes and characters we see on here, it gets old after a while and tends to boil down to 'bad writing is bad' more than anything else

And you're right, they tend to be pretty easy to spot from a mile away - part of why I don't understand the need to emphasize/attack them all the time, you know? I'd rather ignore them or think about how they could be improved/well written, that tends to be more interesting IMO.

** Where are you reading? It seemed like every other fic had this between 2010-15, like [[/u/Ash_lestrange][u/Ash_lestrange]] said. I noticed this more on ff.net. Ao3 got more popular around 2013ish I think, but a lot of writers were still on ff.net exclusively.

Ao3's tagging system means you can search for the tropes you like and filter out the ones you don't. I don't read much hp fic on Ao3 outside of my preferred tropes and tags, but I imagine you see would be seeing less of it there because it fell out of fashion when the platform got bigger.

Also I think a lot of people here are reminiscing about the terrible fics they read and loved huge volumes of when they were younger. I went though a phase where I'd read like every WBWL story out there (easily over a hundred) and cry over the /angst/. Almost all of them were terrible (now guilty pleasures) and most had super Lord Potter Black Peverell God.

So yeah, definitely out there, but I guess now you have to do less scrolling to find something without those tropes.

** Last month I read three separate stories that were all about Harry learning some kind of craft. One where he was a chef, one where he was a wandcrafter, and one where he made pottery. In all three fics during his first trip to Gringotts helpful goblins informed him of multiple lordships and that he had hundreds of millions of galleons to his name.

We aren't making this shit up, it's everywhere. Just because you haven't encountered it doesn't mean it isn't everywhere

I see from elsewhere in this thread that you've barely read fanfiction in the last 15 years, so here's a tip: maybe you should assume that the people who actually do read it know what they're talking about.

**** I mean, you say you've caught up, but it's honestly hard to believe that you've read much if you've somehow avoided all of the stories with lordships in them. I don't even hate the trope (plenty of good stories do it well), but it really is quite common. All three fics I'm reading right now have lordships in them to one degree or another.

linkffn(13452914) (new chapter every week) makes a joke out of it, but they still exist.

linkffn(11591125) (two new chapters a week currently) plays it straight but also expands on it a lot more than most fics do.

linkffn(13540876) (complete) is playing it pretty bog-standard, but is still a pretty well written story, though I'm not even half way through.

I'd estimate that one out of every four fics I start reading have lordships, and it isn't like I seek it out. I just read random recommendations from people on this sub. The fic that I just quit reading was an MCU crossover and Harry was a lord in that too even though it wasn't even set in Britain, so the lordship was completely irrelevant. It's the central point of a few fics (particularly pureblood culture fics and any harem shit), but it's just random window dressing in a bazillion other fics.
