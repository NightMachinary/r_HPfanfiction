This sounds weird, I know, but there's a lot of stories out there where Harry is thrown out by the Dursleys as a child. And, y'know, he gets adopted by somebody, usually magical. My only question is why isn't there a story where he's adopted by an Amish family? Just imagine the chaos that would ensue when he goes back to the wizarding world.


** I mean, we don't have any Amish in the UK so that would be really contrived.

*** I'm operating under the assumption the Dursleys went to the US and dropped him off there lol. Although, you guys do have Bruder Hof (apologies if that's not spelled correctly), which are similar to Hutterites. And Hutterites are similar to the Amish, as they're both Anabaptist and believe in a sense of community or communal living while keeping the rest of the world just outside of arm's reach.

**** Well you learn something new every day, I had never heard of them, and I live very close to one of their buildings apparently. I still think it would be really weird and tenuous for that to be written into the story though. A bit forced.
