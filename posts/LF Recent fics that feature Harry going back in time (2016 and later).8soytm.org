It's my favorite trope. Angsty, war-torn hero that goes back in time. Alternate/parallel reality works too. Maybe with the intention to redo things, maybe just to have a life not in the spotlight (like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668/chapters/7419224][C'est la Vie]]). I prefer gen!fics, less romance the better. I prefer to focus on character growth and general interactions versus romance. That said, slash or het are both fine to me, but I don't care for most poly stuff. Problem is, I've been reading things in this fandom since 2005 and I've read most of the classics in this category. However, I'm wondering if there have been any more recently published fics that fall under this trope, or even fics started before 2016 but that have had significant updates in the past two years. Need some good long fics for some long travel days coming up!


** Yes, the author of “Delenda Est” just began on a new time travel earlier this year: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12775205/1/][Final Protocol]], linkffn(12775205).

  Susan Bones, permanent nurse and bodyguard to the comatose Harry Potter, is commanded to execute the Order's final protocol. As hoped, Harry and Susan are transported to the past. But, Harry's recovery is only partial, so Susan must add to her duties the role of foot soldier as the two use their knowledge of the future against Voldemort. H/S. Time Travel. Subtle Soul Bond

** Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches linkffn(11574569) is a more recent time travel story. Technically I would say it is a harem fic, but honestly its mostly just an excuse for Harry to build a team of talented and specialized individuals Ocean's Eleven style. Plus, its pretty funny and the world-building is interesting, if somewhat overdone.

The Disorder of the Phoenix linkffn(12813755) has Harry, Andromeda and Teddy travel back to 1995 as adults. Its Harry/Tonks, but its a decent read.

Easier than Falling Asleep linkffn(12868582) is by the same author. Harry travels back to 5th year (as a kid) to try to fix things. Its Harry/Luna, which I admit I am somewhat of a sucker for.

Harry Potter and the Veil of Death linkffn(12120193). Somewhat somber, Harry time travels back from 1998 to the Department of Mysteries, but things don't go perfectly. Its an interesting take on vigilante!Harry, and romance is really not that important here. Harry speeds through the horcruxes and death eaters.

Hope there is something you like here. I did try to pick fics that were less important romantically.

I wouldn't say that was strictly true. If it were simply an excuse, then I'd say it was a lazy one. And also, if it were, there'd be no reason for Hermione to be courted by Harry, since she's already Slytherin's vassal. If the Lovegood consort business was purely a way for the author to form a connection, then that was very lazy and unoriginal. Nor do I ever see the Weasleys considering setting Ginny up...especially not at 11. No, he's definitely writing a harem fic, intentionally, he's just disguising it very well.

**** Which is why I /would/ say its a harem fic, as stated.

I just enjoy team style stories a great deal. such that I don't particularly care about whether the team is actually a collected harem. Though I admit, I prefer the team style of something like Prince of Slytherin or even Nightmares of Futures Past more.

  Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the last task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up.
