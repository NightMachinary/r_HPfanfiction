It's a pretty old one. Must've been like 3-4 years ago that I read it.

Should be fairly well known as well. I think I remember it had a lot of reviews.

Anyway, gist of it was that Harry moved to the states to get away from it all. He may or may not have been attending a university.

Hermione finds him. Tries to convince him to come back, but he won't. So she stays with him. I think at some point they do the whole "I'm going to sleep in the same bed as you but it won't be sexual at all yep totally platonic oh god kiss me now" dance, but I could be mixing up stories.

Overall the tone is sort of angsty, but mostly romance.

Thanks in advance!

*** Thank you so much this is totally it!

You have no idea how long I've been looking for this (years!) Not particularly because it's so amazing it's worth looking for, even if I thought it was pretty good, but it was one of the first stories I read, and a critical step in my entrance to the world of fanfiction.

You're the best!

**** I'm not the best, I just have nearly 1000 fics favourite'd lol. I can't for the life of me remember the first fic I read at the moment, but I'm 99% sure I also searched it down to favourite it at some point.

***** My first fic was a Full Metal Alchemist oneshot where Winry met a familiar blond man whose face she surely felt like she could recognize but couldn't for the life of her remember who he is.

Yet another story I lost down history lane. Can't imagine how I'm going to look for that one. It's not like there's a FMAfanfiction subreddit.

****** At least your first fic sounds like it was alright. My first I read when I was about 12, and was just this long plodding fluff fic about Harry and Ginny being married and living together and having kids maybe at some point? It was about 12 years ago at this point, maybe 10. I remember a few chapters were dedicated to them trying to find a house to buy. I'd like to find it again for the sheer novelty, but I can almost guarantee it's not impressive.

*** Some of those chapter titles are thankfully misleading. Thought it was another "Hermione got pregnant in the middle of a war and she isn't even 18" story.

**** Oh haha, I've just checked them and they do wow. When I read these fics, I just read 1 chapter at a time, so I don't really notice the trends.

*** Thanks for providing the link, and [[/u/snowywish]] thanks for describing it. I read the first chapter this morning on a lark and now I'm working on chapter 14 instead of packing up my apartment to move. :-D

It's a welcome break from some of the dark nasty & violent fanfictions I've been reading lately.
