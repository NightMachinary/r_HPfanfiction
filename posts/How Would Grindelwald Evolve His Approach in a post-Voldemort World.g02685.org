One thing I'm interested in is how Grindelwald might make another go at ending the Statute of Secrecy and putting the magical community on top. Specifically, how he would go about it after Voldemort is gone and his followers largely disbanded, so he has the edge in individual power.

Given his prior failure and being viewed (at least by history) as a Dark wizard, how do you think he'd change his approach? Take up a new identity and try the same thing (wizards raised among their fellows do seem to often see themselves as above Muggles)? Some other way of appealing the magical community?

And if he's going about it the same way as before (sans a Dumbledore who can match him), what threat (an at least partially real one, mind you) would or could he point to, to sway a sizable portion of the masses to his cause? Grindelwald intrigues me as he's quite different from Voldemort, who primarily appealed to blood purity and a Magic is Might mentality that was compatible with a general wizard arrogance. While G. seems to style himself a freedom fighter and revolutionary (even a savior, with the power of prophecies to boot).


** He could simply force the issue. Imperius a bombing in a magical area, assassinate some royals/political leaders/generals with magic. Imperius a world leader so that they reveal the wizarding world and have them declare war on it. When the wizards and witches start dying he can show up with an I told you so. Say that all magicals need to work together in order to defeat the threat. Say that he can lead them into victory. Imperius the muggles into bombing themselves instead when the wizards do join his side.

*** Interesting. Up front, I was asking this to get the brain juices going for how to go about doing this in a story. I like this suggestion. One thing that came to my mind (since it would also be in line with other events in the story I'm drafting) is for some young Muggleborns to be caught by some governments using thier abilities. The wizards catch them experimenting on children, and as a user below points out, this is a universal agreed upon issue so it might be enough to force the issue, as you put it.

** Political route. Point out how much forces were tied up with enforcing the statute, especially since the Death Eaters didn't stay away from muggle targets, tending to launch hit and run attacks, leaving the aurors to clean up the mess. Hence the Death Eaters were using the statute to their own ends, therefore it was aiding them.

​

If the statute is ended, however, the muggles can assist and in fact in many cases can clean up messes themselves.

​

Apeal to the conservatives by pointing out that this exposure to the WW will stop muggleborns from entering the world ignorant, while sneakily pointing out to the progressives that this will cause more muggle elements to be introduced to the WW by neccesity.

​

Apeal to their wallets by pointing out the opportunities gained by making muggles pay for magical experiences and products, which will create jobs.

*** Interesting suggestions, especially on the level of tactics. I don't think the wizards in government care the expense of the cover-ups since they treat being revealed to the Muggles as an extremely grave possibility. I do think that if something suitably extreme happened (and kept happening) to wizards - especially children - then that might be another kind of cost that could substitute for money. Maybe more so, since it goes across political lines. Say, Muggle experimentation on undiscovered Muggleborns when their strange abilities are captured on camera?

What do you think?

**** If human experimentation was happening there'd be a war, so Grindelwald wouldn't need to do much in that case. People tend to get motivated when their children could be threatened. All they'd need to have in that case is a leader, and with Dumbledore wanting cooperation and moderation suddenly Grindelwald doesn't seem like such a bad choice.

​

The cost of the coverups is in manpower rather than actual monetary cost, although I'd be surprised if a good portion of the magical government can't be motivated by money.

***** Edit: Actually, I think I agree with you, now that I think about.

I think if I use this in a story I've had sitting around, I might go with the experimentation route. It seems more straightforward to justify to the wizarding public.

** Grindelwald breaks out after Dumbledore dies in linkffn(Reformed, Returned and Really Trying). It's a crack fic where he accidentally conquers the world because he (mistakenly) thinks that /it's what Albus would want/.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

** Grindelwald does seem to be more populist than elitist in terms of who would follow him and his ideology (although they would all be magical, of course). And anyone is more rational than canon Voldemort, so I'd suppose he'd be more successful. He's not trying to exterminate muggles, but control/use them.
