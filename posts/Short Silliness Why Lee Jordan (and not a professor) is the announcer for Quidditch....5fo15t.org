The quaffle flew through the goal hoop.

"10 points to Hufflepuff!"

"Slytherin gets 10 points!"

"Another goal, another 10 points to Hufflepuff..."

"Diggory catches the snitch! 150 points to Hufflepuff, Hufflepuff wins 290 to 110!"

*Later, after the match...*

The students entered the Great Hall, chattering away about Quidditch, when one of them pointed, "What the heck?"

The Slytherin hourglass full of emeralds was considerably fuller than it was before. The Hufflepuff hourglass was full nearly to bursting with topazes. The other two hourglasses for Gryffindor and Ravenclaw were unchanged.

One of the Hufflepuffs scratched his head, "How did we get so many points? I know it wasn't like that before the...Quidditch...match..."

Everyone present thought back to what /exactly/ the professor commentating the match was saying.

"...Whoops?"


** I thought quidditch points already added on to the house point totals? Or is that fanon.

***** I am assuming, naturally, but Imagine an automated magical system which responses as programmed for point allocation.

It 'listens' for point allocation commands. Teachers are administrators, the quidditch pitch match scores are another administrator of points.

So when the magic registers that a point has been scored in a match it would allocate points, or perhaps just on match completion adding the total points.

That would be interpreted as separate from Teacher allocated points. As a Teacher may still need to be able to add or remove points during a match play to enforce discipline in the crowds etc.

So if a teacher were to issue the command words 'n points to x house' then the magic would recognise that as a separate and stand alone allocation separate from the Quidditch pitch match point allocation. Thereby duplicating the eventual total point allocation for the match. Leaving the houses not currently in play or mentioned by the Teachers greatly disadvantaged in comparison to the house receiving 'double' points. Especially if it is the last match of the school year.

I am completely over thinking this, I know.

***** Whenever the professor was not sufficiently cautious about wording, she would risk adding house points. This isn't just with deltas (Hufflepuff scoring ten points) but with totals (Hufflepuff has a total of 200 points so far in this game) -- although it's more likely to happen with deltas than totals.

So if nothing happens for ten minutes and the professor announces the point totals to remind everyone, and she misspeaks slightly, each House gets points.

Even if you solve that problem, you still need to ensure that every point /is/ accounted for correctly. A professor might misspeak and fail to assign points for a goal.

I prefer to think the professors merely have very good memories and manually enter points into a central ledger. Professor Snape keeps his tallies in a private ledger and merely updates the totals at the end of the week, unless he wants to make a particular point of someone's foolishness.

*** I'm pretty sure a House only got points if their team won the game. And I didn't think it related to how many points they got, I always figured it was a set amount, but there ya go. It was the main reason Slytherin had won the House Trophy for so long - they'd also had the strongest team, and kept winning the Quidditch Cup * . I don't know what was going on with the other teams, but Gryffindor hadn't won since Charlie's first season, according to the wikia, which is odd since he was supposedly a very good Seeker and Captain.

*apparently this is not canon, the wikia is unsure which of the three teams won it between Charlie's victory, and the 1994? Gryffindor victory. I just assumed it was probably Slytherin since the Quidditch Cup winner does affect the House Cup a lot

*** I had a hard time figuring this out for my stories. Here's what we know:

- In Book 1, Harry thinks that the 50 points McGonagall takes away from him will lose him all the points he won in the Quidditch match.
- In Book 2, Percy tells Harry that he won 50 points in the Quidditch match. (Although why would he need Percy to tell him how many points he won?)
- In Book 1, a total of 1,732 house points were awarded in House Cup.

If each of the 6 Quidditch games over the school year awards 50 house points, then about 15%-20% of all house points come from Quidditch games (compared with a ludicrous ~75% if it's 1:1). However, my solution was that the winning team received one third of the point spread in house points. This way, the team still gets rewarded for better playing beyond a simple win or loss, but the average award is still 50 points.

*** They are but not on a straight 1:1 scale. The exact ratio is unclear, but iirc we know Gryffindor got ~50 points for a won match in Philosopher's Stone.

*** I need to reread the books again, but I can tell you with 100% certainty that in the early video games for the Harry Potter series, the points were tracked in the entrance hall using hourglasses that had red gemstones for Gryffindor, blue for Ravenclaw, green for Slytherin, and yellow for Hufflepuff. Specifically thinking of Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone for the Game Boy Color.

So it's not fanon, and it's at least -loosely-canon, but I can't tell you for whether the hourglasses show up in the books. I think they do (thus how everyone keeps track of points), but yeah.
