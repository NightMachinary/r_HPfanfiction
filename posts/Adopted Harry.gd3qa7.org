I prefer slash but it isn't a must have. I love dark or gray harry stories. I also like smart harry stories. With that in mind do you guys know any stories where Harry is adopted by death eaters. Either as a whole (like all of them) or an individual? I've read one where Barty takes him in instead of killing him, and another where the Lestranges do. I just like the idea of Harry being raised by dark wizards who treat him better then his relatives.


** I am assuming you are not talking about ones with Snape.

I can only remember The Darkness Within by Kurinoone, Growing Up Malfoy by kira66, and Butterfly by AislingSiobhan

  When Harry was 5 he had a pet butterfly. The butterfly could turn into a man who lived in Harry's basement. That man killed Vernon when Harry turned 8. That man is a Death Eater who has been training Harry in how to be a proper Pureblood Heir. Harry was always told he was a bit like a Caterpillar and one day he'd be a Butterfly too. Sorted into Ravenclaw, when he starts Hogwarts, Harry learns that sometimes it's much harder to keep secrets than it is to tell lies. But it could be worse: he could have been a Slytherin. As if enough people didn't look at him funny already!

  A rewrite of the first part in my Dark Prince Trilogy. What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? Book One of the Dark Prince Trilogy.
