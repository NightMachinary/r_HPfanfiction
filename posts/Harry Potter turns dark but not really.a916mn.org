Okay so I read this fic a while back that basically had one of the whole “Aura” or “magical core” concepts. Anyways Harry's turned dark for some reason I cannot remember and becomes super sensitive to light magic, this having to move to Slytherin because the light side is ignorant as fuck. He befriends the Slytherins but I can't remember what happens after that. Does anyone know which fic this is because I want to reread it and I can't find it for the life of me. Thx!
