I enjoyed the vampires/ veela conflict the most in Caedmean Victory, read few Dresden files crossover fics

The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries, which is too much of a power wank imo, but I thoroughly enjoyed how Unspeakables are meant to deal with beings from other planes, gods and demons(but don't like the OP Harry that buddies up with Dumbledore) and the lore/ world building in it

I am looking for more fics with creepy themes. Eldritch horrors, gods, demons, vampires, evil elves(summer and winter courts), trickster beings trying to deceive, hags whatever.

Preferably longer than 50k words. Points for fics with no power wanks where wizards actually do struggle but I am also in for the power wanks since you it is such a niche


** It's not over 50K, but it is the finest Eldritch Horror fic in the HP Fandom, IMHO.

I've got a few more, but I need to go hunting to find those. I'm reorganising some of my bookmarks, so they're not in the places they normally are.
