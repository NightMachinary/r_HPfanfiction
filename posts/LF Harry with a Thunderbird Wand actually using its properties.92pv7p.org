According to the information, a Thunderbird Wand:

Powerful, but difficult to master, particularly prized by Transfigurers. Can sense danger and cast curses on their own.

I want to see Harry with a Wand using that. Malfoy goes to curse him from behind and the wand blasts Malfoy without Harry doing it. That sort of thing, casting curses on its own when its owner is in danger, I want to see that with Harry.


** But, his wand already did that... and it wasn't just a curse it was GOLDEN FUCKING FIRE. I know there were certain extenuating circumstances involved, but still...

*** Of course it did. But the purpose of the post seems to look for a non specific opponent. As you said it happened but it was because of Voldemort and what he seeks is a wand that would do the same regardless of the person.

**** Yeah, I just wand him to have a "Sense Danger" wand that would protect him like the properties say it's supposed to

** Haha if his wand hates the Dursleys he's going to have so much trouble with the Statute of Secrecy every summer :')

*** Canon Dursleys wouldn't be enough as a threat except possible Dudley/Harry Hunting. Fanon Dursleys would be Reducto'd literally the first time he returns to that house with the wand.

**** Fair. I was thinking more of the wand being "grumpy" and sending minor curses and jinxes at them despite Harry trying to stop it from happening.

On another note, your username is adorable!
