**** It's not cracky at all.

Basically the BWL is Jim, who is raised by James and Lily (who sent their son Harry to live with the Dursleys). Harry, at the age of 11, learns that his whole life has been a lie, and that he actually is a wizard and his parents are alive. He goes to Slytherin, Jim to Gryffindor, and outshines his brother, even though the Potters all hate him for some weird reason.

If you're familiar w/ WBWL fics, the above is basically the standard cliché premise of most WBWL fics. The author of this fic, however, conciously crams every single cliché you can think of (Hadrian Remus Potter, mentor Snape, Nevile-does-a-180, etc), and then tries to make it work logically.

Like why would (logically), James and Lily abandon their son for years and never even visit? Why would the Dursleys abuse Harry (and if they're so evil, not send Harry to an orphanage)? Why would any parents name their kid "Hadrian"? And why are all the 11 year olds so smart?

And the fic works really well. It answers a lot of questions and has all the characters acting really rationally (even Jim and Ron, as you'll see in book 2). Lockhart is competent, and so is Pettigrew. Aurors actually do something, etc.

The only complaint (and this is a huge issue imo) is that Year 1 kinda sucks. The author has to set up all the clichés, so the entire first year (at least until they go after the stone) is pretty meh. Year 2 is super duper good though.

**** I had the same reservations bit the fic is absolutely fantastic. It's one of the best i've read, not only because of how it subverts the common tropes but the writing in general is exceptionally good. It has it's own plot beyond the classic canon rehash and most importantly (for me) intelligent characters without resorting to Mary Sue tropes and bashing.

Both Jim and Harry are intelligent and powerful but that doesn't mean that everything automatically goes right for them. Both of them make mistakes and are irrational at times.

All characters have valid reasons for the things they do and the way they act. Even things that seem like irrational behavior or even outright bashing from the outside are explained and make sense.

It's a fantastic fic and you should definitely give it a try.

Definitely agree. I'm also really happy we're starting to see Harry fail more and Jim/Rom succeed more (to balance out year 1).

I wanna see where he takes Year 3 though. I have no idea what the plot is gonna be at all, and that's something that's scary and exciting at the same time.

****** Well we know from the first chapter that Harry is going to get Sirius's name cleared and get adopted into the Black family. The situation with Theo should get resolved from that as well.

Other than that anything is possible though. I'm really excited about how Harry's going to deal with Pettigrew. I really like him in this fic, not as a person obviously but his character is so much more interesting than the inept coward he's usually portrayed to be.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
