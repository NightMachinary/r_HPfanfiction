The events of Half-Life and the Seven Hour War canonically take place in the 1990s, at the same time as HP.

The Combine are far more brutal even than Voldemort, draining Earth of all its natural resources and reducing humanity to a slave race.

They also (probably) have some sort of magic, as they put drugs in the water to make people forget their past lives before the Combine.

While I am skeptical about whether or not the Seven Hour War was actually only seven hours long(Since I'm pretty sure Earth put up a decent fight), the whole point of HL2 is that Earth has been smashed and demoralized, with only Gordon and the Resistance remaining free from Combine rule.

I'd love to hear some ideas from you all. I personally think this could work. Imagine it! Gordon Freeman and Death Eaters tearing Civil Protection a new one!

EDIT: I think an explanation for why the Wizards were also defeated is the portal storm the Combine arrive through. Lord only knows what kind of abominations that storm brought to Earth.
