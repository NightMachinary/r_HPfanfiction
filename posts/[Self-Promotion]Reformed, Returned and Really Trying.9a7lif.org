It is set in an alternate Universe. A number of canon events didn't happen or happened differently. The society of Wizarding Britain is a bit different and a number of characters will act differently as well.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. Now, if only everyone else would realise this...

********* I like most smart, tough female characters. It's just that in Harry Potter, Hermione is pretty much the only major character of that type, with Ginny and - maybe - Tonks a distant second and third. Everyone else is either a useless adult most of the time (McGonagall, Mrs Weasley) or simply useless (most witches in Harry's year), doesn't fit the type (Luna). or doesn't feature in any role other than cameo (Sprout, Hestia, Bones, and the named OCs like Daphne, Tracey etc.).

Compare it to Buffy: We've got all of the Slayers for the tough action girl part, and Willow for the smart part, but everyone else also fights when called upon - Tara, Cordelia and Anyka, for example. Even Dawn has a scrappy role. Harry Potter has a single female character if you want a canon heroine. And some people do their utmost to tear her down because a girl is a Mary Sue as soon as she doesn't need a male hero to save her.

I noticed the same thing. Heavens forbid you write a scene where Harry gets saved by a girl instead of fighting his way out, even when he had a wand pointed directly at his back and the opposition already demonstrated their liberal use of Unforgivables. So keep up the good work, even if I won't be a reader.

Ugh. Don't remind me. You'd have to intentionally ignore Hermione's main character arc in the first few books to write her like that. Her development in that regard is so blatant and not the least bit subtle.

Makes me realize, If Ron had similarly consistent development in regards to his negative traits, I'd probably like him and would consider him a much more interesting character (from a literary perspective). Sadly for Ron the moral of the story is that you don't have to change at all and just stick to your guns. Just imagine if Hermione would have entered one of the earlier DH scenes with frizzy hair and bucktooth and yelled at everyone that they can't just leave school and need to think about their careers like they are supposed to. Instead she is one of the driving forces behind the Horcrux Hunt and organizes most of their stay away from school, which is about as 180 in terms of character as you can get. Ron, by the final book, should have been someone who mocks and laughs at people who are petty, insecure and jealous, just from a literary structure perspective.

The more I think about this stuff the clearer I understand why Hermione works for me and why Ron totally falls flat in every regard.

************* Yeah, that's my biggest gripe with his arc as well since it basically says that you can will be successful doing stuff which would fail you in real life 95 times out of 100. Pretty much the same thing that ruined the Ginny romance and her character in HBP.

Hell, Rowling admitted that Hermione only ended up with Ron since it was her own wish fulfillment while still pining after her ex (which explains the Tonks/Lupin "romance" as well).

Yeah, her comments on that kind of stuff give interesting insights.

I think we talked before about how JKR places plot and narrative structure above her characters. She needed some kind of dramatic climax (low point), so she regressed Ron in terms of character development. Since she also didn't have the time to deal with it, needed them to work together and have a happy end she also decided to completely ignore (or make her characters ignore) that regression for the most part.

It's basically a matter of luck whether a character gets fucked over by her plotting: Hermione had probably the most luck (except for HBP, becase Harry needed to be isolated) and Harry probably the worst, but because he's the main character JKR always took the time to make him relatable and things that go wrong really not his fault. It's obvious that she loved him as her creation and always took care of him. When it comes to the side characters she completely derailed them to the point that many including myself consider someone who's supposed to be a beacon of light like Dumbledore to be borderline evil. Normally that shouldn't even happen... I'm not set out to hate fictional characters.

The "ten dark years" reveal could have been such an interesting turning point for Harry, making him realise that he needs to get his shit together because otherwise people will keep fucking him over because they have agendas of their own. Instead it's completely forgotten in book 6.

Like, Ron would still get a nice wife and children, we are not aiming to bash him, but he could have been a so much better character if his actions had consequences. Lupin could be a good example for a divorced father who still cares for his children and so on.

************* "Real flaws"? My characterisation of her has her having flaws - but not crippling flaws, which you probably think of as "real flaws".

The thing is, "real human flaws" usually aren't that big. Yes, people aren't perfect - but most people don't have crippling issues either. And as they age and gather experience, they tend to get a handle on their issues. I can buy a young teenager blurting out secrets and mouthing off to authority. I can't buy a twenty-year-old soldier doing so. I most certainly can't buy a twenty-five-year-old officer doing so. If the MC is a hero, then I expect the hero to be able and a functional character, at least - not some bundle of issues with hair-triggers that would get him banned from sensitive or important missions - or any service at all. So, give me realistic heroes who don't go "A challenge? Accepted!" no matter how suicidal it is but can actually judge a situation and risk. Who don't blow their temper at the slightest provocation no matter the situation. Basically, give me realistic people, not some min-maxed RPG characters with huge "Flaws" to pay for their great "Perks" or "Feats".

Not every Ace Marksman needs to be so inept with melee weapons that they'll cut themselves each time they pick up a knife.

And not every Hermione needs to be a bundle of issues that Harry has to save (in between angsting around and rushing into suicidal danger himself) because (contrary to canon) she still hasn't learned how to talk to people at age 16.

In canon, Hermione (and Harry, and also Ron, if not for the author fiat) managed to have a handle on their flaws in DH. It took a horcrux and a stupid "they can't get food, no matter what magic they have at their disposal, nya nya nya" author railroading to make them crack under pressure, but they pulled through. They didn't fail. They didn't break apart. Hermione didn't drive them up the wall with rules and lecturing. Harry didn't lead them into obvious traps.

In short, they were heroes who got shit done and weren't driven by their flaws into making stupid mistakes (apart from the aforementioned stupid railroading for Ron). And that's generally how I write them. A Ron who might be jealous, but doesn't act on that and remains the steadfast, brave friend he was in the first few books. A Harry who is brave, but not suicidally so, and who doesn't lose his temper at the slightest provocation. And a Hermione who doesn' drive off everyone by acting like a 12-year-old rule-fanatic but uses her near-genius level of intelligence, her ruthlessness and her urge to help others and change unjust systems.

In short, heroes.

**** Also, the AUness is far from immediately apparent... could you specify /which/ past events were different? (Or would that be a spoiler?)

In other notes, I love how you're doing Grindelwald, but I continue to be miffed any time someone refers to Nagini as "it". She's a /person/, Merlindammit. In the Parseltongued-world of /Harry Potter/ it should have been apparent to begin with, she behaves intelligently in the books to boot, and now there's her /Fantastic-Beasts/ backstory...

Funny how we ended up with very similar situations in our stories regarding Grindelwald: I also have a "really trying" reformed Grindelwald whose old followers don't believe he's reformed and (since /he/'s not broken out) they /try/ to spring him out and he doesn't want to. And they call him a Dark Lord to his endless annoyance.

Also, aren't you worried about starting a Grindelwald story now of all times, with /Crimes of Grindelwald/ on the way? I mean, they're bound to reveal or portray stuff about him that won't quite gel with what you're written. The same could go for Magical France, actually --- much as I like your "Duc d'Orléan" worldbuilding in this story and others, I'd be surprised if /CoG/ didn't off-handedly joss it with a mention of the French /Ministère de la Magie/ or something. And the movie will feature some of Grindelwald's underlings, we're told, so you might want to feature them in the story alongside your OCs, no?

***** I'm absolutely certain that whatever is revealed about Grindelwald in the movies will not gel with my own take on him. But I don't really care about canon world building when it conflicts with my own ideas. My take on Magical America, for example, has nothing in common with the version in Fantastic Beasts but is a mess. Dozens of enclaves founded by European radicals and malcontents on the East Coast, often at war with each other, a coalitition of Native Tribes in the mid-west hoping that the Europeans never unite and finish them off, and (Spanish) Magical California in the West and Magical Mexico in the South, both founded by Conquistadores before the Statute of Secrecy.

With regards to Nagini, I don't think Harry and Co would treat her like a person if they talk about killing her. It's a monster that almost killed Mr Weasley, not a person to them. (Like Slayers and Watchers in my Buffy stories always call vampires and other demons "it", not he/she - they don't consider them people and don't want to consider them people since that might interfere with their mission of killing them.)

With regards to the AUness, in this story, it's mostly a disclaimer that tells readers that if something differs from canon, it's not a mistake, but design. But basically, apart from the "usual differences" (there are no Unbreakable Vows, no time-turners, elves are much, much weaker and can't teleport, the Wizengamot is not just a court, but also a Parliament, the other countries of Magical Europe are even worse places for muggleborns) this Grindelwald was not just a friend, but a lover of Dumbledore and didn't meddle with muggle politics but gathered muggleborns under his banner of "wizards should rule, but all wizards are equal", and almost took over Magical Europe.

It'd actually be quite interesting to see a post-Hogwarts fic in which Minister Hermione has successfully introduced health and safety to Hogwarts, where the castle has been standardised, regulated, and made much more safe... but that very sanitisation is causing the magic of the castle to literally die.

Robbed of its mystique, romance and adventure, Hogwarts is becoming no more magical than a standard Muggle high school, and it no longer produces wizards of Dumbledore or Voldemort's calibre, but just churns out averagely competent wizards to live unfulfilling, mediocre lives as Ministry drones, civil servants to a nation in magical decline.

Of course, I don't think for a minute that canon Hermione would ever do such a thing to Hogwarts - she very much assimilates to the wizarding world, loves Hogwarts, and hated Umbridge's attempt to sanitise it in OotP. Yet there is this very common idea in the fandom that Hermione retains Muggle values and would want to finish Umbridge's job. So it'd be nice to see that actually addressed.

Who said anything about killing?

The idea that danger is good for kids is not unique to the wizarding world. The principle behind the design of playgrounds is to introduce children to danger, where falling on woodchips is supposed to hurt, but not result in lasting damage.

In the wizarding world, the children are significantly more durable than Muggles and, on top of that, have healing abilities that render all non-magical injuries a trifle that can be waved away with a single spell. Combine that with the fact that danger does seem to cause magic to flourish and you have two perfectly good reasons for a society to value children experiencing danger that would be lethal to Muggles, without it being reckless or absurd. It's just a different context resulting in different values.

It is, in fact, the goal. By learning about the consequences of taking risks in a relatively safe environment, children learn risk management skills. When you make the environment too safe, these skills atrophy, so playgrounds are designed to provide children with a suitable level of negative reinforcement for taking too great a risk.

There's a vast difference between making a playground too safe and letting kids risk their lives. The Hogwarts of the first few books, if taken seriously, isn't a place of safe adventures. Only an utter idiot would claim that taking a few kids into the Forbidden Forest at night, hunting a Unicorn murderer, is in any way, shape or form "appropriately dangerous" for kids, for example.

(Not to mention that it's the usual muggleborn bashing at work - "of course the dumb mudbloods won't be able to find the right measure of additional safety because they're dumb mudbloods.")

************ "Standardising" Hogwarts isn't really what I'm focused on. There are a few ways in which it could be improved, to be sure, but nothing so drastic as you seem to suggest (though I don't think even Umbridge staying in charge could have literally unmagicked the Castle; I think it mostly would just have kept trying to kill her forever, if anything; but that's owed to our different views of the magic system).

It's other issues in the Wizarding World that concern me more --- making access to knowledge of all kinds easier (I find it very concerning that we don't know of any wizarding public library, only the Hogwarts one and bookshops), publicize knowledge of the Afterlife, give better status to nonhuman sapients, try to terraform Mars and the Moon, and, eventually, repeal the Statute (after giving it much care and planning; I'm talking half a century's preparations) to allow Muggles to enjoy longer, happier lives.

In the end the resulting world would be just as weird to current Muggles as the Wizarding World is; but it'd be a different kind of weird that would be much more pleasant to live in for everyone.
