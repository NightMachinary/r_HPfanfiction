Don't think i've read a fic where this happens. Curious if there is one.

*** I read one with that idea. Since the blood had to be forcibly taken, Harry was like "Sure, take it." and Voldemort ended up all wrong.

*** Even were magical oaths such a thing, I doubt deep "life and death" magic could be fooled by such a transparent scheme. It would be like if Harry had known he would survive his sacrifice in DH but had confounded himself so that he still believed he would die. It would be attempting to game a system where a system does not exist. These types of magic are mystical not mechanical and they look beyond the immediately apparent.

In the words of JKR:

  It is important to state that I always saw these kinds of magic (the very deepest life and death issues) as essentially un-scientific; in other words, there is no “Elder Wand + Lily's Blood = Assured Survival” formula. What count, ultimately, are Harry and Voldemort's own choices.

**** Well to be fair this isn't about it being a magical vow, it's about willingly giving the blood. Maybe he wouldn't truly want to give Voldemort his blood, but if he realized it would hurt him... I'm fairly sure he would be willing to lose a bit of blood to hurt Voldemort. Whether there's some clause in the magic where it doesn't matter if it was willingly given if it was given to hurt the ritual user, I don't know, but I doubt it.

Of course, there's always the chance Wormtail's words were just there to obfuscate what ritual/potion they were actually using but hey-- Occam's razor.

*** I've seen that idea in fics so much and I think it's a really shallow thought. In none of these fics Harry actually wants to give Voldemort his blood, he just wants to mess up the Ritual. His blood is still forcibly taken from him, no matter what he says and if he made a vow along the lines like you suggest (yours is poorly worded) he would immediately fail the vow because he's lying.

***** Eh, it really depends how you think magic would define "forcibly taken". IMHO if you're put into a position where there's no other possible outcome than supplying your blood for the ritual, even though you don't actually want it, it is still being taken by force. The absence of bondage doesn't really have any impact. Similarly if you actually *do* want to give your blood, having yourself tied to a tombstone and yelling "No, please no!" will not suddenly validate the condition of "forcibly taken".

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!
