I am tired of people saying that Snape took points from Harry and disliked him because he was reckless because he endangered his life this making Snape's task hard. That Snape favoured Slytherins because the poor little misguided things used to face prejusice everywhere.

But to the best if my knowledge, Snape hated Harry Potter solely because he was the son if James Potter the person who married the woman he loved or claimed he loved. This was the sole reason added to the fact that he looked exactly like his father. And as for people saying that Harry was disrespectful, I shall remind you that from their first class it was Snape who started bullying him and Harry was perfectly respectful in his answers.

What is the definition of a bully? A bully is a person who takes pleasure in tormenting others who have no means to defend themselves. Yes James was a bully but Snape was a bigger bully. Snape used to bully children (an orphan and another child whose parents were tortured to insanity).

So my point is if Snape had his way, then Harry Potter would have been expelled from Hogwarts just for being the son of James Potter.
