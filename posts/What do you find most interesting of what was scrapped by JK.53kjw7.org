** Dean was supposed to play a bigger role. Originally it would be revealed that his dad was a wizard who died during the first war. His family didn't know so they thought he walked out on them. Eventually, it was left out in favor of Neville's story, which was more important to the central plot.

*** Not that it would have been the best move, but I was a bit surprised in the Deathly Hallows that there wasn't an awkward scene between Dean and Harry because of Ginny. I think the fact that they seemed cool with each other prevented a lot of fanfic writers from making that a plotline for post-Battle stories.

***** I believe Harry and Dean were both at shell cottage during DH, but I could be wrong. But you're also correct that there easily could have been a scene like that in HBP. They did share a dorm room.

****** By that time, they already went through hell and back together. It was Harry who saved Dean from certain torture and death. Furthermore, Dean had spend some time with Luna already and might fall for her at that moment; Harry, on the other hand, had also broken up with Ginny.

Their past 'misunderstanding' would appear utterly INSIGNIFICANT given the new circumstances.

******* Yeah, you're probably right, though I don't think there was any indication Dean had a thing for Luna. And not sure if he knew about Harry breaking up with Ginny. Did anyone? I do wonder how they spread the word about that, as it would be essential that people know they were no longer together.

With Harry's level of perception and his preoccupation with horcruxes, of course not.

But if you are using a little bit more logic, Dean and Luna falling for each other, at least temporarily, makes lots of sense.

** Hermione Puckle was going to be her original name! But I'm so glad she changed it.

Also glad that the Mr Granger finding Harry thing didn't go through. Even that idea sounds like bad fanfiction material. (I wonder if that being one of JK's original ideas, thankfully edited out, suggests more of JK's original ideas are very fanon-y? That would definitely go some way to explaining the insanity of Cursed Child - no good editor to rein some of her more unlikely or far-fetched ideas in?)

** Harry finds a door in the Department of Mysteries that won't open- in fact it melts his lockpicking knife given to him by Sirius. Dumbledore says that behind that door is Love, and in the same conversation he says that Harry's capacity for love is the power that Voldemort does not know. Yet Harry never returns to the door, and never gets it open.

I felt so let down that it wasn't part of the endgame somehow.

** I think the cousin of the Weasleys, Malfalda,was an interesting thing cut. She was supposed to play a role similar to Rita in that she would sneak around the school for info. But JKR thought that since she was a student, there was only so much she could do with her as a character. [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Mafalda]]

**** This is an issue I have with the series in general. The Malfoy, Longbottom and Potter families have thrived and lived wealthily in Wizarding Britain for centuries, but they all come down to one single scion born in 1980? I get that storytelling compels Harry to be alone, but there should be Longbottom and Malfoy cousins all over Hogwarts.

***** Harry, Neville, and Draco's parents were all young and married during the first war! Obviously neither Harry's nor Neville's parents can have more children, and Lucius Malfoy doesn't seem like a big family man. The Weasley's have a lot of children, but Ron is one of the youngest - most of his older brothers would have been born before the war even started in earnest.

****** Yes: but building a whole society where each family has exactly /one/ live branch starts to get improbable. E.g. Harry is the last of the Potters, Neville and Gran are the only Longbottoms, Lucius, Draco and Narcissa are the only Malfoys... nobody had any brothers or sisters or cousins, for generations down the line?

** The only scrapped idea that I can think of off the top of my head is the Death Eater Pyrites.

/"Other drafts included a character by the name of 'Pyrites', whose name means 'fool's gold'. He was a servant of Voldemort's and was meeting Sirius in front of the Potters' house. Pyrites, too, had to be discarded, though I quite liked him as a character; he was a dandy and wore white silk gloves, which I thought I might stain artistically with blood from time to time."/

Unrelated, but pages (and questions) like this make my heart so happy that there are other people who desperately crave more information about Hogwarts and the magical community despite it being out of a book.
