I can't remember the name of this fic. Harry was fifteen I think and lived in an apartment by himself, he had a tattoo on his back, he's bi and he had some kind of snake in the apartment that he kept as a friend and not an actual pet. He gets found by the Order and Dumbledore, Remus and Sirius visit him in his apartment.
