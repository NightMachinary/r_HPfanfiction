You know the type. The Harry that has a near-death experience, or is told too much by the Sorting Hat, or comes back in time; the first thing he does is invoke so-and-so ancient rules, demand X concessions from X people, summon Amelia Bones or Fudge from whatever thing they're doing at the moment, using threats of legal sanctions or lawsuits or boom sudden secret magical contract to bully the dissident (usually Snape or Dumbledore) into backing down.

They show up in half the 'Harry inherits everything and has secret powers and stuff' fics out there, usually in the first or second chapter.

But...does anyone know any fics, where this demanding, threatening, inheritance-collecting treaty-and-contract-exploiting Harry is deconstructed? People refuse to be intimidated, invoked treaties and contracts are challenged in the Wizengamot, the designated bash-ee or someone sympathetic to them retaliates...?


** I don't know why someone would write a fic like that. Like, lets make this huge wish-fulfillment novel but haha nevermind, Harry sucks at life. What would be the point of that kind of fic? Also, I don't think 'deconstructed' works in the context of your sentence

*** In normal fics, Harry has this special ability to invoke laws and money and family debts, and this makes him super powered.

In OP's suggestion, Harry has this ability, and everyone else does too, so it's a different type of conflict, and Harry has to be both clever and skilled to get ahead. It's an actual conflict, not just a Gordian knot remover.

Well, I was just looking at the first chapter of Ah, Screw It a couple of days ago, which I didn't like, but I realised I've seen its particular brand of 'Harry immediately starts making demands and forcing all kinds of changes' before.

So, I figure that whoever would write this, would be doing a parody of those stories.

**** I'd read that.

"Under the blanket term of such-and-so, I hereby invoke the rule of-"

Dumbledore holds up his hand, a sad glint in his eyes. "Harry," he says, sounding gravely disappointed in him. "Minors can't invoke laws and treaties and contracts."

  It's the classic Dark Harry fic... or not. When the hero refuses the call, it's up the Spares, the Unchosen ones, to be the heroes. Insane!Harry, Nuanced Dumbledore and Snape, Nuanced Dursleys. World's first Bashfail!fic (to my knowledge), Harry tries to bash and faces slightly more realistic results for it than having everything fall into his lap. Originally written while angry

  My take on the manipulative Dumbledore stories - from Dumbledore's point of view. Written late at night, not proof-read. Will probably go over it later, if people think it's worth a tidy-up.
