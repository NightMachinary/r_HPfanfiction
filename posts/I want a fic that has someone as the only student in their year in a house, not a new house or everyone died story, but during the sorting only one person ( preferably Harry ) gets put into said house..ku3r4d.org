Kind of like the end of seventh horcrux with rose weasley.


** There was one I remember where Harry's daughter was the only student in Slytherin because the Hat raised the standard for Slytherin students after the war.

I shall search for it

Edit: many have said that I'm a doddering old fool (my words) who confused a fic for the fic that the OP had read. Now I don't remember ever reading Seventh Horcrux. But I took a look and that epilogue looks mighty familiar. So I apologize to OP as I have failed to find a story that fits his requirements.

The rest of you should remove my ill gotten upvotes as punishment. Or something.

** Yeah, I did find it unlikely that every generation could be split up quite evenly into each house. Makes you consider the possibility that the hat is just announcing, and the sorting itself happens beforehand by the staff. It would explain why the same-politics-parents' kids end up in the same house regardless of their qualities.

As for the request itself, I've got nothing for you, sorry.

*** You also have to remember that the point of the "house system" isn't to categorize an 11-year old's entire life based on their personality traits at that age. It's to figure out where they sleep at a boarding school, who they take classes with, and what teams they're on for pep rallies and class rivalries. So you can definitely do an AU with the idea and play around with it in fanfic, it could be a fun idea and Seventh Hocrux's take is obviously funny! And if someone wants to be in a specific house, they go there, and it generally works out to be even across the board. But IMO it's important to keep in mind that the house system is a thing that exists IRL that Rowling added magical elements to, not something unique to Hogwarts and spun from whole cloth that needs a purely magical explanation.

With your explanation, while it would make sense for some things, it would also mean that Sirius would've been forcibly sorted into Slytherin because the staff wouldn't have known ahead of time that he wouldn't want to be there.

Oh so true. Has there ever been something as true? Seriously, we're all judging people for life based on Houses. Like, what the hell, people? Are you seriously telling me that some 11 year old is like a little Hitler just because some damn hat said 'SLYTHERIN'?

***** I've always thought it might have something to do with more traditional aspects of education too. Like a student sorted into Slytherin is more susceptible to a type of teaching rewards or behavioral discipline than one sorted Hufflepuff.

  Slytherin House isn't what it used to be. There are barely enough children to fill a classroom, let alone a House Table, and the Quidditch captain is a muggle-born fourth year. For a new generation starting at Hogwarts as the war drifts into memory, there's far more to learn about the four Houses than they could ever have imagined (prequel to Snake Bites).

** Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus. It is one of my very favorite fanfics, has a fem!MOD!Harry and is a crackfic. The story does not initially focus on the single sorted house, but eventually the house comes to be part of the major storyline. It is an amazing story that I cannot recommend enough, with a very charismatic main character, some deeper philosophical/existential situations, and lots of fun magical moments. The author Carnivorous Muffin also has several spin-offs or AUs related to this story and I like all of their works.

** I'm not exactly sure what you meant, but try Reparo. Its a drarry fic(not on ao3 nor ffn or any of those, just search google) and is quite famous in our fandom. It's really good.

Basically, Harry tries to convince Draco to come back to Hogwarts and, you know, set shit right because no Slytherins came back.

It doesn't exactly fit, but its good either way. Just a bit outside of the lines. I don't read many like this, or if I did, I don't fully understand what you are asking for.

I want a fic that has a character be sorted into a house and be the only one sorted into that house , so my example was the seventh horcrux, in which rose weasley is the first person sorted into slytherin since Harry became the dada teacher, so she's the only one in her house.

**** yea, I don't read fics like that. The only ones I read where anyone is resorted(also happens in reparo, actually) is Dreams of Horses in which they're resorted into Hufflepuff. Although that's very different. That and the rewrites of the books(a la Sacrifices Arc) where he's in a different House.
