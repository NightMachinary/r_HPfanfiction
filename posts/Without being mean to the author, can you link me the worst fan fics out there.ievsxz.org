(Yes I know about my immortal, that's to easy)


** There are many fanfics on FFN that are terrible because they are written by inexperienced children and young teens or even adults. My immortal is an example. Just scroll down the page and find one with an attrociously written summary.

If you are asking about fanfics that get memed and hated on by this community, I see a lot of shade thrown at Dodging Prison and Stealing Withes and For the Love of Magic.

*** Well, whatever your subjective tastes, DPaSW gets flak for its demeaning and objectifying treatment of women. I haven't read it myself, and don't intend to for that reason; whether or not I would find it funny, I don't /want/ to laugh at that kind of thing.

**** I don't know, I didn't hate it myself. It had its issues, definitely. In canon, you assume that most of the offscreen characters survived the Battle of Hogwarts, but here, they probably died. Gruesomely.

It wasn't my favourite by any means, but I wouldn't have put it on a "worst fics" list.

*** Oh my god thank you. I've seen so many people loving HPMOR, so I decided to try to hunt it down and read it, the reviews I've seen have np been amazing. I finally found it, and realized I've already tried reading it once and stopped because I hated it so much. Harry was so unlikable, and as far as I made it, it seemed like the author's sole purpose was to tear down everything we all love about the wizarding world. Ugh

*** My theory is that people confuse the protagonist with the author; they dislike this Harry, and assume that he's an author insert, so they're turned off the story. If you examine it more closely, though, you'll find that the story recognises that Harry is making mistakes, and repeatedly smacks him down for them, whether it's Neville putting him in his place for the prank on the train platform, or Professor Quirrell calling him out for his lack of ability to be humble or at least pretend to be humble when it's to his advantage, and making him "learn to lose", or the phoenix turning away when Harry delays accepting its call. The ending is Harry recognising that he's come within a hair's breadth of destroying the world, and all his vaunted rationality has merely given him the right words to describe his own idiotic fumblings, and that he has a looong way to go to become the sort of person who actually makes the right choices.

** Not the worst fic out there, but certainly the worst one I've read recently: linkffn(simple words). It turns everybody into a caricature to bash them, presupposes that people neither grow nor change as they get older, and throws in an "oh, by the way, Harry's a prince of England, has been knighted, and is even richer than he normally is in these sorts of stories." There's just no substance to it.
