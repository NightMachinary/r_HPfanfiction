Maybe Harry left the magical world and is forced back because Draco's kid killed Harry's Crupp or Lily Luna is kidnapped in Bulgaria so Harry has to tear shit up to get her back.

It doesn't have to be based on a movie but that's the general gist of what I'm looking for.


** I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I don't have any gold but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my granddaughter go now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you.

Doesn't really work for Harry, he's too rich but I tried. I hope you find this OP badass harry is a favorite of mine as well as Harry with skills as an Auror but they are in pretty short demand unfortunately.

**** Uh except for the fact the Potter vault was pretty substantial (gold piled to the ceiling) and this was just for school! they are descended from Fleamont Potter who made all these inventions. Additionally related to the Peverell brothers. And last but most important he inherited the black fortune! So uh dude is probably one of the wealthiest wizards in the world by a landslide.

***** But we don't really know how much Harry's fortune is worth relative to the rest of the wizarding world. Not to mention, it's never stated that the vault Harry sees in Philosopher's Stone is a vault 'just for school'. It could be--and probably is--his entire inheritance in there.

Anyway, say he's got fifty thousand Galleons in the Potter vault. Is that a lot? What can he buy with it? Is he rich or well-off? Canon never really outright says that Harry is crazy rich--the most we can confirm is that Harry is well-off. The only time we really get an idea of how much is in the Potter vault is when Harry sees it for the first time as an 11-year-old kid. Personally, I don't really trust his idea of what constitutes as a lot of money, considering he's just come into the wizarding world; he's a kid, meaning he's small and everything looks bigger to him than to us; and he's never exactly seen a whole bunch of gold coins before.

Second, the only thing Harry got from the Peverell brothers was the Deathly Hallows.

Finally, we have no idea how much is in the Black vault. Sirius withdrew money from the Black vault to buy Harry's Firebolt for him. How much money was even left after that transaction? Harry speculates in Prisoner of Azkaban that to buy the Firebolt, he'd likely have to empty his vault, so we know that the Firebolt is probably pretty expensive. We assume that Sirius is pretty rich, but the Firebolt might have put a sizeable dent in his fortune. We don't even know if the Blacks were that rich. I mean, why are a bunch of blood purists living in a Muggle neighbourhood? Unless they can't afford to move elsewhere. The only things of value they had in their home was old books and old silverware, which could be attributed to them hoarding the only valuable stuff they had left.

Maybe Harry is one of the wealthiest wizards in the world. But canon doesn't give us enough evidence to support that. JK Rowling barely gives us numbers, and she's admitted that Harry Potter's financial system is flawed because she didn't properly figure out the maths.

****** Sure we don't have the numbers but that wasn't my argument. You would consider the Malfoy's to be wealthy and the blacks equally if not more so. If you just consider the fact that Harry inherited the black fortune that alone makes him extremely wealthy. The fire bolt wouldn't have even dented the black fortune. I'm at work but I was almost certain the vault Harry saw was just for school. That means he would acquire the Potter at which to be fair we don't know the contents of. But my argument is more conceptual in that Harry comes from a long line of wealthy connected powerful families and therefore should be extremely wealthy. I appreciate your long post and I'll do some digging unless someone can shortcut to a write up on the Potter wealth. It is possible I've read more fan fics and can no longer separate cannon from fan fiction “cannon”.

That's better imo I was never a big fan of super rich Harry, I really don't like Mary Sue characters /cough/ /Rey/ /cough/ Harry kind of flirts with that at times. Like his wand just producing magic he's never done before, love shield etc. Mary Sue isn't the right word because he definitely doesn't learn things on the fly just that I guess he's very lucky.

******* There's no real indication that the Blacks are still wealthy. Between being one of Voldemort's sources of income and the sheer number of crazy members, it's possible that the fortune was pissed away a long time ago. The Blacks could essentially have been trading on their reputation for generations. It's also possible that the Potters are the same: They're a well known and well respected family, but not necessarily a wealthy one. The cottage at Godric's Hollow may have been the extent of their holdings, and Harry's vault may have been the sum total of their liquid wealth. It would even make sense that it was considerable if the goblins pay interest. Ten years of accrued interest would add up. Really, the idea that the Potters and Blacks were ridiculously rich is a fanon creation, like everyone being Lord this-or-that.

Harry looked at the book and said to him self "I had hope I would never have to use this" and reached his hand into what appeared to be a book but in actuality was a box with an expansion charm on it. As he did this Ron walked in the study " So Harry do we have a plan?"When Harry pulled out his hand from the book and turned to Ron with a small grin and a wond in his hand.

** It's not Harry Potter but it's still good enough to check out. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12339320/1/Long-Black-Road]] Its called Long Black Road, and it's a John Wick Mass Effect fan fiction. Does give you a bit of the fantasy element there. But it nails Johns character and it nails most of the Mass Effect world too. If you enjoy either (or especially both) and like action, I'd highly highly suggest looking this one up.

** Here's the closest thing I can think of, linkffn(6471922) Coming Back Late. It's unfortunately abandoned, but the best I can do.

The main bit is this. After Harry gets hit with the killing curse from Voldemort at the end of the 7th book in the Forbidden Forest, he doesn't come back until like an hour later where the battle continues, but Hermione kills Voldemort. Then Harry decides to leave the Wizarding world, faking his death. I forget the reason why he decides to come back, but I think it was like he got found out by someone and had to. Not a lot of fighting, but he's MoD and very powerful.

There might also be a couple fics that involve Harry going back in time or something where he's old and bad ass.
