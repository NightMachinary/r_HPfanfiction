Since ffn only lets you search for fics greater than 100k words, I decided to come here. I'm looking for a nice long fic to occupy me for a day or so.

No genderbending (unless there is a very. VERY good reason that has nothing to do with a pairing), no pottercest, nothing romance or angst driven/focused, crossovers are okay, but no non-magic AUs. Also no mpreg. Also no OC focus. Bashing, slash and OP Harry are okay. Thank you!


** On AO3 you can sort by word count, so you could try that out to find long fics.

Recs:

- Sacrifices arc.
- The Harveste Addams series (on ao3) is very good.
- I'm just going down my favorites list on FFN mobile right now looking at wordcount, so I don't really recall what these are about/how good they are but linkffn(9469064; 2816397; 3762636)
- linkffn(The Arithmancer)
- linkffn(5402147)

edit: formatting

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** Not angst or romance focused, but there is a Hermione/Sirius pairing in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1124404][One Hundred Sixty Nine]]. If you haven't read this, you need to read it. Even if you do not ship HG/SB (which I definitely didn't before this fic) you need to read this. It is mostly a time travel fic and the pairing is not the main focus of the story. The time travel is sooooo well written, the characters are really well done and the plot is amazing. Honestly, this is one of my favorite fics ever - it really stayed with me! I would recommend this to anyone. Do not be intimidated by the word count (but for me, that made this fic all the more attractive because I love a long and well-written fic!). linkao3(1124404)

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.
