This is a thread for all you Ron Weasley haters out there.

I am looking for Fics where Ron has been killed off by the author, with some pretty obscure ways preferred, but not required.

If possible then I would appreciate if those Fics have a bit of Harry/Hermione in it but again I don't mind if Harry is paired with someone else.

  Just before the final battle, Harry asks Ron to make sure he takes care of Ginny such that she never has to worry about the basics of life if he should die in battle. Ron thinks that's a good idea and asks Harry to do the same... see top of story

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

***** On paper there is no difference, but I say that harmony is a perfect harry that everyone loves, and is super powerful, and dates a gorgeous hermione who just happens to look like Emma Watson, becomes powerful also and loses all negative traits and they go about ruling the world though political power and Lordships.

People don't like harmony and it stains the whole ship cause they can work well together

**** Ron is not a problem. Ron only can be seen as a problem if, for some weird reason, people think that they need to get rid of him to have Hermione fall for someone else. But why would that be a case? I've written several Harry/Hermione stories without bashing Ron at all. Sometimes, he simply isn't into her, sometimes he realises he doesn't love her. But he's always a good guy, a strong friend, and usually a hero too.
