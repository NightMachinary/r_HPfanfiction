e.g. in heaven or the afterlive (optional: he still goes to Hogwarts and/or can switch from afterlife to "real"world)

Please no Slash, Bashing is ok, smut/romance also as long as it starts when Harry is a teenager or older.

Thanks in Advance

Quite a horrible story by Kinsfire, but then I'm being redundant.

  Two parents need to protect their baby and use Dark Magic. But the ritual has a negative effect and their daughter's deadly touch cannot be broken without her soulmate. When they are killed, they watch over her as she grows. But she can see them and others as well. And when Death comes along, he becomes her uncle. How will Hogwarts handle the young necromancer? Will the dead help?
