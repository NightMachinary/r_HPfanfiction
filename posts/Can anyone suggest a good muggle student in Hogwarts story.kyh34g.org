I don't really care if the reason a muggle in Hogwarts is "just cos." I just want a story with an intelligent muggle who tries to be equal to his/her/their magical classmates, while dealing with people who think they don't deserve to go to that school. Because duh, they're a muggle."

I'm not expecting any logic here. I just want what I want.

Not sure if "what's that fic" applies?

Edit: Changed flair


** I don't know how you feel about self promotions but mine starts out like this.

*** I think it's normal to self-promote your own story when it's relevant to my request. :)

I'd be missing out on a suggestion, if you didn't.

** Not a muggle, but a squib.

*** Sorry for giving such narrow parameters by saying "muggle." Thank you for ignoring those parameters because what I meant was a non-magical person dealing with a magical world and magical classes and magical friends.

Squib, muggle, witch/wizard who lost their magic and don't want to leave Hogwarts because their friends are there. Honestly just anything and everything, as long as MC is non-magical.

It would be nice to have the "wake up as magical" cliche turned on it's head.

  littlebastardreviews posted the collected facts from the 2014 UK Editions of Harry Potter: and this fact caught my eye. 'Only one non-magical person has ever managed to get as far as the Hogwarts Sorting Hat before being exposed as a Squib.' But, gosh it just makes me want a story where a squib did make it through. So here's a drabble about a squib with a quick mind and a hand-me-down wand, who refuses to be denied her birthright. -- when the hat drops over her eyes it asks, 'well what do we have here?' she's got a forged hogwarts letter with penmanship that's perfect down to the ink splatter; she's got a complicated string of owls, only half of them forged, from parents to administration to ministry that's so complicated her name ended up on the first year roll call anyway. she's got ten arguments, four pleas, and one smothered threat on the tip of her mental tongue for why the house that comes out of this hat's brim better not be 'squib' she's got a lighter up her sleeve and an eight and a half inch wand in her belt that will never, ever work for her. 'well,' says the hat, 'better be slytherin then'

And request is "Dear redditors, please write a story for me."

  Let's get something clear... I'm a Muggle, I was born a Muggle and I'll die a Muggle.But that doesn't change the fact that somehow I have magic and am attending Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizadry.I've read all the Harry Potter books and seen the movies and now I have to live in the Wizarding World. WIzards are idiots, complete and utter bloody idiots. Who's smart idea is it to use quills and parchment? What's with giving hormone ridden, pubescent, angst-driven teenagers a wand and teaching them how to use, then telling them don't cast hexes at each other? What about sending letters by owls? What if you live in a muggle area? Who thought up Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans? Vomit, earwax, really?
