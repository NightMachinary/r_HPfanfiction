** Are you sure the Goddess of Love was called Minerva? Because I don't recall coming across a story with the Goddess of Love being called that. I've seen Aphrodite, Venus, Hathor etc but not Minerva.

With that said however the story Harry Potter and Future's Past by DriftWood1965 features a Harry/Hermione Soul Bond, Time Travel (starting after the battle of hogwarts, and a Goddess of Love named Miranda.
