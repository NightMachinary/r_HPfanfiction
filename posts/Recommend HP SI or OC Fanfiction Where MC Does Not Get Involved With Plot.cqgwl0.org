I've been looking for some HP fanfiction where the MC doesn't interfere with the events surrounding Harry. I don't really care if it's SI, OC, etc. I'd just like to read about a unique storyline that happens from the shadows, or doesn't touch Harry's too much. It'd also be interesting if it totally derailed Harry's storyline without being caught out.

Thanks in advance.


** linkffn(Latet Anguis In Herba) and its sequel linkffn(Shade to Shade by Slide)

The story follows four Slytherins who are a year above Harry. They barely ever interact with the golden trio. Their plot doesn't derail Harry's.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  The sequel to 'Latet Anguis in Herba', set during HBP. The Slytherins return to Hogwarts under the shadow of the war and their own demons. But with the wizarding world embroiled in conflict, how are they supposed to cope with their seventh and final year? MASSIVELY RE-EDITED.

** Sounds like linkffn(what's her name in hufflepuff). The main character tries but kind of fails in making various changes and ends up screwing up some major events by accident. She never becomes friends with Ron or Harry and the plot is original and canon rehash scene free.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** Just an FYI, this would be a Request thread. You are /requesting/ stories that fit the parameters you've outlined above. I went ahead and fixed the flair for you.

Recommendation flair is when you have a story you want to recommend to others.

  What's a nice Jewish boy like Anthony doing at Hogwarts? Well, for starters, his name isn't really Anthony. Winner of the Fanfiction Booker's Prize 2014. Year One complete.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*
