:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
there was a fic I read that more or less followed DH but Harry was basically destroyed trying to get rid of the horcruxes. There was a scene where he went to a magical castle in a hidden world to recover for a bit. Then he was killed and was a ghost and everyone was there to convince him to come back to life. It was a good read and I enjoyed it and want to share but didn't bookmark it. Please help me find


** Change the flair to What's that fic.
