Hey guys.\\
Send me the best fics with Harry paired with a female Elf.\\
She can be a High Elf, Dark Elf, Forest Elf, does't matter as long ad you don't send me some weird shit with a house elf.\\
Crossovers are okay and it would be great if is a Lord of the Rings crossover.\\
No Fem Harry.\\
Also don't send me anything with him paired with Arya from Inheritance. (Srry i just can't see her with someone that is't Eragon, after 4 books those two really growed on me)\\
No Harem.

  There walks in Middle Earth a powerful warlock of great magical skill, wrathful in battle. He walks in the company of a second, a sorceress, vengeful in her spellcraft. Ere the battle looms, and the End of All Things should they not prevail. Meanwhile in the county of Surrey, a teacher seeks a missing student, who is more than miles away.

  With basilisk venom and phoenix tears within him, Harry's body, spirit and magic is transformed and his lifespan is greatly increased. So, when given the chance to go to another universe where he would be able to grow in peace with other immortals around him, Harry accepts it, and finds himself near Rivendell at the start of the Third Age of Arda.

*** It is extraordinarily shitty. Why in god's name do authors have to consistently make things weird, if only just on the other side of non-jarring? The first chapter of this has concepts and things that occupy some sort of uncanny valley, they don't entirely break disbelief but I had to look up and reflect on what I just read more than once.

Like, the first chapter has

Magical stasis. Alright, yeah, I can get behind that, it's probably a pocket realm that-

"It required us to be intimate the entire time"

Fucks sake. Why? Why this? Why make it weirdly sexual?

Or the whole thing where he keeps calling a partner "a mate". The fuck? That's not exactly a word all too applicable to humans.

I want to like this premise, but the constant weird sexuality is incredibly jarring and distracting. I don't know why so many fics are like that.

  A version of Harry Potter from a universe with advanced technology ends up in Middle Earth during the events of the Hobbit movies. He joins up with Thorin's Company and fights evil. He's powerful and is attracted to females. Everything Changes. Harry/Tauriel Pairing. Immortal-Harry. Super-Powerful-Harry. Very Sci-Fi mixed with Fantasy. Not Cannon Compliant. Spoilers within.
