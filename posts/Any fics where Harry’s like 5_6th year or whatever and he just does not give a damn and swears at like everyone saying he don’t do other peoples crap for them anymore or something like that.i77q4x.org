I mean I read a few short ones when he was younger and just didn't give a damn and was like cheeky/sassy/whatever But I wanna read a longer one where Harry just completely flips and swears at absolutely everyone and dude doesn't do crap for people because if they can't do it themselves they ain't getting it done at all or whatever?
