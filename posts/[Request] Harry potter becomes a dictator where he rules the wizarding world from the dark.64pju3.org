Harry potter becomes a dictator where he rules the wizarding world from the dark while pretending to be a great minister of magic.The story is a flashback maybe? told through his son giving a retirement speech at one point he appointed sirius as head judge or something?


** Ooh, was this the fic where he adopted all his children because he thought a wife would eventually betray him, and he manipulated his voting numbers to always stay around 60%?

I don't remember what it's called, but I think it's either an epilogue to a short story or a oneshot.

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years

**** Ravenclaw Harry who values everything based on merit has no interaction beyond Pettigrew/Scabbers scene.

Hermione is a friend but too naive and worships Dumbledore too much for Harry's plans.

**** I kinda of forget, didn't read it for a long time. But I'm pretty sure Ron is not Harry's friend and Hermione is, unfortunately, a friend, like 90% of the fics.

***** Hermione is indeed a friend in that fic. She's /such a good friend/ that her name is mentioned a full eighteen times, almost all of them in two consecutive scenes (library-researching, and then Pettigrew-capture). By contrast, the name 'Harry' is mentioned over 500 times.

********* Let's do this in detail:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione is indeed a friend in that fic.
#+end_quote

As we both said, Hermione is a friend.

#+begin_quote
  She's /such a good friend/ that her name is mentioned a full eighteen times,
#+end_quote

Here, the sarcasm occurs. Note the use of italics in the original (lost in the quotation formatting if you use subreddit formatting here) to emphasise the incorrectness-for-humour.

#+begin_quote
  almost all of them in two consecutive scenes (library-researching, and then Pettigrew-capture). By contrast, the name 'Harry' is mentioned over 500 times.
#+end_quote

Supporting information for the above.

********** I never said you didn't use sarcasm, I'm saying you don't know when to use it. If I had said that Hermione is a good friend, your sarcasm would have been good. Because I only said friend, and never good, your sarcasm is wrong.

*********** OK. We're operating at different levels here. I intended to make the point that Harry has minimal classmate-interaction screentime, and should've included stats on another one of Harry's classmates to make that more obvious.
