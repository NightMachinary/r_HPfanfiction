** Well, it's way too short to form any meaningful opinion: Draco has a bad dream so he cuddles with his sister... OK? Obviously it's just the prologue, so you want to "keep your cards close to your chest", but this is way too little. The story might be interesting to you because you've planned it all in your head, but I as a reader can't gleam any of it to get /hooked/ beyond a mild sibling interaction.
