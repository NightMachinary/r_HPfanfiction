Looking for stories that deals with the characters trying to move on after the war, I hate how several of them pass months after the war when everything is better, I don't want that.

I want the characters realistically reacting to things after the war, trying to move on, the would be students trying to figure out of they should go back to Hogwarts, go to work or take a year off or whatever.

Seeing interviews being done, seeing the characters help rebuild Hogwarts. Seeing the characters like Lavender who were injured, how they deal with the after affects and stuff like that.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Can be as Canon or AU for the after affects of the battle as possible (so for instance if say Remus or Tonks ends up surviving and have to live with the fact that their love is dead or whatever that's fine). (I know messed up, but just something I want to read).

Anyone can be the main character not just Harry.

No Character Bashing.

** Depicting PTSD after Battle of Hogwarts was common in fics, but only a few of them did it to my liking:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/][Cauterize]], linkffn(4152700), expresses it brilliantly in only 1600 words.

In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), they made their enemies pay.
