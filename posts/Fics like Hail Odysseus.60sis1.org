I'm reading and loving linkffn(Hail Odysseus by Brennus).

I think the thing I enjoy the most is the relationship between Harry and Ginny (I don't mean "romantic" relationship itself, I just mean the relationship in general). How they meet, how they act, etc.

Of course, I also like how badass Harry is, and his minor mind games he plays with his enemies sometimes.

Any recommendations for fics like Hail Odysseus, or that at least have features similar to these that I've written?

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.
