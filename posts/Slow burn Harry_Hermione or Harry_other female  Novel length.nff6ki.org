Anyone have suggestions for popular slow burns with Harry being the main character and a FEMALE character as his romantic pair? (no slash for the love of God!) if you have some good ones, I'd like some novel lengths like 150k+ words. It doesn't necessarily have to be HHr, I'd like other females like tonks, fleur, ginny and Luna too. Thanks!
