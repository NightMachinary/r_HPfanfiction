There seems to be an abundance of Dark!Harry fics where he gets along with Bellatrix, but I haven't seen a lot of stories that made her good.

I've read "Delenda Est", but it's kinda overrated and Bellatrix in that story seems more like an OC. I've also read "Time Heals All Wounds", which probably has the best young!Bellatrix I've ever read (at least in the first half of the story), but [[/spoiler][it turns out to be a nihilistic pseudo-tragedy in which she still becomes a sadistic bitch, oh and of course Hermione still totally luuuuvs the insane killer, blech]].

Anything else that I've missed?


** She is de aged and memory wiped in the Harry-times-travels-into-Lockhart story (I think it's amalgam?)

Also the Bellatrix/Sirius that originated right here on Reddit: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BqLg73bGddxhB3hzzIUKr4XTfDkY69NH8PlWb_fJvb8/mobilebasic]]

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

** Well not a lot of fics exist featuring her redemption, mainly because she was a complete psychopath - and that was before she went to Azkaban.

To even think about a redemption arc with her, you've got to start pretty early age-wise, sixteen would be the upper limit, at my guess.

So, apart from Delenta Est, there's only linkffn(8378840). It's mostly mediocre, with probably a third of the story being needless, but it does hit some points well.

Yeah I realize that. I probably should have explained better, but I guess the basic idea of "Time Heals all Wounds" sorta stuck with me. I think Bellatrix could be really interesting if her 'obsessions' could be channelled in a different direction. The idea that Voldemort could 'prey' on someone like her and mould her into the perfect killer intrigues me and makes me wonder where she could have gone under a different Mentor.
