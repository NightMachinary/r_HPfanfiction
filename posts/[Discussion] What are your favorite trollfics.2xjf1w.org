***** I found it mildly funny for quite a while, but by the mid-40s, i would have stuck my testicles in a blender if it stopped the pain.

** One of my favorites is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3278890/1/Harmony-Hippogriff-at-Hogwarts][Harmony Hippogriff at Hogwarts]]. It features an American transfer student who saves an enthralled Harry from Ginny and sets him up with Hermione. They fight an American villain with nipple rings and leather pants. I think Ron died in a mountain of poop before the story started.

10/10 would recommend

*** I lost it after the first sentence :

It was seventh year, after the defeat of Voldemort. Everyone had come back and things were normal again except Ron was dead but no one really care about that.

Thanks for recommending this fic, it's awesome.

***** yeah its a pretty boring ship tbh. There really isn't an interesting dynamic to it and there isn't much canonically to support it so writers just start bashing and make Harry and Hermione into Martin and Mary Sues to try to get them together. At that point, the fic has pretty much jump the shark and is only meant to be enjoyable to H/Hr fans instead of all the fandom.

*** Well, there are words and many of them are even real. They also have sentences and paragraphs. I have no idea what's going on. I do like "Severus Snapplebottom" though!

** I just found this one: [[https://fanfiction.net/s/4352965/1/Resurrection-Potion-for-Voldemort]]

Edit: Aside from the ending, I suppose it's just more of a crack fic. Still a fun, short read regardless.
