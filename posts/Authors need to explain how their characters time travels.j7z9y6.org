I've read a ton of time travel or reincarnation fics and one thing that bothers me is the fact that the authors never explain the mechanics or reason as to why their character was able to time travel in the first place.

For instance, Harry or Hermione being reincarnated in the Marauders era. Most authors never explain this in a realistic manner that fits the boundries of wizarding world. They usually take the lazy wrote of saying the "fates" or death decided to reincarnate them.

If Harry and Hermione can do it, what's stopping other characters from also reincarnating?

In the case of time turners, what has been stopping other characters from using time turners to change their futures?


** So the issue is. You want something that can't be explained fully , explained fully.... There's no cannon way to go back in time besides the time Turner and that's for a few hours... So to your "if x can do it everyone should do it" why doesn't Voldemort ever use a timeturner?

So if people want to say the Gods step in then fine( Harry Potter and the wastelands of time is great) if they want to say it's the veil, good if they want to say it's a ritual good, if they don't want to touch it at all just say an explosion (wind shear is great) .... It happens it's a plot device to get a character to a time you want them be

*** Honestly I would rather skip the explanation they generally go the same way.

get to the meat of the story.

Its like how in every self insert story on space battles there is a chapter with them talking to the god who sends then into the self insert

its like come on, its been done lets move on

*** I don't think he is complaining about the what, he seems okay with authors using any mean they want. He is just asking for them to explain how they got there. Kind of against the character just waking up in the past in chapter 1

** I disagree with your opinion. IMO whenever author tries to explain why the mc time traveled, he is likely to mess up and the reason is something stupid.... Very rarely have I found an adequate reason for time travel to work, most involving a botched ritual and a time turner.

After a while this totally plausible reason would feel like a clich√© and thus bland, so please don't try and explain the reasons why.

In canon tons of shit happens to Harry which would be unbelievable otherwise but we never seem to question it, so let's continue doing so with this as well

*** "If they they try, it's gotta to be something stupid, so they should stop trying"

That's the worst excuse ever. If you apply that people wouldn't even write fanfics at all.

*** Voldemort wins is an adequate reason. I mean in Cursed Child, Delphine time travels to make Voldemort win, what's stopping Harry or any other character from doing the same?

And what are those? Cause if you go to the [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] you'll find tons of posts explaining things most readers don't get.

**** Firstly, how do you reference some1 else's words when you comment?

I think I'll begin my defense with harry surviving as a kid, Lily can't have been the first mother to have sacrificed herself for a child, or the first parent honestly. Yet it's harry who gains a ultimate hax in terms of protection.

In the mirror room quirrel who with a snap of his fingers can bind harry with ropes ultimately goes for grappling like a muggle quick kicks in said protection.

Harry being a parselmouth. And yes I've heard the explanation of the piece of soul in his scar, but I call bullshit... A genetic quirk cannot be influenced by spiritual event.

** I totally agree. People seeing as over explaining, but it is part of the plot. I do a bunch of time travel, and usually I go for the time turner. However, I try to explain how people got to the time turner and where did they ended and stuff like that... Some other times I use different things that make sense.

It is ground work but I am of the idea that it has to be done.

One reviewer once asked why I was writting 5 chaps before the actual time travel, that it was slow, that should have started with the guy in the past... IMO doing that would have been like JKR starting HP1 with Harry already at Hogwarts and explaining first chaps through flashbacks.
