Where harry/ main character has a sentient wand That will do spells for him, or not at all, can be a crack fix or serious one, I don't care as long as the wand is sentient. when I had the idea about I had to post it here!

  Are we gonna hex something now? No? How about now? No? Hmmm... now, maybe?

  I'd appreciate some quality time in my holster. Take a break... ah, who am I kidding? Curse! Hex! Jinx! Hee heeee...... this is what I live for!

  Well, since you asked, I would like to register a complaint. I want to kill a dragon. Right now. Go find one and kill it. That would be SO cool.
