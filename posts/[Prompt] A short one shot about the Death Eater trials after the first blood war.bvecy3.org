Just some stuff to prompt a story about Slytherin-ness, grey morals, politicking, family, and a way to help human-ify our favourite member of Slytherin house. After Harry. And Regalus. And Snape.

The young man stumbled into his chambers, tears streaming down his face. “Is it true?” He asked his wife, his voice cracking with pain, after a tearful embrace.

“I think so,” She whispered into his ear as she rocked him back and forth in her arms. “Tenebrosus Pater sent his message after He fell,”

The battle worn man, fresh from a round of torture, continued to sob into his wife's arms, and later that night they both celebrated their life in the most human way possible.

Later, but still too soon they were reminded of the war, and all its consequences. “What shall we do?” The mans wife asked, her face a mask of calm indifference. The man gave her a sideways glance but didn't say anything for a moment. Finally he answered.

“The ‘heroes of the light' will be here soon, everyone knows I was involved. I will simply have to tell the truth and hope they accept me,” The man looked up and placed a hand on his wife's shoulder, “I fear that this will not happen, already people have been found dead. ‘Drunk revelry' they call it, but the one time someone was punished was when their victim didn't have that curse staining their body. If I do not return, you must run. Run as far as you can so that you may care for our child. Promise me.”

“I promise,” She whispered, “What shall we name our child?”

“Dragon. For the school moto,”

When the man is brought before the Wizengamot his face shows his confidence, as does his walk, and his posture. But one man, who often operated under the pseudonym of ‘Tenebrosus Pater', could see something in his friend. Something even he couldn't point out, but no matter how small it still betrayed the fear he felt as he was charged with terrorism, and murder, and rape, and arson, and treason, and all manner of other crimes. His face didn't crack as the ‘most honourable' body ignored his plea of innocence.

“It is your fault,” They declare, “you should not have been in that position in the first place.”

And so the man is shipped off to prison. If it can even be called that. For truely it is not designed to house criminals, but to torture those one doesn't want sticking around. For three weeks the man sits in his cell, his mind poked and prodded, thrown around and shredded, and then he is free.

“I told you to run!” He rasped to his wife when she meets him at the shore.

“I couldn't, not with the knowledge that you were suffering in that horror house,”

“How did you free me?”

“I didn't, but a large number of officials in the ministry and Wizengamot will be receiving a grotesque amount of gold soon,”

And that just made things worse, it didn't matter that he was innocent, only that he could pay his way out of prison. But if that was how it was, then he would try his damn hardest to free as many innocents from the curse of the dementors, even if he had to buy his way there. A better future for his child awaited.

And six months later, his son was born, Draco Hadrianus Malfoy.

(I took a liberty with Draco's middle name, because I cannot find his cannon one.)


** Canon is Draco Lucius Malfoy
