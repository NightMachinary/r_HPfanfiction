:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I read this Harry/Daphne fanfic a while back and I'm trying to reread it. I can't find it nor do I remember it's name. It was about Harry being a dark lord after his wife (Daphne) and his daughter were killed. Then he goes back in time with his best friend Dobby to save them. Please helpppppppp.


** It's Paid in Blood by zaterra02. It's also been deleted. If you search the name, I think someone posted an ePub download sometime in the past couple of weeks

This is what I found when I googled zaterra02, apparently you need to put .ws instead of .com for the story to come up .
