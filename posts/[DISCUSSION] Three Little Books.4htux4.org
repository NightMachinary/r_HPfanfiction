If you could pick three Muggle books - fiction or non-fiction, of any period on any subject by any writer you like - that would be distributed within the wizarding world and become as much part of common culture as Martin The Mad Muggle, what three books would you pick?

Would you throw them in for the lessons they could teach the wizarding world, for the discussions they might prompt, for the pure Hell of it?


** I'd go with Lord of the Flies, because the wizarding world definitely needs to learn about the darkness of man's heart and how societies can collapse.

George Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London, which I think is better than Animal Farm and 1984 (though wizards should probably read them too).

Oh, and Matilda. Would possibly help them empathise with Muggleborns a bit more.

** I'd thrown a book on spacetravel in there.

Then I'd add Star Wars in bookform

And for a last, I add a collected work of Asimov in there.

Then I hope and pray for spacewizards.

** /Everybody Poops/, to bridge that pure-blood/Muggle-born divide.

And, on a more serious note, David Hume's /A Treatise of Human Nature/.

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Luck_of_Barry_Lyndon][The Luck of Barry Lyndon]], because I don't think that the magical world would pick up on the 'unreliable narrator' and that could provide for some funny misunderstandings about Muggle culture.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Branches_of_the_Mabinogi][The Mabinogi]] because it could provide some interesting discussions in magical academic circles in the fields of magical history and Muggle studies.

And just for the hell of it, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watership_Down][Watership Down]] because I think children of all backgrounds would love a story about talking rabbits with their own culture.

**** Yes, but you have to go into the story knowing that the narrator isn't just unreliable... he makes Gilderoy Lockhart look humble.

I've never watched the film. Have you?

** /Macbeth/, a classic tale to teach Slytherins that maybe, just maybe, they should cool it with their ambition.

/A Scanner Darkly/, because it would be hilarious to see wizards and witches try to wrap their heads around dystopian sci-fi and drug culture. /Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?/ could be a suitable substitute, if not ASD.

/The Sun Also Rises/ would be great for the generation just coming out of the war with Voldemort, because of how it explores the themes of people coping with the trauma of war and living in a post-war society.

** For me, I'd probably throw in Les Miserables, for the way it comments on society, revolution and the split between the classes. Generally it's a book I think everyone should read, even wizards.

Then, Terry Pratchett's Soul Music. I think it brooks some interesting questions about the nature of magic, morality and death, and I'd quite like to see the wizarding world respond to not only a different idea of the magic they live with every day, but also a personification of death that's so much more flawed and almost human than the one they see in the Tale of The Three Brothers.

Then, for the Hell of it, Fifty Shades of Grey, because I just love the idea of it gaining the same cult popularity amongst Purebloods as it has among Muggles.
