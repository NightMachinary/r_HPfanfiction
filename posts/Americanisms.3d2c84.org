I'm curious about some Americanisms besides the obvious s --> z spelling and ou --> o that can be very easily spotted and attributed to an American author. Also excluding the well-known cookies, diapers, sidewalk, etc mishaps. Perhaps just some more vague ones that aren't usually brought up?

** Dressing gown= robe.

Jumper= hoodie.

Rubbish= trash but is also an expression I.e. ' That's rubbish'.

Motorway= highway

Pub= bar.

Tea (in some places, mostly further north)= dinner.

Shop= store.

Edit- Also, graduation is a very American thing. I doubt Hogwarts had one.

Edit again- In England you go on 'holiday' not vacation.

And you only go to the bathroom to bathe otherwise you 'use the toilet'.

Just a few randoms that came to mind :)

** Metric measurement is one. Every single book in the series uses feet, inches, miles, etc. That isn't done just for the U.S. editions, this is Bloomsbury as well. Harry's wand is eleven inches, Great Hangleton and Little Hangleton are 6 miles apart and Quidditch goals are fifty feet high. While centimeters, meters and kilometers aren't technically incorrect, they're just not what the books use and when so when I come across one, I'm reminded that I'm not reading the real thing.

**** It's worth pointing out that /real/ Britain is pretty schizo when it comes to units.

When you're travelling long distances you use miles. If you're travelling short distances you'll either use yards or meters (depending on age).

Heights of people and mountains are measured in feet (and inches) while similarly sized objects will be measured in meters, cm and mm (for example, a table or tall building). However some things are still measured in inches for historical reasons.

When cooking ounces and pounds are still relatively widespread though in recent years there has been more of a transition to metric.

Basically, I don't think a British Muggle would bat an eyelid at the use of imperial measures in wizarding society. It's already so muddled that I didn't notice anything strange when I was reading the books.

** One thing I haven't seen mentioned is that Hogwarts, like most, if not all, British schools, has three terms, not two semesters. There is a break at +Halloween+ Christmas, a mid-term break in February, and at Easter.

*Ninja Edit:* Another thing I forgot to mention is that end of year exams, apart from OWLs and NEWTs, hold very little importance. The third year exams might be more important as it's possible that they determine what OWLs you would be able to do, and the same goes for the fifth year exams. In recent years, coursework has an increasing amount of significance, but not when the Harry Potter books were written. Hermione worrying about the first year and second year exams so much is meant to be an indicator of how scholarly she is. This also explains why the school can get away with cancelling the exams at the end of the protagonists' second year, assuming that the older students were not included in this, as they wouldn't do their exams at the same time anyway.

A related thing is that I've never heard GCSE or A-Level subject choices be referred to as electives. Personally, I and all the people around me referred to them as just GCSEs or A-Levels, for example: "What GCSEs did you choose?" rather than "What electives did you choose?" This might just be a regional thing though, as Northern Ireland is a bit weird with regards to the UK education system, given that we still have grammar schools.

There's the rub. I was once reprimanded by a teacher for using "niggardly" in an essay. Should anybody have a problem with that word? No. Do some weird people take issue to its use? Oddly enough, yes. Sometimes it's just easier to avoid the conflict than educate a bonehead.

  Of course, offensive words from another dialect usually come out much less offensive. *With fag = cigarette still in common usage here in England, faggot = homosexual man is usually more slangy than offensive* (though, any slang name for a disparaged group is always going to be used for insults).

  fag -- standard slang for cigarette -- ‘Gie us a fag' (Glasgow), ‘Got a fag, mate' (London), and fag-end, also used figuratively -- ‘The fag-end of the day”. [[http://dialectblog.com/2012/12/14/the-spread-of-a-slur/][(Source)]]

** Do you think that you would necessarily need to use UK spelling? I mean, the story is set in the UK, sure, but unless I'm talking about what someone wrote a piece of paper (or parchment) does it matter if I use color instead of colour?
