** Respectfully disagree. I know fanon likes to portray Draco in a more sympathetic light much like Snape but the hard canon facts are that neither are very good people really.

Just coming from their origins Harry suffered dramatically more than Draco did from the time Voldemort killed his parents. There's a difference between growing up in a family that does bad things but still loves you (his mother directly betrayed Voldy for her son) as opposed to being an orphan who spent 10 years of his life bullied and unloved. On top of that Harry spent many portions of years slandered and hated by large portions of the school and wizarding word as a teenager and still played the hero.

The difference between Harry and Draco, is that Harry grew up neglected and unloved and still managed not to become a little asshole. Draco is a product of his upbringing while Harry grew beyond it into a sympathetic hero. Draco might have "suffered" more once Voldemort returned, but there is no indication that he was ever "suffering" before those years when he had to follow his families place in the war. Draco had 14+ years of his life being loved and coddled by his family before shit got real, Harry's life was a continual shit show.

** “If you ignore 80-60% of Harry's life, Draco suffered more”

Mate, what?

** Don't agree at all.

Even if you want to just ignore the Drusleys, Voldemort or the dementors, the deaths of his family and the people he saw dying; Harry still had it worse.

Harry had to deal with Snape's abuse throughout the years. He was ostracized and vilified in years 1, 2, 4 and 5. The smear campaigns run against him in year 4 and 5. The year spent on the run.

I think that settles it.

** Lol What are you talking about, even when Voldemort was back Harry still had it way tougher than Draco. Even Ron, Hermione and the secondary characters like Neville and Luna had it harder.
