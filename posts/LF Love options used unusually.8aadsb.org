This is somewhat related to the request for self-medication with love potions from a couple days ago, but a bit different.

Basically, I want stories where the love potion use isn't what we normally see. Maybe Ginny didn't know Molly was doing Harry. Maybe Molly was doing Ginny as well. Maybe it's a love potion backfiring somehow. Humorous fics and non-canon ships preferred, but anything that's not the normal Weasley-bashing/manipulative Dumbledore fare is fair game.

I'm sorry but that choice of words was sooo wrong.

*** I can't even... But given how the world of fanfiction is, I'm not surprised if this exists.

** [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/rhysenn/IP01.html][Irresistible Poison]] is Drarry, and the only love potion fic I've read that I've liked. Draco doesn't mean to brew a love potion - he thinks it's something totally different - and has to deal with the consequences when he takes it. The beautiful way that the author writes and the twist of how the love potion is dealt with I thought was inventive, and I /love/ how Lupin's classes intertwine with the plot. I also really enjoyed Harry & Hermione's friendship here, and Harry & Ron's friendship is also well done. I can never rec this fic enough - it is one of my very favorites.

** Like ferret!Boy using a love potion to get into Harrys boxers? Should fit all Drarry fics, as far as I know.

*** Nah, there are at least like 3 where Harry walks in on him +wanking+ reproducing and then can't get that image from his mind (I'd recommend thorough obliviation, just to be sure).
