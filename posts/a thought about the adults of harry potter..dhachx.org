I was watching a theory on one of my favorite tv show's as a kid " Courage the cowardly dog." where courage is a normal dog, and all his adventure's, monsters etc. are written based on the point of view of a dog.

​

Now this has me wondering how much of the adult's mistakes, bad traits, etc. were from the same thing with harry potter. Now i am not excusing people like Umbrigde. But other adult character's, how much of their story did we miss, how much did we take in from a child's eyes, and our own younger eyes.

​

an example. Harry and most fanon's always put Fudge in such a bad light, but what if he was just a decent politician and not a good or bad man, who was trying to hold together the country now 10 yrs after its worst dark lord ever, while dealing with political factions that are across the board.. demanding things. without the protection of some the real government positions offer.

​Harry views the Dursleys from a child's eyes, for sure. He's been so acculturated to his life with them that he never relates the concept of "child abuse" toward his own upbringing, let alone acknowledges himself as a victim of abuse, even though what he describes of his childhood with them ticks off the checklist.

However, he does wise up a bit over the years, or maybe this was the result of JKR darkening the tone of the series to fit the audience.

Book 1 Harry:

#+begin_quote
  "The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the humbugs and began to eat. It was all delicious."
#+end_quote

Book 7 Harry:

#+begin_quote
  "In the end they settled down for the night in a far-flung field belonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread.

  This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits; an empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry was the least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys'."
#+end_quote

The strange thing is how Harry undersells his mistreatment, but fanon takes it from the other side and amps it to eleven, where Fanon Dursleys will beat Harry black and blue every day and twice on Sundays, force him to get lower test scores than Dudley at school, and throw dinner scraps on the floor and make Harry eat them while laughing at him.

**** The thing about fanon is that it's usually based on canon, at least very loosely. The Evil Dumbledore trope came from years of manipulating everyone, keeping secrets, and never lost all traces of the "greater good" ideology that had inflamed him as a youth.

What changed was the power dynamic between Harry and the Dursleys. Harry went from being a burden on the Dursley family before Hogwarts, able to be kept quiet with a "Don't ask questions!" scolding, to after learning he had magic, being a source of fear. The Dursleys /did/ give Harry his own bedroom and started providing for his physical necessities after learning that Sirius Black, killer convict, was his godfather, and the Order members came around to check on him, but emotionally, they became more bitter and resentful with having him in their house.

****** They kept him in a cupboard for his entire childhood. That's very explicit in the books. Not open to interpretation. Also, the feelings of disdain or bitterness they have for Harry have no bearing on the fact that they deprived a child in their care of basic necessities. If they had been disdainful of him or avoided him while still giving him enough food and clothes his size and adequate medical care, people might've been able to sympathize with their discomfort with having a dangerous child in their household that they did not know how to deal with. Instead, they went out of their way to cause him active harm, and that's criminal behaviour.

****** You could also add in how a horcrux affects people. The Diary was essentially a leach, the locket was a bit of a mental terrorizer; we don't know enough about the other horcruxes effect on people to know if it was just these two, but why would it only be those two? I get the Diary, it was the biggest piece of Tom's soul. But the locket?

Taking that into account in this whole argument, how would a horcrux effect those around it if it was a part of something organic, something alive and with a complex mind? Nagini is the only other possible source for information on this and she wasn't one right from the start of the series. Not like Harry.

So, on top of the Dursley's negative emotions towards Harry, how much of it was aggrivated and made worse by the horcrux in Harry's scar?

How far would they have gone with their abuse if it wasn't there in the first place?

(And I'm fully aware of how this line of thinking could be completely wrong, but I had to point it out here.)

Yeah Harry could see through her eyes. Yeah she showed us Voldemort could posses her, and Harry, because of the horcrux. But the actual horcrux on people other than the host or Voldemort? We dont see her enough to be able to tell.

And Nagini wasnt one as long as Harry. She had his soul piece after she was fully grown, not when she was baby like Harry. How does that change Harry's situation in comparison to Nagini's similarities as a horcrix host?

As i also said, i could be completely wrong. I was just pointing out the possibility. The horcrux was important but how it affected people other than Voldemort brutalizing his own soul was a very vague concept Rowling didnt really explain to the readers.

But once Voldemort came back in some sense form, perhaps that was enough to erode the protection until he was having pain, visions, etc.

And once Voldiemort had Harry's blood, well... game on. He almost was able to possess Harry in the MoM atrium scene, if that didn't cause Voldemort quite a bit of caution.

And also also, in canon, only three things can harm a horcrux: basilisk venom, fiendfire and the killing curse. So by your logic, if the horcrux was strong enough to be affecting the people around it-therfore being the source of their hatred-wouldnt Harry be invulnerable to everything except the aforementioned weaknesses? Their treatment and all the injuries that Harry suffered as time went on wouldnt have affected him (except CoS and the killing curse at BoH).

Unless goodness is some sort of predetermined magic thing, rather than a result of upbringing. It's possible that he was always going to come out as good as he did regardless of what the Dursley family did to him. We can't just assume that the rules of our world apply to the magical world. In fact, they probably don't! This is a world where fate and souls literally exist, after all.

******** In real life, I would guess that people become evil because their circumstances teach them that evil works. I feel like that works in analyzing voldemort's actions, but doesn't seem to with harry. Of course, harry never quite learned to actively use his "accidental magic" (I hate that it's called that even when it's purposefully used, btw.) in the way that Voldemort did, so maybe he didn't have a chance to try out being evil to the dursleys.

When he first went to Hogwarts Ron and Hermione were generally nice to him, as well the other gryffindorgryffindors Iirc.

Till he threatened Dudley his first summer back, of course. And then soon after that a house elf ruined that for him.

Or maybe he was just born with a big heaping pile of love because reasons, and I'm overanalyzing the whole series and real life.

***** The adults dropped the ball on Halloween in book 1 and never picked it up again. No wait, they dropped it when they sent the "hero of the wizarding world" to live with a family of muggles without ever checking up on him, not even considering the possibility that someone who grew up with muggles might perhaps qualify for the same treatment as a muggleborn regarding their introduction to the wizarding world and not thousands of letters delivered to his house. And no, "why whould Dumbledore concern himself personally with Harry's upbringing, he has better things to do" does /not/ count. Dumbledore brought Harry to the Dursleys, probably against Wizarding laws regarding orphaned children, and thus was responsible for him. And disregarding that, Harry is a national treasure of the wizarding world and he is prophesied to be the only one who could defeat Voldemort, a prophecy that Dumbledore puts at least some stock in, and Dumbledore is not just the Headmaster of a school, he is also the leader of Wizarding Britain (responsible for Harry as he is something of a national treasure) and he is the leader of the resitance movement that Harry's parents were part of and for which they gave their life (responsible for Harry on a personal level).

I am not a fan of Manipulative Evil Dumbledore nor of Old Fool Dumbledore so the only interpretation of the character that I can get behind is a Utilitarian who will sacrifice a single child in order to save the Wizarding World. Which is not something I could judge him for, there is no question in my mind that the well-being of a single person (or a bunch of people) is less important than the survival of the whole society. And that he makes some mistakes along the way is just human.

Sorry for the rant, and I think I am not disagreeing with you except that I think it started way earlier.

Also, yes I know that the tone changed between the first and last book etc but there is just no way to not interpret what happens in the first books within the context of the rest of the series without some serious SoD-breaking disconnect.

******* It does get tedious to read (sometimes good, sometimes ridiculous) justifications for canon adult actions in every other fic, but on the other hand it annoys me when fanfics introduce themselves as "what if X happened" or "what if Harry was dark/independent/whatever" and then it turns out they actually mean "... and also the entire world is completely different and everyone acts differently than their canon personality could ever predict but I will insist that it is not AU".

** Claiming Fudge's behavior was defensible is one of my pet peeves. He literally ordered Barty Crouch Jr. to be Kissed without an interrogation because he knew perfectly well what that interrogation would reveal. His attempt to snap Harry's wand was completely insane. These are the kind of hard facts that would require not that Harry has a kid's perspective but that he is literally lying to us about the events of the story, and at that point, maybe magic isn't real and the whole story is a series of interviews at Harry's inpatient psych ward.

It's a stagnant world where people don't much like new ideas and thoughts. The major media outlets are all sources of state propaganda that does not even pretend otherwise. The justice system is insanely punitive and again crippled by the fact that the people prefer the appearance of justice to the fact of it. And Fudge, a man who keeps his power by virtue of using literal soul-sucking demons as his attack dogs to silence anybody who threatens his narrative of "carry on, nothing to see here", is but the pustule on top of an abscess that's rapidly turning necrotic.

But understanding these motivations only makes the actions of most of these adults worse because we can see what such actions stem from and what they lead to. They do not in any way mitigate them or excuse them.

Not... sure what you expect him to do under that situation? It's not like he's ever shown to be able to produce a Patronus. All he can do is try to order it around, and dementors have been shown to not be great listeners.

As to it being suspicious, you can make a reasonable interpretation of the text in that direction, but it's still ultimately a personal interpretation i.e. fanon. As the canon facts go, there's no direct proof that he sicced the dementor on Crouch, just things that suggest that if seen in a certain light.

When they were sent back to their tribes they would look at their parents and their culture with this disdain.

2. Change the name of the class. Change it to Dumbledore's Army for all it matters, I am pretty sure that Harry's group didn't get nailed by the curse, as there was nothing stopping the group from reorganizing in the following books.

3. Change the name of what the teacher does. For example, Instructor, Sensei, Master, Tutor, Mentor, and Professor are all perfectly viable for this.

As adults we understand that there are external pressures that affect how an adult can act, I think this is shown to Harry a bit in OotP, Mcgonagall can't help against umbridge because she has no power in the situation and trying would only lead to more ministry restrictions or her dismissal. Harry understands a bit but he also thinks ‘I can't go to her with anything about umbridge even if it gets worse' (I believe he only speaks to Mcgonagall before the blood quill) whereas an adult would realise Mcgonagall is picking her battles.

Also a key one is where Snape pretends not to understand Harry's warning about Voldemort having Sirius but we find out later he went and checked on him. As a child Harry doesn't understand that Snape can't answer him properly in front of all these witnesses and thinks he's just being deliberately unhelpful but we as adults know that Snape is under pressure to maintain his role as spy and that affects his actions.

Did he do that in time though? I'm assuming he sent a Patronus message which was apparently outpaced by six thestrals to London?

The teens first had the confrontation with the centaurs and Grawp, flew to London from Scotland which should take a couple of hours, then had a running battle with Death Eaters. The Order arrived at the very end which I find very suspicious. The Patronus should have arrived in London well ahead of the teens and the Order should've cut them off at the Ministry Atrium.

** The basis of your hypothesis makes sense. An unreliable narrator...especially a child... could realistically skew the perspective of actual events. That perspective could be a valid defense for those that say that all Slytherins are not evil. The ones Harry doesn't mention (Daphne Greengrass, Tracey Davis, most of the other years) could simply be students keeping their head down and going to school. You could even...maybe...use such a justification to say Snape wasn't nearly as awful and biased to the students as Harry believes.

But there is no ambiguity in Fudge's character. Every adult on Harry's 'side' has the same opinion Harry has of the man. Honestly we don't need to know Harry's opinion on Fudge and his actions as the real life ramifications for his incompetence, corruption and cowardice are obvious from Book 3 on.

tl:dr While calling into question Harry's perspective on some characters is a reasonable basis for discussion you picked the absolute worst example in Fudge as he is clearly the incompetent, cowardly person Harry thinks he is.

Being a Devils advocate doesn't mean you have to blindly support something with no evidence backing it up. It makes your point seem ridiculous even though you do have a pretty good one. Trust me I'm a big fan of Worm, protagonist centered morality and point of view distorting the audiences perception of characters, motivations and events is something I've given a lot of thought to.

Fudge isn't as bad as the worst of fanon, but he is actually pretty accurately portrayed in the books, and his character traits are displayed at several points in ways that Harry's childish PoV wouldn't be able to distort. This man is in charge of magical Britain, he very likely does have something going on in the background that Harry didn't cotton on to, but the major strokes of his character don't change no matter what you make up as a background for his actions.

Someone like Snape is a good example with actual depth behind it, use him instead.

The idea that Harry's childish point of view distorts how useful adults can be and their motivations does have some merit. Like with reporting the quill. But I think at the end of the day Rowling was writing YA fiction and Adults are useless is a useful trope for YA fiction writers, so if that plot demanded it thats how they were written in most instances.
