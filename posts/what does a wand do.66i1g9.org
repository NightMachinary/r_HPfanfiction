tell us your wand fanon.


** wand allow the caster to channel their magic through them. they were invented in Europe at least 2370 years ago ( Olivanders is producing wands since 382 B.C) before wands people used wandless magic and potions. wandless magic is like wand magic but requires a lot more effort and skill and only allows less complicated spells. wandless magic is still taught at the magic school of Africa.

*** why do wands allow the castor to channel magic through them? What makes wands necessary to do more complex magic rather than doing it wandlessly through a lot of skill and knowledge? are wands the only tool that allows the castor to channel their magic or are there other methods and if so what would they be? how did wands become worldwide or did people around the world decide that the best way to do magic was to wave wooden dicks around and speak latin(not that they knew latin). how were wands invented, like seriously why did people decide to put magical thread like objects inside of wooden dicks, I mean, how the fuck does anyone come up with that?

Also, if wands allow the castor to channel their magic why wooden dicks? why not books or amulets or jewelry or makeup or tattoos or somesuch bullshit magic crap. is there something inherent in the nature of male genitalia that allows dicks to channel magic? if it's about genitalia why not books or sausages or tacos or whatever (Mexican taco mages and german sausage warlocks... just no... no... just. just. no). if it's about the shape then why not knives swords and daggers.

**** I'm going to pretend you said "sticks".

Now, to be fair, you're asking an extremely open ended question. There's all sorts of different magical theories under the sun when it comes to the fantasy genre, so what you're saying is basically "tell me anything that makes even the most remote amount of sense." As you might guess, there's lots of different ways to go about that.

From the top!

#+begin_quote
  why do wands allow the castor to channel magic through them?
#+end_quote

Let's generalize that to encompass all foci. Magical Foci do what they're supposed to, which is focus whatever ephemeral energies get pushed through them, be it human will or cosmic magic.

#+begin_quote
  What makes wands necessary to do more complex magic rather than doing it wandlessly through a lot of skill and knowledge?
#+end_quote

To reiterate, wands focus magic. Sorcerers are by definition wandless magic users, and are commonly capable of great feats due to their unmatched attunement to and control over their magic. However, even they might benefit from wands in certain situations, assuming they don't somehow overload them. Asking why wands over wandless is asking why you would use a telescope to view the stars when you can use your eyes. Wands take the magic and directs it to a very specific purpose.

#+begin_quote
  are wands the only tool that allows the castor to channel their magic or are there other methods and if so what would they be?
#+end_quote

No, foci can be just about anything, assuming it has some kind of connection to the theme of the magic system being used. Dwarves might use valuable gems, (proper) elves might use ancient wood, and humans can use whatever suits their fancy. It could be cantrips, or long latin chants, or archaic rituals. Could use dancing, or blood, or souls. Anything, so long as it fits the system used.

#+begin_quote
  how did wands become worldwide or did people around the world decide that the best way to do magic was to wave wooden dicks around and speak latin(not that they knew latin)
#+end_quote

Presumably every country/nation/ethnic group/language has its own faux language that they use to cast spells with. I imagine it spread like all improvements do, by word of mouth and traveling abroad to promote it. "Oh shit that guy's doing way cooler stuff than I can! What, a wooden stick? Well goddamn, let's try it out!"

#+begin_quote
  how were wands invented, like seriously why did people decide to put magical thread like objects inside of wooden dicks, I mean, how the fuck does anyone come up with that?
#+end_quote

Same way all foci were invented: someone found out that some shit reacted to magic better than some other shit. Then they start experimenting with the shit that reacted well to magic. Sometimes they blow themselves up, sometimes they don't, and eventually you're sticking pieces of flaming birds inside wood and calling it a day.

#+begin_quote
  Also, if wands allow the castor to channel their magic why wooden dicks? why not books or amulets or jewelry or makeup or tattoos or somesuch bullshit magic crap. is there something inherent in the nature of male genitalia that allows dicks to channel magic? if it's about genitalia why not books or sausages or tacos or whatever (Mexican taco mages and german sausage warlocks... just no... no... just. just. no). if it's about the shape then why not knives swords and daggers.
#+end_quote

Because it's not a damn dick. Stick. STICK. S.T.I.C.K. Think of it like a thread of magic going through the eye of a needle, and then using that needle to sew up some fancy embroidery. It's not about the shape, it's about the theme. And the theme is about the materials used and the person being chosen, not the shape.

I'll be honest, I don't really know why wizards use wands, but I can guarantee you you're not going to find the answer in Freud's Psych 101 class.

**** One i'm assuming wand's became world wide because of imperialism, assuming that European Wizards all used wands, during the age of discovery and subsequent age of imperialism that followed those ideas would spread across the world with Wizards migrating and fleeing Europe during the religious turmoil that followed the 1500-1600's. JK Rowling sucks at world building so wands aren't explained well at all, but assuming that Magic is not drawn from the air and inside a persons own body (IE like a magical core or mana yes i know it's cancer but blame JK Rowling for not explaining her magic,) Then it makes sense that a focus such as a stave or wand would allow easier casting, the wand would act like a lightining rod, drawing magic from your body, focusing it, and acting as a medium to shape the spell to your will. If your magic is in nature and NOT from the casters body then the same rule would apply, the magic would gather inside the wand and be released in the form of a spell to the intent of the caster.

If their are other methods we don't know of them, and as I've said blame JK Rowling for being shit.

** 1. Magic is a lot about visualisation firstly, I find that it's probably hard for many people to visualise anything but Telekinesis, Charms, Transfiguration, and Elemental Abilities coming out of their hands. There is also probably a reason for that (likely before Catalysts there were no Jet/Beam/Wave etc... Spells).

2. Wandless Magic is probably less powerful, I mean, each wood and core don't have radically different properties for no reason, and there's also the fact that some are naturally more powerful than others, likely in the way they amplify magic and not just channel it. So Wands do both, they channel the energy and they amplify.

3. Magical Control is not something that is easy to come by. According to the Twins, most people in the Ministry can't even cast a proper Shield Charm taught in 3rd Year Defence.

4. There are probably several alternatives to Wands, but most of them are just more cumbersome or impractical. Like, who would want to carry around a gigantic stick that serves the same purpose as a wand? How does channelling magic through a ring even work, is it too small? Can you even move your fingers with a bracer on?

*** 1. More like most people in the Ministry had shitty teachers since they switched every year. I mean, Harry taught a group of people the shield charm in a short amount of time, and he wasn't even a professional teacher.

** Wands are like paint brushes, materials in a wand are like brush shapes and sizes, they determine what it's good at "painting". They aren't necessary, in the same way paint brushes aren't necessary, but at the same time you wouldn't expect a brush painter to be able to create masterpieces with their fingers.

The best reason I can think of for why wands are so ubiquitous is that they intrinsically for a bond with their owner, while other instruments require that bond be built over time. I also imagine there's some degree of resonance going on, which could be used to explain why the brother wands were drawn to Tom and Harry.

*** That actually make more sense than my explanation.

I thought it was all about the magical properties of testosterone and long dicks.

Kidding about that I thought it was more of a European thing and that wands were just convenient for all Europeans being a relatively low skill focus for a mediocre yield compared to rings which are high skill lower yield or staves/staffs which are low skill for high power and high skill for low power and capable of huge yields.

Also, fuck, what you said actually works exactly like what I said. it's like staffs/staves are charcoal, rings would be like using a really small size brush, books could be like programming more than painting where everything is deliberate, and wandless would be finger paints. you can make beautiful stuff with any of them but skill and scale make some easier than others just like how you could finger paint a humongous mural and with enough time and effort make something just as if not more beautiful as paint on canvas.

tldr: you are a fucking genius. I wrote a counterpoint which was the point. how the fuck did you do that.

** I think of magic as explosions. Pure, unshaped magic is like an explosion, which is similar to accidental magic. Something happens, but unless you are lucky, it won't be what you want.

Directed wandless magic, is like putting that explosion in a gun, like a flintlock or musket. It takes a while to charge and shape, and when you fire, it goes in the right general direction, but it is also inaccurate and finicky.

Wanded magic is like a modern gun. Sophisticated, clean, elegent, and very precise in comparison.

The thing which seperates these categories of magic, is focus. Magic, at it's core, is about intent. You have to know what you are doing, how and why. An explosion has no focus, and thus it goes in every direction at once. Directed wandless magic, has more focus for several reasons. First, you know what you want to happen. Second, you can use incantations which help shape your spells into something useful. And third, magic has a certain speed to it. The more you have charged up, the harder it will try to escape, so if you have enough power for a spell, you only have a short amount of time to shape the intent.

The physical focus in directed wandless magic is the body itself. If magic travels through the wizard's arm, it will be going through wizard bone, with a marrow core surrounded by blood. In essence, the arm acts as a wand. This transit time through the arm gives even more time to shape the magic, much like a longer barrel will improve aim.

A wand adds something new. It is more akin to rifling, where not only does it add time for the spell to move and be shaped, but the act of shaping the intent is vastly easier while the magic moves through the wand.

Magic is about intent, and the more factors you add to clarify that intent, the more accurate and powerful it is. Wand motions, incantations, various types of foci are all those factors. One could substitute concentration and raw will in for all of them, but that simply makes it that much more difficult.
