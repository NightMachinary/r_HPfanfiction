Basically, you start in the future with something weird, then people time turn back and cause that weird thing to happen but discover something else, so they go further back in time and in the end of the story they're back to the beginning and cause the beginning to happen.


** Have you ever seen the kids movie Shorts? It's told roughly like this, my kids love it. You come up with some great prompts, cool idea.

** Have you ever watched the film Memento?

Although it doesn't exactly involve time travel the film is presented in reverse order much like you describe above.

It's about a man whose tracking his wife's killer however he has no ability to form memories so after about 10 minutes he forgets what just happened. I found it a rather interesting film.
