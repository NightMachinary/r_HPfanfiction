A link and message from those hardy souls taking on the challenge has just been posted to a number of HP fic groups. Perhaps there is life in the old dog yet.


** Thanks so much for sharing this! We're so excited to take this on - there was far too much beautiful history to simply let float away. We super appreciate the shout out and support. With a bit of magic, we can get everything back online in the next week or so :)

** Can someone explain the big deal with this site? I've seen a number of threads about it going down etc. I've never once read a fic on that site, are there many good ones not available elsewhere? I've never once seen any fanfics on that site recommended by other people.

*** Mostly, its over 17 years old and has a lot of fandom history - its prime was in 2011 so depending on when you started reading, it wouldn't be nearly as relevant to you. But don't worry, we're not bringing it back to just keep it the same, we've got a whole slew of updates in the pipeline to make reading and writing easier on the platform. Cheers! -Ronnie

**** Oh I see, that's cool, thanks for the explanation. How strange that I've never really come across it, I've been reading fanfic since about 2005.
