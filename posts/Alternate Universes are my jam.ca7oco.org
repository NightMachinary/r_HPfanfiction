Send me your AUs!! Of any pairing! With smut or no smut!!

I'm talking Alpha/Omega AU, Flower Shop AU, Royal AU, College/Highschool AUs!

Any fanfic in an alternate universe that still keeps the characters in their usual state is valid, so no snake! Harry or Car! Ron.

My faves are Modern AUs so just sayin

Thank u guys!!


** Non magical AUs:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there): nice Harry/Ginny romance in which Harry is an interesting celebrity.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: my favorite non magical AU so far. Here, the Purebloods are the European aristocrats, the Weasleys become the Wellesleys, Hogwarts is a spy school for the British elites, and Riddle is an aristocratic mad scientist bent on overthrowing the British democracy. It's also a 660k words long completed epic with an awesome Trio.

#+begin_quote
  The Battle of Camlann never happened, thus the legacy of Arthur lives on. The blood of the founders still walk the halls of Hogwarts, while ancient enemies clash to this day. Years later, Harry Potter wakes up a stranger in a strange world. Between over competitive house relations and never ending mysterious plots, he must struggle to find the truth about that fated Halloween. AU

** Linkffn(Patron by Starfox5)

Ultra-traditionalist AU where the only reason Hermione wasn't sold to the highest bidder (Malfoy) is that Harry got her first. Characters are mostly the same, just a little bit more badass.

Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died)

AU where Malfoy finished where Voldemort left off and took over Britain back in 1981.

Harry, Ron and the Order all live in France while Hermione is brainwashed with all the other mudbloods as soldiers loyal only to Malfoy himself. They don't meet until Ron returns to Britain as a spy to prepare the coup. Things get kinda interesting between the two.

Linkffn(The Granger Principle)

Modern AU by the same author. So far only 4 chapters but weekly updates and the author has more than a dozen finished stories so it probably won't get abandoned.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy]]) and it's trilogy is my All Time Favorite AU, but it's made around the premise that the magical world could be more alien than the canon suggests, so be warned, it's Very AU.
