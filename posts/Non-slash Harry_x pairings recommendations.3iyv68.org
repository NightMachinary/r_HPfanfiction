i'm trying to get into Harry/Daphne, Harry/Luna, Harry/Ginny romance heavy stories( i feel like i've milked out all the Harmony stories of which are to my liking). i also prefer it to have smuts/lemons(if possible) and does not go into other characters' love life e.g i absolutely can't stand Ron/Hermoine.

** I rarely read romance heavy stories, but St Margarets's [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=4384&chapter=all][Magic Within, Magic without]] is beautifully written and heart warming.
