So, people keep arguing about Merlin's sorting at Hogwarts. Some say he was Gryffindor, because, you know, every good person is strictly Gryffindor. Lets just forget Cedric. Some say Ravenclaw, because who wouldn't expect him to be a Genius. Some say Hufflepuff for no apparent reason, some say Slytherin, some even say he predated Hogwarts.

Let's put this to ease, shall we?

If you take a look at [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Merlin][Merlin's Part of the HP wiki]] you will see that Merlin did, in fact, go to Hogwarts, and did, in fact, get sorted not into Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, or even Hufflepuff- he was a Slythering folks, plain and simple.

Why do you think people keep insisting Merlin is something else, even when proof is right in front of them? My personal theory is that most of the people that agree either

A) Are to lazy to do research and immediately start spewing off their own little fantasies

or

B) Are stupid and don't even know what is happening

For B, I was about to put 12 year olds, but then I thought that it would be unfair, because, you know, this is being written by me. A 12 year old.

Anyway, what are your theories?


** This issue is not what house he was sorted in, but the fact that he was sorted at all when his legend predates Hogwarts - and this only really became a topic of interest when that Pottermore article was posted. But, to be honest, it doesn't even matter, since any story set in a modern setting that includes Merlin any any meaningful fashion is almost certainly going to be bad.

** My own personal theory? There were two Merlins. The one of King Arthur, Knights of the Round Table and Swords in Stones, and one who went to Hogwarts and was sorted into Slytherin, and over time the two have been conflated together into one character.

Because honestly, /the/ Merlin attending Hogwarts is just stupid.

*** Yeah, it reflects the development of the Merlin mythos as well, given that Emyrs/Ambrosius and Myrddin Wyllt (neither of whom have any initial association with Arthur) get combined and added into the Arthurian myths. I'm even planning a story based on it (A Slytherin Welsh half-blood hears a prophecy about the Norman invasion, wants to fight it and decides to 'revive' Arthur and twists the mythology to use it in his favor).

There's also the fact that even if there's been no conflation of characters (as there's a strong tradition of writers backdating things to do with Merlin by centuries and the Merlin/Arthur thing only really kicks off in the 12th cent. it could also be a single Merlin in the 12th cent. who was added to the 5th cent. setting myths by Monmouth and co.) the Arthurian Merlin is very definitely a Slytherin. Just read the first chapter of the Morte d'Arthur.

*** Merlin Ambrosious went to Hogwarts and Myrrdin Emrys was "The Merlin" who worked with Arthur.

** If you're going to call someone stupid, you might want to brush up on your homophones and spellcheck before posting.

Geoffrey of Monmouth is credited with drafting a large portion of Merlin's backstory in 1136, so I'll defer to him - not Rowling and most certainly not the Wiki - as the authority on that literary character's background.

** i liked "The Mists of Avalon",i always treated merlin like a title rather then a name and i thought the one that went to hogwarts is diffrent then the one that served king arthur.

** Honestly of all the things to complain about this one is just silly. The character is almost exclusively limited in canon to a curse word, and so this change doesn't impact anything important at all. Add in that many people have not, and have no desire to, read all of potter more and are happy with just the novels, or just the movies, and it becomes even clearer why the house of Merlin is all over the place.

It's fan fiction. If everything were identical to the universe Rowling created it would be the exact same story that she wrote. There are going to be differences and I'd you want to complain about them, that's fine, it just seems like Merlin is a really wierd one to start with when you compare it to things like different sortings, different genders, and different pairings.

*** I don't enjoy being called lazy or stupid because I disagree with your opinion. The Wiki is ridiculous and receives few quotations here.

[[/u/yarglethatblargle]]'s theory makes the most sense to me.
