In this Hermione/Draco FFN, there is a scene where Hermione is introduced to the Dark Lord. She wears a ripped dress (I want to say green for some reason) and is barefoot. She walks up to Voldemort and presents her wand. As far as Voldemort knows, Hermione just came from France because the country pass a law? of some sort kicking all refugees out of their country or something. Previously, she was with the remains of the Order and was cooking and cleaning for them. The Order refused to let her out in the open because there is a prophecy regarding her (and they kept knowledge of this prophecy from her). Hermione is bound to Draco in marriage and together they plot the downfall of Voldemort. Ron is very jealous because he feels that he still loves her and does not want to lose her to Draco. Please help find this fanfiction. Thanks!


** FOUND IT :) Thanks everyone!!

  Draco Malfoy has played both sides of the war for years, but when Voldemort gives him an ultimatum---bring him Hermione Granger or die---she surprisingly agrees to be handed over to the Dark Lord. Together, they take pureblood society by storm as Master and Madam Malfoy, all while trying to help the Order find and destroy the last Horcruxes and defeat Voldemort forever.
