** Disagree. Harry is ridiculously normal for someone who went through the childhood he did. It's blatantly obvious Rowling just wanted a fairytale backstory without thinking about what such an upbringing would actually do to a child.

** Agree. He definitely learned how /not/ to act based on his life with the Dursleys, which I think is somewhat supported by the comparisons between Dudley and Draco earlier in the series. (The narration mentions Harry wouldn't have thought he could dislike anyone as much as Dudley until he met Draco.) Also, the Pottermore writing on Lockhart's position as Defense teacher notes that Dumbledore had similar logic for hiring him despite knowing he was a fraud. He hoped that despite his utter lack of credentials, the students would still learn from him "how not to act" and "how not to be." So perhaps that's a running theme.

Granted, HP was written for younger audiences and as such the protagonist is pretty much guaranteed to be a Good Person^{TM} on the whole. It would be a much worse story if Harry picked up some of the Dursleys' more unflattering qualities.

** I'm not sure. I'm not comfortable with the idea that abuse can be a positive tool for building character- it is still abuse after all. As [[/u/turbincarpus]] mentioned, they really are part of the trope of the fairytale evil family, like in Hansel and Gretel, or more recently in Roald Dahl stories such as James and the Giant Peach and Matilda (Vernon and Petunia are literally a slightly posher version of the Wormwoods).

We know that Harry's parents were decent people. Lily was kind and compassionate, and Harry shares her empathy and ability to care deeply for others. He shares James's righteousness and his desire to stand up for others who can't fend for themselves. It kind of poses the question about nature vs nurture and whether a personality is genetic, but the books seem to imply that he is more like his parents than just from his physical appearance.

It can build character, but it can't be a positive tool. Given the option of "be abused, develop some good character traits" and "don't be abused, go without those character traits", "don't be abused" is always the better option.

** Disagree. The Dursley's awfulness didn't seem to affect Harry at all. I think people really underestimate the affect an upbringing like Harry's would have on a child. Locked in a cupboard, denied meals, and unable to escape his cousin's bullying even at school. At the age of eleven he had never had a friend. Every single one of his formative relationships were abusive.

Yet somehow, even though Harry had never been loved or even had a friend at age eleven, he had no trouble making friends with the first person he met on the train to Hogwarts. And on top of that, he's secure enough with himself that he refuses Draco. He has no issues trusting Ron and Hermione. He has no hangups from being locked in a cupboard, from not being fed enough, or from being chased around by a bully for most of his childhood.

The purpose of the Dursley's wasn't to give Harry a reasonable backstory to explain his personality. It was to make it so Harry wouldn't have any parental figures to turn to and would need to figure things out for himself, and to make the magical world that much better in comparison to his home life.

** I disagree, largely. Dursleys are written as the cartoonish "evil stepparents", the Mugglest of Muggles, providing a foil to the wondrous world of magic Harry is invited to. Looking for ways in which Dursleys affected Harry's personality is a bit like looking for signs of brain damage in Daffy Duck after Bugs Bunny dropped an anvil on his head.

In my experience, those who advocate for the position that Dursleys had a meaningful impact tend to have trouble coming up with any concrete, unambiguous, canon-backed examples. Much of the time (but not always!) this sort of case is motivated by wanting to excuse Harry's (supposed) mediocrity---that if he'd been raised by someone better, he'd be an uberwizard of some sort.

The one plausible consequence of their emotional abuse that I see is Harry's pathological inability to follow rules---even when they are a good idea---and take good advice. On the other hand, Ron has the exact same problem, so it may well be a wizard "not an ounce of logic" thing.

This doesn't seem difficult, Dumbledore outright mentions some at the end of OoTP (he mentions thinking placing him in a wizarding family would cause him to be too coddled and arrogant at the very beginning of book 1 as well). His bad upbringing directly led to him disliking people who place emphasis on their high place in society (or desire of such), resulting in a nearly instant disdain for them (and thus the ideology of blood supremacy). An example of this in Book 1, where after a brief exchange he knows he doesn't like Draco, and affirms this later on the train, and even later in the book is surprised to have found someone he disliked even more than Dudley.

**** The OP was specifically talking about Dursleys' abuse, not about being brought up by Muggles. That is, if Dursleys were a typical (non-abusive) Muggle family, would you say that Harry would be more arrogant? Would he have had less antipathy to arrogant and haughty people?

Basically, we have a decent idea what impact emotional abuse and neglect have on a child's development (on average, and there is a lot of variation, however). Harry doesn't seem to exhibit those symptoms, AFAIK.

***** I didn't bring up Harry being Muggle raised. Their abuse was always centered on Harry being abnormal and that if anyone found out they'd never be well regarded in their social circle (the whole point about their "He goes to St. Brutus's" cover up is to make them look good for trying to fix a troubled boy). So yes, had Harry's upbringing not been that he would likely have been very different; much less empathetic towards those like Dobby who have it even worse. Heck, if he'd been raised by one of the non-abusive families at Privet Drive (who seem much like the Dursleys) he would have been more amenable to Draco's viewpoint about looking down on the "improper" Muggleborns. He does, after all, directly compare his antipathy towards Draco to that of his towards Dudley. He sees Draco as being along the same lines, but worse.

And yeah, we know he's more resilient than average. Unless I'm misremebering, even Dumbledore commends him for not letting his past jade him (point being he's surprised that he came out well in spite of it).

** I'm not sure if you're going for negative or positive impacts. Certainly abuse shaped Harry as a person, as it would anyone. For example, he mistakes infatuation for true love. His relationship with Ginny is very common for a teenager, but it never would have lasted in normal circumstances. He also thinks what Snape feels for Lily is true love, instead of a disgusting obsession. Furthermore, he's incapable of discerning abuse and doesn't think it's a big deal, even though Ron is disturbed by the bars on his window. His value system is completely distorted.

** I think it's a part of him (his personality), certainly not something to gloss over, but it doesn't define him. It does help that he was exposed to kids with relatively normal upbringing (Ron and Hermione etc) and to kids who reminded him of his cousin (Draco, to some degree), so he could make the distinction and choose to live healthily. As much as he could with figures like Dumbledore involved in his life.

Having to go back to his abusers every summer probably didn't help him heal, but it hardened him in some ways and led him to learn a lot about his own magic and the magical folk in his life, I feel. That being said, I don't understand authors who heal Harry of all PTSD and emotional scars; those are things I expect him to carry for the rest of his life, even though he moves on and learns how to live with it all (doesn't allow it to define and / or warp him).

** Sure. In canon we are presented with a impulsive, emotionally unstable Harry who has little self worth. He derives all of his self worth from how others think of him or how useful he can be.

Because of his stunted development (no basic trust, because of lack of unconditional love from a mother figure), he's also unable to engage in romantic relationships beyond surface level. He's either annoyed by having to engage his partner emotionally (Cho) or just flat out looks for someone who's "fun", satisfying his more primal urges (Ginny).

All in all his childhood with the Dursleys formed him into the perfect martyr: A person who is mostly self reliant (doesn't want to be a burden) and who prefers to stay distant in most relationships. Someone with so few attachments has little to lose and the promise of him alone being able to save thousands through self-sacrifice must feel like salvation and recognition ("See everyone?! I deserve to be loved after all!").

*** I think calling him impulsive and emotionally unstable are unfair characterizations of Harry. He doesn't do things on a whim most of the time. Even with going to the ministry, he did think it through. He isn't emotionally unstable either. He's a teenager going through puberty and experiencing the same emotional and physical changes everyone else is experiencing. Cut him some slack.

He does have a basic trust. If he lacked trust, he wouldn't go with Hagrid when they only met the night previous. He wouldn't be so open with Ron after knowing the kid for only a few minutes and I doubt he would have believed that Draco would honor his word and come to the trophy room for the Midnight Duel. Harry is many things, but a deep-rooted cynic he is not.

You say he can't engage in romantic relationships beyond surface level, but that is because he is a teenager. Teenagers don't usually have mature, deep connections with other teens. No one at 15 is ready for happily ever after. He wasn't angry that Cho was trying to be emotional! He was mad because she seemed to go back and forth between dating Harry and bringing the subject back around to Cedric, which only made her sad. He's looking for someone that's "fun" because dating is supposed to be fun when you're that age! Trying to only find "the one" as a teenager is silly and almost always fruitless.

I'd argue he was born to be a martyr. Self-sacrifice for the sake of others seems to be in his blood, given that James and Lily both died for him. Harry is fiercely loyal and that is certainly not a trait he would have picked up at the Dursleys. I'd theorize that this is why he died, not his spirit breaking, which I don't think it ever really did.

I'm not sure what you mean when you say, "so few attachments". Ron, Hermione, Sirius, Tonks, Fred, George, Ginny, Remus, Moody, Dumbledore, Neville and Luna. Those are just the people who are close to him! There are many others that he considers allies or even friends. Harry sacrificed himself because he DID have so much to lose and he wanted to try to save it as best as he could.

Frankly, I think your analysis of Harry's character was much too shallow, and cynical. You seemed to shape his character in a way that would fit your narrative instead of shaping your narrative to fit his character.

No, Hermione thought it through, Harry was trying to rush off immediately (their argument is actually one of my favorite friendship scenes between the two, oddly enough). Every book (just about) involves him doing something impulsive but which works out because destiny. Book 2 is particularly silly since the instant Lockhart doesn't pan out as a teacher to inform they just traipse off to the Chamber.

I don't think the Hagrid bit was trust so much as "can't be worse than the Dursleys" and him knowing the answers to things Harry desired to know. I don't know if he has trust issues in general, but it's not even debatable that he has trust issues with adults (not for entirely bad reasons, mind you).

I mostly agree with the teenager stuff, but I think it doesn't really contradict OP's point. Dating necessitates accepting the other person has baggage. It's kinda stupid to think "Yeah I like her and want to date her, and yeah I know she's probably hung up on her murdered ex, but if I ever have to deal with it I become pretty useless."

Believe OP was referring to familial attachments. Ron shows the reasons why Dumbledore basically needed a Dursley situation for Harry (which Dumbledore admits to Snape). Part of why Ron runs out is that his entire family is at risk while the hunt seemed mostly a failure. He had everything to lose. There's a reason Hermione shipped her family to another hemisphere. Harry's only family were people who hated everything about forever (with Dudley coming around a bit at the end). He had no inherent connections to people who were at risk. Ron and Hermione were obviously the ones who filled that role for him (I don't really count the others because it's just not the same, those three were special). Losing friends, especially close friends, is awful. But it's borderline impossible for most to put their family in that kind of danger intentionally so Harry couldn't have that in his life; it would jeopardize his ability to fight Riddle. Not to go entirely Evil!Dumbledote, but he did need that to be the case for him to take the final AK the way he did.

** I think this kind of goes back to the age-old argument of Nature vs. Nurture. Of course, there's likely some balance between the two. The Dursleys likely had some effect on his character/personality, but I remember last year in sociology we were discussing how nature had a larger impact on a person than nurture. So I think Harry's abuse shaped him to some extent, but he isn't likely going to completely flip his personality without that abuse.
