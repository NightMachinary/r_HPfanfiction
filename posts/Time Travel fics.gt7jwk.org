I'm really a sucker for time travel, esp. back in time to Marauders Era. I read a really great fic recently where harry travelled back in time to save Snape, and it hit all my good feelings! (Plus plenty of angsty ones) And now I've really got a hankering for more!

I've only ever read a couple of these, but I'd love any recs y'all could give! I prefer completed fics, but it's not strictly necessary, and I do really love Snape as a character, so I'd prefer if he was a main character.

I don't have preference on ships, but I'm definitely okay with slash.


** In it, Snape and Lily both wake up in the Maurauder era with all of their memories from when they died (in canon) intact. It's not complete, but it's in progress (most recent update was this month). The parts I read were good, but I took a long break from fanfic awhile back and haven't gotten around to picking it up again. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12386916/1/]])

That was the only fic I know where Snape was the MC and involves time travel. However, here are a few other interesting time traveling stories that I feel stand out from the rest. All fics are complete unless otherwise stated.

Harry uses the time turner in the dept of mysteries. Has the best take on the Dept of Mysteries Debacle in fanfic. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7062230/1/Concentric-Wavelengths]])

Harry ends up in the same class as Riddle after a time travel accident, all while the war against Grindlewald is at its height. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11261838/1/The-Unwinding-Golden-Thread]])

A time travel fic from the perspective of a non-traveler: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13022207/1/Anticlockwise]]) (incomplete)

This one is a silly take that updates sporadically. New time travelers appear every 3-6 months. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6728900/1/Far-Too-Many-Time-Travelers]]) (in progress)

Shortly after Merope dies, a time-traveling Hermione convinces Tom Riddle Sr. to take care of baby Tom. Realizing how little respect the Riddle family would be given as muggles, Riddle Sr. then proceeds to con the wizarding world into believing that Tom Riddle Sr. is from an ancient pureblood family. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13013582/1/]]) (in progress)

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody---' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

  They all thought after Voldemort's fall that the world would get better. But they were wrong. The Death Eaters used politics to accomplish what Voldemort never could. And with the dwindling Wizarding population and no one left to fight, there's only one solution: to go back in time to before Voldemort rose to power, and fix what broke the first time around.

  Hollis Potter walked into what she thinks is the final battle of the war that's been raging for the last six years, only to find, when it's over and she's officially lost everything, that she's not where she's supposed to be. Or, rather, she's not when she's supposed to be. She wouldn't have made it as far as she did without being stubborn, however, so she pushed past the surprise and the grief and decides to change it, no matter the cost. --Cross-posted on FanFic: Hollis Potter, with grim determination, walks into a battle that will make or break England - and affect the World War raging around them. The outcome is surprising, even for her, and she is left with nothing to do but adapt. [Slightly Edited/Reworked]

  Harry's attempt to time travel and fix the past went badly awry. Time shattered, and the various pieces of the universe clung to each other as best they could. Harry finds himself in 1961, with Albus Dumbledore the Minister for Magic, Gellert Grindelwald his loving husband, Voldemort newly defeated...and Severus Snape being proclaimed the Boy-Who-Lived.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

** All of these are completed. Pride of Time (and its sequel), Time to Spare and To Shape and Change all feature Snape. Happy reading!

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
