A few weeks back I was watching one of the Harry Potter movies with my family. On this subreddit I like to debate with other redditors about parts of the story that don't make sense. I tried to do this with my brother, pointing out scenes where the characters do something that just does not make sense. When my brother asked why I should have a right to have an opinion when I have never read the books. I didn't know how to respond to that and wanted your guys opinion.

Should some people not be aloud to have an opinion on the story if they have not read the actual books to completion?


** Well, you are ALLOWED to have an opinion, but you do kinda come off as uninteressted, judgemental and lazy, if you nitpick a story without spending the bare minimum of effort on trying to understand it.

*** While I have not read all the books to completion, I have seen all the movies and read a number of fanfictions (not that fanfics are anyway accurate to the books). Also, I was not nitpicking any scene from the books, just the movies. Does this mean that anybody who has not read a DC or Marvel comic is not aloud to have an opinion on the movies they watched?

**** No. Since the Marvel Movies never claimed to be a simple adaptation. And you read fanfiction, but not the books? Lol.

** It's alright to have an opinion solely about the movies.

But for the purposes of most HP discussion, the books hold the only weight because the films were based on the books. So it's a bit lazy to hold an opinion on HP, default the books, based on the movies which are basically spin-offs.

** u/NotWith10000Men:
#+begin_quote
  pointing out scenes where the characters do something that just does not make sense.
#+end_quote

movies should stand on their own, even if they're an adaptation from a different medium. if your critique was that the scene didn't make sense based on something else in the movie or something the movie was lacking, and your brother's response was, "well, in the books..." then I say your critique is totally valid.

** I think it's totally fine to point out something that doesn't make sense even if you haven't read the books. Maybe then someone will tell you actually it makes sense because in the book this and that happened. It's just an open discussion and as long as both parties are able to talk about it I think it could be interesting. I've read all the books and things to me in the movies make no sense because I know they didn't fully develop certain plot lines due to time constraints.

** I mean, sure, you can always have an opinion. Without real knowledge about the subject to back it up, it's pretty weightless and easy to dismiss.

It's a lot like any random layman having an opinion about the virulence of COVID-19, or any other virus they don't understand and then /arguing with an expert./ Obviously, the expert finds the rando irritating and /isn't going to take them seriously./

For example, I know someone personally who said, "I've dealt with plenty of dog coronaviruses and they cause diarrhea. This must be a weak one because it doesn't do that." Not that I'm an expert, but I do have a background in microbiology and immunology, and I've taken a fair few advanced virology courses as part of my graduate degree. Coronaviridae is a massive family of viruses (for context, humans belong to the family Hominidae, or hominids, which includes great apes, apes, gibbons, and so on, but we don't assume knowing something about the extinct gibbons tells us anything about humans), and includes viruses which only affect certain mammals, to ones which only cause mild gut discomfort, to cold viruses, to SARS and MERS and COVID-19. The layperson making this (completely incorrect) statement is certainly allowed to have an opinion. It's just, their opinion holds little to no weight without any knowledge to back it up.

*** I am not making comments about scenes in the book though. I am making comments about scenes in the movie as they happen. Like when Hermione messes with her parents memories, I was arguing against that action. My brother just said, "you didn't read the books. You can't really talk."

Also, I think your example is rather extreme. We are not talking about advance biology or science. We are talking about events that happen in a story and questioning the logic behind characters actions. Those two don't exactly equate.

**** Sure, you can make the comments. But because the movies are based on a book series, and leave a lot to be filled in under the assumption that the audience has read the books at some point (they leave so much out, that they can't really be said to stand alone) that most people who have read the books are not going to give a lot of weight to your opinions.

I used an extreme example to make it easy to see my point. You are missing the background knowledge (having read the books) to give your opinion perceived validity to someone who does have the background knowledge (someone who has read the books).

Feel free to say what you think. Just as if my sister had said the same without reading the books, I'll roll my eyes, smile and discount it.

** Mmm... if you want to argue things about Harry Potter and how things don't make sense in the /movies/, go ahead, but most HP fans have read the books and know that the movies sometimes counteract the books. You have a right to an opinion, of course, but you're making that opinion with only half the facts.

** Just on a basic social interaction level, no one wants to hang out with a negative Nancy. Even if the opinions being stated were valid, chilling with friends/family who just want to enjoy a movie isn't really the appropriate time/place for going off on rants about your favourite manipulative Dumbledore theory. You'll just come across as a real drag.

*** I was not talking about manipulative dumbledore. If fact I did not discuss fanfic at all at the time. I was referring to a scene in the movie as it was happening. It was a casual watching and everyone was talking a little bit during the movie.
