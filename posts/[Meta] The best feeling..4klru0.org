*** If you like Self-Fashioning in anyway, I highly recommend linkffn(Too Young To Die)

It seems as though Self-Fashioning borrowed heavily from it, yet I still consider Too Young To Die to be the better story between the two. It takes a couple chapters to really get good though.

***** Yeah, the grammar and technical errors are really annoying, I felt like every minute I was getting pulled out of the story by a pretty glaring error. Definitely the weakest part of the story, for sure.

The plot is pretty wild, I like how there were so many things that happen out of no where, like him crashing into the Quidditch stands etc. They felt spontaneous and exciting without being cliche or cheap.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest of places...even in your own head. Yes, Lord Voldemort killed his parents, but he was also Harry's first teacher, confidant, and friend - and you don't abandon your friends. A coming of age story that follows Harry from his cupboard under the stairs to...well, spoilers.

*** I realise it's a bit off-topic, but if you like Naruto stories, I recommend [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/][The Waves Arisen]]. It's not on any of the major fanfiction sites, but it's really good and well thought of over on [[/r/narutofanfiction]]

I've not been keeping up with A Fallen God lately. It got too far into original characters and worldbuilding with not enough canon, and doesn't feel much like HP or Marvel to me any more, although I might give it another shot now that I've got a decent backlog of chapters to read.

  "Rationalist" tag on stories usually means it's at least of a decent quality
#+end_quote

Oh boy, do I have a treat for you! [[/r/rational]] is where all the cool kids hang out to talk about and recommend rational fiction, including [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4976703/alexanderwales][Alexander Wales]] (author of The Metropolitan Man, Branches on the Tree of Time, and A Bluer Shade of White) and [[http://www.yudkowsky.net/other/fiction/][Eliezer Yudkowsky]] (author of HPMOR and Three Worlds Collide). Lots of great stuff to read and talk about!

  Fallen God is honestly kinda bad at this point. They've even fallen to the low of using the "guns beat magic" trope. Bleh.
#+end_quote

Thanks for the warning, I'll probably just delete it from my follows. "Guns>Magic" is a massive red flag, and given the number of other red flags I've seen that just pushes it over the edge.
