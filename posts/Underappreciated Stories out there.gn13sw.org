Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Et cetra) Doesn't have to focus on a pairing.

Anyone can be the main character, Can be on ANY site, can have any warnings. Can be any plot or genre.

No Character bashing. Now: Characters disliking/hating each other, or having a falling out, or getting upset at a realistic thing to get upset over is perfectly fine, but no evil Dumbledore or evil Weasley's. No Order or Weasley's using Harry for his fame or fortune, no one using a love potion on Harry, et cetra.

No OP Harry, Harry smarter or more powerful then in canon is fine, I don't want it to be a just because thing, I don't want him having Godlike magic or because of creature inheritance or anything to that nature, I want it to be because he worked hard for it.

If Harry is a "Lord" I'd rather him still help people, not be Draco Malfoy 2.0

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, if at all possible, but if not that's fine.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

  Post-OotP Reluctantly taking a leadership role in the fight against Voldemort, urging others to 'say the name', Harry tries to learn how he can use his 'power the Dark Lord knows not' to fulfill the prophecy as he becomes his enemy's biggest target.

** They Shook Hands, by Dethryl. IMO, the best Slytherin!Harry fic by a large margin, and one of the best fics in the fandom period. I think I can count on one hand the amount of times I saw it recommended here. Which is weird, because threads asking for Slytherin!Harry pop up quite frequently. The only issue with it is that the last book (7) isn't out yet.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

** Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste on AO3

Personal favourite, mainly Gen but with HarryxGin sprinkled in at the end. Focuses more on Harry's relationship with Snape and how that affects everything else, based on the premise of Harry loving potions so much hes willing to put up with a lot more shit from Snape and this grows thicker skin.

I love this story.

** I really love, and rarely see recommended, the Serpensortia series, the first one of which is linkao3(4913998). It's, to my mind, the best of Slytherin Harry story out there-- although it only has the first three years and no plan to continue further.

** I think one of the most unappreciated stories I know is Amicus Protectio Fortis - linkffn(11547735). It is a well-written story with very solid character interactions and dynamics. It introduces the idea of Harry starting the DA early and how it became a close-knit group. It has good world-building elements going on and makes every victory Harry and his friends have feel earned. I think its a story that everyone should take the time to read simply just to have an exposure to knew possiblites.

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?
