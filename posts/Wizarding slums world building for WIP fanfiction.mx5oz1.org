** Wizards barely have any population for proper urbanization and prefer to settle in isolated households, so I don't see any factors for formation of slums in the first place. Poor wizards live in isolated shacks in the wilderness, because magic makes any inconvenience of living far from economic centers irrelevant.

**** You can implement this idea in some "World where everyone is a wizard" AU, though.

****** Well this kind of AU is Pandora Box on its own right. Way too many factors, make worldbuilding extremely complicated, especially if you consider interaction between parts of the story.

Major role in worldbuilding would be played by the fact when "everyone is wizard" happened: always been this way? Everyone turned magical during historical event? Or just overtime wizards outbreeded muggles because their genes are dominant? This developments would imply different speeds of technological and magical progress and different demographic dynamics, due to significant difference life expectancy between wizards and muggles. Taking all this ideas into account, it is hard to imagine what slums would be like without spending few weeks trying to figure out worldbuilding, however here are few basic ideas:

- Wizards don't have any concept of building code, Hogwarts' internal and Burrow's external structures are good example of that. Also take into account Undetectable Expansion charm. Slums would consist of unholy mess of bizarre shacks, forming something looks like non-Euclidean version of Kowloon Walled City with Escher stairs.
- Ministry most likely would force anti-apparation wards on entirety of this territory as measure to have any chance of controlling crime.
- Illicit businesses would pretty much parallel those of muggle world: drug trafficking, racket, trafficking of sentient beings for forced sexual and non-sexual labor as well as body part harvesting, usury, resale of stolen/bootleg/smuggled goods and trophies from poaching.

As I said, it is hard to deduce much without thinking out entirety of AU, so more detailed day-to-day life of wizards in slums is tricky, and not exactly parallel to that of Muggle slums.

******* These short ideas are incredible and I'm sure I can use them in my story(with proper credit of course). I grew up briefly in the slums until 12 then my dad and mom found a well paying job and we were able to move out so I was also wanting to add my own experiences.

** Knockturn Alley is the closest canon comes to a Wizarding slum. One can build from there, and have it and any other such locations be populated mostly by creatures on the margins of Wizarding society such as renegade goblins and wizards/witches, hags, Muggle, Squib and magically untrained werewolves, etc.

â€‹

By renegade wizards/witches I mean magical people who are not allowed wands for whatever reason, like Hagrid. That would seriously blunt their ability to provide for themselves independent of civilization the way they could with wands (especially if they're also not good at potions). Maybe there is an adult version of the Trace to prevent them from circumventing this, and Hagrid can get away with it to the extent he does because of Dumbledore's protection.
