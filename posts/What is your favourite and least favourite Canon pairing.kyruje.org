So many people hate different Canon pairings for various different reasons. What are your fave and least fave pairings and why?

Mine has to be Remus/Tonks and Hermione/Ron.

I'm a sucker for the 'character won't enter relationship because they feel that the other deserves more' trope so its pretty obvious why I love Remus and Tonks together. Plus I love when Remus actually acts like the Marauder he is and in most fics Tonks helps to bring out that side of him.

On the other hand, I can see why Hermione and Ron might have gotten together but there is a fine line between bickering married couple and an unhealthy relationship. While they might be good in the short term, I've always seen their loyalties being more towards Harry than eachother and can see something like an argument over Harry splitting them apart.

[Edited 16/01/21]: I've realised that my opinions on Remus/Tonks comes from fics and not canon so I change my answer of favourite to Bill and Fleur because of how Fleur loves Bill for who he is and doesn't care about who knows, telling off Molly in the process. It's also really sweet how Bill doesn't doubt that Fleur loves him once even with Molly disapproving and Ginny mocking Fleur.


** Favorite: I adore Lucius and Narcissa. I know they aren't very popular characters but I've never been able to get over the fact that they are both so inescapably evil but manage so much familial love which, honestly, is the driving force of the entire series, pivoting on Lily's love of Harry. Why have these two awful people love their son and each other so much? Love comes from everywhere. Not just good guys. How can you want children to die (giving them curse diaries, etc) but be willing to die for your own? It adds a layer of grey that has made me a fan of the series for life.

Least: Ron/Hermione. Not a good fit, even JKR has said it. Better as friends, as are Hermione and Harry, and Harry and Ron. I like the trio platonically; I feel like it highlights the importance of non-romantic relationships, which is very comforting to a lot of people.

I enjoy them, too, but I'll admit it's probably the same case as OP with RL/NT: fan fiction plays a big role in my love for them.

And I do like what JKR did with them and the Dursleys. They're monsters, but they're your everyday monsters. They love their families and would do anything for them, but they'll also do anything to 'get their country back.'

** Favorite: Harry and Ginny. There's a line that goes something like "he'd spent so much time with her over the summer" and I've always found that to be a satisfactory explanation.

Least favorite: Tonks and Remus and Bill and Fleur. Probably the fact that both women suffered in characterization.

*** I don't know if it's the romance I dislike or the change in characterization of Fleur and Tonks.

As the books came out I expected Tonks to be a constant source of amusement, boisterous, skilled with a wand, can change her appearance. I was really expecting her to be a major character.

I also though Fleur would get a chance to shine (after a poor showing at the tournament).

But after that really Tonks just shows up dealing with a relationship with Remus (aside from finding Harry on the train). Fleur is a bit better as she shows some grit but I was expecting something cool from her too, like Bill is a curse breaker and she finally got into that full time as well.

*** Really? That's interesting. I've heard some people say the opposite for Bill and Fleur because of how she tells Molly to (basically) suck it.

Like I mentioned in one of the earlier replies to a different comment, now that I'm thinking about it I think my opinion of Tonks and Remus stems from reading several good fics when first starting to get into Harry Potter. The characterisation set her up as a badass but clumsy witch that goes after what she wants in life and doesn't put up with the self-deprecation from Remus but also understands where it comes from and slowly helps him change his opinion of himself. It also works as an almost 'books from different character's POV' so it wasn't too outlandish.

*** Can definitely agree with Tonks/Remus and Bill/Fleur as ones I dislike.

Tonks deserves better than canon Remus. I'm quite fond of various fanon depictions, but canon Remus was written really horribly. Their relationship reads as pretty dysfunctional in general, as others have said. And any man who leaves his pregnant SO? Ugh.

As for Bill/Fleur, I don't /mind/ it really, but I think it's written badly. She's portrayed as a woman who likes finer things in life, not simply being a mother. Kind of spoiled sweet. Note: nothing wrong with wanting to be a mother, but she seemed to have other ambitions. Then, due to babies ever after, she ends up living in a small cottage with Bill, having children and becoming Homemaker Molly 2.0. It was really bad for the character as she was initially portrayed. If she'd decided she wanted kids, but was doing stuff with Bill as well? That'd work better.

Favorite? That's hard, I'm more fond of non-canon relationships. I suppose of the canon ones, the one I like the most is Harry with Ginny. That could have worked SO WELL, if Rowling wasn't lazy. It reads pretty poorly in the books, but it's the best of the canon ones, IMO. If not that, Harry with Cho if Rowling had let Cho be more than a caricature. Rowling really seems to have a thing against certain character types.

I see where JKR was going with this: an attempt to make her less shallow and I'd be neutral on the pairing if she hadn't decided the best way to do that was to create another housewife. Nothing wrong with being a housewife, but that's so very different from the young woman seeking glory in GoF.

This is my stance on it. If I'm looking for a Harry centric romance, I prefer Harry with Fleur, Daphne, or Luna, but I don't mind H/G and even enjoy a lot of their canon moments.

Heh, as for romances, Harry/Daphne and Harry/Fleur are my favorites. I also wish there were more Harry/Padma. Harry/Tonks can be good too.

******* I don't have much of a problem either, no. Arrogance is a flaw, certainly, but not an irredeemable one, and she's nice to Harry after he saves her sister.

She was initially against him for actually understandable reasons. The whole school was against him, she didn't know him, wouldn't the school know if he'd do it? (Of course, the school was against him due to Rowling, but hey!)

** Harry/Ginny Remus/Tonks is the least for me.

Ginny wasn't developed in the original series, even though she seems like she'd be a cool character. She's very similar to Ron, but also pretty different. In the Cursed Child... just fuck the Cursed Child. She and Harry are completely unrecognizable. They're the most generic 'shitty parents who don't understand their children' cliche when they're the two people who would most understand it. Harry knows all about people drawing conclusions about you without knowing you and Ginny knows all about being anxious to prove yourself when you have a family that has done so much. Whoops, I ranted.

Remus/Tonks also seems completely dysfunctional. I don't like canon Remus. He's chronically fatalistic, didn't check up on the son of his best friend for over a decade. He's completely irresponsible when he's a teacher, forgetting to take wolfsbane. I /do/ have a headcanon explanation which adds a character arc for him and explains all of this, but it's not relevant to the pure canon version. Then add in their /tragic/ deaths, creating the orphan loop again and creating an opportunity for Harry to be a shitty godfather and I don't like it on a symbolic structure level either

Favorite: Ron/Hermione

Don't lynch me. By Book 7 they weren't the same pair of bickering idiots. They actually went through an arc to get to the point they were at over the course of the books. Admittedly, you have to read between the lines so far that you start to question whether you're seeing them at all, but it's there. I don't love it, mostly because we don't get to see them be functional anywhere besides Cursed Child, and Cursed Child is a pile of shit, but it definitely takes the top spot for canon pairings. (My followups were Charry, because it offers so much potential, and Lavender/Ron, because I like Lavender.)

I see a lot of people bringing this up, but why would he? Maybe it's just me, but I don't have any kind of deep connection with my parents friends. I think once Remus got assured Harry had been placed with relatives, it's perfect reasonable for them to not interact again until Harry is a teenager.

That said, I agree with the rest of what you've said about Remus. Being a werewolf would /suck/, but I have very limited patience for people who are "woe is me, I am a monster, I'm unloveable!"

**** In the case of the Marauders, the relationship is presented less as friendship, more as family. The sort of bond where you turn to your fellow Marauders to keep you safe instead of Albus Dumbledore. The only reason Remus was out of the running for Secret Keeper is that everyone realized that Voldemort promised Werewolf rights and they didn't.

Add in the fact that all of the people who the Potters originally wanted to take care of Harry were incapacitated, and I think that it's reasonable for people to be annoyed about him not checking in. If my brother died and someone else was responsible for his children, you can be damned sure I'd be checking in.

To be fair, when Madame Rosmerta, McGonagall, Fudge, and Hagrid were talking about the Marauders, they presented it as James, Sirius, and their two lackeys. They said that James and Sirius were closer than brothers, but Lupin didn't even warrant a mention (unless you count McGonagall saying they were ringleaders of their little gang) and Pettigrew was described as "that fat little boy who followed them around".

**** I guess it's just a responsibility thing to me. If my friend died and left behind a child, I would do my best to make sure that child grew up well.

*** I haven't read Cursed Child at all so that might be why I have a really low opinion of Romione. Thinking back on it now, I think Remus/Tonks are my favourite because of a series of fanfics I read when I first started getting into Harry Potter that had really good characterisation of them. Reading everyone's comments is making me question it lol.

** Least: it's a tie between Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione.

Ron and Hermione, I don't see how their relationship would work long term. I would go mad if I were in a relationship with this amount of fighting (bickering, or whatever people like to call it).

Ginny and Harry..., Ginny seems too good to be true. Most of the time, I found her terribly boring. Also, JKR was awful with their romance, so my dislike for this pairing is pretty much her fault.

Favourite: I think Bill and Fleur? We see little of them, but when I was reading the books, I felt like they really understood each other. Arthur and Molly maybe? She's overbearing, he's more relaxed, but instead of bickering, they complete each other and work well together.

** Least: Ron/Hermione. I'm rereading the books now cause it's been years so maybe once I get to the later books I'll change my mind but for now I think they are just incompatible. Like there is a certain level of compatible u have to be to go from friends to successful long term relationship. I don't think they had that. I think that all friendships don't need to turn into romances. They seem like outside of war related stuff they have pretty different interests/values.

Fav: Angelina & George. I imagine that Fred, George, Lee, Angelina were all in a friend group and seems like they all had pretty similar sense of humor and common interests. I know ppl think it's weird cause Fred and Angelina went to Yule Ball together but it appears they only went as friends. Also I think given how close George and Fred were he would need someone that knew Fred and understood that relationship. And Angelina would have a lot of memories of Fred and could remember him with George.

also Bill and Fleur. I think they are both very adventurous and outgoing and value family a lot. I think they would never get bored of each other and ads exciting enough that no one feels like they are being held back. Also they are both older siblings and take that very seriously. And I think they both have this thing where they are smarter than people assume. They are both described as being very attractive and charming and she comes off very feminine which makes ppl underestimate her but she was a TriWizard Champion and Bill in his rock concert clothing and long hair is actually a curse breaker in Egypt. And I think the way they both committed to the war effort only made them stronger. It's not even a war she had to fight in, she could have ran to France and ge could have to but they both stayed

Second Place Favs:

Arthur/Molly very in love and raised wonderful children and some strays and were just such parents like when Arthur asked Vernon was he not going to say bye to Harry.

Andromeda/Ted this was quite the romance. I like that she leaves he bigoted family and renounces her ways to be with him and raises a kid totally different than how she was raised.
