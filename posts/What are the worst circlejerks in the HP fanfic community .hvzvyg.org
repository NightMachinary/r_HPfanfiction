** Shipping wars.

Now, I get that everyone has different preferences here, but there are quite a few fics where the author goes the extra mile and tries to prove that only their OTP would work. Joking about other relationships (Hermione if Harry is with Ginny, Ginny if he is with Hermione) is already annoying, but there are fics which go way beyond that by what can only be described as bashing (love potion plot, betrayals).

The only way to convince others of your OTP is to show them that it is the perfect match for both of them without being "in the face" about it. Show them happy, cute and in-love, let people draw their own conclusions.

** “Lord Potter/Gary Stu/trope I don't like fics bad.” /cue thread w ppl calling out specific fics/

C'mon. We write fic for our personal enjoyment. Let people live out their fantasy. And who cares if there's a shitton of spelling and grammar mistakes? It's all for fun. I hate it when ppl make fun of a fic, even if it's not my cup of tea.

*** There was a period where there were a lot of post about British English grammar and how fics without it were unreadable. I can't imagine reading a great original fanfic, but then drop it because the author used the word prank.

So much this. Guys? Guilty pleasures are a thing. They're like that awful movie you love: it's a terrible film, it's cheesy, or it has plotholes, or it has bad acting, or its nostalgic, or whatever... but it's also glorious and every time you see it on TV you can't help but watch it.

Don't knock people's guilty pleasures, because reading them is amazing and don't lie to me: you have them too.

** The weird Harry/Draco or /Snape or /Voldemort.

I'm not gay, but surely there Harry would have better tastes.

Especially when it comes to the shitty teacher that hates you and the guy that idk maybe killed your fucking parents.

Draco I can kinda understand but I don't like it, but Snape and Voldemort feels wrong.

“Oh BuT SoCiEtY MiStReAtEd ThEm”

Mate society treats us all wrong, doesn't mean I'm going to join a terrorist group and have a relationship with a minor.

*** Society didn't even mistreat them. The only real abuse Voldemort ever suffered was from his fellow orphans, and he has them subdued by the time Dumbledore shows up.

Snape had an abusive father and a doormat mother (I would feel sorry if not for the fact that she has magic and could, at any time, smear the wall with her husband), but everything else was his own. He pushed Lily away, he joined the Death Eaters, he gave Voldemort information which would cause families to be targeted, he was a thoroughly abusive teacher...

Malfoy, from what we see "on screen", he is actually the worst Death Eater when it comes to the war crime count. If he had just tried to fight Dumbledore, his actions would have been understandable. But he chose to carry out various assassination attempts, attacked civilians, pressed civilians into Voldemort's service, hid his death Eater activities and pretended to be a student (that alone would warrant execution even by the Allies). He used poisons which caused unnecessary suffering (two separate war crimes).

And that's not even mentioning his sadistic tendencies as he relishes Hagrid's misery in PoA. That's not even something you can blame on brainwashing parents, that's pure Draco.

**** I agree, it's just stupid the amount of things some people in this fandom will allow some characters to get away with.

**** Exactly. Just because bad behavior can be explained doesn't mean it should be excused.

** Harry Potter and the Method of Rationality is soft propaganda for the so-called “rationality” ideology. It's not a horrible circlejerk in the sense that the community acts dickishly in other communities, but it's a circlejerk in the sense of arrogant pseudo intellectualism.

Plus, the author breaks with canon in a way that shows a lack of understanding of canon. Maybe it's just that I can't hold my suspension of disbelief. The first few chapters are amazing, but eventually the fic just jumps the shark. I can't remember where it jumped the shark, only that it did jump the shark.

** Robst hate. Sure, his writing has more than a few glaring flaws, but there's a lot of worse popular fics out there.

*** In a technical sense, his writing is quite good. For me, my issues come from the 12 year old soulmate harmony bullshit that infests fics like Harry Crow. Otherwise, that one in particular is your standard powerwank and there's nothing wrong with that.

I don't hate the author, but the way that relationship is treated is all kinds of fucked up /especially/ since they're TWELVE and yes: I absolutely have been known to warn potential readers about it.
