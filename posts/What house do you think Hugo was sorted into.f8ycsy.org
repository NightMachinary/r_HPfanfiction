I'm thinking he's a Puff - I've got it in my head that he's much quieter and reserved than Rose


** Probably Gryff since family and stiff but I'd love it if he was a Hufflepuff

** Ron would go a bit mental if he was sorted in a house other than Gryffindor. Plus the sorting hat seems clear about Weasleys belonging in Gryffindor (remember Ron's sorting) though it does boils down to choice. I think it would have been interesting having a Weasley in Hufflepuff.
