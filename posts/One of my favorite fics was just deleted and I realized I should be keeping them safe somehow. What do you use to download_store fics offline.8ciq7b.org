******* This is false.

I do not have a specific commercial right to fanfiction for obvious reasons. It is not, however, public domain and I have not forfeited my right to have it removed if I choose to do so.

I retain my right over the actual 'distribution' of it as it were, through Fanfiction.net's ToS. If I choose to blow it up, they agree that it is gone. The same ToS's that state all users are expressly forbidden from copying/downloading works from the website and that said works should only be accessed through fanfiction.net in some way or shape.

So no, if I delete my stuff, it should not 'be out there and shared' as that would then be expressly against my wishes. Legally, if I wanted to spend enough money on it, I would be in the right to hunt down and destroy every single copy of it that existed on the internet and elsewhere. It is still 100% mine. It is just not mine to do anything with commercially. And it isn't worth my time, effort, or money to do anything about it.

Just because people don't bother to actually read Terms of Service does not mean they don't exist. And morally your view is entirely in the wrong.

Fanfiction.net is a business. I know full well that I am giving them add revenue by writing stories that are posted on their site. In exchange I am getting a stable platform to post my works, get feedback, and work on the craft, as it were. It's an 'in-kind' symbiotic relationship. Otherwise they wouldn't bother to track that Letters has been viewed 2.3 million times.

Phrase your argument with something like Piratebay. Just because it exists on the internet for free does not mean it should be shared openly. Again, I am not able to legally profit from said work. But someone else sure is. And I'm allowed to decide if I want to contribute to that or not.

******** I love your work TE7 but I wasn't arguing about the rights you have to take down from FF at all, that is we'll within your right to demand they take down all work if it's ever your wish.

My remark was once it's out there a writer can't demand others not to share a story they love, I can see your viewpoint if others are making said money off your work but that was never my point of sharing content freely not for profit.

FF ToS like most ToS mean absolute 0 in the real world and would never hold up in any court in any country bar maybe the US. And no matter how much money you used, you would never be able to chase those sharing your content for damages.

Even chasing those sharing for profit, this would be an even shadier area as it would seem like you wish to have a piece of that profit of copyright material. Only WB and JKR will ever have the right to chase FF sharing and its removal and I hope we never see that day.

Does FF.net actually make a profit off stories or does it just manage to cover hosting is an entire other issue one I'm sure the lawyers have looked at. Do we really want to piss off our entire fanbase to remove one company making a tiny bit of money on the side? Probably not.

********* ff.net and fictionpress make money off of advertising revenue based on the number of hits on their platform. If they didn't, they likely wouldn't exist.

They're profiting off of their status as a host more directly than off of any story. I can't claim I have any inside knowledge of how they sell their add space, but I would suspect it's pretty much, "Hey X amount of people view our site every day!" They're not selling the specific content, they're selling the generalized viewership.

******* This isn't just about the author's wishes. FFnet's ToS includes the following: "C. You agree not to access User Submissions (defined below) or FanFiction.Net Content through any technology or means other than the Website itself." So those people suggesting the use of third party tools to download stories are advocating violating the ToS. That's pretty clearly in violation of rule 6.
