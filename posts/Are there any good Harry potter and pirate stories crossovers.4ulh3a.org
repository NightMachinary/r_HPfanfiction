I'd love something with swashbucklers, the open ocean, degenerate ports, buried treasure, peg-legs and parrots.

  When Harry and Hermione's visit to Godric's Hollow goes terribly wrong, they escape into a parallel world where greed and rancor rekindle an old war for the mastery of the sea. And it so happens someone they thought dead crossed too, long before they did.

** This isn't exactly what you asked for, but is an excellent POTC/HP crossover.

** I had an idea for one a while back and I had a bunch of the characters developed but couldn't find my plot. Basically it was set around 1700 and Harry is a young English man travelling to the Caribbean to find his father who was a sailor. Hermione is a bookish handmaiden to the local governors daughter, Ginny is an Anne Bonny type barmaid/eventual pirate, Ron is an average sailor who befriends Harry on the ride over. The farthest my plot got was finding out James had turned to piracy joining the Marauders one of the most notorious pirate groups on the seven seas before he had been killed in an ambush set up by Malfoy and Pettigrew who are officers of the royal navy. After that I couldn't find anything past a simple revenge story and I got distracted by other ideas.
