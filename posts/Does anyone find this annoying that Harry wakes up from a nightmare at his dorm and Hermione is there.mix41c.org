** I always imagine a creepy Hermione just standing there and watching over Harry sleeping like the possessed lady from Paranormal Activity. Maybe even her presence is the source of his nightmares.

...... I saw that movie and now I think we need something similar for wizards. A "horror" that lives up to the genre only when we fear it's not over

** The stairs leading to the girls' dorms turn into a slide when boys try to go up them, but the stairs for the boys' dorms don't turn into a slide when girls go up them. It's canon.

*** It might be so, but why would she be there when Harry wakes from nightmares?

**** Because she may have them as well and, if we're being honest here, seeing Harry, who's like her brother, would go a long way to calm her down. Same with if she was there if Ron suffered nightmares.
