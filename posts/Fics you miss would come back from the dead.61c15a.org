*** Thanks for the recommendation! I just finished Hell Eyes and loved it. It had some rough patches but was really solid. I also wish that Harry ended up with Lush instead. His thing with Enna basically disappears at the end so while the author develops Lush instead.

Regardless I loved it, but no way I'm reading 3 chapters of an abandoned sequel

**** Yeah I agree that Lush is a better love interest for Harry but I don't mind Enna because she's really temporary while Lush has eternity to spend with Harry. Consider it a period of maturation for Lush. She acted really wrongly when she raped Harry so she has around 100 years to fix her shit so she's worthy of Harry.

** linkffn(To the Waters and the Wild) I discovered this two months after the last update. "Great," I thought, "it's still being updated!" Ha. Ha. Ha. I love the humor in this, as it completely manages to avoid all the usual HP tropes.

linkao3(1155472) I still can't understand why there is a complete lack of Person A/Person B/Person A fics in Harry Potter, especially with Voldemort/Tom Riddle pairings. Horcruxes give you the perfect setup for those! But this is the hilarity of all the horcruxes completely focused on Harry (and raising him too). The author went on hiatus and never managed to get back her mojo for this story.

** Someone's already mentioned Paimpoint's /To the Waters and the Wild/ which I love as well, Harry's naivete is somehow really admirable in it.

/The Peril's of Innocence/ by Avidbeader. I'm still hopeful this one isn't quite abandoned it hasn't been updated in about 18 months.

/Harry from Another World/ by Sprinter 1988.

/By the Light of the Moon/ by MoriasDepths.

/A Different Start: An American Harry Prequel/ by DarkeStar.

/Elementary Calculations/ by KCourCat

These are just four of the 42 fics in my alerts list that haven't been updated since 2014.

/Black and Bones: A Love Story/ by JenniRose isn't on my alerts list and hasn't been updated since 2009.

/Green and Blue/ and /Second Life/ by NiaRiver who is one of my favourite authors.

/Me and Myself/ by The Funny Idiot.

These are all fics I torture myself with and reread all the time knowing I'm going to die a little inside when I reach the end. But I'm afraid it's tip of the iceberg stuff people. I could name a couple dozen more...but I won't.

  ABANDONED. Thanks to a sacrifice by his closest friend Neville Longbottom, Harry is given the chance to do it all again. What will he change and what will he keep the same? And more confusingly, are his feelings for Neville more than platonic? Harry/Neville.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  When things go wrong in one world, wizards seek help from another. Unfortunately what you want and what you get can sometimes be entirely different things. A tale featuring Harry, Hermione, Luna, Susan, Neville and a whole host of others. Loosely inspired by "The Meaning of Fear" by Rorschach's Blot. Rating for highly probable violence, and likely bad language.
