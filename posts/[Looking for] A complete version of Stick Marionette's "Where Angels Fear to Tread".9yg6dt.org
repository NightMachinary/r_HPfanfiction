It's a crime/mystery story involving a Harry who escaped from Azkaban (imprisoned for war crimes) and a Draco who became an Auror after the war. What's intriguing about this is it was written before Order of the Phoenix came out. You can see it in the details: Sirius is alive, no mentions of Luna, etc. (or maybe the author just chose to ignore OotP).

ANYWAY, I'm not sure if this is truly abandoned or there's a complete version somewhere out there. FF.net and Fiction Alley show an incomplete story. The author's notes mention a Yahoo Group (yes, it's that old) that allegedly contains the updates, but I sadly also couldn't find the group through Google.
