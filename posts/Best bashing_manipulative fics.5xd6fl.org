Yes yes, I know everybody hates these five, but I love them. What are the best bashing/manipulative fics out there? Harry pairing, but no slash or Ginny please, and sticking relative close to canon? Lao, don't mind if there's are trope she in them, you know "Lord Potter" and all that. Over 100k wording please.

Thank you!!


** You want long? You want the bashingest of bashing? Sticks relatively close to canon (using a very... generous definition of relatively close)?

Only one option.

*** This got to be the broadest bash fic.

If Arthur, Sprout, and Tonks got bashed, you can imagine the rest.

Ginny is also very different here, having to survive in that snake pit with an institutional rape culture, also known as the Slytherin house.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
