I was reading a fanfic, can't remember exactly what it was but I really enjoyed the world building. In this fic Harry went to America for the summer to learn to be an animagus and ran into not only Native American culture/myths which is common due to some of the magical beast names but folklore and local legends. In this one Ichabod Crane's descendants were all monster hunters and Harry ended up fighting a Jersey Devil. In your opinion how far is too far with adding this extra stuff? I'm not talking about authors just stuffing it into the story never to use again, but with authors who use the world they build. When does it become an AU vs world building? Could you implement angels and demons from DxD? What type of vampires could you add? Different type of shifter clans? You could also go into different regions versions of magic. Maybe the magic we see is extremely western but since Britain is so far behind America's magic is far more advanced? I love good world building so tell me you opinions and maybe your favorite fics as well.


** Well, what I did in my own fic, in regards to Harry's original world, was changing some things. Not huge, world shattering changes, but enough to switch things around, a bit.

For example, I made it so, that you can only be bonded with one wand at a time, and that you could only use a wand, that's been bonded to a blood relative, but with very limited results. I thought that was a good way, to explain why people are so very attatched to their wands.

Another thing I modified, was that only the most powerful magicals, can use certain spells. The Avada Kedavra, for example, can only be used by the most powerful of mages. A snivelling little shit, like Pettigrew can't hope to do so. I always thought the AK was a bit easy, so in my fic, one would only encounter it very rarely.

In my world, you have to concentrate very hard, and picture your destination accurately to Apparate, so doing it, when you're in a fight is extremely risky and no one does it, except someone like Riddle, for example.

See what I'm saying? Fairly small changes, and I expand on some things. Like giving the Veela a bit of a backstory, making magical beasts, and beings very magic resistant, and so on. The vampires in my fic only need the blood of mammals, and not humans...

And I brought in things like Leshen, from the Witcher, because I thought it would fit in well, for a certain place Harry travels to, in search of one of the Horcuxes.

I would say small stuff like that, do not merit an AU tag.
