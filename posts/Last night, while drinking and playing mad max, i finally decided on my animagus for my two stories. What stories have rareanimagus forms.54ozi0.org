In darkness!harry, if the animagus becomes necessary plotwise, he'll end up becoming an andrewsarchus and it will necessitate a frantic search by hermione to find the information necessary for him to turn back (cuz my animagus transformation protocol will require an incredible knowledge of the creature to safely turn back after the initial transformation).

In my sttng crossover, Harry will already have learned to be a Utahraptor and it becomes necessary to use when he's trapped on a Voth controlled planet.

Are you sure you want to use andrewsarchus with this requirement? A quick [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrewsarchus#Discovery][wikipedia search]] shows that this animal is known only by a single skull (and an incomplete one at that), and no full skeleton has ever been found. Any images you see are merely an extrapolation of data based on similar skulls in an extinct family of mammals.

How will Hermione gain incredible knowledge of the creature if they don't even have a full skeleton? Much less the musculature, nervous system or any other soft tissues of the creature. You'd be better off going with (at the very least) something with a complete skeleton, or even better, something with close extant relatives so that soft tissues can be estimated with greater detail.

Also, to fulfill your request linkffn(Harry Mewter)

*** That's one of the reasons why. They'll have to use muggle methods, magical methods, and brute force to gain the info so Harry can turn back.

Explain how this would be done with a single incomplete skull. I can't help but think the only reason you chose this particular animal is because you read an article saying andrewsarchus is the "Largest predatory mammal."

Sometimes it's a good idea to go with something a little less "cool" so the story actually makes sense.

***** Harry will be in the form already having thought that the form was a tiger and it was safe to complete the transformation.

They'll use xrays, millimeter scans, mris, and so on and then, using a magical ability from a story that was abandoned i think, something called a cauldron clone, an incredibly dark potion that creates a clone of a person that they'll then dissect to get the information as the final resort when all the muggle ideas hermione and sophie suggests aren't enough.

Also, in the darkness!harry stories, time-travel and an already established parallel world full of extant prehistoric creatures means i could easily just say that Harry has access to a living andrewsarchus.
