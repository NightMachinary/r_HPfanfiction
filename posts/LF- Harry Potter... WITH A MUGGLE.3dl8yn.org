hey guys, I hope you like the semi-creative title. Its actually fairly accurate. I would love to read another story with Harry being with a muggle. Maybe the one from the cafe in HBP? I like the fact that Harry with a muggle could go so many ways in Fanfiction. I do ask that it not be slash and be complete. I dont really care about length. I do not want slash because if I wanted Slash I would click the sacrifices arc tab I have pinned to my browser... lol THANKS IN ADVANCE

****** Harry goes on the run from Dumbledore and the order. He becomes friends with a muggle girl from primary and their relationship progresses from there despite the fact that the muggle girl is kinda shady. It's worth noting that the subplot is RL/NT so if that's not your cup of tea you might not like it.

**** Harry is framed for a crime and spends 10 years in Azkaban. During this time the dementor exposure lets his link to Voldie intensify, so he sees pretty much everything that happens during that time.

When he eventually gets out hes bitter. His friends betrayed him by not beliveing him, and he was forced to sit in a cell alone for 10 years watching Voldemort plan and execute without being able to help so he is left very bitter. So once he gets out he kills Voldemort right away then abandons the wizarding world.

This is all the beginning so it isn't much of a spoiler. The story is about his reintroduction.

**** No, but it has more than a bit of bitterness and angst. It's not the greatest story out there, but fits the OP's request. Harry marries a Muggle and lives in the Muggle world until events draw him back into the Wizarding world.

The Weasleys (in general) and Dumbledore are treated fairly.
