I don't really like slash as the main pairing(s) but I'll read it if it's mentioned. Otherwise, I'm cool with most pairings or a lack of pairings is fine too. As long as it's really well written, I'm interested! Read so much that it's hard finding good stories!!

** If not epilogue compliant, definitely *The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167). It's probably the only dark lord Harry fic with his canon friends joining on his quest, and still keeping everyone in their canon characters.

** I have a question for you- why do you like canon-compliant fics? I personally detest them because if I wanted to read canon, I would read the series again.

Just so I don't get a hundred downvotes (Does this community hate me?) I am saying right now i'm not hating, just asking a question.

*** I think there's also some question as to just what 'canon compliant' even means.

Are we talking 'nothing in the fic contradicts anything in the books' or 'everything in the books happened as written and then the story starts after DH'

I've seen it used both ways.

** linkffn(Divergence by abovetheserpentine)

It's kinda long and I really thought it was well done. It's a time travel AU with Hermione as the lead. Everything that happened in the books happened in this one but instead of ending up on the platform with Ron, Hermione ends up traveling back in time to the Marauders' era because of reasons the author explains eventually.

linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewels5)

This one is one of my favorites but is, sadly, incomplete. It felt like the story was wrapping up soon anyways so it wasn't terrible but I read it not noticing it was incomplete so I was disappointed. It tries really hard to be canon compliant but I think a few liberties were taken. It's again Marauders' era. Sirius is my favorite part about this one.

I can't think of more off the top of my head but I'll come back to this if I find the time.
