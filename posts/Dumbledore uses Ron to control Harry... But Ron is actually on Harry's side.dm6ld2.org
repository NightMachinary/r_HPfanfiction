A subversion of the usual trope where a manipulative Dumbledore uses Ron to control Harry: Ron is just /pretending/ to be a fake friend, is a real friend of Harry (either by becoming the mask or being that way from the start) and is a sort of double agent not unlike Snape.

Touched on. After Sirius falls through the veil, Col. Jack O'Neill of SG-1 wakes up with Sirus' memories. Jack rescues his godson from the incompetents in Britain. Dumbledore is desperate to get Harry back and uses his usual 'trust me and do what I say' shtick. Ron points out in an Order meeting that that sounds a little Dark Lordy, and what a coincidence the last person who'd have authority over Harry was sent to prison for life, and then later killed.

  >! Bill sat down on the edge of the bed. "Tell me, Ron, Do you trust Dumbledore?"!<

  ...

  Ron snorted. "Will I am pretty sure that everyone knows my opinion of the Headmaster since I compared him to the Dark Lord."

  Bill blinked a couple of times in surprise.

  Taking Bill's silence as a sign to continue. "While I do not believe I will find myself in Azkaban like Sirius, especially after I mentioned that option in the meeting; I would not be surprise if I had an accident while at Hogwarts."

  "Accident?" Bill said.

  "Quidditch accident. Potions accident. Falling from the stairs because they moved suddenly. Serving a detention in the Forbidden Forest. A prank that goes wrong," Ron listed off a number of possible accidents. "I am sure that it will not be something deadly just in case someone remembers that I suggested that Dumbledore would arrange for me to be removed like Sirius was. It will probably be something that will take a long time to recover from or something that would cause me to join Neville's parents in St. Mungo's."

  HP-SG1 Magic can make anything possible and when you mix in SG1 it's a guarantee that the impossible will happen.
