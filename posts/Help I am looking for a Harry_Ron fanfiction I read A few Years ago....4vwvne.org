Hello! I know it's going to be a long shot but I read a fanfiction quite awhile ago, probably after the Half Blood Prince was released. It was a Harry/Ron fanfiction, where Harry was sorted into Slytherin. He misread Ron's attempt to be friendly and when Draco offered him to be friends with "the right sort" he took his offer without quite knowing what that meant. So, the first few chapters deal with Harry trying to get back to Ron to explain that he was being polite, and didn't agree with the pure blood BS, etc etc. The fic is very indepth and goes along with the events of the story as best as she can; ie: Ginny being taken into the Chamber of Secrets, trials of the Goblet of Fire etc. I believe it is after the events of the Chamber of Secrets Ron and Harry begin to be friends, and then some? Harry's aunt and uncle are legit abusive, so Harry moves in with Sirius. Sirius/Remus also happen and Sirius inherited and is living at the Black Estate (don't remember where?) and they are cleaning up the estate. Author goes into detail with coursework and classes at Hogwarts that aren't listed in the actual books. I remember Harry struggling with Snape teaching him Occlumency and non verbal spells. Harry is struggling with both, obviously. The fanfic is especially huge, the writer has her own blog organized with several other fics she's written. I want to say her name was something about Moons? I'm not sure but I've been searching and failing for a few years. I have no idea if I found her on fanfiction.net or not... It'd be great to have a next step in the right direction~ Thanks in advance! <3


** I hope someone finds it.
