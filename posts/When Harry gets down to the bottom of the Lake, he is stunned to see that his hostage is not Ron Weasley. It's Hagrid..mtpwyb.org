**** gonna be honest, if someone took my pet, chained it in a cold lake in the middle of winter that is filled with magical and non-magical predators, heads will be rolling. Even if they 'magically protected her'

** Counter Prompt: They tried to make Hagrid the hostage, but they couldn't enchant him to sleep and nobody was willing to try and subdue him when he refused to participate. So they're forced to improvise at the last minute, and I do mean the literal last minute. So what do they do? Who or what do they panic-choose as the thing Harry will miss?

*** Ludo Bagman suddenly remembers that Harry Potter is an infamous Quiddich fanatic and they decide to take Harry's beloved mentor- Puddlemere United's newly hired keeper Oliver Wood. Puddlemere's management claims it's an act of Sabotage by Bulgarian Quiddich Superstar Viktor Krum who they claim also entered Harry Potter and Cedric Diggory as a ploy to sabotage the hiring pool for British Seekers.

This brings in an array of Quiddich League Bigshots all of whom sponsor one of the Triwizard champions, attempting to offer unsolicited advice and support. Unfortunately Ron faces a crisis of loyalty when Wood gets Puddlemere to back Harry and the Chudley Cannons side with Cedric
