Because HP fanfiction has been going along for almost 20 years and counting, there have been a wide variety of fansites and communities hosting HP fanfiction. I would like to see what fics the people here like from these other websites and hopefully introduce some sense of history into this community as i suspect a good many of these fics would come from the heydey between the release of Phoenix and Deathly Hallows.

Examples of websites active and inactive are LiveJournal communities, Fictionalley, mugglenet, SIYE, the qudditch pitch and more.


** I got two:

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=329137][Year Five]] - Over on the new and improved HPFF (love the new design btw if any of the team see this) - Basically a Canon-ish story that deals with typical teenage issues, set in the background of Philosophers Stone. Really well written I thought and broke a long streak for me of not finishing any Fanfiction. Wish there were more original stories like this around but they are so hard to find!

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/la_reine_noire/BAMSR.html][Be All My Secrets Remembered]] - Fiction Alley - is one of the better Marauder Fics iv read in a while

** Oooh, I've got one, it's one of those ones that is on its own site: [[https://lop.shoesforindustry.net/][Lust Over Pendle]] which is the only slash fiction I've ever read and enjoyed, and gives Augusta Longbottom the badass backstory she richly deserves. It's part of a whole series, and yes, it's pre-DH so the Voldemort War turned out very diferent.
