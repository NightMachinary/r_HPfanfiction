I'm interested in reading some well written original character romance fiction (het, no slash please). Severus or Sirius paired with an original character, any cannon characters other than Harry or Ron would interest me really. I understand how few and far between these fics are, so, any recommendations would be appreciated.


** The Family Clock, by Jan McNeville

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/1724293/1/The-Family-Clock]]

Ever think of the Weasleys' clock? A wizarding watchmaker makes friends with our favorite twins in an answer to the Great Mary Sue Problem. Rating is upped one, just to be safe.

"Any witch or wizard in Britain and most goblins knew, if you wanted a clock, you went to Jas. W. Tickes and Sons, in either their elegant but small Diagon Alley premises, or in the larger Hogsmeade showplace."

The first chapter reads like a one-shot, but then the author just kinda kept going. Which is great, because she's an excellent writer.

This is my fic. It's Neville/OC, with the OC being Draco Malfoy's twin sister. It also takes place 6th year after Draco was given is task by Voldemort. It's still a work in progress and currently is over 300,000 words. It's very romance/ hurt and comfort. It's also Slytherin sympathetic.

*** Hey, just the person to ask then! I've seen this fic recommended around here and there, and have always been hesitant to read it because I find Neville in cannon to be frustratingly pathetic.

Does your fic change this up? I don't mind reading fics with different main characters besides Harry, I just don't like wimps as the protagonist.

**** No, I don't believe I've written him as a wimp. He's still Neville, but he's developing into the man that will lead the DA in the final battle. I'm just writing more about that development. So he still has moments where he is unsure of himself and self-conscious, but this fic also takes place after he went with Harry to battle at the ministry and that experience shows through. For example in the beginning chapters he is still allowing himself to get pushed around, but he doesn't stay that way. (For example in a recent chapter he talked back to his gran unapologetically also he took his wand to Draco) He definitely is a different character, but I didn't just start writing him that way. I think if you read it you will like it. I've not had anyone tell me they disliked the way I've portrayed his character.

  As Sirius led me around the room, I took a deep breath. "So, was it a bet or a dare?" "What do you mean?" he asked. When his eyes drifted to James I grinned. "Don't play dumb. You'd never ask me to dance in a million years. Besides, Potter just gave you the thumbs up." He groaned. "Are we really that obvious? OK yes, it was a dare."

No happy ending.

** Children of the Revolution, by Istani

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5747096/1/Children-of-the-Revolution]]

It is a long-branching Severus/OC focusing on Hogwart's social structure, teenage escapades, muggle rock music, the rise of Voldemort, and later the intricacies of the war effort and relationships in general. The story grows with the characters within it, and for once, a muggleborn OC named Raven Lestrange (last name given to her by her stage magician father) is not Mary Sue at all.

I highly recommend it.

** Its writing is a little clunky at times, but here's an old Severus/OC series that's quite long (the writing gets better as you go):

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/916800/1/Jennifer-Craw-and-the-Phoenix-Wand-1]]

OC is a new professor at Hogwarts who has a unique ability. Mostly a good read because of the length of the series, with each one representing a year at Hogwarts and a fairly interesting story. It starts after the 4th book and replaces the rest of the canon series from there (it was written before the books were completed).
