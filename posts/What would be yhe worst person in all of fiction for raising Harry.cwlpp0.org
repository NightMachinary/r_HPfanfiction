Say worst characters in literature, TV, Anime, Comic, Webcomic or Web Original.


** For the potterfandom I'd like to nominate canon Bellatrix. For one, she lives in Azkaban. Second: she's insane. Also she hates Harry and likes to cruco ppl she's not fond of. On a wider scale there are just too many bad possibilities.

** In the HP universe, Umbridge. There's various people with the potential to turn to utter shit (Malfoys for example), but there's a significant probability of Harry turning out happy in those cases. Of course, turning into a happy person doesn't mean he'd turn out into a /good/ person. But I have a very hard time seeing Harry ever becoming happy under Umbridge.

** I'll interpret 'raising' Harry as meaning that Harry survives to adulthood and independence with both reasonable physical health and the mental and emotional capacity to function.

Also note that Harry's ability to retain positive emotions and relate to people despite abuse is literally his superpower.

I'm going to go with a dark horse and say Carrie's mother, from Carrie. Because the only thing that would tear Harry up worse than an abusive parent would be an abusive parent /who favors Harry and abuses someone he loves instead./

Carrie's mother is a religious nutcase, and religion isn't technically a bad thing to instill into your child, so I don't think the 'power he knows not' would result in Harry rejecting most of the tenets of Christianity. This might lead to him refusing Hogwarts, mostly of his own free will, with perhaps some urging from his mother. On the other hand, Margaret White is misogynistic and would be routinely abusing Carrie in front of Harry, while treating Harry better. Harry and Carrie would discover their supernatural abilities at different points in their life, which would further complicate things, especially if Harry is urged into Hogwarts by Dumbledore, leaving Carrie to fend for herself for three months out of the year.

Imagine a Harry who views attending Hogwarts as both a sin and as abandoning his sister to vicious abuse.

***** No, I mean Harry would be at Hogwarts 9-10 months out of the year, leaving Carrie alone with the mother for that period... unless I'm misunderstanding what's going on.

** The Longbottoms (Augusta and Algie).

For canon evidence of all the problems that little Neville had (yes, he later adquire trust in himself and goes pretty badass, but not thanks to his gradmother and family).

Imagine Harry trying to do the Patronus with James Potter wand: result: Harry, Hermione and Sirius kissed. Or, maybe, if he get lucky (he always is), he could had James Potter wand broken into the troll nose already...

** Elza from Frozen- considering she got so scared of her elemental Powers that she shut herself in and emotionally isolantes herself from her sister, she would be freaked out by Harry accidental Magic...

As It took years for her to "let It Go" and embrace her Powers, Harry would have been, by then, raised by an army of nameless servants. (Maybe Anna would want to play with him, but since Elza would be afraid of what Harry Magic could do, she would probably forbid any interaction)

** If sticking within the fandom of HP, then:

Canon-Snape! The guy hates his students - especially Gryffindors and Harry himself and Harry is well Harry and a Gryffindor! Not to mention that Snape seems super-depressed (otherwise he'd take care of himself better, especially his greasy hair!) and self-loathing, not a good combination to raise a child!

Otherwise?

Hm...Senator Kinsey from Stargate :D (damn, I'd love to read that fanfiction - a selfish, politically savy Harry who would rather like to return to the US than stay in "boring and stupid" Britain and who might also know about the Stargate!)
