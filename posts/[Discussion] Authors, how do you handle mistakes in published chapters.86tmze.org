We all humans, we all make mistakes. Even after several proof readings some mistakes can go into a published work.

So my question is how do you handle them?

I'm not talking about gramma or style, but more about plot, continuity or character personalities.

For example:

- in a new chapter something happens that contradicts earlier chapters;
- or your character does something that look alright on the first sight, but after publishing you or some reviewer makes a note that it OOC and move the character where you don't want;
- or readers see in the plot or characters something different from what you wanted to show;
- etc.

How do you handle such and similar cases? Do you ignore them and continue as nothing happened? Do you incorporating those changes in the story? Or do you rewriting/fixing the mistakes?


** Edit it. And if it's big enough, tell the readers in the A/N of the next chapter. I have an outline and it still happens to me.

**** Does it matter? You have to think about the bigger picture. When I release a chapter, it gets around 800-1000 views on the first day. If I make a change, the next few thousand readers will definitly read the reworked version and that number is significantly larger. Worst case scenario, delete the chapter and reupload if you really made significant changes (like someone not dying or stuff of similar magnitude).

As for fixing typos or changing minor stuff (how a room looks). Just change it, no one will remember the details and if it is really necessary, drop a reference to the updated version in the next chapter and the three people who remember it differently will go back, see that it is not like they remembered and shrug it off.

***** This is the question I'm asking.

If you are changing the already published chapters it means there's no sense if following the story until it's complete.

At the same time the first reviews are about old version, so they may be wrong.

What is the goal? What is more important?

****** Don't make those huge mistakes in the first place. The biggest change I have ever made is cutting a somewhat redundant dialogue part from 1.2k words down to 300, but even that did not really "change" the story much, it just increased readability and removed a few somewhat obvious insights about Harry's thoughts.

I do a lot of edits to my works, but 95% of them are either fixing the odd typo here and there or small changes to wording, when I had an idea after waking up. For all intents and purposes, it is still the same story.

And I think that updating your stories as you get better at writing is quintessential. When I took a look at my first one-shot after publishing 30k words, I was shocked how bad it was. I could do better so I fixed it because it was not the written to the best of my increased abilities. Same goes for the early chapters of my other stories. While the content did not change much, they are now far more polished and yet, I'm sure that I will revamp them again at some point.

** I've rescinded a bad chapter after reviewers called me on it, and rewrote it entirely. Thanked the reviewers for it in an author's note. If I make a significant change in a prior chapter, I'll mention it in an author's note to let continuing readers know of it.

In the end, your story will be re-read and read anew, so if you feel a change is needed, you should put it in. The great/awful thing about fanfiction is that the readers are the final editorial oversight.

** I do finish stories before I start posting, so hopefully any major plot points have already been sorted out. Characterisation and interpretation is more subjective but if I think the commenter has a point I might well make some changes. If a mistake is pointed out and it's definitely a mistake (an inconsistency or canon error, something like that) I go and fix it asap. Frankly I'd be embarrassed to leave it.

** In the first chapter, I'll usually put up an author's note encouraging people to send in mistakes they see, whether it's just spelling mistakes, or even plot holes. I'll go back and edit all the grammar mistakes. I don't usually use a beta, so outside eyes always help. But for bigger stuff, it is what it is. I'm not going to rework 5k words on the whim of a reader, but if it's a quick fix, I'll at least think about it. Once the story is complete, I usually don't go back and do anything.

** If it's just typos, I usually won't bother unless it's something that significantly detracts from the clarity of the chapter.

#+begin_quote
  in a new chapter something happens that contradicts earlier chapters;
#+end_quote

When this has happened, it's usually minor enough that I can do a quick fix by changing a few words. It might be a bit clumsy, but I'll do a small edit.

#+begin_quote
  or your character does something that look alright on the first sight, but after publishing you or some reviewer makes a note that it OOC and move the character where you don't want;
#+end_quote

I think there's been twice that this has been serious enough for me to go back and do a major rewrite. There have been times when I've been called out on OOC actions, and I had to change it. But most of the time, I have a pretty good handle on where I want the characters to go. Thus:

#+begin_quote
  or readers see in the plot or characters something different from what you wanted to show;
#+end_quote

If the reviews are angry about the direction I took the plot or see a character more negatively than I intended, I'll usually defend my position in an Author's Note, and I will often change future chapters to mitigate the problem. I rarely see the need to change published chapters, though.

*** Don't you think that author's notes isn't the best way of clarifying your position?

As a reader I think that the story itself should contain everything an author wants to express. Ideally author's notes can be deleted without affecting the story in any way.

If you note that it is wrong, change it. But don't go change stuff just because some readers are bitching about it. In the recent chapter of "Dawn of Darkness", I had Harry caught at the wrong time at the wrong place and a pair of Hit Wizards, who promptly assume he is guilty and talk about getting him on a fast track to Azkaban. More than one reviewer pointed out that they cannot do that or that it was wrong.

Hit Wizards were the ones who arrested Sirius Black despite him being the best friend of the Potters just because he looked kinda guilty. You know, the guy who unjustly spent a decade in Azkaban. I am not going to change that part because people expect "the bad guys" to act fair.

*** I see what you are talking about.

And you raised an interesting case. Below I'm not asking about your plot, but about how you're handling logic of your reviewers.

Using common sense and parallels with the real world we can conclude that the Hit Wizards are just special forces. They can't make decisions about sending a person to prison. In case of Sirius all decisions were made on the level of the Minister (PoA) or head of the DMLE.

How are you dealing with reasons like this one, which appeals to appropriate analogues from real world?

**** Well, in the plot I have written, the Minister (Scrimgeour) uses his executive powers to restructure the DMLE, dissolves the "ineffective" Auror corps and integrates them into the Hit Wizards. That would be sacking the local authorities and sending in the federal/special forces. Simultaneously, he makes some grand announcement, asking the Wizengamot to codify those changes after the winter break, since he is not a wannabe dictator but someone driven to use drastic measures in the face of a dire threat.

He then gives them the order to "clean house" and take care of all opposing the Ministry. One of the non-Death Eater suspects is under observation and bumps into Harry. The suspect is prying for some information and Harry, seeing that he is not dealing with a Death Eater, relaxes and is therefore caught with his pants down when the Hit Wizards arrive. They find a powerful, dark artefact on the suspect and after watching the interaction from a distance it looks like Harry wanted to buy it. To use an analogue, they are taking down a large-scale drug operation and someone caught on scene is claiming that he did not want to buy the briefcase full of Columbian White.

One of the Hit Wizards is from the Nott family, known supporters of Voldemort. She sees an opportunity to do something about Harry Potter and putting him into Azkaban means putting him on a silver plate for Voldemort. She presents her interpretation of the situation to her partner (Johnson) and since the evidence is there, he takes the word of his partner over the word of a suspect, stating that the court will sort that out. He does not understand Harry's reluctance since the Black case is not on his mind and Johnson is kinda the naive, good-meaning cop. Meanwhile Nott would be a corrupt cop abusing his power to help her mobster boss take care of an enemy.

Is that legal or good? Hell no. But, that's life and there is a canon precedent which paints that kind of scenario as possible.

From your previous comment I concluded (it seems as some readers) that average Hit Wizards do have the authority to put suspects into Azkaban. That your comment and this one are vey different.

****** Well, I might be biased due to cop shows here, but I can totally see a police officer telling a suspect that they will end up in prison since all evidence makes them look guilty. By handing over solid evidence and the suspect they are basically throwing people into prison, where they await trial.

And history is full of services which were police, judge, Jury and executioner. The NKVD, the Gestapo and the KGB, just to name a few. While the Hot Wizards don't have the authority to just take people to the next corner and put them im front of a firing squad, they aren't simply the town police either.

******** Considering that I had Slughorn brutally robbed and murdered in his office and a couple reviewers concluded that he drank the poisoned mead, I think that's the issue. People are expecting the average, trope filled fanfic and I'm writing a story unlike any I've seen in this fandom (that's why I'm writing it in the first place), there seems to be a disparity between expectations and writing because I'm doing something different than the usual fare.

** Ahaha okay sothis is the dilemma that's been bothering me for months. The first 4 chapters of our fic, the first one is fine (my-cowriter did a wonderful job) but the second and third, I hadn't written the characters or fic in general in the universe in a long time and they stick out like sore thumbs. We got our groove back from around 4 or 5, but whenever I go back to reread (it's like 200k, when you have that much, rereading is essential for canon keeping) but I constantly wonder if we should go back and rewrite those couple of chapters now we're both more comfortable because honestly I'm not proud of them at all.

**** Haven't had that happen yet. But I would think so, yes - internal consistency is important to me. However, I would likely look for a way to correct a mistake that doesn't require rewriting the plot. Once I had Nagini kill Snape despite Nagini having been killed earlier in the story. I fixed that - but it didn't lead to Snape surviving; since he was facing Voldemort at the time anyway, he simply got killed in a different way.

** In the first installment of my "A World Unseen" series (Vol I and Vol II), I came up with some worldbuilding details after the fact, which I had brought up in Vol II, with a bit of fridge brilliance in that the characters in Vol I already knew all that, but the character to whom the details are explained to in Vol II is a muggleborn going to Diagon Alley for the first time, and thus doesn't know the details.

** Barring small typos I find while re-reading chapters, my personal rule is not to fix mistakes. The keyword there is personal; I'm a perfectionist, and if I allowed myself to go back and constantly tweak already published chapters, I'd never get anything new done. It's also a personal growth thing, learning to accept my mistakes and move on.

That said, the exception I allow is the first chapter of my fic, Girl in Red. It's the first impression readers have, so I want it to be good.

My beta catches most of the crap I try and pass off as "making perfect sense in my head", and I keep a comfortable pad so I have some wiggle room when I'm writing something that turns out didn't work.

I don't get many reviews, so I can't speak on that topic.

Ultimately, the advice I will give is this: try to incorporate the changes into your story, if at all possible. Trying to figure out why one of your characters acted strangely may help stimulate your creativity, or it may frustrate you to no end. Either way, I think internal consistency is important. Readers lose part of their connection with a character if established events around that character constantly change (unless that change itself is part of the story).
