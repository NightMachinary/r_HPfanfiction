** Almost ~50k words, oh my.

I'm so happy, the author always makes the infrequent update schedule worth it when they happen. These chapters are like giant burritos, I can hardly fit them in my mouth.

*** This is an update to Book 4. Book 1 is The Pureblood Pretense. linkffn(7613196)

WARNING: This fic is really, REALLY tropey. It has many of the tropes of bad, cookie-cutter Indy!Harry fanfic. (Magical Cores, arranged marriages, auras, creature inheritances, pureblood politics, Noble and Most Ancient Houses, and Junior Politician 11 year olds are a thing.) Book 1 goes real heavy on the exposition to explain the differences of Harry's world. But it has fun, likeable characters who are OOC from the HP originals, but are still pretty entertaining.

Harry is a halfblood girl trying to get ahead in a prejudiced world by pretending to be a pureblood boy. The premise itself is unusual; there's a struggle, conflict, and avoiding the plot railroading and Idiot Balls of canon, there's a legitimate reason why Harry can't solve all her problems by telling an adult. (Identity theft is illegal and a one-way trip to Azkaban, basically.) The dramatic irony and tension it creates makes this fic a pageturner. Will people find out? What will happen to Harry next? Who can she trust??? The writing and characterization is good, and gets better by the later chapters, as the chapters themselves get longer.... which is where you have 50k word long chapters by Book 4.

The worldbuilding is EXCELLENT. At first you might miss original HP, but this AU take is just as rich and fully-fleshed so you end up not caring that it's not a copy of what you're used to. If there is a downside to this fic, it's that the main character has to be ultra-competent to be able to pull this trick off at age 11. Harry is competent and clever, and to fit her into the cast of characters, everyone else is competent too. Up to the point of utter /ridiculousness,/ where 11 year old children have the dialogue of a 40 year old banker.

You have to suspend your disbelief to get into this story (Who the hell thinks that limiting Hogwarts enrollment to pureblood only is a good idea? Purebloods are a tiny fraction of the wizarding population) so it can be hit or miss from the start.

...But if you give it a go, and accept the canon changes and cheesy central plot devices, this is an addicting story.

*** Yes! It's seriously amazing, The author once said that she wanted to subvert expectations and write a good female!Harry fic, and she's done that wonderfully (along with all the other tropes). You do have to suspend disbelief at the maturity level of 11 year olds in the beginning, but it's actually explained later on. The world building and character development are superb. In the author's words, the story is "both entertaining and moving, realistic and fantastical at turns." I couldn't recommend it enough.

  Harriet Potter is back for a fourth year of quietly masquerading as her pureblooded cousin in order to pursue her dream. There are those in the Wizarding World who refuse to see her fade into the background, however, and when the forces she's been ignoring conspire to bring her to the fore, it will take everything she has to see her artifice through. Alanna the Lioness take on HP4.
