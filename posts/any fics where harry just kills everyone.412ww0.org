  Time and time again the Bad Guys do bad things and get away with it. Time and time again the Good Guys take the low blow and just soldier on with their upper lips stiff. What might happen if someone couldn't hold it together? How would Magical Britain react? More to the point; who would they blame? A little One-Shot in documentary style.

*** Eh. This fic has an interesting idea, but terrible, cliche-ridden execution. The author is more interested in using fanon to pick apart canon's plot holes than the actual story of Neville, it seems.

**** Fair... but that might be what OP wants given that he's apparently looking for a Harry that loses his shit and kills everyone.

*** I somehow suspected a local madman to be behind all threadmurdering in this subreddit. But a new user of interest has turned up in my investigation.

/EDIT/

There has to be a better joke in there, but my sleep deprived mind can't figure it out.

It also happens in the third volume of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, but we don't actually see it in action, and I badly want someone to write it.

  After the war ends, Neville is visited by a friend he thought dead. An experiment in a darker style of writing by the author. Feedback appreciated. One shot. DARK FIC! DARK EVIL HERMIONE! MAJOR CHARACTER DEATHS! Revised 8/13/2014

  Left a Squib when Voldemort was vanquished, Harry Potter is left with the Dursleys with a letter stressing he cannot use magic. However, things go awry and he finds himself with another gift, and abandoned. Found by Harlan Wade, what will happen now? Graphic content, you are warned!
