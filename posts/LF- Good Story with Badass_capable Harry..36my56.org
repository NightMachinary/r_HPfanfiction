Hello all, as you have probably guessed from the title post, I am interested in a story that has Harry kicking ass and taking names (for lack of a more eloquent way of stating it.) Keeping such things in mind, I would prefer the stories to be at least 60K, and not abandoned, if they are unfinished. (Abandoned by my personal definition is 6 Months with no info on the story, or why there is no update). I also want Harry to not be unbeatable. I have read Taking Control, MoR, Denarian Series, The Sword of the Hero series, among others. Thank you for your suggestions in advance!

** Have you read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Wastelands of Time?]] It's less Harry and more Badass!Harry from the future, but an excellent read

** As with every such question: Read Jbern! The lie ive lived(which Ive reread maybe 10 times now), Bungle in the Jungle and To fight the oncoming Darkness are the best in the biz at this sorta stuff.

*** I love Jbern! Isn't there a saying in the community that goes if in doubt, read Jbern? I have reread The Lie I've Lived atleast 10 times. The same with To Fight the Oncoming Darkness (was my first Fanfic of the HP fandom. ruined me. Now I can't read anything unless its atleast 60k words just so the chance of good writing increases.)
