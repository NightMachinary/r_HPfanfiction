I read this AMAZING fic called Gypsy Caravan [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8243003/1/Gypsy-Caravan]] 5-year-old Harry Potter overhears his aunt complaining to his uncle about the "freaks" camping nearby. Maybe if they are the same type of "freak" he is they will want him? it is soooo awesome but I could not find a good place to put it so I made my own post and I beg you to read it and if you have read it tell me your thoughts linkffn(Gypsy Caravan)


** That is one I have on my kindle and re-read frequently. It's a great story.

*** I gave it a solid try, I've gotten to chapter 30 out of 84..but this just isn't for me :/

In 30 chapters, it's only been about 3 or 4 weeks. Normally I can appreciate a slow pace, but I don't think it's quite necessary in this case to go day-by-day. I love new takes in Harry's childhood, but it has to fallow a believable pattern. Like the story where Harry thinks he must be an elf and go lives in the woods and makes bargains, or joins an urban orphan group and hints forbmagical items. I'm fine with any new development, if it follows a believable route from where it diverges. But here, a few days after staying with them, the gypsy caravan spoiler gets owls from all characters in the hp fandom at the same exact time? (Weasleys, Prewetts, Snape, Diggory and Flourish & Blots) Idk why, but that's what kinda drew the line for me in believability. I still gave it a chance after, but 15 chapters more didn't help.

I can see why you like it, it is a different take on how his childhood could go...but it's just not for me. Thanks for the rec though!
