Anyone got tips on writing Dumbledore's speech? I'm not convinced I've got him down pat; there's a pattern to his dialogue in canon that really epitomises the idea of the Wise Old Wizard(TM). I'm going back over examples of his dialogue from the books to help, but other advice will be welcome too (or even just examples of your favourite Dumbledore dialogue in fanfiction). I'd /prefer/ benevolent!Dumbledore but if you know of a particularly eloquent evil!Dumbles then I'll still take a look.

Here are some examples from my draft of his speech, for reference:

#+begin_quote
  "Tastes magical, doesn't it Harry?" said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling over his half-moon spectacles. "Barnabus here never had a talent for wands. His family disowned him, thinking him a squib - one from a wizarding background with barely any magical affinity. His magic is rather unconventional, and lends itself well to his love of cooking."

  ***

  “Harry, Tilly is a house elf. Her greatest joy is to work and care for people, and she will help you around the house until the start of term. I know you have a lot of questions, and I shall endeavour to answer as many as I can in the next few weeks. If you think of any while I am away working, write them down and we will go through them on my return. With your permission, I may bring the occasional visitor to see you.”

  “Now, this is by no means a prison. You may leave the house if you like, but I would like you to stay nearby and only go outside under a glamour from Tilly. Try to avoid crowded areas, as she will find it much harder to keep you disguised when around many people.” He looked longingly out of the window. “You may find the woods interesting to roam in the day. Tilly or myself will accompany you to make sure you come to no harm.”

  “I'm sorry that I have to leave you so soon, Harry, but I will be back before long. Tilly knows how to reach me should you wish to send a message.” His face darkened as he stood up straight. “But first, I have a reckoning to deliver.”

  ***

  "There's a lot you need to know before starting at Hogwarts in September, so I apologise in advance if you feel I am drowning you in new information. Don't hesitate to ask me for clarification - although as Headmaster I rarely teach classes these days, I do very much enjoy educating the youth of today." Harry nodded quietly as he absently stroked Sesame's cool scales.

  ***

  "Unfortunately, several Parselmouths of the last few centuries became Dark Wizards or Witches. Now, from what I know of the skill, the language in and of itself does not make one susceptible to such corruption." Harry's palpable look of relief was obvious here. "However, the rarity of the gift has developed a certain mythos around it. The average laymage will likely link the skill to the practitioners of the Dark Arts. Whether or not you reveal your gift to others is entirely up to you. However, I felt you should be aware of this so that you may make an informed decision."

  ***

  “When I was a boy, I lived here with my mother, and my younger brother and sister: Aberforth and Ariana. After my mother passed on, I was made head of the family. An accident here led to the death of my sister soon afterwards.”

  “I... I'm sorry for asking, Sir.”

  “Harry, do not worry. I am glad that I brought you here, for you have brought newer, happier memories to a place I thought would always be filled with sadness. If I may, I might try to bring Aberforth here soon to see what you've done with the place.”

** Your Dumbledore is far more direct than I would expect. Even when he was dying Dumbledore took his time. He was a true teacher. I was once told you can't teach anyone anything, you can only point them in the right direction. Dumbledore in the 6th book was the epitome of that. He made Harry watch the memories, draw conclusions and then challenged them to make sure Harry understood what he was saying. Very rarely does Dumbledore give answers, he's more likely to point you in the right direction to find your own answers. Would he tell Harry all that your Dumbledore told him or would he encourage Harry to ask questions and explore by himself? Maybe the directness is due to time constraints but I can't really think of a time Dumbledore was rushed doing anything.

This is better than most Dumbledores. I think it's about 80% of the way there, but it's too information-dense. At this point if Harry doesn't know what a squib is, Harry should interrupt Dumbledore and ask what it means. "A squib, sir?" Harry asked. Etc.

This dialogue seems like it's working too hard to advance the plot. It needs more of Dumbledore's character. I'm realizing as I read your stuff trying to figure out what seems off (and it's just a little bit off, not a lot), in canon Dumbledore doesn't really introduce much new information. We love him because he finally provides answers to questions Harry has been grappling with for awhile. (Or we get frustrated with him when he continues to not provide answers.) When he does introduce new concepts, he takes his time about it. He doesn't, for example, say, "Harry, a horcrux is a magical object into which a dark wizard places part of his soul." He does the whole bit with Slughorn's memory. He takes several chapters! Basically, I think Dumbledore likes to teach via answering students' questions, and when he wants to teach them something new, he makes sure he gets them asking the right questions.

#+end_quote

Here you show that he is open to questions, but it would be better if you showed him actually answering them. (Side note, "the youth of today" sounds too much like a modern muggle expression.)

So much new information! And I doubt it's even been teased at yet. In canon, Dumbledore wasn't used as the infodump character (that was Hermione) so much as the character who handed out the key to the ongoing mystery.

Based on the structure of your story, it might be unavoidable that Dumbledore has to provide more of the basic plot-necessary information, but that's going to make his character feel a little bit off, because that's not how JKR used him.

*** I think you and [[/u/herO_wraith][u/herO_wraith]] have nailed it. I didn't see the problem because I've altered things to making Dumbledore Harry's first contact with the Wizarding World. I knew /something/ wasn't right, but it also made sense for Dumbledore to be informative in the context so I didn't pick up on it. I think I'm going to read the suggestions and parts of canon (especially HBP) and then go back over my Dumbledore from the beginning of the story.

The progress I'm making is slow, but it's still better than the zero progress I made in the previous several months and I'm happy :) Thanks so much for your analysis!

**** Perhaps have Dumbledore give Harry several books to read on the wizarding world rather than info-dump. You have to respect show not tell. Make Harry learn about the wizarding world, have him make mistakes and be corrected. Have him quiz the elf a bit and learn through her.

Be careful with this. Yes, Dumbledore can turn a phrase nicely, but:

1. Contrary to common belief, Dumbledore does use contractions (though not always). He's not a walking essay.

2. When directness is needed, Dumbledore doesn't waste time with flowery words.

3. Dumbledore is not always eloquent.

Some examples:

  “Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?”

  It was Professor Dumbledore. He didn't look surprised to see Harry there.

  “Your carriage is at the gates, Remus,” he said.

#+begin_quote
  “Professor Dumbledore --- yesterday, when I was having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went very --- very strange.”

  “Indeed?” said Dumbledore. “Er --- stranger than usual, you mean?”

If I remember right there is zero smut in the entire fic so it's slash by definition only.

The author, flamethrower, does an excellent job with Dumbledore dialogue (especially in the first few chapters).

** A few people have already mentioned this indirectly, but Dumbledore is much more succinct in the books, and Rowling often breaks up his dialog with actions, his expressions, adjectives, or prompts from his conversation partner.

Rowling uses adjectives and expressions to show Dumbledore's mood and provide a subtext, including: pleasantly, gravely (twice), quietly, smiling, raised his eyebrows, and patiently. She also uses a lot of descriptions about where and how Dumbledore is looking to break up the dialog and show Dumbledore's evaluations. For instance, when Dumbledore visits Tom Riddle in the orphanage:

#+begin_quote
  "Well, you were quite right," said Dumbledore, who was no longer smiling but watching Riddle intently. "You are a wizard."
#+end_quote

When Dumbledore picks up Harry from the Dursley's house:

#+begin_quote
  "It is a long time since my last visit," said Dumbledore, peering down his crooked nose at Uncle Vernon. "I must say, your agapanthus are flourishing." There is a long description of Vernon's reaction to Dumbledore, showing rather than telling, then: "Ah, good evening Harry," said Dumbledore, looking up at him through his half-moon glasses with a most satisfied expression. "Excellent, excellent."
#+end_quote

Additionally, canon Dumbledore, even when interpreted as benevolent, is much less open than your Dumbledore. If Harry asked about where they were, canon Dumbledore would be more likely to answer (content-wise) along the lines of "When I was a boy, this was my family home. I lived here after I graduated from Hogwarts. Of course, it was never quite this nice under my care." But presuming Harry asked about the significance of a place, Dumbledore's first bit in your example dialog about Ariana is fantastic- Dumbledore tells the truth without hinting at any of the drama surrounding his sister's death. I think that Dumbledore would be more likely to make his assurances with a lesson rather than a statement about his own feelings. For instance, "Harry, do not worry. It is better we make new memories than dwell on the old."

And as a final point, Dumbledore has a unique sense of humor, which helps emphasize how eccentric he is. And the privilege of being eccentric without consequences is definitely a wise old wizard thing, and makes Dumbledore more believable. I've copied a few examples below:

To Harry:

#+begin_quote
  "Very well, then," said Dumbledore, pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into the yard. "I see a light in the kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are."
#+end_quote

To Vernon Dursley:

#+begin_quote
  "Albus Dumbledore," said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction. "We have corresponded, of course." "Shall we assume you have invited me into your sitting room?"
#+end_quote

Visiting Slughorn:

#+begin_quote
  "My dear Horace," said Dumbledore, looking amused, "if the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark Mark would have been set over the house."
#+end_quote

Adding some more information about Dumbledore's tone, expression, and the situation will make it easier to show his sense of humor and tendency to be eccentric.
