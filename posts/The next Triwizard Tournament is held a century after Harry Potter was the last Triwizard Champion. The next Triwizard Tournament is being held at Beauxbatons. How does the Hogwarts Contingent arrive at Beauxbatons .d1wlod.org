In the Goblet of Fire The Durmstrang arrives in their ship and Beauxbatons arrives in their flying carriage. How would the Hogwarts contingent arrive at the the other host schools. Lets make sure they arrive in style.


** I've seen fics where they use the Hogwarts Express to arrive, which is a neat idea.

A headcanon I have for future Tournaments is that nobody removed the Confundus Charm on the Goblet, so Harry's name comes out of it /again/.

*** I read a fic once where it was held in one of the other schools (I forgot which one). They took the Hogwarts Express. It started like usual from the platform at Hogsmede, and then took flight shortly after starting and flew to its destination. The train was also slightly altered (off-screen, so probably before departure) to work as temporary dormitories for the Hogwarts students.

This seems entirely plausible to me.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

*** if Iwere to write a fanfic where the Express was used for such transport; I would have the tracks themselves be in a sort of pocket dimension and the destination of Kings Cross can be moved around.

thus the "in style" would be the tracks & train & station folding/shimmering into existence through a hill or something just outside the wards.

Actually, lol, it's not a new theme at all. It's keeping in line with the books. Gryffindor(Harry) is fire, Hufflepuff(Cedric) is earth, Ravenclaw(where Fleur sits) is air, and Slytherin(where Viktor is) is water.

** Dominique Beauclair, Beauxbaton headmaster, blinked in surprise.

"Ah." He began in accented English for the benefit of his Illvermorny guest. "It seems the Hogwarts contingent approaches."

A ripple of confusion and interest ran through the crowd as the collected students of the two schools looked this way and that. Eventually the man merely pointed a hand skyward and off in to the distance. A few seconds later and they could hear it; the distinct chugging sound of a steam engine.

The scarlet and black steam engine raced on through the night to the awe and shock of those on the school grounds. Dominique smiled as the famed Hogwarts express raced towards the school on invisible tracks; arcing through the air high above them. The train made a pass around the school's perimeter in a dramatic display before it began to spiral downward towards them.

Several members of the crowd yelped in surprise as it passed mere feet above them before lazily curling in on it's self like a resting snake. The train came to a stop and hissed as it expelled the remaining pressure. There was a bead of silence that overtook the crowd.... Before a series of lights erupted on the outside. Then a door near the back slid open and a red carpet extended.

Headmaster Beauclair stepped forward with Headmistress Boot of Illvermorny at his side. A slight smile splitting their face as a group of students exited the train dressed in various colored robes. And at the head of the group walked a famous figure known for his work in generations pass.

"Headmaster!" Dominique greeted diplomatically as the man drew near. "Welcome to Beaubaton."

"None of that now." The elderly man said a genially smile. "We are equals here. Please; you may call me Ronald."

"If you say so Headmaster Weasley." Headmistress Boot said with a smile. "It's an honor to meet you. And I must commend you on the entrance."

"Thank you. You wouldn't believe how much work it went to making it go. I was sure my wife would have killed me for the idea alone."
