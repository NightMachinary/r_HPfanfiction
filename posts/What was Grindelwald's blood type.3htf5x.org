** Blood type = A, B, AB and O

Blood status = pure-blood, half-blood, Muggle-born

** Do you mean pure/half/mud, or A/B/O? In either case it is never specified in canon, but I think it is stated (correct me if this is fanon) that he attended Durmstrang, and Durmstrang does not accept muggleborns.

*** I don't know what A/B/O is but he did go to Durmstrang so be probably was pureblood. I could've sworn I read he was muggleborn somewhere else though.

**** It was a joke. You asked about blood types. Human blood types are A, B, AB, and O with + or - appended.

**** His great aunt is Bathilda Bagshot so even if Durmstrang were accepting muggleborns back then it's unlikely that he was one.

**** See, I see A/B/O and usually run the other way because of the alpha/beta/omega.

Please don't ask about knotting.

** Not sure why everybody's piling on the "pureblood" bandwagon. History shows that it's the half-bloods who stir up the most trouble.

***** fucking finnigan always stiring up trouble. Remember that time he went to a DA meeting and Umbridge showed up? Or that one time he went to the World Cup and the dark mark appeared in the sky?

Don't tell me these are coincidences.

***** I forgot Flitwick, too! Although he's a half-breed and not a half-blood.... Champion duellist, that one. I bet he was a real hellion at one point.

****** Some half breeds could be half-(pure)bloods as well, I suppose. If one of Flitwick's parents was a pureblood he'd be half-breed + half-blood. Although I imagine he'd primarily be labeled as a half-breed as it's the more derogatory of the terms.

It would have been cool to see some of that in the movies :(

******* I imagine we can't because something like this went down:

Lockhart: Hey Flitwick, where are you going?

Flitwick: Talking to Dumbledore, tell him about this idea I had to form a dueling club!

Lockhart: That DOES sound like a great idea. /Obliviate/

** We can infer that he is at least a Half-Blood, as his great-aunt is a witch. Also, Durmstrang does not accept Muggleborns, but there has been no information on the status of Half-Bloods. So either Half-Blood or Pure-Blood.
