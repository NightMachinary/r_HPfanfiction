The only request I have is to avoid two opposites -- no ‘everyone is gay' AU so no one thinks twice about it world and no ‘all the drama and plot is built upon characters getting it together about being gay' story.

  Hermione Granger fled Britain seven years ago after the Battle of Hogwarts, still battling against the horror she endured. She's finally content in her quiet life where no one knows her as the Golden Girl until unexpected post from Hogwarts offers her the chance she had once dreamed of. Now, she returns to the castle to find her dreams, her family and her life; she might also find a certain beautiful French witch along the way.

  Everyone has a weird gap in their knowledge. Unfortunately for her, Hermione's coincides with a mistake that could have huge consequences. She's known as the Brightest Witch of Her Age, but there are some things she has just never come across. Try explaining that to an enraged Veela... Fleurmione. Femslash. Post-War.

  Voldemort didn't stay dead at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts, and things got very, very bad. Ancient magic returns a 20-year-old Hermione back to her 15-year-old body, and she must set up complicated plans in secret to ensure the end of the world doesn't come to pass. Her first goal is to stop Voldemort before his body is restored, but she cannot do it alone. She must enlist the help of at least one of the champions of the Triwizard Tournament if she has any shot at stopping Voldemort and protecting Harry in the process. And she is as surprised as anyone when she finds love along the way.If you enjoy Fleurmione stories, sibling dynamics between Hermione and Harry, or time-travel fix-its generally, this is the story for you! Also, this features a major trans storyline, because JKR is a transphobic bigot and we deserve better.I make no promises about any kind of an update schedule. If you're a fan of any of my other works, you'll know I can be all over the place. Sorry! But I'm a busy lawyer. I do have the gist of the story plotted out, and as with all my stories, I promise not to abandon it.

** Hello. Would you mind elaborating on " all the drama and plot is built upon characters getting it together about being gay". Do you mean internalized homophobia or is it something else? I may have something you might like, but I don't understand that part of your request very well.

*** hope OP doesn't mind me jumping in for them, but there's a pretty large body of work where the primary conflict at least in the beginning is the main character realizing they're gay and coming to terms with the fact. usually with lots of suppressed feelings, denial, and yeah internalized homophobia. I get why they exist ofc but it's not what I want to read when I'm looking at fanfiction
