  What if Voldemort had not called for a cease-fire half-way through the final battle? What if the death toll had continued to mount until in the end, Harry stood victorious but alone? What if Harry decided that such an outcome was unacceptable and set out to change things, to re-write the prophesy that had always defined his life? WARNING: not JUST about time-travel.

  Five hundred years after the defeat of Voldemort a new generation of Death Eaters is rising. Will the Muggles they attack be able to survive the encounter? For that matter, will the Death Eaters?
