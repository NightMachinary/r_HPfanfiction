I don't know if it was mentioned in books but In the movie “Fantastic Beasts: Crimes of Grindelwald” we see that Albus and Gellert had mad a blood pact which means that the can never face each other( unless it was somehow destroyed ) so how did Ariana's death happened? If I remember correctly, Albus , Gellert and Aberforth had duel and one of the spells accidentally killed Ariana. But how did those two even duel If the pact had forbidden them from fighting. I can't really imagine dumbledore making the pact after his sister's death. Does anyone have an idea or is it just a mistake like having an adult Mcgonagall in that time period?


** If you enjoyed Fantastic Beasts Crimes of Grindelwald, don't let others detract from your experience.

There are many reasons that can be explored but the most persuasive one for me is that the blood pact is one of the reasons Arianna got hurt in the first place. Aberforth attacks Grindelwald and Grindelwald attacks right back. Dumbledore can't fight Gellert so is just stuck protecting his brother. Unfortunately, Aberforth isn't very willing to be protected right now and tries harder to kill Grindelwald. Grindelwald can't fight Dumbledore so has to respond to Aberforth's threat with greater force. Situation escalates, Arianna dies.

McGonagall appearing may be a genuine continuity error if you really squint at it but I've given writers much more leeway than that if it makes for a good story. A person close to Dumbledore to be a sounding board and to reveal his thoughts to the audience may very well be needed. We'll never know now though what would have happened if the script didn't have to be rewritten.

*** Thanks!! That really helped me a lot. But wasn't it mentioned that dumbledore was guilty because he didn't know if it was him or Gellert that had killed Arianna? And I really liked the movie despite the things that didn't make since( McGonagall, credence(?) etc..)

**** Yeah, it was mentioned that he didn't know which of the three people cast the spell that killed her in the end. My above explanation doesn't contradict it. In the heat of battle it could have been literally anyone. It could be an Aberforth spell that missed Grindelwald. It could be an Albus spell that deflected someone's spell to Arianna. It could be a Grindelwald spell that missed Aberforth and Albus.

I would really hold of on calling Credence something that doesn't make sense. It is clearly not done, the mystery is obviously not revealed. It's like saying in Chamber of Secrets how the diary, and the whole Tom Riddle story makes no sense.

***** I thought she had wild magic and she couldn't control it making dangerous accidental magic. Their father went to azkaban after an incident involving muggles that hurt her because it was incredibly dangerous for her. She needs intensive care and they aren't supposed to use magic near her so it can't set off her own magic. I thought it wasn't a spell that killed her but her magic reacting poorly to the duel itself and the stressful situation. Therefore the blame can be laid at all their feet for her death but nobody remebers who cast the first spell that started it all.

** At the end of the movie Newt hands over an item to Dumbledore, this item is the physical manifestation of the blood pact and Dumbledore states that (he believes) it can be destroyed.

*** Thank you for the information, I really hope in the next movie they will give us more details about Albus's and Grindelwald's past and how dumbledore managed to destroy the blood pact.

** It does seem to be a mistake simply due to the amount of continuity errors present in the film (e.g. McGonagal & Aurelius). Though m I won't say it's impossible that the next film won't retcon it or push in some kind of explanation, as it's likely the next film will focus on breaking the Blood Pact.

*** I love this movie. I really do but there is these parts that don't make since( SINCE WHEN DID ALBUS HAS ANOTHER YOUNGER BROTHER?!?) I'm pretty sure grindelwald is lying ( my boy Albus dumbledore is your elder brother but he has abandoned you so why don't you go and kill him?) that would make a lot more since than being a long lost brother that even the books didn't know about, other wise the spells and action ( I love grindelwald speech and blue fire dragons! It was epic)was pretty darn amazing ❤️

** How old is McGonagall in the seven Harry Potter books? In which book is it said when she was born? (I have no memory of an indication of a specific age in the books). Maybe it is said in Pottermore? But is Pottermore officially canon?

I take the opportunity to ask some questions:

All the Fantastic Beasts Movies are the canonical prequels of the books (like the Cursed Child is the sequel) or are the prequels of the eight films?

I read about the canon of the films and the canon of the books, but I admit that I didn't follow the "issue".

*** The only indication of McGonagall's age is in Order of Phoenix when she tells Umbridge that she has been teaching transfiguration for 39 years.

Canonicity has been and will always be very fluid in Harry Potter stuff. Rowling has never let any past details (even in the Harry Potter books) come in the way of a good story. Where other writers might get stuck trying to explain every little decision in Philosopher's stone, she just moves on.

If you must put a name to it, I'd say Fantastic Beasts follows its own canon made from an amalgamation of the book and movie canon. It's similar to what a lot of fanfic writers do with taking the good parts of the movie and leaving the rest. Like Hermione's scar and Slughorn's Goldfish stories are both movie originals.
