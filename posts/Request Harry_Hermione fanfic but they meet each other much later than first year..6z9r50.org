** James Spookie's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766604/1/What-We-re-Fighting-For][What We're Fighting For]], linkffn(9766604), should be the most famous in this category. This formula generally paints Hermione as a friendless damsel-in-distress being badly bullied. Then Harry the White Knight showed up and righted all the wrongs at Hogwarts.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

** If you don't mind very AU, try [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/courting-hermione-granger/][Courting Hermione Granger]], where Hermione left Hogwarts before meeting Harry (different houses). It takes place maybe 8-10 years after graduation. Very Lord Potter, pureblood political shenanigans but in a fun way. And a lot more believable when everyone involved is over 25.

She's also got the epic Soulmate Bond, where Harry doesn't come to Hogwarts until 6th year.

  Instead of Durmstrang Academy, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was invited to take part in the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. When Ilvermorny arrives at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore is shocked to see the long-thought-dead Harry and Lily Potter appear, as well as the missing Sirius Black and Remus Lupin.
