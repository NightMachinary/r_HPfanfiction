A while ago I read a fanfiction where Harry ends up (post war) in another universe. Voldemort never died and his parents are alive, there is a younger brother and he has sisters (twins).

Voldemort slaughtered all baby's from Harry's birth year, execpt some Muggleborns, who got away and the Purebloods on his side.(Draco Malfoy is evil and has two brothers.)

There is some kind of revolution. If I remember correctly, Hermione's parents were murdered by dark wizards but she doesn't differentiate between good and bad wizards, she just hates them.

Ginny is pregnant from Dean and on one point Ron comes too. I still now I loved how Ron's character was portrayed in this story.

Anyway, does anybody know this fic? I can't find it anymore and I need your help.

  Harry won the war. It's a couple months afterwards and unexpectedly, he's quite literally picked up off the face of the world and shoved into another. One where Harry Potter died a long time ago and the Potter family's still fighting a war with a Dark Lord whose ruling over the world one muggle murder at a time. They say he's their only hope. Harry doesn't really want in.
