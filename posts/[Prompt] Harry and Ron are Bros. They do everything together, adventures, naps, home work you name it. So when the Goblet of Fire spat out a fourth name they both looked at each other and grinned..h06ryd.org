"Harry Potter!" Dumbledore exclaimed after his call had been ignored the first time.

Ron stood bouncing on the heels of his feet as if waiting while Hermione just looked exasperated.

Harry patted Ron on the shoulder "Give it a moment mate."

Just as Harry said that another name flew out of the Goblet. Dumbledore, surprised fumbled to catch it and once he did he sighed through his nose before shouting out "RONALD WEASLEY!"

Harry and Ron fist bumped and ran to the front to meet with Dumbledore. Once they got to their destination they did [[https://youtu.be/X4m42HOdsUc][Their secret handshake]] and ran to meet with their competition

*** After their time was up Voldemort called for Harry Potter to face him once more.

Harry started walking towards his destiny only stopping when he heard foot steps next to him. Looking to his side he noticed Ron, wand at the ready and smile on his face. "Ron, go back I have to do this alone..."

Ron just laughed "of course you do," he patted Harry on the back with his free hand "and I'm going with you."

"bloody hell mate its a flipping firebolt of course I like it, isnt a bit much though for a gift''

''I am sure when your a fancy pants auror, you will pay me back'' harry smirked 'besides sirius paid for half of it, I am sure if he was not terrifed molly would murder him he would try adopting you. you did get him out of azakaban afterall''

ron laughed '' I feel I get to much credit for that, all I did was take scabbers to transfiguration and ask mcgonagall if she knew any spells that worked on animals as I was tired of being told false ones as pranks by my brothers.''

"so want to test your broom out'' harry asked

ron looked outside ''Mate its two am''

harry shruged and said '' so we know spells to see in the dark''

Ron smiled and then picked up his wand and flicked it shooting a spell at the neville who awoke with a Jump "Neville we are going flying get your broom'' ron exclaimed

Neville looked out of the window and sighed and started dressing 'I was having such a good dream, there was this french witch and well if I am going flying then so is dean'' neville pulled out his wand and flicked a spell at dean who awoke with a start.

''fucking hell neville its two am' dean started. 'yes but Harry and ron want to go flying so they woke me up so I decided if I am awake you have to be too' Dean grinned. 'well if we are going flying I should wake up shamus too, it would mean to exclude him' dean grabbed his wand and pointed it at shamus's sleeping form 'agumenti'

***** Ron is also an 11-17 year old boy. Now, I don't know how many interactions you've had with teenage boys but Ron is definitely more preferable to most. Sure, he's not the most invested in his school career, but that doesn't make him lazy. Would you count him upping his whole damn ass up and going with his best friends on a journey for who knows how long, whilst abandoning his family, as lazy? And he has poor manners, but again, though its definitely not a /good trait/ he's just a normal kid. Frankly, if he went around kissing the hands of fair maidens and bowing down to every adult, I would be quite alarmed, because that isn't realistic. And the whole point of the Harry Potter series is to make the characters as realistic as possible to elevate the realness of the magic. Just because you can't relate to him in a personal level (and neither can I for that matter) that doesn't mean you have to absolutely loathe him.

Btw I'm not trying to say you have to love Ron, or that you're not entitled to your own interpretation, but the thought someone would hate Ron baffles me.
