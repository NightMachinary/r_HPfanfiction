It was on ffn.net and was focused on Sirius and the marauders post Hogwarts during the war. I think that Sirius was just released from Azkaban and he was dealing with his trauma while him, James, Lily, and Remus and the rest of the original Order fought against Voldemort. Harry and the others were also there and there were snippets of them in Hogwarts, though I don't remember any details. I know that James was considered one of the most powerful Aurors and at one point Harry was called into Dumbledore's office and he though something had happened to his dad. There was a sequel too.

Thanks!


** This might be it. I don't know if I can link properly to it but i's written by Robin4, called "Promises Honored". It's a four-part series and it fits most of your description.
