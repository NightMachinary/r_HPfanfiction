** Have you tried [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]]? It's not finished yet, but it's really long. Darkish Harry rather than actually, seriously Dark. Voldemort is still pretty damn evil, but he's pretty charismatic. It's not slash, but it's extremely well written.

**** [[http://hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]. It's got a bit of a cult following, and most people either love it or hate it. I am one of the few that found it interesting and well-written, but was not wild about it overall. Still, it fits your criteria and is worth checking out, if only because it's so wildly popular.

** I haven't found anything like that yet, though HPMOR /maybe/ hints at an explanation of Riddle's motivations in the future.

I'm working on a story, dark AU, AMBIGUOUS?HARRY, that tries to go into Voldemort's motivations and madness. It also has a large focus on Beedle the Bard lore, which doesn't get much play in fic, and it goes into the technical aspects of Horcrux creation and /why/ it's such dark magic, which also doesn't get discussed much. That kind of relates to your other post here too.

It's still in alpha, but I have about 350 pages done. PM me if you're interested in reading a first draft. Though, even if that doesn't interest you, I'd still like to hear some of your thoughts and interests, since you sound like the kind of person I'm writing this story for.

***** Sounds great, I read a lot of fanfiction so I have a general idea of the kind of stuff that I like. I might have an idea or two for you after I read what you have so far and see the general direction you seem to be taking the story. I don't want to suggest something that completely wouldn't fit in with your story.

**** Well if that's the case, I'm sure you've already read the one I was thinking of: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today][Death of Today]] by Epic Solemnity.

I'm sure I've read others, but for the life of me I can't think of any more. I've gone through my many, many bookmarks with no luck. I'll keep looking, but I'm sorry in advance if I can't find any more :(
