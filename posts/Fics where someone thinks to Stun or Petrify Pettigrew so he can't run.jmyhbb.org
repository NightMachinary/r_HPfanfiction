Petrificus Totalus is learned in 1st year. I'm not sure what year Stunning Spells are taught in, but there are 2 armed adults in the room. It's unconscionable that three reasonably competent 3rd years and two adults don't think to take the common sense solution of either knocking out the traitorous bastard or at least preventing him from moving.


** linkffn(12849081). Snape stuns Pettigrew, the effect of the dementors wakes him up then H/Hr use the time turner to set up an ambush.

  The Great Firebolt Debacle of Harry's third-year shakes out differently, and the whole year is affected. H/Hr. Mild Ron bashing. COMPLETE

** The starting premise of the time turner fic Three Little Words by Rouven_Auge_des_Sturms_Singer is exactly that. Eg Remus finds a short message "Stun the Rat!"

  This is a AU where Harry and Hermione use the timeturner to change one more thing and it makes all the difference. It changes the course of the world to a better turn. A lot of politics and also Fluff.Of course, this is a fan-fiction. I don't own Harry Potter in any kind or way and I don't make money with this story.

**** Sorry for the delay. Well I thought it was ok but then again "beauty is in the eye of the beholder". I can say it wasn't bad enough for me to delete it from my drive. But I'm pretty tolerant with the stories I read.

Truth is I haven't read it in a while but it is in my updateable folder which means I check every couple of months to see if the author has updated.

My recommendation is to give it a try. You should be able to decide if after a handful of chapters whether you want to continue with it.
