I always felt that Divination was horribly done in the books as it went with the cliche route and never expanded upon it and it's usefulness. (That I thought that Trelawney shouldn't have been the teacher as while she is a true seer, she is only truly able to use one form of Divination called Metagnomy) and not much else. And that nobody took it seriously enough to expand on it. And some types of Divination don't even focus on interpreting the future but rather the present or even the past.

Here is a link to a list of the different types that I found.

*[[https://www.paranormal-encyclopedia.com/d/divination/types.html#o][Glossary of Divination Types & Techniques]]*

*[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_divination][List of Divination Methods]]*

My personal take on Divination is that it is a highly individualized art that requires the person learning it to find what best works for them (their Medium for performing the magic), and then focus on developing that students talent in that particular branch of divination. And if they manage to develop a new talent for another form due to new factors or circumstances they can work from there. The way Trelawney and Frienze taught it doesn't seem like the best way to teach future Diviners/Soothsayers if you ask me.

The way I would go about it is this:

- In the students 3rd year (when they start learning), IThey would spend the year having the students try all basic forms of each type of divination. This is to determine which areas of divination the prospective diviner/soothsayer has talents and what their medium is.

- 4th year, have each student focus on their medium to achieve goals related to their area of expertise to expand their talent and learn higher level skills within their divination medium.

- 5th year, O.W.L. will focus on having the examinees use their medium to achieve a specific objective (like a pychometrist divining the history of a specific object chosen by the examiner for example) and how well they are able to use their medium to achieve their goal.

- 6th year, expand on previous years while trying out the other methods again to determine if the student has gained any new talents in other areas due to years of practice opening them up to it in a way that they weren't before.

- 7th year, showing mastery or at least a high level of proficiency in their medium of divination.

I personally believe that the "inner eye" thing is not something that is necessarily something you have to be born with to use divination or even something that can't be "opened" with the right kind of teaching. Otherwise, why have a class for it if it isn't something that can't be taught or awakened? My take is that while you can be born with the "inner eye" open, it just means you have a head start in the field. Others will have to have it opened through the practice of their particular medium if that makes any sense.

What do you all think? This make more sense than how they teach it at Hogwarts. This is how I'd go about it if I was writing it up but not sure if everyone would agree.

And if you do agree what Medium(s) do you think the main characters would be suited to use if they had been taught Divination in this way ?


** I think Divination was never taken seriously by Mrs. Rowling, because it stands against the basic spirit of her wizarding world, which is in my opinion rather rationalist and modernist. I am also afraid that any effort to make divination more serious is fundamentally OOC for the HP world.

*** Pretty sure at first she planned to amke the divination teacher competent but then realized that would be bad for the story, so insteaed we got Trelawney. But i read that ages ago and have since forgot were I read it.

** My theory is that The ministry of magic has been running a centuries long Smear campaign to discredit the branch of magic that is Divination. It can actually be used by everyone if they are taught properly.

I also feel like there may be some fundamental differences in the thought process of people that are good at transfiguration and what it takes to do Divination after all Both Dumbledore and McGonagall are both masters of transfiguration and seem to be the main ones that we see Looking down on it even going so far as to think about canceling the Class when there has to been a reason that it was taught at Hogwarts for hundreds of years.

** I always liked the idea that initially Divination was taught closer to it's D&D counterpart, where it was more of a general subject dedicated to magic used to divine thing (ie: to learn the truth of them), of which the future was only a part of the list. So spells like the Four-Point Spell would've been part of that branch of magic, because you are using it to learn which direction is north. But then, say at some point during the 16th or 17th centuries, there were a consecutive number of Divination teachers hired who heavily favoured the predicting the future part of this branch of magic, and so the focus of the subject was alterd accordingly.
