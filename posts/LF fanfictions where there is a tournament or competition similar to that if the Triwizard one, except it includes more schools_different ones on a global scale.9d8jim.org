#+begin_quote
  Growing up on London's streets and having nobody to rely on has led to a different from canon Harry Potter start his first year at Hogwarts. Add an ancient and mysterious pendant, pureblood pricks, a scheming headmaster and a goddess as his mother-figure in the mix and you have a genuine Alternate Universe. Grey, asshole Harry. Neville BWL. Veela-OC (sequel is up)

**** I do not vouch for the quality of the fic. It's been a while since I read it, and I think I was enjoying it for the most part, but your mileage may vary. I believe it does do the stations of canon rehash bit, but I can't remember most of it.

****** Initially, yes.

By summer of 3rd year, Remus and Sirius are tagging along to find a fire demon with three superpowered mages, Harry gets the Horcrux removed, and Barty Crouch gets replaced by a new villain (the elder on that is).

**** I guess, after looking at the summary, it starts near the end of CoS. As for the tournament (whatever they call it), it starts in the same place you would usually expect it to start: 4th year.
