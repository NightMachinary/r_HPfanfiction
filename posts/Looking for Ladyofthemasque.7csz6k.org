So it's recently come to my attention that LotM had a lot of fics on restrictedsection.org that weren't archived anywhere else.

Since I really like her work I'm wondering if anyone has copies of those for me.

I'm especially interested in Corsicuum, which has an interesting blurb.

*** I have all of those except droxy's tale and corsicuum, which I'd never heard of before I found it on a rec list the other day.

Thank you so much :D you must have a fantastic archive.

P.S the ones I have are all in mobi/epub format so I could share them with you if you like.

**** If you've got ones I didn't list, I'll gladly take them, but it's no problem for me to convert these. I've actually already done them (edited above comment with links). I was expecting a lot of them to be long, given that FSS was over 500k, but they were almost all under 100k and fortunately fairly clean so I didn't have to tidy them up too much to make them readable. (Some files I convert have messed up UTF-8 and html coding and fixing it all can be hell.)

*** Thanks :)

I got my copy of FSS from there too - needed quite a bit of work to be satisfactory on my Kindle but it's all good :D

I wonder if I can ask the lady who does sshgreview if she has a copy of corsicuum...
