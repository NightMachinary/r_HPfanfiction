** I prefer James Evans since it could fall in the realm of passable. If you're going hilariously obvious I'd say go with what he named his kid and then have a character say what a stupid cover name it was and that no person would be dumb enough to name their kid that.

** Or you could just do the Voldemort anagram game and put Harry's full name into it (even include Black if you're going to have him be the heir etc) and then choose something you like. So he could be called

Harem Ray Jetsport (call me Ray) etc

*** The reason I like mine "cover name" is he could take two paths. One - the tonks method of some parents shouldn't be allowed to name their kids. I.e, why he hates/doesn't use his first name. Or two - my dad said he always liked the idea of me having a Harem so he gave me that name so whatever happened I would always have one.

Plus it gives him an excuse etc if he makes a mistake and either answers or starts to state his name is Harry.

** I have some extensive notes I made in case I wanted to write a fic where he used a fake name. Here are some highlights.

If a person is serious about a fake name, it should be one that has absolutely nothing to do with their real name. "James Evans" is laugably obvious and wouldn't fool anybody looking for him. (I did read a fic where Snape is looking for Harry and hears about a Mr Evans that he thinks is him --- and makes a note to tell him how obvious the name is --- but Harry is actually going to Leo Slyder.)

A lot of people make fun of Hadrian, but I personally like *Harfang*: it's another name for snowy owl because hares are their main prey. He also has a Potter ancestor named *Hardwin*. Both of those have the benefit of allowing for the accidental "Harry," which if he makes that mistake he can cover it up by saying he's trying to ditch the "childish" nickname and go more formal.

Instead of Evans or Black, I've seen authors use Jameson, but -son is not the only way to indicate your father. McJames or FitzJames work. James is a form of Jacob, so *Jacobson* also works.

James is also easy to disguise by using a different language. I already mentioned Jacob, which can give the nickname of Jack. Irish or Scottish Gaelic is Seamus or Hamish, Welsh is Iago. (Side note: Evans is a common Welsh surname.) Harry is not as easy to translate because it is essentially a nickname, used as a formal name only in recent times. (We know from canon that Harry's name IS Harry, not Harrison or Henry with Harry as a nickname.)

To honor his mother all he needs is a plant name. There are many, and all you have to do us use a baby name site to search. My favorite is *Rowan*, a tree thought to protect against malevolent beings. (Elder was thought to bring bad luck, elder and rowan are opposites.)

*** Harry's going to a separate universe where he died as a baby so he can have a restart so no one's going to be looking for him. Eventually, he's going to reveal himself.

For the time being, until I can decide, I've been using Henry Evan Jameson. It's perfectly obvious and a nod to both of Harry's parents without being too obvious since his parents (and himself) have been dead for sixteen years. Henry is also close enough to Harry's first name that he can slip up easily and mention that his friends used to call him Harry. There's also the fact that his great great grandfather (in my fic, at least) was named Henry.

I was kind of thinking of using Evander Jameson as a name because it has Evan in it and it sounds unique enough to be a wizard's name. I really like what you've mentioned about different versions of Harry's first name that are similar to his name, though. I was thinking of perhaps using Jamie Evanson or something because I thought it was cute. I don't really want Harry to go around with an "ugly" name or a name I really didn't want to type over and over again.

Elder would be an interesting last name because I'm playing around with the Deathly Hallows and Harry's bringing the Elder wand with him.

*** Well, I probably shoulda mentioned that Harry's going to an alternate universe where he died to start over so he can't obviously have the name of a living person. I was thinking James Evans but that would be copying the name from the fic that I'm basing my own fic on linkffn(The World Without Me), so I chose Henry Jameson until I decide if I actually want to use James Evans. I must say, I do like Jameson as a last name because it's so obvious.
