** Quick question before I read it. I tend to prefer gen fics, how heavily if at all will Romance factor into it? It's not listed as one of the genres, which is a good sign for me, but from the summary the plot is something that could easily go in that direction if the author wanted it to, but could also not go in that direction if the author didn't.

*** I'm not entirely sure what the specifics will be in regards to romance, but I can say that however it develops(and let's face it, at some point these will be teenagers going through puberty- it'll be a /subject/ and has to develop), it /won't/ be a focus and it very well might not be between the two main characters.
