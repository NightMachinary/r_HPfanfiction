** I can honestly say i like the idea of Fred and George being Foxes, not only for the colour but that foxes were often thought of as mischievous in folklore.

** Well, I don't have much of an opinion when it comes to animals - but I can say that Severus Snape probably shouldn't be a bat. Aside from it being 'cliche' the form would only further cement the 'villainous' nature of his character - making it less likely that he could be anything but who he made himself out to be.

*** A raven would suit him fairly well. A clever but maligned creature that can hold a grudge. They also eat carrion and, in some western cultures are considered dickish, evil, or disease-spreading pests, which would cover his worst traits nicely. Some, like the Norse one, showed ravens as intelligent, iirc, and they'd feed Odin information. Greek myth had them as white birds that were turned black for some reason or another. And then there's that Tower of London stuff ... In other cultures, (some American Indian ones) the raven is a trickster god who made the first people.

Basically, they suit his personality, especially with their dual nature.

** For Hermione, I'd say something like a parrot. A female version wouldn't be very flashy, but it'd be clever and it wouldn't be afraid to bite a few fingers here and there, to say nothing of the squawk. It's also a smaller animal, which I think she'd be more comfortable with being -- she doesn't like to stand out too much.

For Ron, I'd go with a horse. Horses are an animal of battle and domestic labor, associated with both swords and plows. Fitting, considering that Ron is willing to go to war for those he considers family. Horses often have a special connection to their particular warrior, knight, cowboy, etc., much as Ron has a connection to Harry -- he's not the hero, but he's just as necessary for a win. What's a knight without a horse, after all?

** In my mind I have always seen Harry's form as a Scottish terrier.

** For some reason I think Remus Lupin would be a sea lion. A big, powerful predator that would rather lie in the sun and relax. Intelligent and playful and often friendly, but not with the desire for the approval of a master that dogs have. Looks like a big unassuming lump on land, but sharp and fast in the water and has one hell of a bite. It also isn't a "useful" form, which I think he would appreciate.

** Fred and George should be a grey rabbit and a black duck
