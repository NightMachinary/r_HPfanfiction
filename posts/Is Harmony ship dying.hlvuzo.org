When I was leaving social media of Harry Potter at 2014 Harmony ship was still one of the biggest ships which could rival canon ones, now coming back after 6 years I barely see people shipping them, it's barely in top 10 ships, what changed that people now barely ship them and prefer ship like Drarry, Dramione, Snarry, Snamione? After JK Rowling statement of Harmony being better fit than Romione I would though that it would stay as a big ship as canon ones given how many people were mistaken that they would end up together in the past.


** it's not that Harmony ship is dying, it's just that other ships are growing. Harmony ship is going strong, especially amongst fans who don't read fanfics and casual readers. The only sign of a decrease in Harmony shipping I've seen is is the general fanfiction community getting tired of the ship and the tropes that generally accompany it (ie, bashing the Weasleys, Perfect!Hermione, etc...) and moving on to other ships.

** It's alive and well in my experience, although some of the most visible examples have perhaps not given the best impression (eg the top ten most favorited fics on FFN include Methods of Rationality and Harry Crow, both with a Harry/Hermione pairing and both attracting a lot of hate).

I've also noticed that [[/r/HPHarmony][r/HPHarmony]] is a bit salty and defensive about the pairing, which is understandable when it didn't become canon.

** Barely in the Top 10? Their are alot of harmony stories being written over on ff.net if you cut out anything not published within the last year.

The Harmony Sub is still the most popular shipping sub for them so idk where your getting that data

At least according to the 2018 survey, Ginny/Harry is the most popular ship on this sub at 21 percent followed by Harry/Hermione at like 19.1 percent so it's still plenty popular.

*** If we mean by fanfiction then yeah it's still popular, if we go by some other sites people barely ship them and prefer Dramione,Drarry or Romione(Quora,Reddit,Youtube).

** I think it is not dying, it is just not as dominant as it used to be during The Shipping Wars of 2000s'. It got severe beating with general rejection of over-the-top bashing which is almost always present in Harmony stories. And yes, for me, as Hinny shipper, Harmony stories have tendency to be too boring, because Harry and Hermione are so perfect together, and they are so perfect, did I mention how perfect they are ...

** Rowling just said Romione was too obvious so she would like to try something else, she didn't say Harmony was better.

*** No she literally sayed that Harmony could be better pair, read that interview again, she also regret a little how she wrote romance between Ron and Hermione.

Edit: /I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione with Ron./

#+begin_quote
  /It was a young relationship. I think the attraction itself is plausible but the combative side of it... I'm not sure you could have got over that in an adult relationship, there was too much fundamental incompatibility./

  /In some ways Hermione and Harry are a better fit and I'll tell you something very strange. When I wrote Hallows, I felt this quite strongly when I had Hermione and Harry together in the tent! I hadn't told [Steve] Kloves that and when he wrote the script he felt exactly the same thing at exactly the same point. David [Heyman] and Steve -- they felt what I felt when writing it. And actually I liked that scene in the film, because it was articulating something I hadn't said but I had felt. I think you do feel the ghost of what could have been in that scene./

** People got sick of it most likely and now the big thing imo is taking characters that show now homosexual tendencies and shipping them with the same sex or taking 2 characters that hate each other and say its sexual tension regardless of the implications it has

** As a big disliker of the Harmony Ship (it's always the same boring couple who never fight, and they often bash Ron), there are still *a lot* of Harmony ship (though Dramione also seem to be popular).

**** My main problem with the Harmony ship is that it often makes the characters . . . bland. It takes all the complexity of the characters to make them parody of themselves.\\
Ron loose all his quality and his failings are turned over 9000, to the point where you have to wonder why Harry took 4 years to realise how bad he is.\\
As for Harry and Hermione, they become "perfect". Harry is happy to spend 8 hours a day in the library, they both are top of their class, and being in a couple somehow transform Hermione into a bombshell.

I don't think fighting necessarely make a fic better, but having 2 characters (even in couple) disagree on something is one of the little things that make the fic feel alive. Seriously, some fics take the "never in a fight or a disagreement" thing so far that it makes you wonder if Harry and Hermione are not actually a hive mind in 2 bodies.

***** But that is totally to writer how he writes them as a couple, some are boring and some are good, even in movies they have sometimes disagreement and in the films they would be good together.
