Alternatively; having noticed how Death Eaters so frequently get slaughtered en masse and Super!Harry gets a house-elf who can do anything in every fic that he's in, Voldemort decides to trade up.

Alternatively; having taught himself wandless magic and been treated as second-class by purebloods for his muggle upbringing, Tom Riddle finds more kinship in house-elves than he does in wand-waving humans.

** I'm picturing a scene like Minions where they ever so helpfully end up accidentally killing Voldemort. Maybe during the Beam 'o War in the graveyard, the elves decide Voldemort's losing because he's 'incomplete'. So they helpfully assemble the missing pieces of his soul and destroy their prisons.

*** "LEAVE HIM! HE IS MINE!!"\\
The formerly-house-elves, now Death Elves, nodded and huddled together as Voldemort duelled with Harry Potter.\\
"Master Voldymorty wants to fight Harry alone but he is losing."\\
"Darky is having an idea! More than one Voldymorty can fight Harry! Remember with the diary that mean Harry destroyed?"\\
There was a chorus of mms and aahs.\\
"Wicky, if you go to the Mummy building and grab Time Turners, we'll have time. Fouler, go grab Master Voldymorty's soul thingies! Baddie, take Kruel and Kreature but not Kreacher, and go grab some humans to offer to Voldymorty!"

What seemed like seconds later, but thanks to a time turner was in fact several hours of concentrated effort by a large segment of Voldemort's elven army, /another/ Voldemort stepped up and casually started flinging curses at Harry's back.\\
And then another Voldemort, this one younger and looking more human, entered the fray, and then a third, whilst a fourth clone stood back and munched on some hot fish and chips he had somehow gotten.\\
/"What did you do?!"/ the first Voldemort hissed in between throwing curses at Harry.\\
Darky cheerfully answered, "Only Master Voldymorty can defeat Harry, so we got more Voldymortys!"

Surprisingly, this went extraordinarily well at first. The five Voldemorts (once a stray curse that destroyed the fifth one's chips enraged him enough to join the duel) easily defeated Harry Potter, mercilessly killing him, killing him again when the first time didn't stick, tried transfiguring him into a frog when the second time didn't stick, before eventually giving up and having an elf pop him to who-knows-where in the Atlantic Ocean.

However, things soon fell apart after that, as no Voldemort could agree on whom should lead. The non-horcrux one felt he was the most mature and experienced, the Diadem-Voldemort questioned the real Voldemort's sanity and felt it was the next best one, the Locket-Voldemort felt that he had much more charisma than the snake-faces, and so forth.\\
Eventually, it escalated into a duel as each of the Voldemorts tried to dispose of their usurpers the hard way, and the Death Elves, sworn to serve Voldemort, had no choice but to try and keep each Voldemort from killing each other until they could reconcile...

** "My good elves, when I came to you, many thought me crazy... Even some who stands with us today. But these last twenty days have proven just what a small highly motivated group can do. I came to you with a vision, The Great Work!"

"THE GREAT WORK!" chanted out hundreds of squeaky reverent voices.

"Yes my elven friends, I said that together we would stride across the lands, and destroy the old word that was rotting before us, that a house with mouldering foundations was no house at all, that it needed to be torn down so that it might be rebuilt!"

"Now some might dare to call anyone of us '/bad elves/,'" a susurration of hisses and much ear pulling spread through the horde, "that we are destroyers, murders and thieves!" The crowd was truly agitated now.

"But the are blind. We are best elves! For now our Great Work begins. It stars now and never stops. Together we rebuild the world!"
