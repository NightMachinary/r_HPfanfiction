While trying to think of a crossover for the original story I was writing, I had an idea where Harry is Snapes son, only Lily knowing the truth. This causes everything to be for naught, as the prophecy said "born to THOSE who have thrice defied them" and shenanigans ensue. Are there any fics where Snape is Harry's father that actually has a good plot?

  Harry finds out that he's Snape's son. It goes as badly as possible.

*** The author of this fic has a few great bio-dad Snape fics. Here's another one of theirs I really enjoyed: linkao3(990947).

It has a lighter tone than Conditionally, but the concept is handled very realistically, even if the author seems to like Draco a little too much.

  AU of HBP. Harry found out that he was Snape's son two years ago, and he's carefully concealed it. But now Snape is his Defense teacher, and Draco Malfoy is up to something, and Dumbledore is dying, and the final battle is coming up, and everything is getting very, very complicated.

** There are tons of biodad!Snape fics out there. You can search for "severitus" fics and you'll get many recs. Also Potions and Snitches is a site dedicated to Snape and Harry father/son fics although some are of the adoption or mentorship variety. The best biodad!Snape stories I know:

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

  Against his better judgement Severus Snape let a part of himself be used in a spell six years earlier. Now the consequences of his actions cannot be avoided any longer and Snape finds himself the father of a five year old boy-Harry Potter! Complete.
