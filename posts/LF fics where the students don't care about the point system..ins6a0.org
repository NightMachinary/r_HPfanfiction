Between Snape taking and giving points for stupid reasons and prefects abusing their positions, the majority of the student body doesn't care about house points. This isn't started by some grand speech by Harry or an open rebellion, it's just kids realizing the point system isn't fair and so they just start ignoring it.


** I've read a fic before where some turn of events that I absolutely don't remember at all, led to Hogwarts having set points for taking points away and for awarding points. And that made the students actually care more. That said, I'd love to read some fics like what you're requesting too!

  But that's just it! Don't you see? It is just a symbol of their ill acquired domination!” Draco had a feverish look about him. It was so clear to him! “The point system is a lie!”

  Which even Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs could comprehend. The points meant nothing. They didn't even hand out a special gift to the house that earned the House Cup at the end of the year. Hurray, you won, you are better, look at his cup behind the glass. That was it. It was just a system to enforce discipline and avoid unionizing by turning the +working class+ students against each other and stopping them from confronting the teachers.

An exert from Endrina's brilliant [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9476138?view_full_work=true][The Meaning of Dandelions]], but really, I recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][the whole series]] and it will make more sense. :)

**** It made me feel so emotional. The beginning was all cheery, but the the middle was heartbreaking. The end felt like everyone was tired and sad.

** Oh God Not Again! by Sarah 1281 linkffn(4536005)

A fun romp of a do-over fic, in which Harry claims his scar is psychic. He also declares war on the House Cup competition:

#+begin_quote
  “I'll tell Professor McGonagall,” Percy threatened.

  “So I'll get a couple of detentions, that's not exactly enough to deter me. My relatives would be thrilled to hear I'm doing my utmost to get myself killed, and I honestly do not give a damn about house points.”

  “Really?” Ron asked, wide-eyed.

  “Really. You see, I've come to the conclusion that the ‘House Cup' is really more of a ‘Suck-up Cup.' After all, the more of a teacher's pet you are, the more points you win. God knows I love Hermione, but she has got to be the biggest teacher's pet I have ever met and guess what? She's the single biggest point winner in our year. I don't care if I lose Gryffindor all of our points because quite frankly I don't want to be a sycophant all year just so the Great Hall gets to be decorated in our colors for one meal and you get an entire train-ride's worth of bragging rights. It's just not worth it,” Harry concluded.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
