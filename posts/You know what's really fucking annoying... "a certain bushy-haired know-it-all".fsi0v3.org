Okay, I understand that when you write, you use descriptors to identify people, and when you write FanFiction, it's almost like a game, because the people who read your work already know the characters, for the most part. But you know what's really fucking annoying- when this is COMPLETELY overused! I am sick and tired of Fics where "Our surly ferret has been having a rough time, until a certain bushy-haired know-it-all who just left a freckled redhead waltzes into his life and turns it upside down". It's just annoying to see it all the time. It's not even just summaries. I've read a couple of REALLY good Fics that used this every chapter and that completely ruined them for me.

And if you're going to do it, PLEASE at least don't do it while you're writing in first person. Because really, people don't think of their friend as "that bushy-haired know-it-all". People may think of strangers as "that bushy-haired lady", and maybe Draco may say "She's just a bushy-haired know-it-all" but that's really not how someone thinks of their friends in their head. PLEASE


** Amen. A person who constantly uses epithets like that to describe their friends...ehh

*** I read one story where the author didn't mention hair at all and just called him "the raven". It took me a long time to figure out why and I kept reading because a) the plot was 100% unique and that's rare and b) the fumbled prose was this odd mix of hilarious and train wreck. Especially since I started blurting out "Nevermore!" like a loser every time I saw it happen. Probably I should've turned it into a drinking game.

I'm assuming there was a translation failure going on, but oh my.

** This ruins fanfiction. You can be reading a really good fanfiction but then a certain green haired teenager gets identified as a greenete (have you ever heard a boy being called a fucking brunette, ever in spoken english?) And it just takes you out and ruins everything, just bloody call him deku. Or harry being identified as the boy with green globes said every 5 lines. Legit just use his name and it sounds better

Yes. It was looking at pictures where we were trying identify people, though.

Plus its brunet if its a boy, although its easy to butcher French.

**** (Pronounced without the sharp t sound at the end, for those who don't want to butcher french).

Interestingly though (to me ;) ), I would probably not think to use brunet in French myself - I'd default to 'il est brun' instead. Then again, I would be more likely to use 'brune' instead of 'brunette' in conversation - it might just be how my family talks. It'd be interesting to see if that holds true across France, now that I think about it.

** The majority of the time I stop reading after seeing that more than once. When "the younger" and "the older" is used that's an immediate nope from me. I feel bad because it can be an otherwise good fic.

I wish I could tell the authors but unless they specifically ask for constructive criticism it's not really my place to comment.

** Replacing names with descriptors should only be done if the character's name is not known to the reader. It should never be used to replace a pronoun.

It is also acceptable to do in fan fiction before the character's name is introduced in you work.

Even when it is marginally acceptable to use them you should still be a succinct as possible for identifying the character.

If you have 2 people that might get confused for the readers then using their names over and over is far less annoying that even a single descriptor.

I agree with the sentiment, but when it comes to writing "never" can often be unhelpful. Rules are made to be broken, as long as you know why you're breaking them.
