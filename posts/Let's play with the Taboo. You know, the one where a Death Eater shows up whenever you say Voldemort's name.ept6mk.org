Maybe someone uses it to lure Death Eaters into a trap. Maybe someone else has a taboo on their name, like Bloody Mary. Maybe explore where Voldemort got the idea. Maybe someone weaponizes it, uses it to threaten their enemies, or to cause a distraction. Just have fun with it.


** Xander looked at the little black haired boy who seemed totally out of his depth but trying hard to swim.

He had wound up in another unknown universe and was trying to figure out what was going on.

"Wait so this big bad has a Taboo (you could hear the capitalization of the word) on his name? Which means whenever you say his name his people will know and come for you. Right away they just teleport in and start blasting?"

Harry nodded along to the older one eyed man.

"Well that's just dumb. Alright kid let's have fun with this."

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Harry wasn't sure why they were standing there in between two hooligan crowds after Arsenal had lost but Xander said it would be fine.

"I'm gonna call my friends and we are going to kick all your limey asses until you understand American Football is all that matters. You nancy kickball isn't shit."

The angry yells and sudden proliferation of deadly objects worried Harry greatly.

"Oi mate, ya Yankee twat, go ahead call your mates, just more blood to spill!"

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Elric Strongoak was wondering why he was being called in. So far over fifty Death Eaters had been sent off for something and it looked like his group would be joining them soon.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Elric vomited as he looked around. It was a war zone as he saw muggles beating Death Eaters to well, to death. This was some seriously messed up stuff. Speaking of messed up, Elric soon learned a new definition, for a short time anyways, of the word messed up.

Messed Up, Define: the feeling of having a chain hit you in the head at high velocity several times by a foaming at the mouth hooligan.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

"Xander is this anything like your last idea? Cause this seems like a really bad one."

"Nonsense, it's fine Harry." Xander stood still in the large steel box with a few air holes in it that Harry was levitating into the enclosure. "Random fun fact, did you know an enraged Chimpanzee can rip a person's limbs off with ease? Also if you wouldn't mind now would be a good time to cast that reverse calming charm. Voldemort"

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Harry could only shake his head as he stared at Xander. He was standing on a little platform, covered in a heat resistant suit and brimming with cooling charms.

Said platform was in the middle of the largest steel refinery in the UK surrounded by molten metal. Harry was almost starting to feel bad for the death eaters.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Gillyweed was amazing, especially when you were over 20 atmospheres underwater and could say the word Voldemort easily.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Xander clapped Harry on the shoulder. The war was over and you would be hard pressed to find a blood purist alive still. Apparantly you didn't need to kill immortal assholes, just send them off really far, like the sun.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Hope you enjoyed it! A slight Buffy crossover.

** Here's an idea I've had for a while.

--------------

Blefarius Globenclodder glanced at the clock. It was shortly after 6, two hours into the evening shift, with six more to go until his replacement would arrive.

When they first showed him office, after he volunteered to work as a Taboo dispatcher under the new regime, he had found the gramophone whose enormous horn took the shape of a human ear creepy beyond compare, especially with the din of a thousand indistinguishable conversations coming from within.

But, the ear kept him busy enough in those first few days, as the regime consolidated power. Now, he found it calming, whiling away the hours trying to make out the snippets of speech. It was futile, of course: every conversation in the British Isles echoed in that enchanted eardrum, over 60 million people having hundreds of thousands of conversations at any given time. It would remain unintelligible until someone said The Name.

"Voldemort," a female voice echoed from inside the ear, before fading back into the din. Blefarius perked up. The gramophone came alive, the blank vinyl record spinning up, the arm with the needle beginning to inscribe the location onto it. A chime rang next to it, indicating that the Anti-Disapparation jinx had been cast over the target location, and any protective enchantments short of the Fidelius Charm removed.

"Voldemort. Voldemort." The voice repeated the words, but the contraption was smart enough to ignore repetition. (He'd been there during the shakedown period, before they implemented that. It hadn't been fun.)

Blefarius caught the finished record as it was levitated from the gramophone, pointedly ignoring the three squads of Snatchers ready to go.

Who should take this one? It was Fenrir Greyback's turn to go. No, he wouldn't do. This was Portland Place, in the middle of Muggle London. Statute of Secrecy still mattered, so this required a more deft hand. Rowle's squad? He motioned him over, ignoring Greyback's low growl and bared teeth.

He passed the Death Eater the record. Rowle and his group crowded around it, making sure that everyone was touching it. (Amazing invention, that gramophone: it made each record a portkey.) There was a crack as Rowle's group disappeared.

He'd also need to warn the Obliviators, too, just in case. He started to write a note.

"Voldemort-Voldemort-Voldemort." Several different voices this time. The needle started dutifully inscribing a new record. (They had, in fact, anticipated the possibility that several people might speak The Name at the same time. The ear would echo all of them, but the gramophone would pick one and go with it.) He glanced at the record. Somewhere in Wales, in a pretty remote area.

He took that record and handed it to Greyback.

"Voldemort-Voldemort-Voldemort-Voldemort-Voldemort!" The repetition continued sounds blurring and building on each other. Blefarius raised an eyebrow. Greyback's group disapparated.

Blefarious passed the next record to the third and last group. Busy night. "VOLDEMORT-VOLDEMORT-VOLDEMORT-VOLDEMORT-VOLDEMORT!" The horn was becoming uncomfortably loud.

"VOLDEMORT-VOLDEMORT-VOLDEMORT-VOLDEMORT-VOLDEMORT!"

"/SILENCIO!/"

Blefarius wasn't sure if the device could still work when silenced, but it looked like they had more calls than they could handle anyway. He sat back down, and looked over at the Appariton spot.

Because of this, he missed the increasingly loud whistling that accompanied the steam that was now billowing from the ear.

There was a pop as Rowle returned. "Just Muggles," he spat. "The rest are keeping them company while we wait for the Obliviators. Hey, what's..."

He did not finish his question, because both were bowled over by the silent explosion, before being peppered by flying burning chunks of ear and not as burning but much sharper chunks of gramophone and record.

***

"You recon it worked?" asked Ron. They were in an empty house, crowded around a TV tuned to BBC Six O'Clock News.

Hermione shrugged. "My Confundus worked: she said the words. Thousands of Muggles will be wondering what a you-know-what is for at least a few days."

"It'll keep the Taboo busy, at least."

"The question is, for how long? Can they make the Taboo ignore Muggles?"

--------------

If I had more time, I would probably write it as an escalating series of "pranks" against the Taboo. Start by having a recording playing it, and when they filter those out, have a Portrait saying it, then teach a parrot to say it (from a recording), etc., and this would be the latest.

** People seem to frequently forget about the more powerful/broken aspect of the taboo: it doesn't just alert the Ministry to where you are, it also breaks all the protective enchantments at your location.

Walk up to Malfoy Manor and say Voldemort's name then rush into the unprotected home and try to do as much damage as possible before the Ministry arrives.

** In the Floriography series by Endrina on ao3, there are some excellent shenanigans where someone leads Death Eaters on a merry chase using the Taboo. One of them ends up apparating into a sewer. It's absolutely fantastic. It does have slash pairings, but they're really well done. I hope you enjoy it!
