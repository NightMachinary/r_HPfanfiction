It's a series I read once upon a time on fanfiction.net. what I remember from it is that there is a creature below Hogwarts that's man like but with a pod on his back and vines, he's half plant half man? Harry finds him and get adopted by the plant guy. They find the plant guys mate who killed voldemort. The meet other plant people and fight a war against basalisks. Harry turns Sirius into a plant guy. Someone has a baby plant person. The plant people came from a meteor that crashed into Atlantis and are I fact alien. I'd really like to reread it if possible.


** ...And the award for weirdest but strangely fascinating fic premise goes toooooooo ----
