** Harry and Ginny from [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][The Meaning of One]] kind of apply.

They don't have an affinity for fire, but their overpowered magic turns the harmless bluebell flames spell Hermoine uses in Philosopher's Stone into a room-sized fireball and since as first and second years they don't really know any other powerful offensive spells it ends up becoming their "nuclear option" for when shit really hits the fan.

It's not the best fit but it's the only fic I can think of that matches the criteria.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

** I remember a Batman cross where Harry starts using fire almost exclusively. I wanna say Ace of Spades? The author's Joker seemed to be a Ledger-Nicholson blend. Didn't get too far in it, though.

** Ginny in the later years of linkao3(Harry Potter and the Girl in Red) is the best I can think of, but she's not the MC.

Also, if that counts, my Hermione in linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) can spit fire since Third Year, and isn't afraid to use that, but she has no affinity for /other/ spells than the modified /Fiendfyre/ in question.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.
