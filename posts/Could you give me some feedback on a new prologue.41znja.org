I'm always writing new prologues. While often enough I'm stuck with my ongoing fic projects, I do write new beginning to stories on a regular basis.

The newest, I find especially interesting. However, I'm not sure if I should give up one of my projects for it.

I'm just asking for some feedback on it, even if its just "like it"/ Don't like it"

The working title is "Magical Machines". I got the idea while playing Fallout 4, watching Ex Machina and reading about "new Era" fics on here. The premise is basically that the new life created by humans develops magical abilities.

** Right off the bat, I can give you at least 50 solid points for creativity. This is what I like to see, new and novel ideas.

Overall, I thought it was pretty good! It was decently well written and certainly a cut above the average quality of fanfiction. Definitely good enough to read more. I did catch the occasional misplaced comma or slightly unfitting word, but these are just minor problems that could easily be fixed with a beta.

Ultimately, if you have a good idea for how the plot will progress (that is, if you're not just writing an /idea/, but an actual story), then you've got the makings of an enjoyable fic here.

*Edit:* On a second read, it has to be noted that you use a /lot/ of exposition. Maybe a bit too much? You might want to rewrite it so that it's more show (Hermione finds the acceptance letter for the Android) instead of just /telling/ the audience it happened.

The key thing to note here is that all these changes you're describing have existed for decades in this world, so all the explanations seemed more aimed at the audience than anyone. Write as though everyone already knows about these things, show them acting naturally around it, and you will be able to convey the same amount of information without just telling it to the audience.

First off: thanks for even attempting a second read :D

Yes, its a sketch, more than anything. If I decide to develop a story from it, I'd rewrite all of it.

** "Rituals, Blood Magic, Shamanism and Druid Studies" <- Nothing really wrong with them, but you should have showed instead of telling this bit. Their inclusion in the Prologue feels unnecessary, aside from trying to look "edgy" or showing how diverse! and different! your magic system is. And it fails spectacularly at that. My advice would be cut these out, just mention the movement or have a throwaway line mentioning the new subjects in Hogwarts, and expound on them in later chapters.

"Back to nature and its ways, that was the path the wizards took and it brought them nothing but a wealth of knowledge and good lifes." <- You make Hermione sound like an environmental hipster.

You also use the idea of muggle technology (no matter how advanced) > magic. I disagree with it fundamentally, but this isn't the place for that debate. My issue is that even in this hypothetical super-advanced scientific society, I just don't but kids not wanting to learn magic.

I mean come on, it's /magic/, for crying out loud. It's fantastical! It's adventurous! What kid wouldn't want that? A small fraction, I could accept. But a majority? You must be shitting me.

You also need to read up on your capitalization. You capitalize Goblins, but not centaurs. You capitalize English, but not arabic. Plenty of places where you don't use the right punctuation. You're mixing up tags and beats in speech.

For example: "Hi," John said. <- this is the right way to write a sentence.

"Hi," John chuckled. <- This is wrong. Because no matter how big John's penis is, or how awesome his magical core might be, or how many animagus forms he has - He. Cannot. Chuckle. A. Word. That's like trying to say he laughed a sentence.

It should instead have been written as, "Hi." John chuckled.

You also misspelled algorithms (not algorythms).

"Gringotts credit card" is cringe worthy as a concept. The magical world has always been isolationist. I don't see them developing a product that has no market, especially since the logical conclusion of less muggleborns is less interaction and therefore greater isolation.

You like to tell a lot. Almost 70% of the prologue seemed to be just info dumping stuff on the reader and make for a boring read. Look it over again and ask yourself, "How important is introducing this concept/idea to the story?"

Does it affect the plot? Is it significant to the world you're trying to create? Does throwing in a bunch of science terms really do anything?

If the answer is no to all of the above, then trim it down. Yes, I get that you're trying to show how advanced and science-y your society has become, but it's just too in your face. Little details, subtle hints and let the reader reach those conclusions on his own.

*** Thanks for your feedback. I agree with most of what you say, especially about the stylistic choices I made. But then again, most of these things I never look at again. This one would be rewritten completely if I decide to make a story out of it.

But I don't get where you read this:

#+end_quote

I had thought I made it clear that the Android is the only technology Hermione knows of that doesn't drop dead when it comes in touch with magic.

**** The breakdown of technology is trivial to the discussion of which is superior. It neither proves nor disproves which system is better.

No, I'm talking about. Hermione's tone on the off-world mining muggles are doing felt too much, to me at least, that it was something wizards were incapable of. How kids were choosing technology over magic.

How its implied that wizards couldn't find a solution to the exploding cybernetic hearts once they were aware of the risk. The first student dying I could accept. They didn't know what was happening. Once they did though? That stretched my disbelief. It should have become a non-issue for magic to fix.

This ties in to what I'm talking about with little details and subtle hints bringing the world to life. You may not have intended to write it that way, but these small things build up a picture that magic is now stagnant.

I guess at the heart of it is, I see all these advances in muggle society, but I can't help but wonder what about the wizards? What have they done? Returning to druidism or whatnot is fine, but does that mean they never found a means to have even faster communication? That they never advanced, made things more efficient, made their magical knick knacks better? That they couldn't, if they put their mind to it, take a vacation on Pluto or something?

Those improvements are exactly at odds with your New Movement idea.

Of course, now rereading it, it's apparent to me that some of my criticism is rooted on the fact that I dislike the idea of old magic = powerful magic. It just makes more sense to me that a magic system develops and gets better over time, not degrades.

***** Ah, now I see.

The underlying idea was that the wizarding world of Britain goes into something like the Renaissance of magic. The only way why old magic = powerful magic would be if by some reasons magical knowledge degenerated like scientific knowledge did under the church. Stuff that was illegal, forgotten and whatnot gets found or pours into Britain from other regions of the world. The old becoming the new, essentially. I also wanted to explore the "alternative to progress". Progress as we know it is a very new idea. 200 to 300 years old plus or minus a few decades. Its a symptom of "hot cultures" and the way it strikes me, magical culture were inherently cold. The timeframe I'm writing in would be when this cold culture becomes hot due to a change of mindset within the relevant institutions. Basically from "If they want magic, they shouldn't have these mechanical hearts." to "We must change to allow these implants to work."

Anyway, i'm keeping your feedback in mind should I really write it, because in essence you're right. Especially about the "faster communication" stuff.
