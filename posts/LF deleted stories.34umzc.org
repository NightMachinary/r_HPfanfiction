I'm looking if anyone has a saved file or site of stories by the author "Werewolf Warrior". They wrote 2 stories(smutfics+plot), the current one which was a WIP called 'Dragon Lily', which I was really enjoying as the story was completely different to any other I had read. I recently checked for updates and found it was deleted, does anyone know if the author gave a specific reason?


** I happen to have epub versions of both these stories

- [[http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=62594865889255677024][A Big Happy Weasley Family]]

- [[http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=80703633409842663822][Dragon Lily]]

Edit:- +I've updated the links Get them before they expire+ Edit2:- Updated with new links .Will never expire

*** God dammit Dragon Lily was a really good story, regardless of smut. Sucks that the author being a pussy killed both versions of it.
