** linkffn(8324961) Magical Me by Pubicola is a blatant self-insert, where the writer ends up being transported into Gilderoy Lockhart. Unfortunately, it got left at 16 chapters back in 2015, so that's probably all you'll ever get.

(No, it's not the one where Harry goes back in time and becomes Lockhart, that's a different fic)

Anyway, I enjoyed it enough last time that I'm willing to go through it again. I hope you find it to be fun as well.

** Man, I really need to re-write my fic without Maggie some time, because so many people post here looking for a male OC without a love story and I honestly think I could write Todd Ollivander without the love interest. But I like the love interest, haha! Anyway, here's my story. I'm going to think of others that better fit your request in the meantime.

Not complete but updated regularly. I think you would like all the chapters that I call my "best" that I highlight in my author's note at the top of Chapter One, because the adventure plot is the main focus in those.

EDIT: Also, my one-shot is not a love story (but, y'know, it's only 1,200, words): [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942599/1/Hagrid-s-Umbrella]]

EDIT2: I liked “Goldstein” a lot, though it's very mellow so it's not everyone's cup of tea. No romance plot:

*** Thank you!! As long as I don't get annoyed at the love interests personality, I'm fine with it.

Female characters tend to be a bit whiny and unlikeable, but if you like the character, I'll read it

** Maybe that's what you're looking for. A male OC called Scott mentors Harry through his sixth and seventh year. By the way, Scott is not a Scot but a Yank. Although no OC is mentioned in the summary, Scott is the main character in the story, closely followed by Harry.

**** Thank you so much! I really appreciate it. I haven't been reading fanfictions since 2007 cause life, so I've missed out on a lot.
