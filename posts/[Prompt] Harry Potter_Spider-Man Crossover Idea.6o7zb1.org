This seems like an unlikely crossover on the surface, but there's an idea that I've had centering around the two for quite some time.

As many are aware, in the Spider-Man comic archs and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 movie, Gwen Stacy falls to her death due to Peter being unable to save her.

This is where my thought comes in. When Gwen hits the ground and dies, instead she wakes up...somewhere else as Daphne Greengrass.

Gwen/Daphne would then have to struggle through deciding who they actually are. She would have memories of both childhoods and would immediately decide that her death and life with Peter were the dream. Except was it all a dream?

The reason I find this idea so intriguing is due to the OC nature of Daphne (which is talked about often on this sub). There could be this very real human struggle where Gwen/Daphne have to decide to stay the path and conform to Slytherin House's more pure blood ideals or cast away whatever remains of Daphne Greengrass and become a hero as Gwen.

Edit: A possible arch could be Gwen trying to get back home to help Peter with her new found powers.
