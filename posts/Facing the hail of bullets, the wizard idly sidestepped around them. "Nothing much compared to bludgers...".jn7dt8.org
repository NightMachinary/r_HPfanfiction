Note from CoS:

The Nimbus 2000 travels at easily over 100mph (probably closer to 150mph), and

Bludgers are still able to catch up to players flying on a Nimbus 2000

That means Hogwarts Quidditch players can tangle with 100~ mph automatically targetting metal balls. Professionals, though...


** This might work if they were baton rounds or arrows. Which are significantly slower [[https://emj.bmj.com/content/22/2/111]] however given that the trademark crack of a bullet is because it breaks the speed of sound which is over 700mph at sea level [[https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/sound.html#:%7E:text=If%20we%20consider%20the%20atmosphere,%2C%20or%201100%20feet%2Fsecond][https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/sound.html#:~:text=If%20we%20consider%20the%20atmosphere,%2C%20or%201100%20feet%2Fsecond]].

It's much less feasible.

You then need to take into account the profile of the different projectiles into account. Bludgers are 6" balls of steel wrapped in leather. A bullet is 6mm of lead. One of those is significantly easier to see coming at you than the other.

*** Now I can't stop thinking about a wizard that thinks something like this...

"Bullets hit you and go 'crack' because they are too fast. Bludgers also do the same, so they must go at a similar speed. I can dodge a bludger with no problems so I must be able to dodge bullets. Even if I get hit, light armor protects me from bludgers. bullets are smaller, thus, weaker."

Then he goes to fight polisemen in quidditch uniform and gets an overdose of lead.

** 150mph equates to 792,000 feet per hour which equates to 13,200 feet per minute which equates to 220 feet per second

The muzzle velocity of a standard hunting .30-06 (7.62x63mm) round is 2700 feet per second which is over 12 times faster than your nimbus broom.

The standard military round 5.56x45mm is 3165 feet per second which is over 14 times faster.

So if the Wizard did not already have some sort of viable defense in operation prior to the trigger being pulled it's doubtful he could avoid a bullet especially if he was attacked from a distance as both rounds travel over twice the speed of sound. So the wizard would be dead before he heard the bang.

** I always wondered about this, actually. Like, how easy would it be for a stands-level audience member (or whatever you call the people who aren't in high boxes) to follow a Quidditch Game like that? The actual specifics, I mean - player goes this way, bludger goes that way, oh he saw the snitch type stuff. Or do they wholly rely on the omniculars and the announcer to actually make sure they know what the hell is going on?

*** Out of universe explanation: Rowling is bad at math and intentionally designed Quidditch to be stupid. As such, any attempt to understand Quidditch or create a realistic game should probably ignore most of canon.

In universe explanation if you really don't want to ignore canon: Just because the brooms can go that fast doesn't mean that they always do. A high top speed does not necessarily imply rapid acceleration. And players may choose not to fly at top speed for greater maneuverability, sharper turns, and to give themselves time to react. And we only know the canon speed of the Firebolt. Older brooms were definitely slower, but we don't know how much slower.

**** I would imagine that only the seekers would ever get up to those sorts of speeds, and even then, only in controlled bursts. Which also explains why the Wronski Feint is such a tricky move. I can imagine that they have a sport like motorcycle racing except in 3d where those speeds are more commonly reached.

***** And quite frankly even with "movie magic" the scenes that showed brooms flying and a stable background (building, seated fans, etc) did not show anyone moving that quickly. I'd be surprised if someone did a speed calculation whether they would reach 50mph/73fps (assuming a 2 ft wide seat (average chair is 18" so being generous here), that means for one second of "flight" the broom would go passed over 36 people in a row).

**** Even so, it's still relatively fast paced, chaotic, and happening in a large space. And players aren't exactly car-sized blobs to follow around.

*** I just assumed wizards bad much better reflexes a d stuff because of magic developing in the body there are holes in that theory tho since if their reactions are better because of that and uts been proven they can change their bodies with accident magic why would harry have bad eyesight when if my theory was correct even if he was born like that it should have fixed itself

**** There was a comic I saw once that had a Werewolf and Vampire standing side by side and being shot by a couple of soldiers.

The Vamp is "You cannot kill that which does not live."

And the Were "Only a silver bullet could kill someone like me."

The soldiers look at each other and open up with chain guns, leaving the Vampire and Werewolf in many many little chunks.

Maybe still what passes for being 'not dead' for each of them, but in little chunks.
