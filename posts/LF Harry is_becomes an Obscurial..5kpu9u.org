** Wait another month or so. Out of experience, those worth the read take a while to be released. At least I haven't seen a good one with themes from Fantastic Beasts, yet.

  COMPLETE: Following a freak storm in Little Whinging, ten-year-old Harry Potter flees his horrid home and embarks on a journey towards Hogwarts, a place he knows only from a strange letter addressed to him. Guided by a mysterious voice in his head, Harry avoids dangerous men with wands and a powerful force that wants him dead, as rumours persist that Lord Voldemort has returned...

** Hm, I haven't seen anything in that direction. And this topic actually itches me, I'd love to read about it, maybe even write about it. I'm by no means a talented author, but there is so much you could do with it. I already have ideas for 3-4 ideas for interesting scenes. It's already established that Harry is a rather powerful wizard (Patronus fighting of 100s of Dementors in 3rd year), so you could go anywhere with it.

You could write this from different perspectives, and it would be interesting from all:

- Harry
- Dumbledore
- Amelia Bones / Fudge (I imagine as head of the DMLE it'd be her job to deal with it)
- Arabella Figg
- A teacher of Harry
- McGonagall (Dumbledore says nothing, but she realizes that an Obscurial in Surrey can only be Harry)
- Hagrid (Same thing as McGonagall, but he informs Newt)
- Newt himself
- ...

You could have a different focus:

- How did Harry become an Obscurial
- How is it discovered that it's Harry
- How will the wizarding world deal with it, when he is maybe even killed?

You could even call it Newt Scamander as "Expert" on Obscurials, a Newt / Abused/Obscurial Harry interaction might be interesting to read. It is implied multiple times that Newt and Dumbledore do know each other well enough.

Maybe Newt has truly given up after Credence. Maybe he thinks the risk is too high. Maybe all the time in the Beast Division of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures has made him cynical, but maybe he still has some of his wonder. You can write Newt in so many ways. Maybe he's become a little Dumbledore himself?

Damn, this idea has merits. You can do so much with this, and all of it is interesting.
