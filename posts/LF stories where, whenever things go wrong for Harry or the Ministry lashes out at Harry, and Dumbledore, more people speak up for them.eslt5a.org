Rather it's to speak up to Malfoy, to Umbridge, maybe they write complaints to the Ministry, in how Umbridge is running the school, write complaints about how Snape is, or different things like that.

Not really wanting romance, but am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

No Harry/Hermione, no Draco/Hermione.

No OP Harry, no Harem Harry, no Lord Potter-Black-Malfoy

Can be on any site

Would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.

Harry anonymously presents the facts of the situation in the newspaper. The public starts listening. And then they join his side by the end. Harry's Slytherin side really comes out to play in this one. I wouldn't call it helpful Goblins though. More like quid pro quo.

*** I tried reading it, and it seems interesting, I can see why people would like it, but it was just, too much.
