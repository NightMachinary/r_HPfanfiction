There are some ships that can make some very interesting plots. Here are my opinions on Harry/? couples that I like reading best.

Harry/Susan

Harry/Daphne

Harry/Hermione(even the good H/Hr fics I've read differentiate Hermione's personality a bit compared to the books)

Harry/Fleur


** I almost exclusively stick to canon, but my exception is Harry/Luna.

** Hmm. I don't know, I've never found a fic that explicitly stated this as the 'pairing', but I've always liked the idea of an asexual Harry.

** Out of all the non-canon Harry pairings my favourite is Harry/Luna. I think that Harry/Luna would have happened if Ginny didn't exist, or if her role was way more relegated (for example, by having Luna be in the Chamber instead of Ginny).

*** Harry/Hermione has always irked me, and people tend to overlook Susan quite a bit.

Harry and Luna do have quite a bit in common but I've never gotten that kind of spark between them.

** I'm a sucker for Harry/Tonks.

Harry/Fleur or Harry/Luna is also good.

*** I once read a fic that was during the summer inbetween OoTP and HBP, if I remember correctly. Seriously well written story. I'll try to dig it up from my rather large and terribly unorganized fanfiction archive.

** I'm pretty big on Harry/Luna as a rather large amount of people seem to nowadays. I'd write a fic about them if I had any idea how to write Luna's character.

** I'm definitely a huge Harry/Ginny only person. I've only read one fic where I liked Luna enough to accept a Harry/Luna pairing. Other than that, not happening for me.

** My favorite is non standard stuff, just because its different. The truth is that I really don't mind though, as long as its well written. Except that some things are no go. Hr/D and the like.
