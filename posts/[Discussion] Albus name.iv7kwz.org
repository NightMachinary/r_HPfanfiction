No, this is not about Albus Twenty-Middlenames Dumbledore. This is about Harry's kid, who has absolutely no sense being named Albus Severus. Severus is just a no-way for a name. Albus, though it is more likely, it's odd it came before Rubeus. And over all, it was Ginny's turn to pick! First Harry, second Ginny, Lily Luna is one and one. Perfect.

Now I am so going to change Albus name in fanfic, but everything else stays the same. He is still going to be in Slytherin and still going to go to Hogwarts with Rose and Scorpius.

Initially I thought of something like Arthur Bilius Potter, but I also thought Ginny was a person more likely to give a new name to her son. So, I thought on Zephyr Arthur Potter. It made sense with Quidditch and a windy name... But not entirely convinced on how it sounds. Opinions? Other proposals?

EDIT... New ideas:

Wilden (means wild, passionate) -> Wilden Arthur Potter

Roland (yeah, no Ronald, to get on Ron's nerves) -> Roland Arthur Potter

Aslan (meaning lion) -> Colin Aslan Potter

Colt (male horse, based on Ginny's likely horse patronus) -> Arthur Colt Potter

Harrison (meaning "son of Harry") -> Arthur Harrison Potter

**** That should be Errol Crookshanks Weasley. Pigwidgeon was named by Ginny too. Errol was the old Weasley owl Ron was fond of

** Ironically, Albus Severus Potter seems like a name you'd see come out of a fanfiction.

** You could try Aeolus instead of Zephyr, but I don't really feel like Ginny would give her kid a complex or very old fashioned name. She seemed to really dislike the name Ginerva.

Alternatives that fit with your theme are:

Neil, Rai, Raiden, Tal, Gale, and Altair

As a completely unrelated option I'd like to suggest Colin.

*** Yeah that's my problem with Zephyr. I do feel Ginny could go for a new name, but a more common one, or at least a more common sounding one. The Quidditch thematic is good but the uncommonness of the name is not. Colin seems a solid option, I could picture it as a middle name instead of Arthur.

**** I suggest not Zephyr because I'm using that name in an hp related story and I would feel bad if I knew someone else was going to use it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
