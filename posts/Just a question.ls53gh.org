** Honestly, Because the books push so much about how much James loved Lilly.

and Sirius is often written as the bad party boy, and remus the tortured one. and just being online enough has told me the party boy and the tortured one is a clich√© and therefore used to death.

maybe there is also an element about how James and Sirius basically became brothers and they do not want to change that from a close brotherly bond to a simple romance.

but then again people ship the brothers of supernatural.

so I will go with the answer I always go with, most shipping is based on horny and horny often makes no sense.

oh and James is dead. and since most harry potter fics I would wager are set during the time period of the novels its hard to have sirius horny for James, if he a big dead corpse

** Because the whole series is based on James and Lily having a child.

** Because James is very clearly and repeatedly portrayed as having been in a relationship with Lily, the girl who he pursued for years while at school. Sirius is not shown in any intimate relationships, and Remus is only shown in one - with Tonks - late in the series. So Sirius and Remus are "available", James isn't.

*** It took him seven years to get Lily. Likely as not, they were all horny AF but James wouldn't take a girl out if he hoped Lily would change her mind and love him. The solution would be to seek relief elsewhere if you catch my drift. Preferably hidden.

**** He would then do what every teenage boy ever has done, and use his hand.

****** There's no possibly about it. He would definitely use his hand, and would continue to do so even after Lily finally falls for him :-)

But it's quite unlikely that he'd go "oh well, girls are too difficult, I'll just go for a boy instead". Bisexuality is uncommon to start with (it's less common than homosexuality), and I would like to think that he has at least /some/ brain and would realise that if word gets out that he's just shagging anything that's available that would make Lily even less likely to fall for him.

** As others have mentioned its likely because James/Lily is needed for the whole basis of the story, if they don't happen, there is no HP, unless you have him fathered by someone else o course.

I've read at least one fic where James/Lily/Sirius was a triad, though I don't think it got as far as whether it was james/sirius with lily/James or james/lily and lily/sirius or a full triad. It would be an interesting base premise for a story tho

** Probably because people have internalized the idea of James/lily. The idea of James/whoever is more difficult to fathom because of that.
