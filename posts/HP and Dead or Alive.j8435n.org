I looked at fanfic and didn't see this couple pair. So i would like to see one. What I want to see is:

- year 6, While Harry is on Horcrux hunt.
- Kasum is still being hunted by her clan
- Kasumi agrees to help Harry take care of Horcruxes and Dark lord/Death Eaters... In exchange, Harry help hide her from her clan and deal with Donova
- I would like to see Ninjistu applied in Wizarding World. and how Dead or Alive universe would deal with a Wizard.
- Harry/Kasumi romanctic pairing

Optional - both Ron and Hermoine abonded Harry. and Ginny broke up with Harry. (or never dated)
