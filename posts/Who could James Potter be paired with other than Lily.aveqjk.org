** If we're saying Voldemort is an acceptable pairing for Lily, then literally anybody who isn't dead will work for James. If we're talking about an actual believable ship.. Well. The thing is, we just don't know any women his age. Not that I can remember anyway. I assume you don't mean slash, otherwise one of the marauders would be the obvious choice.

Andromeda is at least 6 years older than him and had given birth to Tonks by the time he was out of Hogwarts, but I mean it's probably doable. If you're going to go with one of the Black sisters, Narcissa is probably your best bet and she's 5 years older than him. James stealing Lucius' girl could be amusing.

Alice would-be Longbottom, maybe?

** My major, major pet peeve with the series as a whole is the lack of female characters who are more than a name in that generation. Harry's parents had four best friends between them and all of them were male. So far as we know, the only Marauder who wasn't an only child was Sirius, and he had a brother rather than a sister. Of course Lily has Petunia, who wasn't magical and didn't want anything to do with magic, and Sirius had his somewhat-older and canonically married-off cousins, but that's not much.

There is no real option for James (or Snape or the other Marauders) beyond Lily.

** Andromeda (Black) was 5-9 years older than him and in a relationship with Ted when James was a first year. So it's unlikely. Narcissa would be a slightly better bet as the youngest sibling but even she is quite a few years older. There aren't many known female characters in canon from his Hogwarts days so it's hard to say. By virtue of being one of the few female characters we know of in Hogwarts during the Marauder era we can point to Marlene McKinnon. But we know next to nothing about her.

A lot of people tend to think that a ton of the adult characters went to Hogwarts together, but most of them went to Hogwarts before the Marauders (Amelia Bones, Bellatrix and her sisters, etc.)

*** tbf Narcissa is only 5 years older than James, which isn't a huge gap once both characters are adults. It won't work in a Hogwarts era fic for obvious reasons, but if you're doing some sort of AU where James survives the attack on Godric's Hollow, or something, you could theoretically make this pairing work if you invest a great deal of time into developing the characters. Their relationship would most likely be openly hostile, though, given the whole "married to a Death Eater" thing, so you'd have to make a up /a lot/ of groundwork for a post-1981 James/Narcissa to work in any capacity.

**** True. It all depends on when the fic takes place, if it's years after they all finished Hogwarts it's not really an issue. I personally don't really mind people meddling with the ages all that much (i.e. Bellatrix, Narcissa, Andromeda all in Hogwarts around the Marauder era) since it makes that period more interesting with canon characters. And if you do end up throwing all those characters in the same melting pot a character like Amelia Bones would be my primary guess for a James pairing.

#+begin_quote
  Draco married the younger sister of a fellow Slytherin. Astoria Greengrass, who had gone through a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from pure-blood ideals to a more tolerant life view, was felt by Narcissa and Lucius to be something of a disappointment as a daughter-in-law. They had had high hopes of a girl whose family featured on the â€˜Sacred Twenty-Eight', but as Astoria refused to raise their grandson Scorpius in the belief that Muggles were scum, family gatherings were often fraught with tension.
#+end_quote

snape is a good contrast: snape rejected his past ideology, affiliations and actions and actively worked against them and for other people, which is why harry considers him the bravest man he ever knew. it isn't just about physical courage, which he's always had, it's /emotional/ courage

******* Thanks for the quote; I assume it's from Pottermore? I pretty much never follow Rowling's post-canon clarifications, so I was hedging my bets a little because I don't think it's directly stated that she's a blood racist in canon but can be assumed given that she was a Black and married Lucius. So yeah, that's another huge obstacle for a James/Narcissa fic to work.

#+begin_quote
  snape is a good contrast.
#+end_quote

No, he's not really a good contrast, or he is, but not in the way you've stated. While I agree that he rejects his past ideologies, affiliations and actions, his turning point is when Voldemort kills someone he deeply cares about. And by the time we learn that Snape was really a heroic character all along, he's had nearly two decades to self-reflect and turn himself into a better person (which he just about accomplishes). If we met Narcissa 10-15 years after Voldemort killed Draco in cold blood, we might have met a completely different character as well. I think the only fair comparison you can draw is between Narcissa and young Snape, the difference being that she turned on Voldemort before it costed her the person she cares about.

maybe, but there's no basis for it. if we meet umbridge, lucius and igor 15 years later they too will possibly be different people. igor and lucius also betray and abandon voldemort, to save themselves and, in lucius' case, also for his family. narcissa loves, taught and expects draco to be a hateful bigot- and is disappointed when he isn't. we /already/ know snape behaves heroically, and how he develops, which is why we can claim he does; we have no reason to expect anyone else would undergo similar development

** I think almost everyone would work, to be honest. We know so little about James. His relationships are never really explored, apart from the Marauders, Lily and Snape of course. So almost all characters would be fine.

If we are talking about relationships that seem plausible from hints in canon, then I think Sirius would be the most logical choice. I personally don't really ship it and I don't think romance between these two is implied in the slightest, but apart from Lily and Harry, Sirius is probably the person that meant the most to James, so it wouldn't be that much of a stretch to pair them off (again, only if we are sticking to relationships already established in canon).

** Sirius feels like the strongest choice to me. They're established as best friends and love each other. Sirius' love for James (and as a result, James' family) is what drives him to watch out for Harry. It wouldn't be difficult to write them as a relationship instead of a friendship.

Then any of the blank slate female characters from his generation (Marlene McKinnon, Mary Macdonald, Emmeline Vance, Dorcas Meadows).

Not realistically. She's either the eldest of the Black sisters or the middle child, which would have her somewhere between 4 and 9 years elder to James.

I know that people like Harry/Tonks, but dating a guy that's 6-7 years younger isn't something that normal girls in their teens or early-mid twenties do.

As for pairings for James, the only real acceptable names (because names are all we have here, really) are Alice (whose maiden name shall be unknown), Marlene McKinnon, Dorcas Meadowes, Mary Macdonald, Emmeline Vance, Pandora (Luna's mother, whose maiden name shall be unknown) and...that's pretty much it, unless you want to go for Narcissa Black (although she's about 4-5 years older)
