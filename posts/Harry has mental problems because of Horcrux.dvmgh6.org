a fic with the negative long term effects of the Horcrux that is in Harry. There are a few fics that give some heavy bonuses such as Harry having all the knowledge that Tom did until that point but not so much the negatives. A fic where Harry has some severe dual personalities because of the Horcrux and talks to himself alot would be interesting. I'm talking full on psych ward Harry who starts going absolutely crazy with moods that swing like a pendulum and just entire loss of control of himself. He could have tics and muscle spasms because of his body fighting it, a whole bunch of things that make him look completely insane. Similar to t few fics that write Ron after the brain incident except more extreme and he progressively gets worse over time until he goes on a suicide mission to kill Tom. Something like this would be cool.


** linkffn(12978018) posits negative effects of Harry's long-term horcrux, yes. This isn't an action-packed story but I still suspect you'll enjoy what it is.

  When Harry was hit by the killing curse, a horcrux was created. In this story, Harry is affected by the piece of Voldemort's soul inside his head in a more noticable way than in the books. Muggles, not knowing any better, decide he must be mentally ill. What effects might the treatment on a psychiatric ward have for the boy-who-lived and the wizarding world?
