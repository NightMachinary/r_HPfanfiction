*** Yeah, it's kinda weird I know. It just really interests me. How they'd both deal with it. How would they all react? Depending on when it is (GoF probably) would Fleur's family know/be told?

****** He'd be freaked out for sure :p

Though it raises a question : would Harry in Fleur's body know how to speak French and vice versa? Because if not, there's a serious issue there haha.

******* I'm pretty sure that the whole "freaking out" part would last for about 5 minutes before it would be replaced by "I have tits. And a clitoris. Multiple orgasms, here I come!"

I mean, complete body changes are 100% canon (polyjuice), so it wouldn't be that alarming at first.

******** I feel like it could be even funnier if Harry was really hesitant to do /anything/ because oh god its leaking blood and everyone is looking at me like they want to eat me and /I never took sex ed/

and then Fleur is just unabashedly seducing all of Harry's female friends

******* Hmm. Not sure. I think that because it's Fleur's body he'd be able to. Though if it was to be concealed from her family the two would have to talk, and Fleur would teach Harry how to behave. Presumably this would take place during the tournament, when her family are absent and they can meet without anyone not in the know suspecting anything.

*** Not High Literature, but interesting enough to follow for a bit, anyway. One of the more annoying attempts at a written French accent I've seen, though. "Replace all initial t's with z's" is so not how that accent works that it never justifies the obnoxious reading experience, even as a lazy approximation. I wee why they wanted to distinguish the voices, but it would have been better to just write it straight. I'm dreading Hagrid.

  Imagine that one person that irritates, infuriates, & insults their way under your skin to the point where each moment with him or her becomes a pop quiz in self-control. Now, imagine that you've woken up in that person's body. For Lily Evans & James Potter, learning to navigate this unfortunate and stressful new reality is truly a walk through hell.

*** I just read one where Hermione and Lily Evans swap bodies called S(witch)ed linkffn(11287263). It had some interesting ideas, and I like that it fleshed out the world of 1970s Hogwarts, as well as exploring the House dynamics after the Second Wizarding War. The best aspect of the fic was that it explored their personality similarities as the brightest witches of their generation and created a similar streak of political activism, but created tension as Hermione tried to keep the timeline stable while Lily was trying to pester her to go and change the past. However, there were too many fanfic cliches to even finish it. (Too much common room drinking, Head Boy/Girl Rooms, Annual Balls, Lily has a pet snake and tries to befriend Draco Malfoy, everyone keeps saying 'Mione like it's her name).
