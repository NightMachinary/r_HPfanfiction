I get it. Maybe having a badass, capable protagonist isn't good for drama, but I'm not necessarily looking for drama. I'd like to read a story where the main character just does badass, reasonalbe, cool things. Preferable Harry is like 6th year or older as I can't really wrap my head around a little kid doing super cool stuff.

Thanks in advance if you guys have any reccommendations.!


** linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) is large parts political intrigue and war, but there's plenty of moments where Harry is awesome.

That said, linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal) is pretty much a constant stream of Harry being awesome, if you just want action.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
