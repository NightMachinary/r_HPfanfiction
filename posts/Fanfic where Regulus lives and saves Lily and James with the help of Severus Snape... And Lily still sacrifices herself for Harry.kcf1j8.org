The reason Voldemort's spells before the final battle didn't hold was that Harry had /meant/ to sacrifice himself, not because he actually died. (Obviously, given that he was alive at that point).

So what if somebody intercepted the curse before it could reach Lily, and told it that /in order to kill her/, it must stop all higher brain function? Which would put her on a coma, of course, but she's not dead, yet she made her sacrifice.

A similar thing could happen with James, but I'm finding it hard to come up with a person who would be clear-headed enough to think, 'If Voldemort thinks they're dead, they're safe', and also not protect Harry because they recognise the blood protection will do it for them and take out Voldemort in the process.

I also think that there might be a way to bind a stray piece of soul to an object or person, effectively turning /all/ of Voldemort's various pieces of soul into Horcruxes. Which would mean that it would be possible for Voldemort to be defeated in Harry's first year, in the run-in with Quirrel, while Harry happily lives out the rest of his days in ignorance of Vdemort's piece of soul inside him. (Or, given that Voldemort didn't just murder a family in cold blood, maybe he's never a Horcrux at all.)

Second year would happen relatively similarly, I think, assuming it is indeed possible that Harry could be a Parselmouth (either by Voldemort or his connection to Salazar Slytherin), and here's hoping that third year doesn't happen at all the way it was, seeing as Lily and James Potter would be around to object to the imprisonment of Sirius Black in the first place.

Of course, you're welcome to dispute the possibility of this ever happening, but it would be excruciatingly satisfying to see James Potter and Severus Snape finally come to a head, what do you think?
