Like the title says, fics where Harry at least is a troublemaker or prankster like the marauders, even better if he becomes an animagus.

Pls no slash, it's just not my thing. Thanks in advance!

** Which interpretation of the Marauders would you prefer? The nice, prankster one or the evil, bullies one?

**** Potter Club is kind of the best example of this. The thread below has some other decent-ish examples, but Potter Club is the best one. All the other examples I have bookmarked/could find with a quick google were mean/targeting enemies sorts of pranks (eg. trying to drive Umbridge out of the school by being annoying) or just bad.

This other thread also just had some interesting ideas for magical pranks that weren't shit or mean.
