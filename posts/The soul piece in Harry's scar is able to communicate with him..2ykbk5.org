  When Voldemort gave Harry that scar he gave him two other things; a part of his soul and a friend. The last remnant of Tom Riddle's humanity mentors Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

**** Victorian flower language is just assigning meanings to certain flowers. Neville is just Neville - awkward and slightly strange, but good-hearted. It's a very good fic
