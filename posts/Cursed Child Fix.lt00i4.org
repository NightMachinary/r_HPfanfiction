*NEW CHAPTER OUT NOW (CHAPTER 7)*

Hate the Cursed Child?

Ever wondered why Harry is not behaving like himself in it? or why we barely see him or the original trio at all? Why Cedric Diggory ever becomes a Death Eater? What's the deal with Voldemort having kids? And what's with all the time travel, didn't JK Rowling specifically say she smashed all of the Time-Turners in OP to get rid of this plot device?

*What if we could make the Cursed Child better? What if we could make it fit better within the Harry Potter series?*

I'm working on a "fix" of the Cursed Child story with my own (upcoming) series of books (Harry Potter and The Lost Child is the first of five):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13823288/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Lost-Child]]

General summary: no Delphi, VERY canon adherent, the plot draws a little from the Cursed Child but improves upon it (at least in my opinion), and NO BLEEDING TIME TRAVEL.

Let me know what you guys think!


** I haven't actually read the Cursed Plot, so I'm not the best person to critique your efforts, but I'll applaud the sentiment anyway :).

*** Lol do yourself a favour and don't read the cursed child. You're welcome to check this story anyway though. I think it's even better if you didn't read/watch the play!
