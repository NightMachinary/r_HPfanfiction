I'm not sure if this has been done, but I thought I could give it a shot. What I will do is once a week you guys suggest a story, and everyone describes what cliches there are, and what is unique about it. At the end of the week we collectively decide if the story is worth reading, and if so we promote it or if not we just leave it. I'm willing to work with others to iron out rules, and such. Thought it would be a fun thing to do while also promoting stories that are not well known, and it gives a competition type feel. If I can get some help in figuring out a type of prize at the end of each week, suggestions will be welcome. So hoping to hear from you guys, bye.


** I don't think it's a very good idea. It sounds uncomfortably like how the bullying started over on DLP. I think the current system of free recommendation is better.

** Don't we already have a book club going on? This sounds like basically the same thing. I'm sure you can give [[/u/Psantium_]] recommendations to take into consideration.

*** üëçI'll be happy to consider any ideas and recommendations; the PM link is always on the bottom of the Book Club posts!

** That sounds like it could turn into a fic-bashing fest really easily. No one deserves that unless they specifically ask for brutal honesty.
