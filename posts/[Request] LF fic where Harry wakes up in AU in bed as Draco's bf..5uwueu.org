He goes along with it, then eventually returns to his own universe where the relationship sparks again. Post Hogwarts Fic. Don't remember much else - except it was fairly well written. Any help tracking it down would be hugely appreciated!


** Sounds a LOT like linkao3(Turn by saras_girl) - amd if it isn't, you should still read Turn, because it is possibly my favourite fic!!
