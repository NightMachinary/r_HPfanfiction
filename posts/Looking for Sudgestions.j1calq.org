Hey guys, looking for fics regarding the C.O.S., looking for things such as: Harry returning to the C.O.S. learning Parselmagic, rituals ( such as in Harry Potter and The I.T.T), Basilisk familiar and all good stuff like that.

Maybe even learning from Salazar, be it via time travel or whatever.

T.I.A.

Joe üôÇ


** Well f*** me it's at the tip of my tongue but I've forgotten it, the premise is where harry discovers Salazars portrait and it teaches him it's a harry x fleur and Salazar prompts harry into taking a life in order to remove the horcruxes. So he kills pettigrew in 4th year and burns the body, then gabriel and fleur discover the body. I'll look for it and post it later on

** Just started with The Venom Peddler by lightningfury (archive of our own) its fun, Harry haches basilisk in the chamber and they made a whole Lore thing out of it. Its a very indi Harry who just goes off on his own. I read it as a 'snackfic', in between other, more heavier fics. It is on the lighter side with plot, pace, development etc. Not the best writen but not bad.

Also just got serpentine by darkfire1220 (also archive of our own) recommended to me. Harry makes snake Friends before hogwards and escapes abusive dursleys with their help. I only red the first chapter right now but it looks very promising and well writen.

Sorry dont know how to link.

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.

  The voices Harry heard, those no one else could, were the only ones that spoke kindly to him growing up. They had spread their whispers across the world to rescue him and at last, found a way; by creating a queen of serpents. The birth of the amber-eyed empress triggers a permanent change in Harry's life, as he enters a world of magic that may protect or destroy him.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
