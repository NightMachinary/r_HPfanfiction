I don't know about you but I run into a LOT of Ron bashing in fics. I blame the film's. Let's discuss why our beloved redhead isn't a daft sidekick!

What are Ron's:

• likes/dislikes

• insecurities

• strengths and weaknesses

- Biggest misconceptions people have about him?

• things he values

• fears

Any other insights you'd like to share?


** Sorry I'm late to the party, but I'd like to contribute:

- Ron's likes/dislikes

Ron likes being part of a group. He likes the idea of "us." He's always inviting Harry to spend time at the Burrow. He plays chess with Harry and Hermione (and wins!). Even when he's arguing with Harry in /Goblet of Fire,/ he quickly strikes up a rapport with Dean and Seamus. His career ambition is to be an Auror, part of a /team/ of Dark Wizard hunters.

What Ron doesn't like is being /outshone./ He doesn't like it when others make themselves "big." But that doesn't mean he's critical of success. He's quick to praise Hermione as "best in the year," treating such a claim as common knowledge. What he doesn't like is when Hermione plays the role of "know-it-all" (and Hermione is no saint in that regard). He openly notes the accomplishments of his brothers. But he's antagonistic towards Percy the Prefect for being a pompous prat.

Ron likes good food. He likes being taken care of. And he also likes taking care of others--he writes to Mrs. Weasley to say that Harry wasn't expecting much for Christmas. While he certainly didn't expect her to send a sweater, we can reasonably assume he expected some sweets or perhaps some baked goods. He repeatedly invites Harry and Hermione to the Burrow, and welcomes them with open arms. He enlists Fred and George to help him rescue Harry from Privet Drive.

What Ron doesn't like is not being comfortable--he reacts the most harshly to the poor conditions of the Horcrux Hunt. But that's because he's cold, hungry, and slowly healing from a bad injury.

- Ron's Insecurities

The bulk of Ron's insecurities stem from his role in his family. He says as much--everything he does won't be as impressive, because it's already been done by his older brothers.

Bill is a Curse Breaker for Gringotts--which takes a lot of lessons from difficult subjects like Arthimancy.

Charlie is a dragon tamer and was Quidditch Captain.

Percy is very smart and very driven and likely had his nose in a book throughout most of Ron's childhood.

Fred and George are two peas in a pod and are always together and pull pranks and invent things and are on the Quidditch team as beaters. They are two halves as a whole.

Ron watched each brother, one after the next, develop these identities. Each one different, each one sought to stand out from the rest, and each succeeds in his field of choice.

Ron sees all this success and balks. He's got not only the expectations of everyone, but also the fear of "What if I /can't/ do this?" that none of his older brothers would have. Bill and Charlie were the eldest and paved the way with their passions; Percy immersed himself in making connections and amassing prestige; Fred and George stand side-by-side, forever.

How could Ron not be insecure about that? Harry /wants/ to be Just Harry. Ron sees himself as Just Ron.

- Biggest misconceptions

Ron Weasley is not a Death Eater.

Yes, he's rude. Yes, he is a bit of a glutton. Yes, he has some biases.

But he is not a Death Eater.

He is not overly lazy.

He does not hold Harry or Hermione back. If anything, he's the heart of the trio.

- Fears

Having grown up in the Wizarding World, Ron is simultaneously the most prone to superstitions (the Grim, the "powdered dragon root") but also the one who knows just how bad some people can be.

Dolohov killed his uncles, Gideon and Fabian Prewett. Ron would be too young to remember them. Ron knows the cost of war.

Within his personal relationships, Ron fears being left behind. He's seen his eldest brothers succeed and then leave home to bigger, better things.

- Other insights

While Ron is not without his biases, he's also not one to hold grudges. He's quick to try to bury the hatchet--his prolonged fight with Hermione over Scabbers notwithstanding (though it's worth noting that Hermione doesn't actually say she's sorry either).

Ron holds stereotypical views of giants and werewolves and house elves, until he gets to know them on a one-on-one basis. He develops a friendship with Dobby, giving him a pair of socks and a sweater. This is in stark contrast Hermione, who stands on a soapbox and ignores what the house elves actually say.

- Things he values

Ron values family. A lot. And he also values chivalry.

Over and over and over again, we see Ron step up to the plate when someone is in trouble and risks his neck to help.

He stands up to Malfoy from the beginning, putting a target on his back for Malfoy's taunts for six years.

He is instrumental in fighting the troll on Halloween.

He helps Hagrid with feeding Norbert, and gets bitten by the dragon for his trouble.

He follows the spiders, his greatest fear, into the Forbidden Forest and comes face to face with dozens of them.

He confronts Professor Snape's biases against Hermione the Know-it-All /two years/ before Harry shouts at Professor Umbridge.

Upon realizing he has let Hagrid down with Buckbeak, Ron pours over books in the library, taking over from an over-worked, exhausted Hermione.

He stands on a */broken leg/* and stares down "mass-murderer" Sirius Black, boldly declaring his intent to die for his friend.

He helps Harry study for the Second and Third Tasks, sacrificing his own valuable study time.

He joins Dumbledore's Army, despite the very precarious situation his father is in at work.

He fights in the Department of the Battle of Mysteries.

He fights in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.

He /shoots to kill/ during the Battle of Seven Potters, saving Tonks's life.

He dives into a pool of freezing water in the dead of winter to save Harry's life.

He fights throughout the Battle of Hogwarts, and is one of the most outspoken in defying Voldemort himself.

Hermione speaks for justice--but she's got a vicious streak to her that undermines her case, as she is more than willing to abuse others to get her way.

Ron fights for justice and is willing to kill but is not nearly so grey is his methods.

** I don't blame the movies for the bashing. I blame them for taking away Ron's humour. Ron in the books isn't classically witty but he is funny. He's a laugh to be around and a good friend. What I blame for the bashing is Ron, like a real friend, fought with Harry a few times. If you look at the fourth book, Harry and Ron do talk about entering the Tri-Wizard tournament, maybe not with intent but they do talk about it. Then Harry gets in, and you're left with a choice, either Harry did enter himself in which case he let Ron down first or its a reminder for Ron that Harry is THE Harry Potter and stuff always happens to him. To Harry fame, glory and a thousand galleons (all things promised to the winner of the tournament,) are nothing. To Ron that's everything. In the first book, the mirror of Erised show Ron wanting to be the greatest of the Weasley brothers. I think eternal fame and glory and more money than his family has ever seen would go a long way. In a way Harry trying to reject his place in the tournament is a rejection of Ron's hopes and dreams. Its not exact, its not Harry's fault but they're fourteen and we all do dumb shit we wish we could forget about at fourteen.

Before people focus on Ron leaving, can we first take a moment to remember the shit Ron goes through just for being friends with Harry. If you need a big reminder, think follow the spiders. What is Ron's greatest fear, what was his Boggart? and yet he still followed the Spiders in the second book.

Ron is brave, he just has more to live for than Harry. More to lose.

*** A lot of us, especially in the fanfic community, have grown up with HP and we have this more mature perspective that, if magic were real, we'd work our butts off for more of it.

Ron provides a kind of pacing to the story, but he becomes the scapegoat for why Harry isn't more like Hermione. We see Ron influencing Harry to be lazy and that casts him in an especially negative light.

So yeah, Ron's not a horrible person for having his own perspective, but he detracts from what Harry Potter could achieve we're Harry to be a driven individual. Instead we see Harry become more passive as a character due to the enabling of secondary characters. (Edited)

No you're won't. And you know it. You just continue doing what you always do in real life. Wasting ever second of your life or doing something your future would thank you you for it.

Sure, maybe Ron is the reason why Harry isn't more interested in magic like Hermione, not (imo).

Harry isn't your normal kid. He's abusive, neglected by his guardian, have no friends and have been bullied by his own cousin and his friend, including his own guardian.

Once he found magic is real. He's life turn 180 degree or just 90 degree. He have people who he can call his own friends, families, two bestfriends, a brother (Ron), a sister (Hermione, according to fans which I agreed as their friendship grew older), a parent or at least a mother figure (Molly) who treat Harry as her own son, and a girl to love with which he never realize he needed when he was a kid.

All of those things he never had when he was pre 11 year old.

Maybe if he had a normal childhood, I would agreed with you. He would go crazy But he's not.

How you and other came to this conclusion. I do not know.

Edit: Also you comparing a child whose life have been expose to magic since day 1 with a child whose life have been told magic is a fantasy since... day 1.

He would have come back within an hour or so if he didn't have the bad luck of being caught by Snatchers. By the time he escapes them and goes back,Harry and Hermione have already moved away the next morning.

You make it sound as if Harry deliberately picked a fight with Voldemort for no reason other than hunting terrorists.

Now, I can't fault anyone for quitting the fight if they want a safer solution, but then what the fuck are they still doing in England?

When Ron never speaks without his mouth just fucking crammed full of mashed potatoes, and favoritisms his way onto the Quidditch team, and is only interested in Harry for reflected money and fame, and constantly fights with Harry, that's bashing.

When Dumbledore is forgetful, or doesn't really care about Harry, or is perfectly willing to throw Harry to the dogs without agonizing about it and second-guessing himself countless times (remember that he ultimately didn't go through with the original plan, as he was too attached to Harry), that's bashing.

** According to this article. Whatever you call it.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/index.php?action=gringotts&st=rift]]

He's a greatest most valuable friend Harry could ever have and I doubt he realize it, Hermione is great and all but nothing compare to Ron, he help Harry run away from his abusive family and introduce him to his own family, even if it makes his parents prefer Harry over ron. He would do it again.

One of the bravest, if not the bravest character in HP, literally, fighting his fear, a fucking giant boggart which is a GIANT FUCKING spider for the sake of Hagrid innocent being sent to Azkaban even though he never care about Hagrid as much as Harry care of Hagrid. Not many can do that both in real life and in the book.

Ron Weasley is one of the most underrated character in HP, Almost all Fanfiction are horrible at writing ron's character, whether to bash him(unless it bashing for the sake of bashing, not quality writing) or praise him as one of the Golden Trio whatsoever, Ron situation is similar of Luna Lovegood who is a victim of reverse bashing, One of the most realistic character writing from JK Rowling, And it's one of my favourite character in HP, just wanna point that out? And... One of the character with sad tragedy backstory below Snape, of course.

A child that is least loved according to the movie when Ron destroy the locket, which is pretty much the true, Overshadowed by all of his brother achievement and his little sister who Molly always wanted a daughter,

And yet he turn out to be an alright kid, might have a temper here and there but always knew when he's in the wrong.

Oh, and Ron is never jealous of his best friend my Harry Potter, for his fame nor his wealth. Jealous is not the right word.

Envy? Possibly. Jealous? Never.

The only time Ron ever felt jealous for his friend is Krum with Hermione.

He was always a little angel for Harry in all books/movies, except in GoF, but he never gave the silent treatment to Harry out of jealously (or envy), he gave the silent treatment because he was hurt, he felt betrayed by Harry, or should I say he thought he was betrayed by Harry for a understandable reason with good evidence.

Even though in the end Harry doesn't know what reason was Ron upset about.

I highly recommend to read the article. It long. Yes, but it can help anyone to understand Ron character more than most fanfiction author who wrote Ron in their fanfiction.

If anyone gonna argue me about Ron character is bad bad bad jelly bad, read the article first then you can bite me.

** Ron's a bit of a 2 dimensional character. He's kinda just defined as 'Harry Potter's not so bright and not too loyal best friend.' He provides some exposition whenever Harry (and by extension the reader) doesn't know something about wizarding society, but that's about all he was really needed for in the books. His character isn't well developed in the books.

In the films, however (which I don't consider canon), Ron is a great character, simply because Rupert Grint did a far better job of playing the Character than Daniel Radcliffe managed to play his.
