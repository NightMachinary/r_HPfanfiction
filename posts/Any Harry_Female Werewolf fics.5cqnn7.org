** This is quite interesting. Also, you should flair it as a 'request'.

*** Mm. Do you see under the title where it says:

#+begin_quote
  2 COMMENTS EDIT SHARE SAVE HIDE DELETE NSFW FLAIR
#+end_quote

Select FLAIR and a dropdown menu will appear; click on the flair that you want (in this case, [Request]), and then click the Save button on the FLAIR menu.

***** I was actually aiming to address the OP. Replying to your post ensures that 'you should flair your post' and 'here's how to flair your post' are sitting right next to each other.

** God, I can't remember the name of it, but it's one of the most famous HP fanfics, it's over a million words, never finished, and involves Voldemort being Harry's mentor. Lot's of intimate ritual magic, a werewolf colony where Lupin and Sirius started out as a couple together, but then it was retconned away. Voldemort is the ruler of Magical U.K. and the order is a terrorist group. I think Harry was raised in Germany by his parents before they were killed in a mugging?

The story definitely involved brainwashing muggleborns as well. I think Hermione was adopted by the Malfoys.
