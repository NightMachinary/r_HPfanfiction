Other than Dumbledore meddling and the Bystander effect, how apathetic were people back in the 1980s to 1991 in Britain?

Surely it's a plot device that people ignored the signs of abuse within the school, but how good/bad was suburban culture in Britain back then?

If we apply real world scenarios to Harry's situation, how likely will be the Dursley's abuse be uncovered? Will it be uncovered at all?


** My opinion is that in the time period when it happened, as is unfortunately the case now, it is not likely that someone like Harry would get uplifted from his home environment, but for reasons most people won't expect.

Firstly, Harry doesn't mention the abuse he receives at the Dursleys. Do you notice? He mentions his dislike of them, and other students mentions he ‚Äúhates those muggles he lives with‚Äù. This is common for children living in abusive situations, particularly the abuse that he was experiencing. His abuse is from adults in power over him. Why mention this to other adults in power? Why detail specifics? There isn't a guarantee that they will listen, or that it will be taken seriously. What is, however, guaranteed, is trouble for Harry if the Dursley's find out he said anything. Common for kids. I was fascinated to see this so capably coded by JKR, she seems to understand children very well.

Setting the emotional and psychological abuse aside, if he mentioned living in a cupboard under the stairs to peers, this story may get lost in transmission - wouldn't get passed on to adults, or adults would find it bizarre and likely to be embellished. Living in the cupboard is the most likely thing to be immediately nabbed by social workers, it's just wildly inappropriate. There are cases of children being made to sleep out in wood sheds and that's still considered egregious enough to uplift children. But the Dursleys move him into the spare room when they fear, at the beginning of book 2, that they're being observed. Typical behaviour, too, by the way. So the most obvious sign is now no longer present.

To aggravate this, we have the fact that the Dursleys maintain an impeccable social appearance. This counts heavily against Harry's favour for an investigation, realistically. If Harry said to anyone he was kept in a cupboard under the stairs in the past - a nice seeming couple keeping a kid under stairs? Ha! It would be considered a schoolyard fancy. The dragging of Harry, threats, clipping him around the ears, threatening with a pan - all of this would require an assessment of reliability because there isn't any marks left. Nobody else will corroborate. Dudley is treated very well. It's Harry's word against the Dursleys, again.

The bars and catflap and the beginning of book 2 is probably the last thing that would have attracted attention and been tangibly provable and compelling for intervention. Once that was gone, again, Harry would have been left in the unenviable position of advocating for himself against the well-to-do looking Dursleys. Describing the things done to him emotionally would have been difficult and children in this situation don't know how much is wrong or what to disclose - the line between interpersonal conflict and actual abuse. He was generally healthy so a social worker wouldn't be happy to be involved for very long (there's just so much worse out there, honestly. Harry for example didn't experience sexual assault, that's one thing that they belligerently investigate even if no evidence) The poor state of his clothes and glasses may have attracted attention, but that would have just been a request to update his clothing and glasses.

There's lots more that I could say using a line by line textual analysis of the behaviour he experienced in the home, but that's the crux of it. It's an exhausting topic because the area is badly underfunded, subject to a lot of stereotyping that protects people like the Dursleys, and fails often because uplifting kids is highly traumatic so they avoid it where possible (and try rehabilitating the family environment). The dursleys would know exactly how to hop these hoops.

Source, I've had too much involvement in this area myself. I'm happily grown up now and no longer have to deal with the state or social workers and have learned about it now in law. I feel bad for all the recipients of child abuse in the series, and JKR shows a very interesting spectrum of how different characters cope and survive in healthy or unhealthy ways.

**** üíñ if you ever see a kid with some of the quieter signs like Harry I hope you feel more able to shuffle up and be a friend/have a convo about what's up at home.

The conversations I've had with people who opened that door - who expressed concern and kept asking questions - are convos I'll keep till I'm an old granny, honestly. I do it sometimes when I'm at uni parties üòÇ like an agony aunt that serves piles of affirmation and therapists cards. Most people like Harry don't figure it out till they're older sadly, then they're stuck with all of the fallout and none of the actual help they needed at the time. Ugh Harry, my heart breaks for him.

***** Things like this are not easy and people need to be educated about it.\\
My mother for example just realized later on that a classmate (then they were 6 to 8) of my older brother showed signs, but she just wasn't able to put it together, but later after things got out she was able to see those signs.\\
It is terrible and unfair towards the old classmate, but that was a time when people just didn't know enough about when and how to react. My mother as unsure what to do.\\
The girl rode on the same school bus as my brother and she often stopped by really early before bus got to our place to pick them up. And my mother often made her breakfast, because she said she did get any at home, but should that have been enough to call the attention of authorities to it?

****** I always always say to just be a friend, be trusted, show that they can tell you things and ask questions - not pointed questions like ‚Äúare you being abused?‚Äù But things like: how's family? How's life? How's your sleep, your appetite? Just follow up w questions like you're a friend chatting about life, because that's kind of what they need. That's probably what that girl could have used at that specific time.

Also if people are trying to be armchair sleuths, asking questions and hovering by a phone, you honestly clam shut - you don't wanna get anyone in trouble, and it feels like you're telling on them. They go on a psychological blacklist. But if someone's just asking how you are, how are things, and just follow those trains of thought - ‚Äúyou said last week your mums boyfriend is really annoying, how's he now? Worse? Omg üò© so annoying. What's he up to now?‚Äù

Just things like that. That's the most important, establishing yourself as a confidante and support person they can trust. The whole problem is that their most trusted people are being messed up. So be someone they can be honest to. That's literally most of the Battle, most of these kids have no one even asking questions. Your mum can't feel bad about not doing anything. Lots of people show those small signs of abuse/neglect but in reality are fine, they're just poor or family is stressed but ultimately best place for the kid. If you see someone seeming to not be doing well, be a friendly ear and support person. If there's no abuse, idk, you've also helped support someone probably going through a shitty time too üòä

*** Indulge me for a little because I have little to no expwrience.

From what I could understand, the reluctance of Harry sharing his experience would not have caused him to be picked up by the social workers, which is typical from people who experience abuse, i.e, if i don't share it it would be buried and I would like to forget it, and thus, not get picked up by the local government, yes?

Also, since it's just neglect and not even criminal neglect, seeing as Harry is still alive and able to walk, there wouldn't be an investigation that would occur, yes? Add to my earlier statement and this would be a no-case scenario?

Objectively standing, a psychological case analysis would be interesting in Harry's psyche.

**** Yeah, those are the broad strokes absolutely. I would say some of their behaviour certainly meets criteria for him being taken away from them if there was someone else in the house willing to describe the behaviour and who was also considered reliable. I don't know if it would meet the threshold of being criminal, but definitely enough that they would take Harry away for his own safety for at least a little bit, force some parenting courses on the dursleys etc. that's what beginning intervention looks like.

It's not that he's alive and able to walk, per se, juuuuust that there's no marks or actual evidence around the house.

And I psychologically analyse Harry for days. He's interesting because he kind of behaves like an idealised child abuse victim. Most people like him have not had the luxury of being kind, trusting others etc. We are more likely to have significant behavioural problems that require help and active management and sometimes those problems never fully go away. Most survivors of situations like Harry's aren't Snape, but tbh they have more in common with Snape than Harry. Which is, honestly, heartbreaking. It's interesting that JKR gave us those two people as two opposing responses to child abuse. I wanna be more like Harry most days.

***** I think, from a psychological stand point an extreme case of Harry showing the signs of abuse was portrayed in Brutal Harry iirc.

Also from what you're saying, and from what I absorbed from your comments, while on the off chance that Harry did speak up, it will be just a detriment to his situation considering the portrayal of the Dursleys to Harry speaking up regarding his situation in the household.

From what the books show us, Harry was constantly in survival mode, prior to book 6 in the failed attempt to be ‚Äònormal.' I guess, survival is already hard coded into Harry's subconscious prior to Hogwarts.

****** Yeah. Sadly I haven't yet found a fic that closely resembles the experiences I have had. I always come back to this, but most fics overplay the physical violence and underplay the effects.

I kind of don't like it when you have things like extreme physical violence, breaking bones, burns, extreme sexual violence. Mainly because, yeah you do see those cases in the news and they're made to be a spectacle. But mostly in survivors groups you have stuff that's way more physically subtle and nuanced BUT also leaves bad effects we have to survive with. And so when I read the extreme stuff it has things like Harry being violently abused, not realistically surviving it, and often also exhibiting a specific, stereotyped ptsd like being a lovely wee creature that quivers sometimes at the slam of a door or has the occasional outburst. I lose my interest.

Abuse victims do weird stuff. We trust people we shouldn't, because we're searching for peers. We self-sabotage. We're sometimes way too resilient and so others can't gauge how we're coping. We play out abusive situations again to feel control. It's weird but I've been thinking of writing a fem Harry survival story but tbh, I don't know if people want to read that kind of stuff. I don't know if I wanna write it too. Some days I do, some days not so much. Harry Potter is a happy place for most people yknow.

Also re: Harry not saying anything? It's sad but I wanna say in survivors groups abooout 90% of participants will say that when flags were first raised, things got really bad quick if there was any delay in investigation and they were left inside the home. Which most people are at least initially. Lots of people wonder why kids don't say anything but the strategy of not saying anything is actually rational. You're a kid. People disbelieve kids all the time.

Man, though, even raising one red flag is enough for things to go to custard straight away. Harry did what most kids do. Head down. Hate on them. Keep away where you can. Bite back when you can (love his little quips at the dursleys haha)

******* Then there is the wizarding world to think of. Harry is also famous and he hates it. Even in the 2nd book he is aware of the power of gossip over his life. If it got out that he was abused, he'd likely get equal parts disbelief, disdain, and pity. At this point Harry would actively hide his abuse. Also, I get the feeling the wizarding world doesn't see child abuse in the same light that the muggle world does.

***** It's unlikely those sorts of things would go to court in the first place. There would almost certainly be a talk about not doing that thing.

The cupboard would be a big flag, but the Dursleys would almost certainly get notice of a visit and once Harry is in the bedroom - the risk is reduced. Plus, the Durlseys could easily spin a story about Harry feeling safer in the cupboard, but having always had a bedroom.

Marge doesn't live there, so most likely they would ask for the dog not come. Although, yes, it does show 'failure to protect'.

In theory, yes, certain things could be prosecuted but in the majority of case the trauma of being separated from parents is avoided and obvs parents in jail would necessitate this. So they try to work with the parents.

I do know someone whose dad had to go to court to get their kids back after that, but it was for a FAR more severe case - with broken bones, strangers taking the kids for periods of time and being prevented from stabbing the children. And abuser got all the kids back once SS felt that parent had done enough work. SS stopped following the case - and it was never followed up because the children kept things quiet. (I also had the experience of hiding from a knife at the hand of their parent, so I am certain it's all true.)

*** Yeah, the Dursleys have broken quite a few child protection laws (most were not significantly changed between then and now, merely enforcement improved), but actually proving the abuse would be difficult because unlike in fanon, they did not beat him black and blue.

The best solution I've found to this issue is simply planting a few pounds of coke or similar drugs at Number 4 and calling the bobbies. Coincidentally, the British law has the same maximum sentence for possession of large quantities of drugs as it has for child abuse, 14 years. It also saves Harry traumatic courtroom events.

'Harry for example didn't experience sexual assault, that's one thing that they belligerently investigate even if no evidence)'

This is actually not quite true, at least in England. So, in order for Harry to be removed - there needs to be 'immediate risk of serious harm'.

Essentially, parents are almost always given the chance to rectify situations and the older you are when SS are involved the more able you are to remove yourself from the situation, such as walking to a friend's house.

I lived in the same house as the person who sexually abused me, I could just walk away. After I moved out voluntarily to live with family but visited to see my younger brother, I was told that it couldn't have been that bad if I came back. A friend reported that when staying over, they'd seen this person taking my brother into their bedroom - but this could simply have been because he didn't sleep. My brother said he was fine and didn't know why I was upset.

A few weeks prior to them getting involved, this person tried to kill me (in a manner that failed and would have looked like an accident, so no proof). This event happened after my school told me (against protocol) not expect not to be going home on the day I told them. The first social worker saw how difficult this person could be, the second believed this person over me and told me I had a nice house and the third had to top it all off by insisting that as CAMHS said I had dissociation, I must have read a book and imagined it (they told me that the person had suggested it). Anyway, CAMHS told them that it meant the opposite and that my symptoms were consistent with trauma.

The police did show up in a heart beat tbh, but no immediate risk. When I did try to report it, there wasn't enough evidence against either two people (the second lived elsewhere and had such a generic name that without this person's help they couldn't track them, allegedly). And nobody actually tried track down a child who I saw taken into a bathroom with a camera by their parent plus some other details I shan't mention here. They'd since moved away and of course this person had seen it to, but didn't back me up. Of course.

Oh, I was also told that I didn't do any chores/was difficult about them and so my goal was to help keep the peace by doing more.

So, yeah, not so much belligerent investigation going on.

And Scotland are even more chilled out with regards to reporting and what can be reported.

I agree with you over all, though - I've seen many cases that people simply wouldn't believe children are left in. Zero 'taking children for no reason' going on at all. One child was almost Hogwarts age and still had no bed, others were allowed home despite us witnessing abuse and children far more filthy than Harry. Etc, etc.

To the post OP As for whether other people would report it, well - most people worry about the backlash of getting involved or have other anxieties such a being mistaken, it being too small a sign or the child being kept out of their eye if they made a report.

**** I am so, so sorry to read that you went through that in the family home. Truly reprehensible that this was all permitted to happen to you and that a system completely failed to protect you. You were vulnerable and young and all I can see is victim shaming by the state which should have intervened. I hate that a million times over and hope you're in a safer place now and have a good support system, whether that's professionally or through found family. Everyone deserves safety and love.

In terms of the belligerent investigation, I should have spoken with more nuance and I appreciate the correction. I'm a part of support groups so really don't have an excuse for that one, so im sorry for that. Unusually, my primary physical abuser in the immediate domestic home was my mother, and people have often said about the case that if there was more sexual abuse it would not have been left to go on as long as it did (or have the outcomes it did). Of course, we know that isn't always true. Cases like your really exemplify that. For the record, CAMHS can go die in a fire. Again I hope you're well/healing well now and appreciate the correction. ‚ù§Ô∏è

***** Thanks for that. I hope you're doing well.

I've not escaped without mental health difficulties and under achievement, but in many other ways I'm the 'exception' so, yes, I am quite lucky. I am fortunate that I got a couple of years living with my grandparents who are calm and peaceable people.

I've heard lots of people who've really struggled with CAMHS - more than I've heard had good experiences. In my case, though - I can honestly say they turned my life around and went well beyond their duties to get the best for me.

Unfortunately, often when its a woman doing the sexual abuse it's not taken seriously. I often think up ways I might have been 'saved' by things going worse (if only I'd reported earlier, ey. If only one single family member backed me up.), though and I'll not deny you your rational.

Edit: no worries. I think it's just one of those things people assume will be a reason for removal. It really does come down to current risk.

****** It's a lovely day to hear that camhs stepped up to the plate for someone! And yeah I feel you on the mental health difficulties and underachievement, I don't know about you but I really struggle being an ‚Äòexception' some days because sometimes you're treated as ‚Äòinspirational' for getting out, but really, you're just incredibly tired lol.

Also you're right about women in that situation. In my situation that abuse was outside the family home and more traditional gender dynamics (older male/female child) but yeah, abuse has many faces absolutely.

*** Would you say a character such as Sirius (possible Regulus too) suffered abuse at home, simply going off from his mother's insults and threats? I recall that portraits are supposed to be an echo of a person in real life. I also wonder whether verbal abuse necessarily means other more extreme forms such as physical. Or was he simply neglected. I'm also asking because I wonder if people with abusive childhoods try to go against their parents in any way possible, and if Sirius abandoned supremacist ideologies to first and foremost distance himself from them. Thoughts?

Sorry for rambling and if I don't make sense.

**** Honestly, there's patterns in how people with abuse behave but it doesn't mean those 'types' are similar - Regulus quite possibly got in deep because he was trying to appease his parents (or it could just be bigotry). Sirius goes the other way.

Some people come out from abusive situations seeming unscathed or relatively unscathed. Others have severe PTSD from exactly the same types of scenarios. That said, the more Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and fewer protective characteristics in a child's life, the more likely negative outcomes are.

There is no perfect victim. Looking for patterns helps us identify abused kids, but anyone who thinks all victims behave that way are letting abuse slip under the carpet.

That said, Sirius does show some signs - he engages in impulsive and risk taking behaviour. Even before Askaban, there's a short story about Sirius and James and some muggle policemen. His emotional regulation is poor and he's stuck in the past.

These aren't exclusive to abused children of course.

***** I do realise that, but when talking about fictional characters, however complex they are, it's not really the same as categorising actual, real life abuse victims. However diverse the cast may be, you'll end up falling back onto some stereotypes. Thanks for raising awareness though, I guess I worded my question incorrectly, sorry for that.

I was wondering about Sirius mainly because the fandom seems to be really divisive on whether he really did have an abusive home life, or if it's just a fanon cliche insert to add unnecessary angst on top of the tragedy porn that was his life.

****** Oh, mostly I mentioned it because there are a lot of people on these forums who think Harry wasn't abused because he doesn't fit a profile.

I suppose my point (which I lost somewhere in my comment) is that fictional characters don't need to have the same mould, so it's hard to say if JKR intended him to be an abused child.

It's quite possible Sirius was well liked until his sorting in Gryffindor, but after that point it's quite likely he faced emotional abuse. His family did blow him off the family tapestry for running away - if it was just teen angst you'd expect they'd be frantic to get him home.

******* Something that's always interested me is that Sirius himself ran away; he wasn't kicked out of the house. I always wondered what was the breaking point. I can't believe that somebody - especially a fifteen year old - could run away from home just because his parents were racists, and as far as we know, never mistreated him. They're family, despite everything, I bet he still loved them deep down. Although that begs the question like you said, of how they didn't bring him home? Or maybe they did and we just don't know it?

Orion and Walburga seemed to actually hold murder in low opinion, unlike Lucius and Narcissa, since Kreacher insults Sirius by calling him 'murderer'. Prior to that Sirius displays his distaste as well, when he praises Moody for bringing people in alive. It's an interesting tidbit, where he does share some of the values his parents raised him with. I wonder what else is there? Regulus seems to be the one who breaks the mold here, he actively joined the Death Eaters at sixteen. At that age Sirius had cleanly cut off ties with his family.

Sorry for the ramble I have many thoughts about this messed up family.

** There's a few things to bear in mind here. Firstly is that while Harry is certainly neglected, he is not really physically abused, certainly not by the standards of the time (bear in mind that corporal punishment in state schools was only banned in 1986, and it wasn't until 1998 that it was banned in private schools. Even today, parents smacking their own children is banned only in Scotland).

He is not fed as well as Dudley, and the condition of his 'bedroom' is certainly grounds for concern, but neither of these things are especially visible from an outsiders perspective. There are, sadly, far too many instances of children who were starved or beaten to death, after long histories of abuse who the system either did not find, or was unable to help. Even if Harry's abuse was of the very worst kind found in fanfiction, there's no guarantee that child services would have been called, and even if they had been, they might not have been effective at helping him.

If someone had been called, it is extremely unlikely he would have been removed from the Dursleys. In all likelihood, they'd simply be subjected to occasional welfare visits, and Harry would be moved to the littlest bedroom. It's very unlikely anything else would have been done.

There was, typically, a very high burden of proof needed in order to remove a child. This would have been especially true for a suburban middle-class family like the Dursleys.

*** Ah so a no-case scenario, then? While not in the extremes shown in Fanfiction, there isn't enough to warrant intervention?

As with [[/u/bumblerina][u/bumblerina]] ‚Äòs comment, there wouldn't be an investigation because of Harry's reluctance to report and the portrayal of the Dursley's seemingly upstanding citizenship.

** Outside of the whole "sleeping into the cupboard" thing, I don't think the Dursley's treatment of Harry would even qualify as abuse by the 1980's standard, some people may raise an eyebrow if they knew everything, but we are far from calling the social workers. I mean, if we take a look at the few usual complains:

- *Harry was starved* : In PS, Chapter 7, it is said "/The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick/.". So, while the situation was not ideal, he was still far from starving and his childhood with the Dursley did not hamper his growth. Canon Harry is pretty tall, he only seem small because he is next to Ron who is taller, and he was played by Radcliff in the movies who is short.\\
  Harry may have been close to starve in GoF because of Dudley diet, but the whole family was starving so it's not specifically against Harry (and I'm pretty sure all of them cheated, just like Harry).
- *Harry was treated as a House Elf* : No he was not, Harry is rarely given any chores in canon. There are few ewamples, but they all have an explanation:\\
  In PS, Petunia asked him to watch the bacon (and only this, not cook for the whole family everydays) because she was busy for Dudley birthday, it was a one time thing, not a daily task (never cooked for them after it).\\
  In CoS, Harry is given a list a chore he has to day as a punishment after making Dudley believe he did the "forbidden thing". It's a punishment and the timing was probably right too since Petunia needed help to prepare the house for the Masons.\\
  In PoA, he does everything Aunt Marge asks him to do because he is trying to bribe his uncle to sign his Hogmead paper.\\
  The Dursley do not treat Harry as a servant, most of the time, they prefer to have him locked in his room or out the house.
- *Harry had to dumb himself to not outshine Dudley* : The only indication of Harry's grades in Primary school is this " /He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad/.", from PS, Chapter 4. It doesn't say much (we can't even know for sure if he was better than Dudley or not), but the Dursley probably never beat him for having good grades. If anything, they probably didn't care about Harry's grade as long as they had nothing to do with it (they may have been called to school if he had terrible grades, which is inacceptable for them).
- *Harry was beaten black and blue* : Well, that's the most difficult point and I'll only give my personal opinion. It is a fact that Harry got some hit during his childhood, but I never saw anything that I would consider unacceptable by the 1980's standard. Even this scene in CoS where Petunia tries to hit him with a pan seem more like "I give you a little hit with anything I have in my hand" rather the "full swing/ murder attempt" as some people describe it. It is also important to note than even Dudley got hit when the situation asked for it (his "fight" for a Hogwarts letter in PS) and that Vernon thought that being hit with a stick "forged the character". One way trip to social service in 2020, but not so strange in the 1980's.

So, even in a real world scenario, I do not think that the Dursley's abuse would be uncovered, because I'm not even sure that there were any abuse. Harry looks more like a neglected kid rather than an abused one, and he doesn't show any of the "red flags" professionnal would look for. He is not especially afraid of authority, don't recoil when touched by someone, and is even a sassy little shit. As I said before, only the "sleep in a cupboard" would really bother me (especially since the Dursleys have 2 "free" bedrooms), but it's not like anyone would know about it before investigating the house. Also, since Vernon is able to stand in the cupboard while Harry is already inside, it is not that small (may have caused problems in the later years, but a child probably could probably lie down and even move a little).

I guess Vernon putting bars to his windows would also have made the neighboors raise eyebrows in CoS, but "He is punished after completely ruining a business meal and bringing an owl inside the house, and I put these there because I'm afraid he would run away" is a perfectly reasonable excuse to give (and that sound totally true for someone who doesn't know about magic).

** Simple answer is it's really easy to hide abuse and for children to not say anything or know it's completely not normal. Also once Dumbledore tells him why to stay, he feels that option isn't the worst (vauge)

  Oneshot, Abused!Harry. Before Hedwig the owl, there was Alastair the spider. In an unforgiving household, 10-year-old Harry has no one else who cares whether he lives or dies. He'll need every ounce of vigilance if he is to survive. Warning: descriptions of physical child abuse.
