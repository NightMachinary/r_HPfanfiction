Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood have one of the more interesting friendships in the series, but the vast majority of fics I've found ship them. I'm looking for fics that explore their platonic friendship.

One of my favorite fics, that has since been taken down, was /Faith and Understanding./


** Linkffn(A Night Without Stars by Potter47) is pretty decent. The author's Ron/Luna fic is better though.

*** That was...actually pretty good. I enjoyed it very much. Luna's quirkiness and odd ways were nicely handled.
