***** What I mean is that it's the essence of his character that he lacks empathy, from as early an age as we know him (11 years old). People are free to write him how they want, but you can't write him in character and not as a psychopath.

You can write Hagrid as a house-elf if you want to, but you're changing the character to the point that they're an OC.

****** Actually, what we do know (via word of Madam Rowling) is that what really mattered to him being the kind of character that he was was the death of his mother Merope, and that had she lived he would have been a different person, which implies that whatever is wrong with him is something that could have been fixed. This implies that whatever psychopathic tendencies he displays may not be actual psychopathy, as that one comes from nature and cannot be fixed by nurture whereas his could very well have come from nurture only.

Yes, he still is not, at his core, a good person. But this does mean that character development would be possible for him.

Though, obviously, some people take what Madam Rowling said past the books' releases as something to be disregarded. Not up to me to tell anyone to accept her later words, but obviously when writing Tom Riddle as a protagonist in a crossover doing so in this instance would probably be optimal.

I don't mean to harp on this point, as I'm really not bother what people decide to change, but for anyone reading this I feel I need to point out that this is definitively untrue. Our formative experiences in our first few years of life and significant and irreversible effects on us. Just because something happened by nurture doesn't mean it can be changed by nurture.

******** As you yourself wrote, in the first few years of one's life. So one, it definitely can be fixed, there's just a time limit on it so yes had Merope lived he definitely could have been fixed (also, hello, this is what Madam Rowling said, not something that I am pulling out of my ass, you know, and while she may not be an expert on psychology this still does have the implications I wrote are there), and two, the one that refers to this particular example and the one that /actually matters/, we do not know to what extent Tom is broken so it is possible to interpret him as close to a book-definition psychopath but not one letter-for-letter and as such not as someone completely incapable of change (something that, again, the bit you quoted supports and that's not something I pulled out of nowhere).

Do remember that we are talking hypothetical scenarios about a character who is broken but we do not know to what exact extent and who, despite being labelled as a psychopath by people, does show that he does not meet all the requirements (or what people see as requirements).

Yes, I am well aware that sometimes there are changes caused by nurture that cannot be changed back, at least not easily. The point is that we do not know if the changes that Tom went through are changes of this kind or not; it is easy to assume it to be the case, but assuming them not to be would not break Tom's character and this is a post where people are talking about the challenges of writing a character like him and how to overcome them.

****** Changing Hagrid from a giant to a house-elf physically changes the character. Developing a human quality in a human character is not the same thing as changing the species of a character.

We also do not know if Voldemort is incapable of empathy. Dumbledore thinks so, but that does not make it a fact. If he was completely incapable of it he likely wouldn't be as interested in trophies, which have a specific emotional meaning, as he is.

It is not out of the realm of possibility that something could happen that could change him, or that Dumbledore doesn't know his entire history and makes incorrect assumptions. Writing it off as 'he's a psychopath' is boring.

******* Obviously, the idea that he can't show empathy is just my opinion, but I think the evidence for it is very strong.

Psychopaths actually love trophies, it's one of the defining characteristics of a criminal psychopath that they take trophies from their victims to help them relive their crimes later, like Tom did with the children at the orphanage. Empathy for human beings isn't necessary for forming attachments to objects.

Just because something is caused by nurture doesn't mean it can be changed later. Reading Tom in canon it seems like Rowling's specific intent was to write a typical psychopathic child (taking trophies, manipulating/terrifying his peers, killing a rabbit). Again, this is all my opinion and people often write characters completely OOC, but I always find it strange they don't use an OC so that the reader doesn't have to ignore that their central characteristics have been removed to get into the story.

** u/UndeadBBQ:
#+begin_quote
  It eliminates any sort of connection with other characters.
#+end_quote

I am 99.99999% sure that by clicking /any/ film on Netflix you'll find several more ways of connections between characters than love.

Self-Interest is nothing bad. The vast majority of characters, of human behavior in general, is deriving from the hope of benefiting oneself. As we are a species that relies heavily on packs to survive and thrive, self-interest is often also benefiting a group of people, however large or small. True, it does not a shining hero make. However, the Anti-Hero - an archetype motivated by his own benefit and desires - is a thing and can be done very well.

For a seventeen year old Tom Riddle in Skyrim, I can see quite a bit of interaction with people in this new world that go beyond "kill or control". He is a young wizard. The first idea would be to look for the source and application of magic in this world. The Academy is one possible place to go. He could be picked up by some random destruction mage on the streets. He could also wake the interest of a Daedric Prince (who are sometimes a rather benevolent folk), or maybe Paarthurnax.

Whoever he ends up with, Tom Riddle will inevitably try to convince them to give him their knowledge / power by the tools he knows. Seduction, Sweet-Talk, Fear. This someone needs to be steadfast in his mind, a mental colossus equal to Riddle to withstand him.

Just as an example, I could see Paarthurnax take him on. He sees Tom Riddle as he is, a rabid beast in human skin, hell bent on domination by violence. He may be reminded of his past self, or his brother Alduin. The connection could start out as a purely mentor to student one, but evolve into something more emotional once Paarthurnax can crack through the deeply scarred, troubled, cynical and at this point probably also psychopathic mind of Riddle.

Another interesting thing to do would be to think of the Dragonborn as the Archmage of the College of Winterhold and therefore the top address of Tom Riddle to learn the magic of Mundus. The Dragonborn is his equal, both in terms of magic and mentally. Tom's games don't work with him. He has seen it too much, heard all the phrases of deceit - has bested /Daedric Princes/, the literal Gods of all these manipulatory tools Tom uses. First Tom curses him as "just another Albus Dumbledore trying to control him". But the Dragonborn is of course more than that - a warrior, adventurer. He can /show/ Tom the depths of the abyss he steers towards and not just tell him of the Wolf Mother, the arrogant Dunmer Gods, of Alduin and all the other examples on Mundus of people sucked into the darkness never to return. Tom won't believe it at first, of course, but that's your part as author.

When it comes to love I think Voldemort was incapable of it, but Tom Riddle was not. Not yet, at least. He was looking for it, but was only met with those who wanted to be dominated and those who wanted to control. There was no altruistic person to be found that would show him affection just for affection's sake. I have in my mind now a little, young Kahjit sorceress trying to make it big in the College. Being a Kahjit she is faced with plenty of stigma against her, making her hang onto Tom. Tom finds her useful to find out about Skyrim, at first, but is later faced (after some shifts in his character) with the fact that he came to like her, even after her usefulness was exhausted.

Well, in any case, I think there is plenty of playing field there. Good luck writing.

** This may not apply completely to your situation, but I have an interest in writing psychopaths and have run into this problem before. Not with Tom Riddle, but an original character of mine.

My problem was that I was in this mindset, where I kept thinking of this checklist of psychopathy symptoms, and couldn't come at it from a different perspective. I based a character entirely on this checklist, and it made the character bland, because, well, she was basically just a checklist of personality traits. She was a caricature, not a real person.

What helped me was thinking of it as 'tendencies' instead of absolutes. So instead of 'she is a psychopath', I thought 'she has psychopathic tendencies'. It just helped my brain separate the psychopath from the person. Instead of packaging her personality into a box labelled as 'psychopath', I tried to change my mindset so that I was focusing on the person rather than the condition the person has. Psychopathy was an important part of her personality, but not all that she was.

I think this could kind of apply to your problem with Tom's characterisation. Stop thinking so much about his inability to love. He is still human, albeit one that cannot feel the full range of emotions that the majority have. If you're still having trouble with writing Tom, there is a book called 'Confessions of a Sociopath', written by, you guessed it, a sociopath. Well, she prefers to refer to herself as a sociopath, but in my entirely unprofessional opinion, she fits the definition of a psychopath better (however much of a definition for psychopathy there is) and has the lack of empathy, arrogance, self-centredness and love for insidious manipulation that most psychopaths seem to have. She basically tells what life is like for a sociopath/psychopath, and talks a bit about why she does random things that aren't really in her self-interest--for example, she apparently gave her brother 10,000 dollars, just because, and bought her friend a house.

I haven't finished the book--in fact, I'm not even halfway through it--so I can't tell you how helpful this book might or might not be. If anything, it is an interesting read.

I hope this was at least somewhat helpful.

** An inability to love doesn't preclude relationships with other people or complex motivations. There's plenty of room for an extreme narcissist in Skyrim, where might is right.

You can read a few Tom-centric fics. The only one I can remember where he's still in school is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment][Realignment]] and it was excellent.
