  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

*** This one is really good. It's what started me down the Fleur/Harry rabbit hole. The interactions between them are top notch. I agree that it's also abandoned, but it's so good up to that point that it's worth the time. So far, I've only found one other that I also really enjoy:

** In spite of obstinate men by quatermass is really and realistic portrayal of a relationship between them. No veela mate bond or love at first sight stuff. And its sequel really gets into their relationship. Sadly he hasn't written anything on it in a while even though hes still updating other fics

**** It can be but sometimes it's really good. Sad thing is a lot of those end up using it as a means to force a harmony pairing. Like in the price of being noble. Good story but still

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13448485/1/A-Different-Kind-of-War]] this is probably one of my favorite. Hasn't been updated in a couple of months though.

There is another one where Fleur is a romantic interest, but it's a multi pairing fic where no one girl has been set in stone and I'm not sure Fleur will end up being the winner (or one of the winners) but judging from what I have read so far she's probably still in the race in the story. I'm being careful with this fic. It's extremely well done, but if I invest too much time into it and Fleur isn't with Harry in the end I'm doing to be majorly disappointed. With all that said this is the other fic.

** Linkffn(The Stag and the Flower) was a good one for a post-DH relationship, and I believe it's still updating.
