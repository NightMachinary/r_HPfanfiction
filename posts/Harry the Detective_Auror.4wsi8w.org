I'm looking for any fics that are centered around Harry being an Auror or Detective. Being an Auror/Detective main part of the story. No slash please


** You might be interested in my fic, linkffn(The Aurors by Floreatcastellum). It is Harry-centric, but also centers on an OC and has a plot focused on suspense. It's nearly finished now.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

** You can try The Chronicles of Harry Holmes. linkffn(7487494) Basically Harry loves Sherlock Holmes so he ends up emulating the character, it's witty, interesting, and over all well done.

  What if the Dursleys gave Harry the Sherlock Holmes books when he was a child to make sure he knew that there was no such thing as magic? What if he did everything to become just like Holmes? May seem rushed, but more coming. Sequel in the making!

#+begin_quote
  It's nearly eleven years since Harry defeated Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts. Life for the youngest Head Auror ever appointed is busy and chaotic, but it's good. Not everyone in the wizarding world, however, is content; there are stirrings of unrest. A new adventure starts with the theft of a mysterious artefact from the Ministry of Magic . . .

  To avoid the unjust prosecution of his friends in the days following the end of the war, Harry Potter signed a magical contract in blood. Years later, Harry struggles with the balance of his latest Auror case involving a wizard ritualistically murdering Muggles, periodic contract renewals, and both the developing and deteriorating relationships with those closest to him.

  Hermione gets the cat, the flat, the food, and the furniture. Ron gets the family and friends. Harry gets the boot, his little book, the blame, and the shame. Ginny gets a new bloke and a haircut. New circumstances mix with old patterns, and Harry and Hermione find their friendship put to the test.
