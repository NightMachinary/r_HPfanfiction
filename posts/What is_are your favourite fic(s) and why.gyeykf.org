So, what are your favourites? I seem to be running out of good fics to read so I want to know what are your favourites.

I feel like this is written in a confusing way or something, ugh

So like, link your favourites and explain why they are your favourites if you want to

Thanks.

Oh and my top 3 is:

Linkffn(harry potter and the elemental's power) The ship is amazingly written and even the plot is great, a warning, it contains smut scenes.

Linkffn(dodging prison and stealing witches)

I'm unsure if it's still updating or not, but it's amazingly written, the idea is great and the worldbuilding is quite good too, very good

Linkffn(harry potter, squatter)

It's still updating and it's amazing, even if you don't know a single thing about greek gods you could read this, amazingly written thus far, not yet at Hogwarts age (assuming he'll go there) but yeah

Thank you and stay safe

** Linkao3(Of a Linear Circle) Series. Voldemort is handled by Adults, instead of a Teenager. Start with Part 3, that way you dont miss the subtleties in parts 1 & 2.(Also, part 3 is the funniest, but that's just me)

Linkffn(Have Chrome, Will Travel) Voldemort again dealt with by Adults, Harry's use of Magic is different.

Linkao3(The Reclamation of Black Magic) has Dorea Potter coming back from the dead. Also a Coven. Fun.

Linkao3(Face Death in the Hope) Might be very slow paced, but the characters are awesome.

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Update: May 2020 --- This story has been getting a lot of new readers lately, so I wanted to let you know that, yes, this story is currently on hiatus. As with many writers, I struggle with mental health issues, but I am working on them AND working on getting back to this story as soon as I possibly can.

** Linkffn(Victoria Potter). Basically the author is a perfectly decent writer, no bashing/cheap plot contrivances. Interesting plot thats mostly original. But the absolutely key part is that his writing shines when it comes to world building . Gives 1000% of the wonders and charm felt when you first read Harry Potter and learn about magic.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Faith and Understanding]] by Lethe Laguz

This is the chronicle of Ginny's friendship with Luna, with Ginny's musings therein.

It's funny, it's heartfelt, it's goofy, it's sweet. Ginny and Luna argue and tease and confide in one another.

This is my favorite one-shot Harry Potter fanfic ever. The closings lines are absolutely beautiful:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

  It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

** Definitely and forever "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]]" : Linkffn(8096183)

It's a blast from start to finish (sadly on hiatus, but with 314k words you have time to enjoy it nevertheless). Truly amazing writing, humor is stellar, the plot is actually very intersting and does deviate in a very natural way from canon due to the presence of our new student.

As a DnD wizard the protagonist has very interesting but also very limited spells and it's a delight to see him work his way though day to day classes and the mandatory adventures by using his limited ressources carefully. The characters are well crafted too, especially our main protagonist Milo and the few others OC's who will appear and sometimes cross pathes with the main cast.

It's overall both a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat and a story that will truly make you laugh out loud at the same time and I couldn't recommend it more strongly.

If you fear that you won't get into it because you are not at all familiar with DnD, try it anyway, you will slowly pick it up over the course of the story, you will have a different point of view at first and it will make for an excellent reason to re-read it with your new found experience on the subject after.

Please do try it and tell me what you thought of it, I would be very interested in discussing it with others.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/1/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes][something wicked this way comes]] hp/disgaea crossover. harry and co summon etna from the disgaea universe. naturally it ends up harry/etna pair as she trains him and his friends up to be a better fighting force. i quite enjoyed this one even having only played disgaea once like 15 years ago.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][the arithmancer]] a hermione focused series where she uses the power of math to do amazing feats of magic. this and the sequels are well written and have great details and character development.

"After Tony Stark outs himself as Iron Man on live television, he acquires a magical stalker in the form of a bored (female) Harry Potter, who has emerged from the Veil of Death in a world without wizards.
