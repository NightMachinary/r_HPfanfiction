Basically, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny are added to AM's five victims. AM's 'game' for Harry is inspired by Black Ink, Red Rose. Except Ron and Hermione also become Death Eaters. But I haven't come up with what Harry has to do to break himself and the others free from AM's grasp. \

â€‹

Any ideas?


** Why are Ron and Hermione death eaters

in i have no mouth and I must scream is about the end of the world why are the death eaters still even around if almost everyone is dead

*** In the game, AM puts each survivor into different games. He even makes people to torture them.
