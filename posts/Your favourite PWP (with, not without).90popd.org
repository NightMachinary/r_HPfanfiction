Stop looking at the screen like that.

Yeah, you. Don't judge me.

Whaddaya mean Harry/Dobby/Bloody Baron on the Horcrux Quest won't work out well?

Just... yeah.

** Can you be a bit more specific?

Do you prefer slash? Do you prefer post-Hogwarts characters or something set at the school? If it's set at the school we can't link it directly according to the rules of the sub.

Do you have pairings that you just won't read?

EDIT:

What I write is almost exclusively smut with plot, I just don't know if it's the kind you'd enjoy.

**** I have two stories that are currently posted, Baby Fever and The Brightest Witch. I can only link directly to Baby Fever as The Brightest Witch does have minors having sex.

I'll link you to my profile page instead:

[[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewuser.php?action=storiesby&uid=15449]]

The Brightest Witch is definitely the more plot heavy of the two, Baby Fever does have a plot but it written much more as a comedy.

I have two other stories that I'm currently working on but that aren't posted yet.

*For Every Day After*

#+begin_quote
  During her relationship with Ron, Hermione had tunnel vision. Now that it's over, she looks around and wonders how everything changed. Why is Harry just drifting through life? Why did none of their other friends try to help? Why is she the only one willing to do what he needs? After DH. EWE. Domme!Hermione/sub!Harry
#+end_quote

*Just Magic*

#+begin_quote
  When Fleur asked for Harry's help with a bit of magic that is fairly rare, Harry thought she was playing a joke on him at first. He'd never heard about sex-powered spells in school... granted, that didn't seem like something they would teach there. But Fleur had insisted that it was just magic, nothing more. Well, just sex and magic, nothing more. Nothing more...
#+end_quote

Both of these will be posted after I've gotten further into my two existing stories and have plenty of the story already completed.

I have a few other plot bunnies that I'm considering as well.

EDIT:

I have since posted *For Every Day After* as well.

***** Holyfuck.. i just started reading Brightest Witch and am eagerly awaiting more.. cool to know you're on here with the rest of us degenerates..

Here's hoping that you get to tick the Completed box unlike the only other lengthy multi chapter BDSM H/Hr story i can think of.. think it was called Serpent something or other and had Harry carry Gryffindor's sword around Hogwarts after getting with Hermione during the summer of 3rd year..

****** Sounds... interesting.

I'm glad to hear you're enjoying it so far. TBW should be updated on Fridays, Baby Fever on Mondays, and For Every Day After on Wednesdays.

The first chapter of FEDA should be released today or tomorrow I think.

***** I will not confirm nor deny whether or not I am eagerly waiting for chapter 10 of Brightest Witch.

It helps if you pretend that they're 18, tho. For /the most part/ the story is still "awkward" in the right places.

****** Ah... well... chapter 10 might actually mess pretty directly with your ability to imagine them being 18...

Since they're supposed to be basically 14 and 15 in the story, some aspects of their interactions with each other have been realistically adjusted accordingly.

I'm glad that you may or may not be enjoying the story though.

If you want something where the characters are older and that isn't as comedy focused as Baby Fever, I actually just posted the first chapter of For Every Day After a few minutes ago.

******* I haven't read Baby Fever; I stumbled upon Brightest Witch by happy accident. I'll give it and For Every Day After a look. :)

EDIT: I take that back. I /have/ read Baby Fever. I just didn't realize it was your story, haha. Waiting for that update, as well.

EDIT2: Apparently I love your writing. Would you happen to have a mailing list or a preference for where people follow your stories?

Wait, is that really a thing? Can you not link any story that isn't post-DH era if it has sex in it? Cause that's like 98% of smut stories in the HP fandom.

** If you don't mind making an account on Questionable Questing to view their NSFW boards, then you should check out Cambrian's HP stuff. It's all pretty good, if you're in to Stong-Guy-Dominates-Many-Women.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/mutually-satisfactory-arrangements-harry-potter.5798/][Mutually Satisfactory Arrangements]] is post-canon Auror Harry, [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/world-of-bitchcraft-harry-potter-warcraft.6975/][World of Bitchcraft]] is the sequel and a WoW crossover.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/applied-education-harry-potter.7045/][Applied Education]] has wizards dominating witches as a natural consequence of magical strength, and of course Harry is OP.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-stud-the-slut-harry-potter.6358/][The Stud & The Slut]] is more vanilla-ish, with it mostly being a school romance (read: porno).

Also, there's Big Al's smutty SI/Fixfic [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/unscarred-harry-potter-au-si-fix-fic.6858/][Unscarred]] which ages up the cast by making Hogwarts a magic university instead of a middle/high school. Big Al also makes [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/general-qq-cyoa-thread.1263/page-275#post-1424407][smutty CYOAs]] by the dozen, which are always a treat, and they've got their own original continuity too!
