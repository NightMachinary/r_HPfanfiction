Harry learns and masters the switching spell to the point where he can do it wordlessly and wandlessly. Maybe during 3rd year, he switched his blank permission slip with a filled out one or he switches Lockharts toupee with a puffkin. Maybe during 4th year, he switches an ingredient Pettigrew uses in the culdron, or switches voldys wand with a regular stick. Maybe during 5th year, he switches umbridges quill with a different one.


** How about a switching spell to keep himself out of the TriWiz Tournament?

  As Tri-Wizard tournament approaches, Harry Potter prepares himself. He is unwilling to dance to the whims of manipulative old men, and he's laid the groundwork for what he has to do. This year's Quiddich has already been cancelled, and with the shadow of the Tournament threatening him with peril, Harry's got a plan to slip the old manipulative bastard's leash. Crack-ish! Bash!Draco
