Hey there! I am looking for two specific fanfics I have read recently but can't seem to find them again.

One Fanfiction was about Harry being raped by Bellatrix so she could give Voldemort Harry's child but the child ended up being a girl so she gives it to Harry and he raise the child and hide the fact that he was raped until eventually revealing it.

The other Fanfiction was about Harry bei g kidnapped from his relatives (by portkey I think) by Voldemort where the latter force him to perform a ritual that will revive Lily (can't remember why but I think it had something to do with nuclear weapon) and the only way Harry can keep Lily alive is by having sex with her. Also, when he and Lily arrive at Hogwarts all the ghosts recognize Harry as being a Necromancer and announce to everyone at the feast that a new Necromancer has appeared.

Sadly, those are the most notable details that I remember about those fics but I hope it'll be enough :) Thanks!


** What's depressing is that I remember reading both of these just a few weeks ago but I have forgot the names as well. I think the second one with Lily being revived was on Ficwad if I'm correct...

*** The thing is that I, for some reason, remember both being on FF.net... The one with Bella sure was as I read it a bit over a week ago and clearly remember but I forgot it's name and tagged characters (Bella is not one of them) so it's more complicated to find it.

However, the one with Lily I am not sure... Perhaps you are right.
