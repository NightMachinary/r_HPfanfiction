"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...."

I'm pretty sure we've all read those words a million times, to varying degrees of enjoyment - only rarely does the wording of the prophecy change in a fanfic, and even rarer is the fanfic that does it /well/.

I would like your help in finding those rare gems that do a /really/ good job of changing the Prophecy.

As always, I'd prefer if there was no bashing, and no abandoned fics please.


** I can't recommend Backwards with Purpose enough. There's a very valid reason for it to change (not out of the blue and that takes awhile to fully understand) but still very good

** This wasn't a great fic at all but I just wanna put it here- someone found another meaning for 'either must die at the hand of the other'... Apparantly 'die' means 'have an orgasm' as well. Yeah.

**** While you're at it, allow me to share with you a tidbit from Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived, a non-magical AU where at one point Hermione punishes the twins for their behaviour - by infecting their computer with a virus that sets their desktop background to a photoshopped picture of naked Dolores Umbridge.

  “AAAAAAAGGGHHHHH! MY EYES!”

  George snickered, “I think you win this round, Granger.”

  “I CAN'T UNSEE IT! HELP MEEEE! SOMEBODY SHOOT ME!”

  George added, “I'm going to have to bill you for the ensuing lobotomy.”

  Hermione ruthlessly asked, “Can he afford to lose any brain matter?”

  “Nope, but it'll have to be done. Or maybe it's cheaper to remove his larynx. I'll ask at the hospital. Maybe I should've asked those berks to shoot off both my ears.”

  “AAAAAAAAGGGGHHHH!”

  Hermione firmly said, “After he apologises to Ron, and Ron tells me it was a real apology instead you boys' usual nonsense, I'll see what I can do.”

  “AAAAAAAGGGHHH! OEDIPUS KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING! NOW THEY TELL ME! AAAAAGGGHHH”

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.

** Linkffn(Yule Ball Panic) This trilogy is a really good series, one of the best stories I've read. The prophecy is changed significantly and there is another prophecy as well if I remember correctly. The story is mainly focused on H/Hr shipping but since it's a fem!Harry story, it's femmslash. The story starts in 4th year and is about 700k words total.
