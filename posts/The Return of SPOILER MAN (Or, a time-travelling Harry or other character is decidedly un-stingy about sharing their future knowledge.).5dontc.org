See title. For some reason I just want to see a fanfic where, whether or not in disguise, someone goes around and just spoils plot elements at random occasions.

With a loudspeaker. During dinner in the Great Hall.

"There's a Philosopher's Stone that grants eternal life hidden in the third-floor corridor, and Professor Quirrel wants it." "The legendary monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk, and there's this diary somewhere around that can possess you if you write in it." "Sirius Black was strangely enough never tried for his crimes. By the way, did you know there's an animagus in the Gryffindor dormitories? That isn't McGonagall?" "Approximately 14% of all defense professors in the past 25 years have actually been impersonators or frauds of some kind. In other news, the ingredients for Polyjuice Potion have gone missing from Professor Snape's office." "The dementors are still under the control of the Ministry as of this time, and can be deployed by the Minister, or his Undersecretary." "Did anyone ever fix that vanishing cabinet that Peeves broke four years ago? Last I saw it it was in the Room of Requirement on the 7th floor. For that matter, does anyone know where it goes?"


** Have you read Oh God, Not Again linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again]]) It is a "parody" but really well written and not cracky.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

*** Mm-hmm, I've read it. Wus gud.

But I'm looking for a Harry or some other character who comes back or otherwise has knowledge of the future, and doles it out as much as possible rather than being all sneaky-like and doing things themselves. This Harry, while not particularly covert...I'll have to read it again, I don't remember.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

*** Oh...I started on it, but I'm a little concerned about the treatment of Ron compared to Harry in the first chapter. I'm not a fan of Ron-bashing.

Actually, considering what went through my mind as I read said first chapter, I might file a new request...

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.
