:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's one of the only things about this fic I remember. I think maybe Harry had followers that he marked with it and when he told dumbledore about it Snape tries to convince dumbledore that his mark is just another dark mark. I think maybe Amelia bones is there too? It was definitely a dark harry fic, and I think only Snape was really suspicious about harry not being a good person. I'm fairly sure that the mark was rune based too. I think it was on their hands? I can remember that harry was asked by the headmaster how he made it, because it would be very useful for the Wizarding world. and when Snape accuses harry of marking his followers harry pretends to be offended and threatens to not tell how the mark worked. That's about all I can remember about this fic.


** I remember this too. I think it was a Harry/daphne paring if that helps

  A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him.
