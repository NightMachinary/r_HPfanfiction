My favorite all time trope is where a ridiculously overpowered main character hides the fact that he can casually wipe the floor with any opponent. Usually this happens due to the character's upbringing, wanting to remain as normal as possible, or due to the fact that he doesn't realize he's so overpowered and thinks everyone else is hiding their abilities so he should too.

A good example of what I'm talking about would be Mob Psycho 100 where the main character is easily the strongest if he uses his powers but due to his personal situation, he limits himself from using his powers unless absolutely necessary so most of his peers believe him to be a stereotypical loser.

I had this idea of how Harry accidentally did something tragic as a child using his overpowered magic and agreed with the Dursley's stance that it's better to be normal and realizes that even in Hogwarts with fellow wizards and witches that he is anything but, which is the reason for why he hides his overpowered-ness. Does anyone have a story similar to that premise? Thank you!


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/346100]] he has a rare magical abbility and is a genius who could easily get all outstandings but fears that the durselys would be mad if he did well in school and doesent want people to notice him too much

*** This premise and the whole story fit what I wanted exactly. I'm already at second year but what is his rare magical ability? He seems literally beyond ordinary besides being book smart and good with theory. Thanks for the rec!

***** The hint was canon though, and I don't exactly think being a metamorphmagus can really be considered to be all that rare and special since Harry being a parselmouth is infinitely more rare and coveted. So is he basically the same as canon Harry then in terms of power?

- Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty good fic I just thought his rare magical ability would be something along the lines of making him easily able to destroy Voldemort or something along those lines unless he can metamorph into Cthulu or something -

*** Is Harry actually strong or overpowered in this though since he all but lost to Voldemort the first time around? He also said that his magical reserves weren't that great and had little magic when he first realized he was younger than he wanted to be. Looks pretty interesting considering its length and how long it's been being published for.

**** Nah poorly written, mate. Think of it logically- the moment you come back, you figure out a way to fix things. What did Harry do? Spend time in an orphanage, re-do the years for no real reason..

***** Yeah I thought it was going to like diverge from canon post seventh year and that it's length and how long it's been written for was the author building a whole new world/story. Not a great story at all.

******* Averages out to 1 chapter every two months.

But forgetting that, it seems the writer is just trying to force canon events to happen, in a very poor way, at that. The entire point of re-starting is to nip any plots in the bud. In a year alone, the Horcruxes/bone of the father/pettigrew/etc. should have been dealt with..

That is the inherent weakness of most timetravel! fics. They read more like a series of oneshots in which future Harry faces off against his past trials and tribulations, rather than try to believably have him solve the problems before they even arise.

And, the other trap, having the 21 year old (mentally at the start of the fic) Harry try to seduce Kid-Ginny. Author finds nothing wrong with that?

Ugh. People like these give a bad name to fanfictions everywhere.

It's pretty much the exact opposite of every problem you have with this fic. Harry gets sent back in time and has 12 hours to kill Voldemort and the horcruxes.
