******* I've been well. Writing more mugglewank actually, but this time for My Hero Academia. So instead of a quirk, what if Izuku built a mecha? It's on my other profile at linkffn(Rejected Stones). I just needed a break from HP, I'd like to finish the dangling stories I left but when that will be I dont know.

  It was Mei Hatsume who told Izuku Midoriya that he could be a hero, with her help of course. Desperate to have someone believe in him, Izuku decides that to realize his dreams, he'll need to make himself into a hero with the help of this odd girl. Together, these people once rejected for not fitting the mold will find themselves becoming the foundations of hero society.

******* I've always written purely for my own entertainment. As I personally am a religious individual, when I wrote an SI story I included those elements into it. I'd rather write something I'm passionate about and do it well have have some people have a strong antipathy for it than write something tepid and get a resounding meh.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. Now complete! Sequel: Nymphadora Tonks: The Last Auror.
