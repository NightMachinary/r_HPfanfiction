** If I recall correctly, linkffn(Misplaced Moony) is along those lines, although it's just Remus. I think I enjoyed that fic, not my absolute favorite from that author, but good!

#+begin_quote
  What will happen when the Marauders find themselves transported to another time and dimension, which is scarily similar to their own? Landing in the year 1996, smack dab in the middle of a different war than the one they were fighting. Non canon. Dramione friendship. Sirius/Hermione pairing. AU from HBP and onwards.
