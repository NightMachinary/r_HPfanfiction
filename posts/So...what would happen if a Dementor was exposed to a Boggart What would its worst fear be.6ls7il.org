I doubt it'd just be a patronus; I imagine those would be infuriating like a cage locked round a delicious cake, but not particularly scary.

*** They can negotiate with humans.

That makes them automatically more intelligent than almost all animals, and means they could have the mental capabilities to fear.

** My first instinct is that the Boggart's abilities only work on humans, for some reason. So either nothing would happen or the boggart would be too scared/depressed by the dementors to change into anything.

**** Also because he is innocent, which allows him to better keep his sanity (because the Dementors can't take that) and the vision of Pettigrew in his rat form in the Prophet that gives him the motivation to act.

**** True, but... ah, canon is very unclear... the thing is, while Dementors /absorb/ good memories, they seem to prefer preying on people who are already depressed; this is stated to be the reason they are especially attracted to Harry (because he has so many bad memories, starting with his parents' death). I guess they're not so much taking happy memories for their own sake as they are trying to /induce/ despair.

Either way, the aforementioned superhappy person, while a prime feeding source, would also presumably have one hell of a Patronus.

** I always thought Patronus physically /hurt/ Dementors --- not in a way that could give them lasting harm, but causing great pain upon contact. In which case then yes, definitely a Patronus. Beyond that... I imagine it'd probably change depending on the individual. Some Dementors might have such strong rivalries with other Dementors that their Boggart would be their version of Malfoy, I guess. Maybe the more "tactician" Dementors would see their strongest ally, Voldemort, defeated. Maybe they'd see themselves in a cage.
