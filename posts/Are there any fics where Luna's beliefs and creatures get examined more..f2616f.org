In the majority of fics her belief in nargles and the Rotfang Conspiracy is seen as a funny quirk. Occasionally it turns out she's actually a seer and their just her way of seeing the future. I was just wondering if there is any fics that really go into, maybe a character talks to/confronts her about them and tries to figure out if they're real or the consequence of some quirk of magic or if they are just delusions. And if need be maybe get Luna some help. She went through something extremely traumatic and I kinda doubt Xeno would have got her the support she needed.


** Yes, yes, yes! I always thought that if she finds somebody to whom she can really trust, as much as the only person whom she really believes is her a wee crazy father, he would be able to gently explain to her that there are no Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. It could be a lovely story.

And to your two modes, I can add a third one (rather amusing as well), when Harry & co. are completely desperate from her persuasion that there are Nargles in the mistletoe and somebody adult just notices, that yes they are and Hagrid should be more careful where he picks the mistletoe from.

** ik people generally don't like the Black Queen series for how dark it is, but it does have an interesting take on seer!Luna- in that series, Luna sees emotions and waves of magic as imaginary creatures.

in some works (i'd recommend the author Colubrina for this,) they're metaphors that she uses to mess with people. there's one fic- idr the name or author, sorry- where the Quibbler is literally a satire magazine, and none of the kids realize that until later.

there's one very good fic called "It's Always the Quiet Ones" or something like that where her mother's family inspired Lovecraft's novels. she can see eldritch monstrosities and whatnot. and she casts a spell to make everyone see them too and it basically breaks everyone's mind and it's SO fun.

** In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin), Lockhart creates a investigation group to find if nargles exist or not, and why Luna sees it and nobody else.

And the group has a sensible conclusion.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
