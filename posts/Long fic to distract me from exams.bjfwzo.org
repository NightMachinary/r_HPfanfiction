Looking for a really good long fic (200k+) to distract me from impending exams. Preferably complete but recently/regularly updated is also good.

Preferablely Harry centric, and I like a good heart wrenching romance, mainly slash but well written non slash pairings are also great. Preferably not a rewrite of all the Hogwarts years with only minor changes, I've read a few too many of those recently.

Thanks guys!


** I liked linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter), it's got a pretty interesting twist on it

*** This one was a bit depressing, lol. It's like someone repeatedly killing a cat... Except it has more than 9 lives.

If I remember correctly, he didn't particularly use his reincarnations to get much stronger, so it was kind of shitty to read of him getting killed again and again.

And once Voldemort got the same power, it kind of defeated the whole premise

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** A Cadmean Victory was a really good one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory]]

​

Does a good job of not repeating every year with no real changes, focusing on a harry diverging from not just canon, but his existing friends, tired of them abandoning him constantly.

​

Moratorium [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9486886/1/Moratorium]] is another really good one, with a solid well-done story, but it unfortunately sort of repeats year 1, though after that things change drastically.
