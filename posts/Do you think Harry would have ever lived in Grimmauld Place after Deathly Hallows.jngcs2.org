In a lot of fics, Harry is living in Grimmauld place after the seventh book, though I'm pretty sure I remember something about him not liking staying Grimmauld Place in Deathly Hallowes because it reminded him of Sirius or something. What do you think?


** I think it is fifty-fifty toss: in my headcanon, he manages to understand that there were centuries of people living in the house, many beautiful and horrible stories were liven there, so whatever happened to Sirius in that house was awful, but just one more story, nothing to prevent himself and his future family to live there and supplement new nice memories to the house.

** I think you're thinking of a paragraph in HBP:

#+begin_quote
  Harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve, Grimmauld Place again if he could help it. He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave
#+end_quote

By my estimation, Dumbledore comes for him about 2 weeks after school ends. So this is said about 3 weeks after Sirius' death.

Given his behavior with Mundungus and the fact that it was he who suggested they stay there in DH, I'd say, yes, it is entirely possible he lived there after DH. At least at beginning of '19 years later.' Of course, he also could've stayed with the Weasleys, Andromeda, or at Hogwarts.

*** You don't have to be filthy rich to buy a house. People do it all the time. But even if Harry wanted pay with cash instead taking out a loan, he could sell Grimauld and use the money to buy a different house.

*** Well he is a wizard, so he can live basically anywhere, so he needn't be even remotely approaching 'rich' to get a permantent residence somewhere cheap, magic some renovations if needed and go on with his life.

*** No, he wasn't filthy rich, but he had all of the Black money and I doubt he'd made his way through his own 'mountains of gold.' He should've been pretty wealthy when all was said and done.

** He lives there in my fic, precisely because it reminds him of Sirius.

That said, I can understand why it would have been hard for him to live there in DH, since he was still actively grieving Sirius and angry at Kreacher.

** No, I don't think he would. My headcanon is that it's now the headquarters of the DA, who are now more of a political group.
