Hey guys, I had an Idea for a dark harry fic. And here is the summary. When Sirius fell through the Veil, a portion of Harry snapped. When Harry uses Crucio on Bellatrix, another portion of Harry's humanity breaks away. And finally, when Dumbledore tells Harry of his destiny, Harry turns his back on the concept of good. Watch as Harry descends into the depths of Darkness to kill his own pain.

opinions?


** eh, sounds generic enough to get a thousands reviews in two weeks

** For me one of the defining moments of Harry's strength of character was when he told Dumbledore that Sirius wouldn't want him to mope around. People die, at some point we all experience this one way or another. If your Harry can't deal with this it is more a sign of how weak and fragile he is. You can go and try, but to make this into good and believable story you need to work VERY hard on it ...

*** I think it would work. The whole concept would not be that Harry is rejecting the fact that Sirius is dead. He would want the PAIN to stop. Sirius is the first death that Harry faces, and in my mind, that is his most intense moment. And while I agree that he needs to be able to eventually work through it, my Harry would hate that people feel pain. He would attempt to numb himself, and others in his quest to feel less hollow inside. That would be where he fell into darkness. Harry never really felt love, and when he did he had it ripped from him by a psycho bitch. (sorry Bella) So I want a harry that would react as if he lost the one thing he always wanted, followed by being told that his whole existence is simply to kill a man who wants him dead.

**** Don't forget Cedric. It affected him tremendously. I didn't say it won't work - just that it will need lot of effort to make this into believable and a good story. I wish you luck and make sure to post a link when you done :P
