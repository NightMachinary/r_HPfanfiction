So here's what I've been thinking: the Dursleys are /obsessed/ with appearing 'normal' to, ironically, an abnormal degree. Harry's been shown to have no warm feelings towards that family so he tries to differentiate himself from them as best he can.

What I'm saying is - Gimme that *Punk Rock Harry Potter!*

I mean, it would make sense, wouldn't it? Britain is kind of seen as the home of the Punk movement and Harry is well known for being a snarky, defiant little shit.

Imagine him getting to Hogwarts and his first self-appointed mission there is to start some kind of Wizarding Counterculture. What would that even look like?

Just to be clear, this isn't Harry or whomever else trying to "enlighten" the wizards and witches. This is Harry and Co. (whomever they may be) saying "Fuck you and everything you stand for"!

Justifications for such a thing are depressingly easy to find: open bigots like Draco Malfoy whose family is rich and politically influential; a Headmaster who sees no problem with having a corridor of "most painful death" in a school full of eleven-year-olds; detentions in the "Forbidden Forset; Severus Snape in general... And that doesn't even touch on the cesspit that is the Ministry of Magic!

What do you think? Would it be fun to see a Harry Potter that's deliberately trying to set the Wizarding World on fire while radicalizing his classmates?


** This reminds me of the fic 'runic animagus'

But for real, torn up robes instead of torn up jeans.

** If I was to imagine Harry being far from normal, it would look like Elton John at his peak : crazy costumes and performances without a care for the norm.

** So a Harry that's dressed like, and acting like, a miniature Dumbledore?

*** Dumbledore's a brilliant eccentric. Harry acting dotty like Dumbledore wouldn't work. And Dumbledore's outfits are flashy, but not outrageous - Fudge wears lime green, Umbridge, pink, and Mrs Longbottom wears a stuffed vulture. Those things aren't small.

Actually, it'd probably be pretty hard to wear clothes seen as rebellious.

*** So if he tries to become normal in the magical world, he goes full non-magical and in the non-magical go full Dumbledore?

** Um, not exactly what you're looking for, but they end up in the 90s punk/grunge (I don't remember which - it might be both tbh) scene in Rise Above: linkao3(7833937)

  For once, Harry has taken advantage of his enormous wealth and used it to talk to a solicitor. He finds out a few things--- namely, the fact that his participation in the Triwizard Tournament has rendered him an emancipated minor and the last Lord of the Potters. Being the Lord of the Potters means a lot of things, but most importantly, it means Harry can get the hell outta dodge, and his friends can come along, too.Thus begins the new life of the Golden Trio. They're in America, they're in California, they're in Berkeley. Let the good times roll.
