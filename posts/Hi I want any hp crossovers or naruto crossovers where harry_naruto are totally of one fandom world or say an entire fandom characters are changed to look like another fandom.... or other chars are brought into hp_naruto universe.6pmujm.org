Ok that didn't come out properly - 1. Harry/naruto must be from the another fandom totally the personality must be similar but born in another universe example : The Black Prince(hp/GoT) or 2. The total hp/naruto universe must be modified to look like another fandom or 3. Other fandom chars must be brought into hp/naruto universe but born in hp/naruto universe
