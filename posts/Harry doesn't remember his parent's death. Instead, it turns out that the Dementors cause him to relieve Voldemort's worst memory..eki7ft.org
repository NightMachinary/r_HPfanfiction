*** Which might be interesting, if Harry has another close Dementor encounter and only then realizes that the memory is from Voldemort's point of view, then it hints at him being a Horcrux. Him realizing that before Dumbledore dies could change a lot of how the entire Horcrux mission would be.

***** If I'm being honest, I'm OK with the idea of the goblins having a fairly decent amount of knowledge in the realm of Horcrux destruction (what with their work in Egypt, and the Pharaohs known obsession with living forever); but if I were to ever write a fic where Harry goes to them to get the soul fragment in his scar removed, I would make it cost him a metaphorical arm and a leg, and literally the majority of the gold in his vault, along with some other unspecified, but quite possibly horribly unfair things.

****** I agree... it does make sense, but it's still funny because it's pretty overused. And not used well, at that.

It would be cool to delve into the substance of ancient egyptian history... or even ancient greek history, considering Herpo the Foul was credited with creating not only the first Horcrux, but also the first basilisk. But alas, this would require someone far more interesting than Binns.

****** Eh, I see the Goblins having treaties for stuff like that with at least the Egyptian magical government. Where they are required to do it, for a reasonable fee. Maybe for also agreeing to work for them for a few years since he is a parselmouth. Which I think should be a permanent ability.

You can have Bill get into serious trouble with the Goblins for telling that information. Until Bill tells them about the Malfoys and Lestranges. Then he becomes their favorite curse breaker.

I can see the Goblins willingly going to war for that. They get a war, lots of gold, and force the ministry to revisit some treaties. And potential profit by having a parselmourh work for them for some time.

****** Which makes sense when you look at it from a mythological/historical context, too - in most of these stories, a curse as bad as being a Horcrux is usually cast by some deity, higher power or somesuch, and requires you to undergo journeys and adventures and trials and usually still ends in a bitter ending with a sacrifice of either the life of another, or part of yourself.

Within the context of HP magic, you could say that the Horcrux wasn't so much just on top of his own soul, but entangled there and slowly reaching deeper and deeper as it learns to slowly circumvent Lily's protection. it's slightly damaged by the Basilisk in his second year, but also strengthened by Harry's proximity and interaction with the Diary, and then it gets a massive boost when Voldemort Prime manages to stop Lily's protection from hurting him, and starts sending him targeted visions. Then the team start carrying around another Horcrux, the locket, which again strengthens the one in Harry's scar, and it digs deeper and deeper.

And then it's violently torn out, ripping apart Harry's soul in the process when the barbs and hooks it's got in his soul are removed by the Killing Curse.

**** Well, coming to Voldy's capacity to love, he was never shown to be cruel to snakes (until he was disembodied in Halloween, 1981 after which he possessed snakes, birds, squirrels and Quirrell) and valued one of them so much that he literally put a piece of his soul in them. I am sure that Dumbledore's conclusion about Voldemort's ability to love came from observing his interaction with fellow humans not snakes.

***** HPMOR has its flaws, but anyone who thinks it is bad enough to be the fanfiction-that-must-not-be-named is severely overestimating the quality of fanfiction as a whole. Not to say your impression is wrong - I enjoy it, but a hell of a lot of other people don't. It's just not /that/ bad. That having been said, if you want the same twist without all of the baggage, /Seventh Horcrux/ is basically HPMOR minus the drama.

******* More fun? Absolutely. Better written? Maybe - the beginning of HPMOR has some serious flaws, and Yudkowsky took too much of his essay writing with him when he started fanfiction. Seventh Horcrux, on the other hand, is hindered by its devotion to comedy, and relies a lot on your knowledge of canon in order for certain scenes to make sense. At its best, it is really good, but at its worst it reads like bad /Naruto/ fanfiction. In terms of plot, I think HPMOR is better. HPMOR really drags out in the middle, but Yudkowsky is juggling a lot of plot threads, /most/ of which resolve in a clever and satisfying way in the end. The only place where I feel he really dropped the ball is with Dumbledore acting in arbitrary ways according to prophecy. It explained why certain things happened in-universe, but you could tell it was just a hasty patch over the few plot holes that remained.

Still, Seventh Horcrux succeeded where Yudkowsky failed, in that it doesn't sound obnoxious or opinionated. If that decides whether or not a work is readable for you, there's no changing it. A book is only worth what it can give you.

******** For me, MOR really stutters along because of Less Wrong's determination to have Harry scrutinise the minutia of the Wizarding World in absurd amounts of detail. I understand that that's the point, but on a similar note, the sheer absurdity is the whole point of Seventh Horcrux. The writing is stylistically designed to mirror the viewpoints that Harry has, which are oftentimes insane. Seventh Horcrux is one of the best stories on the entire site, in my opinion. It accomplishes what MOR tries to in a fraction of the content (a radically different Harry) and it is a lot more fun because it doesn't read like treacle.

Also, anybody who reads FanFiction WITHOUT understanding the canon does so at their own risk. Authors have no obligation to spoon-feed readers.

If we are reliving Voldemort's worst memory, we would have heard 1. James saying Lily take Harry and go. 2. Voldemort killing James 3. Voldemort killing Lily.

From Harry's point of view, there's no memory of Voldemort killing James because at that moment, they were in the other room.

***** If I was to continue playing devils advocate I'd say ; Dementors dont strip a memory completely of everything non negative. You still have basic context, things you feel neutral about (like say walls, or the floor). Killing james would theoretically be actively joyful, and killing Lily could be explained away by saying he felt mildly irritated at having wasted the time to speak with her.

I dont think this theory makes sense when looked at too closely tbh. I agree with the guy I first replied to when he said it's not likely Voldemort's memory.
