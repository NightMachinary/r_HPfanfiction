Minerva McGonagall's Magic Armor Course.

For the next serious of lessons, McGonagall was going to teach the students how to enchant clothing and use magical Armor . Hagrid had volunteered to demonstrate some of the clothing and the day before the lesson he went over to McGonagall's office to do a test run of the clothing.

"Alright then, Hagrid, why don't you take off your shirt so I can see how you will look."

Hagrid had no objection to this. He knew he was in good shape from wrestling Buckbeak. In fact, he wouldn't mind showing off his muscles to Miss McGonagall. She noticed He had quite the barrel chest, thick biceps, and even a six pack ripple.

"Okay," she said, somewhat breathlessly, "You can drop your pants now so that I can get some measurements to create the armor." That he wasn't expecting. Hagrid's eyes widened in surprise. "Right here? Now?"

"Well, sure; I need to take some measurements so that the magical garments will provide optimal fit." She smiled at his naivety. "If they don't fit, they won't work as intended!"

Hagrid didn't seem to appreciate her point. He was no professor, and it seemed pretty strange to be dropping his slacks in Miss McGonagall's office, but, then again, if he can't do this he certainly couldn't do the demonstration. "Well, ok, if you say so Miss McGonagall." Miss McGonagall smiled in appreciation. "Now, that's a good boy, Hagrid."

Hagrid undid his belt, his slacks, and unzipped his fly. He glanced at her office door, wondering if it was locked.

Miss McGonagall could see his concern. "Oh, yes, sorry, Hagrid ." She got up and went to the door to lock it. "I should've done this when you first came in." She was glad that Hagrid noticed the door. It probably would not have been good if another professor or, even worse, a member of the administration, walked in on her with a male Hagrid's pants down at his ankles.

As she turned back to Hagrid , she could see that he was ready. His black slacks were at his ankles.

Miss McGonagall had to stifle a smile. He was wearing very worn out grey boxers. Some of the fabric in the rear was wearing thin and there was even quite a tear beneath the elastic hem.

"I'm sorry I'm not wearing my best pair, Miss McGonagall," Hagrid self-consciously apologized. If he had known that she would be asking him to take off his pants he certainly would have chosen a better pair.

Miss McGonagall resumed her seat in front of him. Her eyes were now at the same level of his crotch. "Hagrid , no need to be apologetic. In fact, one perk of this job is that you will get quite a set of new garments." She reached into her desk to get a tape measure.

"Really?"

"Oh yes, certainly" she replied, as she carefully measured his waist. "None of the garments that you will be wearing will be off the shelf. We will special order these to fit you as precisely as possible. So, once it's over, they won't really be of any use to anyone but yourself. You will be able to take all of them home."

He hadn't realized that. "Cool."

It was a little odd though when she wrapped the tape around the center of his butt, just above his crotch. She apparently had to measure him from all angles. She then moved to his thighs. 'Whoa!' he thought, as he felt the back of Miss McGonagall's hand pressing against his testicles.

Miss McGonagall was herself rather startled. She did need to take a good measure of the size of his upper thighs and was surprised at his inordinately large thigh muscles, proportionately larger than his waist. If she hadn't gotten this measurement it was quite likely that his briefs and even the boxers would be too tight in the leg. She wondered if his genitalia were proportionally as large.

It had been quite a long time since she had felt a man there, seen a man there. Well, actually, that was not counting Snape (see Chapter 12), but Snape was hardly a man.

She purposely let the back of her hand brush against his loose hanging testicles as she carefully measured his thighs. Her face flushed at the realization of what she was thinking.

She knew that she shouldn't have such thoughts. Hagrid was, after all, much younger than herself, and, besides, a gamekeeper. However, it had been so long for her, and, ever since her episode with Snape, she was beginning to find certain thoughts entering her head, thoughts that she had not had for quite some time.

Hagrid soon got over his shock. In fact, there was something really quite appealing about the pretty Miss McGonagall feeling around his shorts.

"Um, Hagrid ," Miss McGonagall spoke softly, a bit of nervous apprehension in her voice. "I will need to, um, get a good feel, I mean, measurement, of your, um, genitalia."

"You want to measure my penis?" On the one hand, that sounded pretty good. That was pretty much close to what he was just thinking about. However, like any guy, the thought of being measured was arousing in more than one way; it aroused quite a bit of apprehension. Blood was flowing to his face, as well as his penis. What if she was disappointed?

"No, no, Hagrid ," she corrected herself. "I won't actually measure your, um, your penis." She blushed at actually saying it, not quite sure if she was getting red out of embarrassment or excitement. She was beginning to see some of the perks she could herself get from this exercise. "I just need to get a feel of the general size." 'Feel' was a rather awkward word at this point, but that is what she needed to do, at least figuratively. "We might need to make some adjustments in the cup of some of your briefs." She looked up at him. Her pretty round eyes looking so appealing, her red lips expressed an endearing smile. "You wouldn't want us to make them too small for you now, would you?"

"No, ma'am, yea, okay." He felt a bit silly, even childish, to be pulling down his boxers like this, right in front of a professor. He slipped his hands into the elastic waistband and quickly pulled them down.

Miss McGonagall's eyes were right at the level of Hagrid's crotch, and they widened in surprise and delight at what was now presented for her viewing pleasure just inches away. He was indeed a very large man. His testicles were as large as she had ever seen before; no, frankly, the largest she had seen. They hung down quite far, and seemed more appropriate for some large beast than for a man. And, his penis; well, it was really very thick and hung down over his balls, even curving out a bit, like a well packed sausage with a tasty red head. She placed her right hand to her throat and self-consciously coughed. She even licked her lips, but, she told herself, only because she was feeling a bit nervous, her mouth getting dry. "My goodness, Hagrid , you are quite a big man."

Hagrid breathed a deep sigh of relief. "You really like them, Miss McGonagall?" 'Doh!' he thought as soon as the words escaped his lips. It seemed like the right thing to say at the time, but as soon as he had said it, it seemed like a terribly wrong thing to say.

Miss McGonagall though did indeed like them, but she offered a more professional basis for their appeal. "Well, uh, yes, Hagrid, their size will actually be advantageous. A man your size well help provide apparel definition."

She couldn't help herself. She removed her hand from her throat and reached out to grasp the entire package within the palm of her hand.

Hagrid gasped.
