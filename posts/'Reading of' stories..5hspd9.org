Can anyone recommend some good stories where the Characters are reading the actual books or perhaps even another fanfiction? These types of story are currently my flavour of the month, if there's already been a post about this please link me to it.


** Most of them have been deleted in a great purge few years ago. But there is one that's actually pretty nice: /Strawberry Fields/, linkffn(4940094)

As for /The Trio and Ginny Read Fanfiction/, linkffn(3679134), it's hilarious.

  A hypothetical AU in which a most unlikely person removes a baby Harry from Privet Drive and leaves him with the Grangers, along with seven popular children's books. HarryGinny.

  One fine day at the Burrow, Harry and Ginny relaxing on the couch, and Hermione is reading something on her laptop. 'Hermione, what are you reading,' Ron asks. 'Oh, just a bit of fanfiction...' she says lightly. Therein lies the tale. DH spoilers.

**** No, sorry. I think most writers get fed up of typing out the books by then and the few that don't get deleted by monitors. If I find any and I remember then I'll pass them on to you.
