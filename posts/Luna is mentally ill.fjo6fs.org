** There's an unfinished story called “Harry Potter and the Magic of Perspective” where a subplot is that all the women in her family w/blue eyes eventually go insane because they see the dead and hear voices.\\

**** It needn't be Schizophrenia. She grew up with only a conspiracy theorist father after having lost her mother in a highly traumatic manner. One theory I have is that she's probably on the autism spectrum already, and her circumstances make holding onto her father's delusions a likely coping mechanism.
