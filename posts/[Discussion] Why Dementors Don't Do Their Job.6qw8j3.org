I have just been hit by a bit of Fridge Brilliance (as TVtropes calls it) concerning the Dementors. In canon, the Demento's Kiss sentence is only given out by the Ministry as the specific penalty for those who /escape Azkaban/ (fanfiction tends to occasionally forget this). Now, we also know that (for heavily debated reasons) Dementors /enjoy/ eating souls. So what if the reason they keep doing a crappy job of keeping the prisoners in is that they secret hope they'll be caught again and sentenced to the Kiss, because this is the only legal way they can get souls?


** Union related issues. Dementors are terribly underpaid and their displeasure shows

** - Sirius Black was feared and respected for being *the first* to break out on his own.

- The Dementors may have already been under Voldemort's command, or at least influence. Explanation 1 for the mass breakouts.

- Voldemort is an extremely capable wizard who has simply fought the Dementors off. Explanation 2 for the mass breakout.

So I'd say that if your theory is sound, its a relatively new development.

*** Certainly. (Crouch Jr.'s escape, which is prior to Sirius's, does strike me as an example of Dementors slacking off, though. Since they absorb memories, I find it unlikely they didn't see the difference between the true and fake Barty.)

I'm mostly on board with Explanation 1, usually; this theory, however, is that the Dementors, the crafty devils, were playing a double game: if Voldemort won, they were free from Azkaban and could scour the world, Kissing at will; but if Voldemort was defeated, all the escaped Death Eaters would be brought back to be Kissed, making this is a winning situation either way. Of course, accounting for Dementors not being very clever, they didn't count on the fact that once the Ministry was victorious, it would no longer employ them for having temporarily served the Dark Lord.

**** I look at Dementors as intelligent sharks, essentially.

Imagine knowing that a 19' shark could understand you. Imagine meeting up with one (or many), and attempting to strike a deal with them. What on earth could you offer them?

I think the only way you could keep these beasts in line is to threaten them with giant nets, and harpoon guns. Force them to stay in restricted waters where they are /allowed/ to feed at your pleasure.

So here comes some guy who's like "hey boys, just letting you know, I'm taking over the government soon and if you join me, you can roam free and unchecked again. Just don't attack me or my dudes, cool?"

That's my interpretation of it anyway.

***** Close to mine, though I like to think it wouldn't be impossible to redeem the Dementors. All of this was merely an additionnal theory.

** It was said most of Voldemort's gang couldn't cast the patronus. So I think if someone managed to turn those dementors again, Death Eaters would be all easily slaughtered.

*** I really believe there are better more dark ways of capturing and controlling Dementors.
