WARNING THIS IS MORE OF A RANT BUT THERE WASNT ANY RANT FLAIR SO ITS UNDER DISCUSSION. also since i cant remember only some exmaples and my feelings have been given.

Harry Potter has been represented as a genius who had to hide from his uncle and aunt or get hit.

this is a common trope i have seen in many fanfics and seems off too me

Harry seems more like an average student. mainly c's and b's with 1 or too A's (edit: should clarify i know how wizard marks are taken just comparing it to the school system i know best) and more of a practicle person. this was probably intentional by Rowling to make a charachter the audience could relate

another thing ive seen is , this applies to fanfic as a whole, but reading books can only take you so far. sure you know all these facts but knowing is good and all but applying is alsp important. take potions. you can know and make any potion that you have the recipe for, but if you want to make a new potion or improve you have too know how the reactions work together too form something. reading about knowledge is important but just reading wont take you any where.


** It's a common trope for all HP fan fic protagonists and if it's not Dumbledore, Riddle, Grindelwald, and Flamel it's off.

But also average student =/= average intelligence. We are told at least twice the fear of death gets in Harry's way and HBP and DH have quite a few moments of Harry /understanding/ magic.

Lastly, it's fan fiction centered around an almost shallow reader insert. You don't have to read it.

** I like authors who take the time and focus his intelligence more on his friendship base, which happens a lot in fics where he's sorted into another house. I prefer these because it's more realistic, when he develops a different friend group suddenly he doesn't have Hermione giving him all the answers and Ron distracting him, he's forced to actually apply himself and work hard, as a result of that he usually becomes above average.

Harry got mostly B's in his real subjects on his OWLs.

Harry's OWLs

Astronomy: A

Care of Magical Creatures: E

Charms: E

Defense Against the Dark Arts: O

Divination: P

Herbology: E

History of Magic: D

Potions: E

Transfiguration: E

History of Magic and Divination are pointless and don't really matter, and his Astronomy exam got interrupted by the attack on Hagrid and McGonagall during the exam. He was pretty preoccupied with the DA, his problems with Umbridge, his visions from Voldemort, etc, that year, so it's reasonable to assume he could have gotten mostly O's if he applied himself to academics more.

*** History of Magic is not pointless. Also, since it's not a magical exam, it's the only one for which we get an actual insight into its subject matter, and it seems that Hermione's notes were quite detailed and he absorbed them well. It's just that the exam got interrupted by the vision, he probably would have managed an E or A there.
