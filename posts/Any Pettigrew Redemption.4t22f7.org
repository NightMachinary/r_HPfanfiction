I'm looking for stories where Peter Pettigrew did everything in canon- was the secret keeper and betrayed the Potters to Voldemort- but then regrets it, or maybe has to work with Harry, Sirius, or Lupin in some way, or any stories where those three have to get past their feelings of wanting to kill him, for whatever reason.


** linkffn(Time is the Fire by Oddment Tweak). Very well done.

  What would you do if the only way to save the person you loved was to sacrifice everything else that you held dear? DH-Epilogue compliant, sort of. Some HP/GW and RW/Hr, but ultimately, epically, HP/Hr.

** Well, it's part of the Dangerverse /well/ towards the end, but you'd have to read a lot to get there. Several books full of stories.

Link to first story of that lot: linkffn(Living with Danger by whydoyouneedtoknow)

If I remember right there is slso some Peter-redemption in the "Truths" universe by Neurotica. But again it takes some time to get there, snd I don't think it was complete redemption.

Link to the first one of that series: linkffn(Truths by Neutotica).

I am now also curious if there are any stories that make his redemption a central part.

** I remember reading a fic nearly a year ago that was basically an Heirs of Merlins thing and Pettigrew betrayed Voldemort in it. He gave some nice stuff to Harry and was brutally murdered by Voldy soon after.
