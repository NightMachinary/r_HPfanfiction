:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm tying to find an old fic where Harry and Hermione were together while they were on the run, Hermione fell pregnant, Harry left her and she ended up marrying Draco.

The other plot points I can remember were:

- when Hermione told him she was pregnant he said he didn't want it, was leaving her to resume things with Ginny and gave her money for an abortion, but she kept the baby

- Harry and Ginny had their canon 3 kids.

- hermione married Draco and they had kids as well.

- The potters went on holiday to France (?) where James met and liked his secret sister but they didn't hook up beyond a kiss and were fully grossed out when they realised they were related

- I think Ginny maybe lied to everyone about hermione? Or maybe I'm confusing two different fics but I seem to remember there being a big showdown at the end where her lies came out and everyone tried to fix the past but hermione told them where to go.

It's was also definitely posted on ff.net when I read it, but it may have been taken down from there and reposted somewhere else

Any help including a possible author who writes stories like this would be appreciated, since google and trawling through my old favourites hasn't turned up anything.


** I don't know if it's the one you're looking for, because I didn't like it and never finished it, but Harry runs off after having sex with Hermione in linkffn(Missing Harry by HPFANGIB).
