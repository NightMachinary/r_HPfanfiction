Hello there.

I have never read a crossover fan fiction before. I have always been the guy who was uptight about lore and canon.

However, I have decided to broaden my horizons and take the plunge.

So can you recommend me some good HP crossovers? Ones that are complete and preferably with no bashing.

Cheers.


** Linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal by DisobedienceWriter)

HP/GOT. Harry pubstomps Westeros, still worth reading as what he does with magic is unique.

Linkffn(The Katarn Side by Darth Marrs) A crackish sort of fic. HP/SW. Rather humorous at times. Kyle Katarn is an enjoyable character and as always Darth Marrs has some truly unique ideas.

** Needing to be complete narrows down the field considerably, and misses out on a lot of excellent crossovers. Like, none of the good Star Wars crossovers are complete, but some of them are still worth reading.

**** I couldn't get into this one when I tried reading it previously. The setting just didn't feel believable for me. And while a lot of that is the fairly out there premise, there are other stories with similarly ridiculous premises that don't trigger my suspension of disbelief limit as much, and the ridiculousness of the premises feels more natural. To each his own though. Maybe I'll give it another shot at some point.

** I did a post on one of my favorite Sherlock and Harry Potter crossover fic awhile ago: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7lih75/recommendation_sherlock_holmes_and_the_adventure/][HERE]]

However, I'll just quote myself so it's easier.

#+begin_quote
  Definitely read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12447494/1/Sherlock-Holmes-and-the-Adventure-of-the-Seventh-Safeguard][Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard]] by Charlotte Ann Kent if you're into well written mystery type of stories with a magical twist.

  Basically, BBC Sherlock Holmes and John Watson (both are completely muggle) helped the trio find the horcruxes from the Deathly Hallows in a Conan Doyle detective style story. I don't want to spoil much, but there are other muggle ‘aquatints' that help as well. (Plus, the author somehow incorporated helicopters... as amusing as it sounds.)

  Don't let the first person POV style derail you from reading the story. This is one of the rare stories that was actually written like an art form. When I say it's like a Conan Doyle book, I really meant it. The suspense and mystery is all there from John's relatable, yet insightful, perspective.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][/The Power He Knows Not/]] by Steelbadger is a pretty good HP/Lord of the Rings crossover. The same author has an even /better/ HP/LotR work in progress, but updates are sadly rather infrequent these days.

Most of the best HP/Star Wars fics are still incomplete, but I think that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11576387/1/The-Katarn-Side][/The Katarn Side/]] by Darth Marrs is probably the best completed one out there.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.
