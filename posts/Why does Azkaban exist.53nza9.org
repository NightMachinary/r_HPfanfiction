I've never understood why it exists. It seems like something from an Orwellian nightmare world. I mean with all the muggleborns you'd think they would see it as vile or something. If the wizards don't already. I'd love a fanfic with it being less hell on earth and more a actual prison with at least an attempt at rehabilitation.


** Rowling has said that after DH the Dementors were removed from Azkaban - they were a sign of the corruption of the Ministry. I assume then Azkaban became more like a normal prison, or at least that's how I wrote it in my fic. Rowling said that Aurors guarded it from thereon, but I thought that seemed like a waste of resources so I had regular guards and then a rotation of one or two supervising Aurors.

  Under Kingsley Shacklebolt, Azkaban was purged of Dementors. While it remains in use as a prison, the guards are now Aurors, who are regularly rotated from the mainland. There has been no breakout since this new system was introduced.

*** Wait ... didn't she say at one time that there's something worse than the dementors at Azkaban and that their presence was required there due to that?

I mean, I may be wrong which is why I'm asking now, but I'd thought that was the case.

Real-world prisons run the full gamut, from motel-like accommodations to true hells-on-earth.

Azkaban exists for the same reason that real-world prisons can become terrible. Most people who have the influence to improve them either don't encounter them or have the resources to get put in the good places. In most of the U.S., if you get convicted of a felony you lose your right to /vote/. And most people aren't terribly open to things like "Hi, I'd like to talk about improving conditions for the convict who <insert crime here>."

** JK Rowling appears to have a retributive theory of punishment. If you transgressed, you deserve to suffer. It's not about reparations; it's not about satisfying the victims; and the lack of advertisements about the existence of Azkaban mean it's not so much about deterrence. Rather, the appropriate response to people misbehaving badly enough is to make them suffer, and that's just a basic thing about the world. The world of Harry Potter reflects her belief.

She also seems to be of the opinion that your unalterable soul determines your fate. Tom Riddle had an evil soul, tortured animals and other kids as a child, born under love potions, from an evil family...evil from the start. Pettigrew was a rat by nature, and he ratted out his friends. Ran off to find Voldemort at the first sign of trouble rather than making a new life in Australia. So if you transgressed, it is a sign that you are evil to the core and rehabilitation is pointless.

That's why she couldn't use memory charms to replace evil people with productive members of society.

Unbreakable Vows could work, but they're risky. They constrain behavior, but they don't change a person's will. You need very broadly worded vows to have an effect, but that comes with an increased risk of accidental death. And clever people will still find a way to work around them.

Personally, I would prefer monetary reparations as the punishment of first recourse, followed by vows, followed by memory charms if they could be made workable, with capital punishment as the last resort. Capital punishment would not be positioned as a deterrent; rather, it's a recognition that you are too dangerous for us to allow in society. It's faster and cheaper and less risky than prison.

*** I forget which fic I read this in but it was the best idea for a prison I've read about. The AGE LINE. You know the prisoners age and their sentence, add them together and set the line. Done deal.

**** That works as a prison (or at least, it's an interesting idea and a fic doesn't even have to sacrifice canon compatibility to get it to work), but it results in an unpleasant prison. You stick people in a cell for some number of years and hope they emerge more compliant with the law than before.

It's not unrealistic, just depressing.

** My headcanon is that azkaban is the treaty between the humans and the demons. A war was fought and part of the treaty was for us to send them our most dangerous to feed on or the war could continue. In my mind there are many azkabans worldwide, each hosting dementors that 'feed' on the souls of the damned and those souls are then sent to a hell dimension. But every time an innocent like Black is imprisoned, it edges us closer and closer to our violating the treaty and soon the hellminions will wage war on us again, they only need wait....
