** linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow) has a Harry that /applies/ himself due to the premise that Ginny dies in the Chamber of Secrets. It updates +slowly+ glacially, but it's one of my favorite fics, so I'd certainly recommend checking it out.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** For no main pairing (as far as i know): Linkffn(Anarkia) Linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) Hp/Lotr crossover

I would also recommend Linkffn(Lightning Dragon's Roar) Crosses over with a bunch of stuff btw This fic does have a pairing (harry/daphne) but as far as I've read it plays a very insignificant role. The vast majority of what I read has absolutely no romantic feel to it.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** linkffn(8879660) is pretty good and quite an original take, since it places Harry somewhere in the Second Age of Arda, I believe. The one tragedy is that it hasn't been updated for a while. The author has multiple HP crossovers actually (check their profile), and some additional hidden ones if you're fine with one-shot ideas: linkffn(9331540)
