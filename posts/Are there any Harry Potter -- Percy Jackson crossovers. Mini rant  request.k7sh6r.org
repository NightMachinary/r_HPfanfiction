I have a problem. I really like Harry Potter and Percy Jackson series but I only ever find Percy and co. go to Hogwarts fics or Harry's Dad/Mum was, in reality, a God type of crossovers. And I have problems with those.

My problem with the former is that Percy was born in 1993 in Harry's 2nd or 3rd year nor sure so that could never happen without time travel/timeline shifts.

My problem with the latter is that it forces Harry to be something more. He changes from a neglected kid whose parents loved him so much that they died for him and triumphs against all odds into a halfgod with special powers and that, in my opinion, is not Harry Potter.

So I ask you are there any adult Harry Potter has to deal with the world of Gods/ fallout of the actions from the Percy Jackson universe type pf fanfictions example:

Auror Potter has to deal with the aftermath of the Medusa/Hydra/Lotus Hotel... Etc. Type stories.

I imagine the Statute of Secrecy would be royally messed up if a Hydra rampages in Washington, D.C.

So if there are any fics like that pls send.


** Why would the Statute of Secrecy play any role in this? I highly doubt the wizards care if the world of gods and demigods gets exposed, they have nothing to do with magic after all, same as I doubt the gods give a damn about the wand waving wizards and their laws.

Sadly can't help you with your search, I have only read "Squatter", and loved it, but always check these threads as I would like to read more crossovers between these two universes.

*** Ok, but how do you tell the difference between a Magical(HP) Hydra and a Greek(PJ) Hydra plus if goods are real why not Wizards.

I imagine that in a shared universe the Gods pay the Magical community to obliviate the Godly activities.

- I doubt that the Gods wouldn't care about a magical world that has a spell that instantly kills you nothing you can do about it sends your soul straight to the afterlife. One more thing Dementors just saying soul removal is a pretty straight death so I would think that the Gods have to care if the magical world exists.

(All my assumptions are made with local rules for example I won't assume that a Percy Jackson Bronze Sword can kill a Dementor (one fic I saw led with that) nothing can kill a Dementor only the Patronus drives a dementor away. Gods/Halfgods/Demigods all have souls therefor Dementors can Kiss/kill all Percy Jackson characters without any counter.)

I'm no expert in The Percy Jackson universe so if you know something like the Dementor rule tell me

**** Oh ok, we are going full AU. Obviously all that would work then, but any story like this would require a whole big deus ex machina. Or the author rewrites a lot of the books.

I was just thinking about both universes are absolutely 100% seperate, noone cares/knows about the other until the crossover happens. Since thats how I like my crossovers. I hate the whole "Imma rewrite everything canon so my crossover can work and have Harry learn about the Gods and how they are real at Hogwarts". But yea, if you assume all that, I guess they would care, maybe? Lot of stuff that doesnt make any sense then tho. For example, I doubt Hades would allow Horcruxes to exist since they go straight against his domain.

***** I didn't mean it like that I just don't like the "one universe is Better than the other in every way" trope for example Wizards VS Half gods in my opinion a really equal fight but many authors only focus on the physical side of the fight Half Gods train more, therefore, they beat the Wizards but the fact that Wizards can Teleport, create things out of thin Air, cast living sentient fire that can't be put out unless it runs out of feeding material (Fiendfire), turn into mist, transform into Animals, ... Gets completely ignored.

That's why I like that some canon in my fics, I imagined the whole the Gods pay the wizards to keep the goods a secret thing like this:

The gods only know that some mortal organization keeps the rest of them unaware of the Gods.

The normal Wizard doesn't know that gods exist it's an Unspeakable/MACUSA President level secret. The Obliviators only get told to erase the last few hours of memories.

But I had an idea that would go full AU:

My idea is that the whole Pantheon of Olympus and all the other gods are just very strong near-immortal Wizards with, Illusions of grandeur, that act like gods and that give through blood magic some magical traits to their children and put them in camp half-blood to create an army of child super-soldiers to take over the World. The wizarding world found out about this and launches an international Auror strike against Camp half Blood and Mt Olympus at the end of Percy Jackson and the Lightning thief when everything seems to be right with the world.

Problem is that I'm too lazy and Incompetent to write a story that's longer than 700 words without losing interest and binning it.

***** But dementors are Magical, not Mythical creatures in Percy Jackson law, as far as I know so correct me if I'm wrong, their weapons shouldn't work at all add to that that you can't in any way shape or form harm a Dementor as far as Harry Potter lore is concerned and I would say that Dementors should be pretty safe from anything.

****** Okay but “magical” is a very broad term. The magic and creatures that we see in the wizarding world needs to originate from /somewhere/. Since the gods are...gods, it's a reasonable assumption that they played a hand in how magic works. Their creatures and monsters also need to originate from somewhere, so doesn't it make sense that they'd originate from the same place as all other monsters in this universe (Tartarus)? So, it's simply possible that the wizards haven't found a way to kill it, but Percy being a demigod is able to using his sword which is lethal to monsters.

In a shared world, that's the lore that would make sense to me. However, this is just my interpretation of how an universe with both magic and gods would work and perhaps you would do it differently

** linkffn(Dies Irae by MufuMufuSan) might not be quite what you had in mind, but it fits, and it's probably my favorite Percy Jackson fic. It does have Harry as an adult dealing with the Percy Jackson world, but it's because he's doing some MoD dimension hopping. What really sold me on it was Persephone being a main character and the actions she's getting up to.

linkffn(The Serpopard by PsychicDetective) fits, but hasn't been updated in about 1.5 years and hasn't even reached the start of the PJO books yet.

** Well, there is "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13274956/1/Harry-Potter-Squatter][Harry Potter, Squatter]]", which is more of an [Abandoned Harry finds new home] fic than anything else. Although he technically is a demigod, he doesn't get an OP buff from said heritage; it just explains his bipolar luck. He still gets by on his skills and wit, with a touch of accidental/wandless magic. linkffn(13274956)

One thing I find nice is that it's not just a [PJO rehash, but with Harry in the team] fic, but a relatively fresh plot. Also, Annabeth gets a raid team to help her tackle Arachne, rather than being forced to solo the Mark of Athena.
