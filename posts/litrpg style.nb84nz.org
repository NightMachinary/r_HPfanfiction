so i really like litrpg's, like gamer novels and stuff, and i've heard of some fics that are like that but all the ones i've found are just cringe. pls tell me if there are any good ones that aren't “wow i'm a epic gamer now i have girls trying to smash”


** I'm pretty sure that's all of them and more than half of fanfiction in general.

That said, here are some previous threads that might be relevant.
