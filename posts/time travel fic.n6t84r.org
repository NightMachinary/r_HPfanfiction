I'm looking for one that's like instead of Harry gong back into his younger body (but if you have one of those I suppose drop them) that his older self replaces his younger self or just has to coexist with younger. I just want like a older harry Potter meets Sirius üò≠üñêüèΩ Preferably during his fifth year or just during his school days


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][wind shear]] has Harry being sent to the 70's, shenanigans ensues, Sirius doesn't play a major role however as it's mostly the generation before that plays a major role.

** I /love/ these type of fics! Although idk any in which Harry goes back in Fifth Year, I've read a lot of them in which adult/post-war Harry meets Sirius. Here are a few fics that ik -

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17732855][The Source of Grief]] - Complete Fix-it AU

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26396641][dogged]] - this is /so/ fluffy and funny!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19334905][Messing With Time]] - Love this fic. It's very light-hearted and well-written, and quite long, still being updated, I think.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27988995][been waiting a lifetime (to be with you)]] - this is drarry and wolfstar and jily, but harry and sirius have cute moments :)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29959236][i saw you for the first time (but i knew u already)]] - sirius/harry soulmate time travel AU, set after harry's fifth or sixth year

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366][face death in the hope]] - this is a classic and though it's more regulus centric, it still has sirius harry scenes.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1097556][Backwards And To The Left]] - focuses on regulus more, but again, sirius harry moments

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30051027][Age Restrictions]] - almost exactly what you asked, except it's adult harry time travelling to his fourth year. But sirius doesn't have much role in this :/

You can try these, too, somewhat related - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13325979][Building Walls]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27760204][the sound of trumpets is a glorious thing]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22408996][Touch of Grey]],\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13409283][Sometimes, The Best Things Are Worth Falling Through Dangerous Objects]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22618939][Begin Again]].

Hope these helped!

** Hi! You'll want to change the flair from recommendation to request. Recommendation means you suggest that fic! As for fic suggestions, I've stumbled across quite a few, but don't really read them, but I'll comment it here if ever I find one.

  "A second chance,‚Äú Death said. Harry stopped in front of a bench and turned to look at the being. "A second chance at what?" "Life."Harry laughed bitterly. "Because that has worked out so great the first time?"Death tilted its head. "You've changed," it stated."Life does that to you," Harry said and his mind felt clearer than ever, "Or should I say the last seven years. I never really left this place, have I? I lived a life feeling not quite dead and not alive either," he spat. "I know how you feel," Death said after a moment, grinning."Oh, do you," Harry retorted and pierced Death with a look. The being's smirk widened as it leaned closer."Bored." Years after the war, Harry Potter lives an apathetic life. When Death offers him a second chance he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.Seeking to make up for the boredom of past years, Harry isn't above carving his own space between two sides to even out the playing field.
