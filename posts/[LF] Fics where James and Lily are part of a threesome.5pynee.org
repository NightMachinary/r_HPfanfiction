The smuttier the better.

Extra happy if it's James/Lily/Sirius or James/Lily/Amelia.

No Peter or Snape as part of the threesome

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)
