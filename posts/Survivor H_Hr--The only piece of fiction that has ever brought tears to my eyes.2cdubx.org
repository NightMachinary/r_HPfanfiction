*** I managed, somehow and... well, that was a horrible experience. Fantastic writing though, truly.

Need to read fluff for a few hours now.

**** Seriously. I didn't think it was possible for a piece of literature to actually make me actually cry. I've read The Road, watched Schndler's List and Requiem for a Dream, and I didn't shed a single tear for those. I think it's just how most of us feel so close to the characters and to their relationships with one another that makes this one so damn hard to read. It's brilliantly written though.

** I basically just cried from chapter one onward. This was so well written and just perfectly encapsulated H/Hr and even made me like Ron a bit more.

** First thing I've ever read that made me cry like a total bitch. I'm laying here, read through it all in one with tears covering my face, nose plugged, crying like just a total bitch. Would I read it again, no I wouldn't put myself through it again. I applaud the author, it was absolutely incredible though.

** I'll take the place of the soulless cynic and say that any story based on the fact that an eighteen year old can't live without his girlfriend automatically ruins the suspension of disbelief for me. Was well written, but overall overly dramatic and cliched. The theme of "a love greater than life itself" doesn't do it for me. At least it's a step above "sentimental dribble" that most romance/angst stories are.

Ron was nicely written though.
