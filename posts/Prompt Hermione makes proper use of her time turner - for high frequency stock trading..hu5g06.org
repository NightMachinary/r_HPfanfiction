Every evening she uses a magic mirror to ask her parents about the current stock prices and uses the remaining hours in her time turner that she didn't use for classes to travel back. Then she calls her parents again and they boot up the computer, dial up to the internet, and use the NASDAQ online trading system to increase their dentistry money. A few percent increase a day in the beginning, but over the span of years it really piles up. Nobody at Hogwarts suspects she's doing anything but using more time to study than she should (which she obviously does too). Muggle authorities get suspicious but can't prove there's anything illegal. She doesn't quit muggle studies or Divination out of fear of losing access to the time turner, and by early fifth year when Malfoy's bribing half the government, she uses her billions and bribes them right back.


** The only problem I see with that is that the only way Hermione can contact her parents from Hogwarts canonically is by owl, and I'm not sure if it is ever stated how long letters take to get to her parents place (You would have to make owls be super fast or tweak things in order to create another form of communication. Now that I think about it tho, Dumbledore managed to get an owl to Harry super fast in book five with the whole dementor problem. Maybe they are already that fast?). Otherwise, its a great idea, as long as the magical world doesn't have a way to monitor that kind of thing. Even if it does, it would be interesting to see how that would play out.

**** I completely forgot about that! Do you remember if the Marauders created it like the map or bought it? Actually, Hermione could probably manage to recreate it with the help of Sirius and Remus if this were to take place around fifth year. Otherwise she would not have known of the mirror's existence quite yet. Of course, if it were to be a buyable item, this becomes a non-issue.

******* Modified protean charm is a commonly suggested way the mirrors could be made, but honestly there's not even a need for a modified one if both sides are willing to see the same information at the same time. It's a hard spell though, N.E.W.T. level, so third year Hermione being able to do it is a bit ridiculous. She did brew Polyjuice Potion which is a very complex potion, but with not that great results.

********* She didn't brew it perfectly though. The maximum duration of Polyjuice is 12 hours. She got 1 hour out of it for Harry and Ron. Now whether she brewed it as perfectly as possible barring the unideal circumstances or whether she didn't do it absolutely perfectly I don't know. I also don't feel like skimming CoS for all the relevant passages, which probably don't contain all that much anyways. My gut reaction though is that it's absurd for her to have brewed Polyjuice perfectly. I don't recall her being absolutely perfect in Snape's class. With a potion so hard that many adult witches and wizards being loathe to attempt, making it so she would have brewed it perfectly if the circumstances were ideal reeks of Genius!Hermione.

*** So, I had written up two paragraphs about how /maybe/ Hermione could pulse an overpowered Lumos from the Astronomy Tower with Morse Code and have a confederate use a telescope to monitor it from off the Hogwarts grounds, using the same kind of magic as that which allows Squibs like Filch to function inside Hogwarts.

Then I realised that I was way overcomplicating things.

Just have the Grangers' house connected to the Floo network (since a witch does live there, and any fees and "fees" can be viewed as an investment), and you have real-time communication between the Gryffindor common room and the Grangers' house.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
