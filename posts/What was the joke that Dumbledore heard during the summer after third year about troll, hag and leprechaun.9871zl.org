I have been constantly thinking about it for the past week, I would love to hear your ideas. You could even your own jokes and make it a prompt...


** A troll and a hag walked into a bar; the leprechaun was short enough to walk right under it.

** A troll and a hag are off on a date. On the way they see a beggar begging pitifully with his skin peeling off.

Being generous and taking pity, they donate several Galleons to the beggar.

The beggar jumps up, and says, "Hah! You fell for the leper con!"

** A troll, a hag, and a leprechaun were running from the aurors, when they found themselves down an alleyway, with no way out. The troll said "well I'm really good at keeping still and quiet, I'm gonna curl up in the corner and pretend I'm a broken stone column."

"Good idea" said the hag. "We'll hide in these sacks, and if they hit me with a spell, I'll pretend I'm a kneazle."

So the troll hunched down in the corner, and the hag and the leprechaun scrambled into a sack each, just as the Aurors came round the corner.

"Best check no one's magically hidden in here" said one, and hit the big pile of rocks in the corner with a tickling charm. The troll, with his head tucked up in his tummy, couldn't help but grunt, and quickly turned it into a growly bark.

"Nope, nothing but a stray dog in there," said the auror, and hit the first sack with a stinging hex. The hag instantly hissed and spat and snarled.

"Nope, just a cat hiding in the sack," said the second auror, and hit the other sack with an incendio, burning the leprechaun to death.

Come on, you know Dumbledore would love antijokes.

**** Well, he was speaking Trollish, and the hag wasn't very fluent. It's entirely possible he was merely suffering from a stitch.

Personally, I'd have smashed through the wall, if I had the size and strength of a troll, but then, I'd probably have the brains and fitness of a troll to go with it, and thus not think of that.

** “Speaking of that, over the summer I heard a terrific joke about a troll, a hag, and a leprechaun.

The three walked into this bar and two ordered drinks. The troll ordered a large gillywater, the hag a shot of Ogden's Old Firewhiskey, and the leprechaun ordered a butter beer and pulled out a small flask.

“What's in the flask?” The hag input rudely.

“This, my lady - er, if you can be called that - is some of my finest Felix Felicis... for tonight, we celebrate!”

“Why are you celebrating?”

“My terrific genetics, and my luck that I was not born a hag or a troll! Speaking of, suppose I should split this between the two of you instead of taking it all for myself...”
