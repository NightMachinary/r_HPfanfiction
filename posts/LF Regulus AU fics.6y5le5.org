I just finished reading linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina]]) and while it was cracky as hell, it really got me interested in the "what-if" scenarios spinning out from Regulus somehow surviving the cave.

Hoping you guys have some suggestions on other Regulus AU fics where he is a prominent character, because it's weirdly frustrating searching for it. So much sirius/regulus incest ugh!


** I know a fic, but Regulus surviving is a massive spoiler. It's a pretty popular fic, but me telling it to you ruins a lot. People who've read the fic can probably guess what I'm talking about.

I can PM it to you, but I wanted to give you a heads up.

** linkao3(Dead Man walking by cywscross)

I forget the manner in which Regulus lives but he does. The first 3 chapters are amazing but chapter 4 switches the tense and (I think the person) of the narrative stream. It was jarring enough for me that I didn't bother reading it.

This is the same person who wrote C'est La Vie, by the way.

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** Surprised nobody's mentioned LullabyKnell's take on this idea yet. Harry goes back to the past after he is killed by Voldemort in the forest, and saves Regulus just in time. Contains mild Harry/Regulus pre-slash; it's pretty subtle so far and I don't think the author has really written anything explicit, she's more into gen stuff.
