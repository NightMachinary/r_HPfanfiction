There's actually a character that has the same name and surname as my OC. They are only mentioned once in the book, but it's still bugging me a bit because I love the name and now I feel like I should change it. Bummer!


** Slip in a reference at the time of the sorting in the fourth book that they have the same name. I knew several people with the same first name, and even a few with the complete same name at school. So, this actually happens and I think you could build this into your story very well. Imagine all the possibilities for mix ups if you ever need some

**** Is there any way you could have your OC just be Graham Pritchard, and have his first year in book 4? Or does that not work for your timeline?

***** In my fic, Harry is born a year later making him the same age as Ginny. I have build an entire cast of OCs, and I thought it wouldn't make much sense if one of Harry's best friends wasn't an OC. That's Graham.

******* Here you go:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23393368/chapters/56059639]]

Fair warning though. It's my first fic and it currently has only four chapters. I had to take a break because of school and chapter 5 it's still being written. So read at your own risk, I guess.

******* The problem is, I have already posted four chapters and introduced Graham to the readers. I don't know if it would be the best idea for me to change it just like that. I am thinking it will be better if I just put a disclaimer on my fic about the whole situation.

******** I mean if Harry is born a year later, what's wrong with Graham being born two years earlier?

******** Oh damn, I didn't realise it was already underway.

Yeah, a disclaimer would be a good move.

******** Bro i think you should just keep Graham, he has such a minor role in books he may as well not be a character
