I really love Author Notes (not the whole responding to a review thing, it gets annoying, would prefer for them to only address popular thoughts and/or things they felt need addressing) I always love that I can finally get into the mind of the author and understand how they think and it humanizes them a lot. I absolutely love them and *hate* when the author doesn't have any in a story. It seems that others feel differently, so what are all of your thoughts on them?


** As long as

1. they aren't long as shit

2. they are not a bigass collection of review responses

3. they're not in the middle of the text

4. they're obviously separate from the text

I'm cool with 'em.

*** I'm with you here. These are basically the rules I follow when writing author's notes, with the added rule that I never beg for reviews. That just seems desperate.

I do use A/Ns to (succinctly) explain my thought processes, but I also use them for other purposes, which is why I think they're valuable. These include announcing changes to my posting schedule (which I consider /very/ important), (rarely) soliciting spell ideas and thanking reviewers for spells I use, and clarifying issues that a large number of reviewers brought up.

** I've begun erasing A/Ns in chapters 2 to N-1, only leaving the initial AN and the current chapter's A/N in my stories.

*** Why would you do that, if the reader doesn't wish to read them then they don't have to but it gives the reader insights into your thoughts at the time.

**** Because my A/Ns are topical and no longer necessary when a new chapter is updated. Old notes are outdated and replies to them are annoying.

** I hate them. I don't care about the author's insights as to why they decided to write something the way they did. If an idea is bad, I don't care how they justify it. I also hate when they're in every chapter, or extremely long, or both. There's no reason to have 1/4 of your word count be authors notes. I also can't stand when an author note is being used to beg for reviews, or responding directly to reviews.

I've actually purposefully gone out of my way to not include author's notes even when I really wanted them. Like, in my most recent story, I had exactly two authors notes, one in the beginning, stating that the story was complete and that a chapter was going to be posted every day, and in the very last, saying that there is going to eventually be a sequel.

*** Exactly. People just use them to explain their plot or why things are happening. The story should speak for itself. I've seen author notes that explain every reference included and they are so boring and pointless.

One thing I do like is when authors use the notes to link to fanworks (other fics, fanart, or playlists) based off it.

** I like A/Ns that have some sort of clarification or teaser for the next chapter (There was a Dramione that did this well. The Bracelet, iirc).

I hate it when the author does review responses or mentions the exact number of hits/favorites/follows/reviews the story got and thanks readers for it.

Notes in the middle of the story are a big no-no, but asterisks next to a word that is explained at the bottom of the chapter is fine with me.

** It depends on how relevant it is. If an author goes on and on about one flame they received and pen this whole righteous response, that annoys me, especially at the beginning of chapters. If an author goes on and on about how they got sick last week and they're moving house and their aunt is in hospital and their new dog peed all over the carpet, that's annoying too. Otherwise, within a paragraph and at the end of a chapter, I don't mind too much what they want to write in their A/N.

** I very rarely include them because I feel they break up the flow for the reader, especially once the fic is complete.

** I'm not a fan, usually. But it doesn't bother me either. If I don't want to read it, I just scroll past it. Every now and then I will find an author that writes relevant and/or amusing author's notes, and those I actually do read. And if the fic is still in progress I appreciate a note at the end of the last chapter about when to expect an update (especially if it an "I'm going to be super busy for the next month, so don't be surprised if the update is delayed" warning). The biggest thing I can say is that I prefer notes at the end of chapters instead of the beginning. It shouldn't make that much of a difference, but it does to me lol.

** Things that I DON'T think should be there are things like:

Media reference explanations: People can google this if they want.

Spell translations: Shouldn't have to tell people what the spell does if you describe it well enough during the actual chapter

Speech translations: Especially true for fanfiction with Fleur. Have a bunch of French in the chapter and translate it at the end? Just have it in italics and indicate she's speaking french.

Polls: I like Harry/Multi as much as the next guy. I just don't need your tally count of who's getting votes to take up more space then the chapter of the actual story did.

** They interrupt the flow of the story, and in my experience, consist mainly of excuses for the posting schedule. Which I couldn't care less about, as I'm generally reading an already completed fic. And the comment replies are annoying - if you want a dialog with readers, post on Ao3, which allows that.

When I save fics, I edit them out.

** Against my better judgement, I'm conditioned to tack an author's note on the end of each chapter. It's usually just a couple sentences thanking people for reading, because I'm sincerely grateful lol!

There's also the much-reviled disclaimer accompanied by a brief and intentionally ambiguous chapter synopsis placed at the header, but until I receive a three million-signature petition to take them down, stay they shall :3

** I've got notes at the start, with the disclaimer and sometimes a bit extended summary. And sometimes at the end, to plug the next story. Other than that, I thank the beta readers at the start of each chapter.

** As long as they're clearly marked and not longer than the actual chapter, I don't mind notes as I mostly skip over them.

the only note I absolutely hate is "If you don't like ______, don't read this" because it comes off sounding like a whiny child who is getting ready to stomp off with their ball.
