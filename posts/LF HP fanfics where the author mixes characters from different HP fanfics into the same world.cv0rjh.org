So say for example 4th year Harry from the Art of Self-Fashioning ends up in the world of Hogwarts Battle School just before the Triwizard Tournament. Or the 6th year version of magical Dudley Dursley in Magical Relations finds himself in the world of For Lack of a Bezoar just after Ron's death. Or say Ginny from The Changeling ends up in the world of Gryffindors Never Die.

The only one I can think of that does this is Echoes in the Fog where the author used a group of characters from one of their stories as well as characters from canon and placed them in an third (previously written) universe together.

I'm also fine with an established fanfic character being placed in the canon universe or a canon!character ending up in an already established fanfic verse.

Thanks in advance!


** The Carnivorous Muffin has written many zany (and frequently hilarious) side-fics for her longer stories which would fit your prompt.

For example, in one crack spinoff she stuck her HP characters from "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus" into the same fanfiction universe as "My Immortal": [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15769602/][My Immortal and the Art of Bringing Me to Life]]

She has also written several short crossovers between her own fics. One of my recent favorites has all of her different versions of Tom Riddle trapped in Limbo together: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19337350][We're All Tom Riddle Here]]

It's a crossover of her fics "The Unwinding Golden Thread", "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?", "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus", "October", and "When Harry Met Tom".

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985266/1/The-Mirror-of-Erised][The Mirror of Erised]], it involved three universes, canon, the one from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7511748/1/The-Rewards-of-Perseverance][The Rewards of Perseverance]], and the one where Neville was the BWL. The story is basically Harry and some of his friends from X universe is switched with the one from Y universe and each tried to solve the Voldemort problem from each universe.

Edit: Now after I posted it, I realize it doesn't really answer your request. Sorry?

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.
