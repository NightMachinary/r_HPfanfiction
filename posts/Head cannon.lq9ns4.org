What is your favorite head cannon?

My favorite head cannon is that staffs/wands are like computers, big and clunky when they where first invented but over time they became smaller and smaller, maybe in the future they are small enough to be ring or bracelet like.


** During the Christmas holidays of /Order of the Phoenix,/ the Lovegoods realized that something very bad had happened to Arthur when they stopped by the Burrow to give the Weasleys a present.

The Lovegoods spent the remainder of the holiday maintaining the Burrow's upkeep and assorted chores, while the Weasleys were at Grimauld Place.

Luna never told Ginny this.

** First of all: it's canon, not cannon. Cannon with two n's is an older type of artillery.

With that out of the way, I'm currently partial to the notion that Hogwarts wasn't founded to be a school, or at least not in the style as seen in the books, because that kind of formalized education didn't come about until about 5 or 6 centuries after the castle's construction. Instead, Hogwarts Castle and the village of Hogsmeade were envisioned as a sanctuary for wizards and witches to live in, safely hidden away from the non-magical inhabitants of the British Isles in a remote part of the Scottish Highlands. That they'd also be able to nurture and guide future generations of Magicals in one centralized location was part of their decision to create it, but not the entirety.

This also ties into another piece of headcanon that I like, that wizards and witches had already been distancing themselves, to greater or lesser degrees, from their non-magical counterparts for centuries before the Statute came into being, with the Statute itself being little more than the finalization of the separation of the two societies.

** Dementors used to be solitary predators that lived in dark woods, preying on individuals that strayed from the path. They feed on despair, not hope, which is poisonous to them. Dementors would disable victims by sapping their will to live and slowly ridding them of poisonous happiness and hope. They would feed on the victims despair for days, until they reached the brink of death, at which the dementor would feast on their soul.

As civilization expanded and the dark forests of Britain shrunk, Dementor hunting tactics changed, and they would occasionally break into homes where humans lay dying, surrounded by the despair of their loved ones which choked out the hope that would have kept them at bay. They would take the soul of the dying one, whose body would fail soon afterwards. This is the reason for the similarities between the appearance of Dementors and the traditional personification of death.

As towns and villages grew and the dark places receded further, Dementors grew desperate and began banding together, using their combined energy to overwhelm the hope of humanity and storm villages, consuming the souls of all inside.

To stop the rampages it took both the creation of Azkaban as the carrot, and the patronus charm as the stick to create the uneasy alliance that protected the general populace from the dementors.

** Werewolves exist because of an ancient ritual to become an animagus. In the ritual, the wizard petitions the spirit animal to bond and use it's form. In this case, Wolf found the wizard lacking and refused. The wizard tried to force the issue and Wolf cursed his bloodline (curse spreads by spilling blood) with a twisted perversion of the wolf form.
