** This fic long ago jumped the shark and though I still read it because why not, it can hardly be said to be good.

I AM a sucker for fortress and town building, so that subplot is a pleasant surprise.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
