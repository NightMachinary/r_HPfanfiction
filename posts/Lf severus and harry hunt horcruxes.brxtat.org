All I remember is that Severus and Harry are using a time turner to hunt horcruxes. They go shopping together at one point and they visit the orphanage riddle grew up in. I think severus takes harry to the opera. Also they are finding the rooms where the horcruxes were created and harry reads the parseltongue that's on the walls.

Thanks


** Is it the same story where Harry has swimming lessons? A Snape guardian one?

But I've read the one you're looking for! So I follow this thread with anticipation because I also want to read it again.
