Looking for fics where either Harry or Voldemort are female and they start a relationship/mentorship. Looking for a little action as well. Don't want the whole fic to just be about a relationship.

*** I'll second that. I hope he's able to keep his weekly updates. Reading new chapters is the best part of my week

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.
