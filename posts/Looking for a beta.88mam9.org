I'm currently 6 chapters into my first HP fic and have changed things around and added and deleted so much that I could really use a fresh set of eyes for consistency and pacing. If anyone is interested, please let me know.

Also, sorry if stuff like this isn't allowed. Please advise if there's a different subreddit that this request would be more fitting. Thank you.

Edit: I'll post the prologue in the comments.


** Prologue

Something didn't feel right.

At first, she thought that maybe the ghosts were in a temper. It was Halloween, after all, and with the muggles finding new ways to dress their children as rude caricatures every year, the holiday had become a sore point in the spirit community. But no, she decided, that couldn't be it. Perhaps the house elves were to blame.

She sipped her wine and glanced over at Dobby as he sat on the floor with her son, making lights and sounds float through the air around him as he looked up in wonder. Dobby had finally found a way to amuse Draco that didn't involve him pulling at his batty little ears or kicking his knobby little knees, thank Merlin. If he could just keep him that way, maybe he would sleep soon and Dobby could get back to being useful. No, it wasn't the house elves. They actually all seemed quite content at the moment.

With a deep sigh, she surveyed the room. The portraits that hung from the walls wore their usual gloomy expressions, her husband's certificates of thanks from high ranking Ministry members sat impressively on the mantle among heirlooms that they had...ahem...inherited... Nothing was out of place. Nothing was different at all, really.

She brought her wine glass to her lips, then paused, holding the sweet, red liquid on her tongue as she tried to search for something- anything- that could explain the nagging anxiety sitting in her chest. Perhaps she had forgotten an impor-

The door slammed open, the sound breaking the perfect silence, and a tall man in a black cloak rushed in and turned to close it. "Lucius!" she exclaimed, quickly standing from her chair and moving towards him. "Lucius, what is happening? Why is-" Her words and steps stopped short as her eyes took in her husband's slightly disheveled appearance, then fell upon the small, black-haired boy in his arms. "What is this?"

"This," replied a somewhat breathless Lucius Malfoy, inclining his head at the child, "is the Potters' son. I believe his name is Harry." He scrunched his nose as if the name tasted bad.

Narcissa stared. "And why is he here? I was under the impression that the Dark Lord wanted him dead."

"The Dark Lord is gone," said Lucius.

She laughed humorlessly. After a quick few seconds, her eyes widened. "What do you mean, 'gone'?" Her heart was beating wildly in her chest. Surely this was wholly impossible.

Lucius quickly explained the night's events. They had arrived in Godric's Hollow, he said, and the Dark Lord had ordered him to wait in the shadows near a clump of trees just down the street from the Potters' house. From there, he could act as sentinel and witness to his Master's triumph, but something had gone wrong. The boy's parents had been completely defenseless and had both succumbed to the killing curse, but when Lord Voldemort had tried to kill the boy...

"This is where it hit him," said Lucius, sweeping the child's messy hair back from his forehead, revealing a jagged cut that looked almost cauterized.

"He...survived," said Narcissa in breathless astonishment, clapping a hand to the neckline of her dress.

"Indeed he did," said Lucius. "Immediately after I saw the green flash in the boy's bedroom window, I felt the Dark Mark start to burn like fire. When I looked down at it," he adjusted the child in his arms so that he could lift his sleeve and reveal the faint reddish outline on his skin where the Dark Mark had once been.

"It's gone," she said, unnecessarily, holding her mouth open in an uncharacteristic display of shock. She felt lightheaded.

Lucius nodded. "Precisely. I can only assume that the Dark Lord is also gone, yet the boy lives. And that is why he is here."

Narcissa pulled her eyebrows together, blinking quickly as she tried to keep up with all of the information. "I don't understand."

Rapping his cane once on the hard wooden floor, Lucius glared purposefully at Dobby. "Bring this boy and Draco to the nursery, elf, and care for them until I call for you." He dumped Harry into Dobby's small arms and the elf stumbled a bit under the weight. With the smallest of bows, he left the room and cooed quietly to Harry as he carried him up the stairs. He returned a short while later for Draco and shrank nervously under his Master's sharp glare before scooping the child up with only a small bit of difficulty. Once he succeeded in another wobbly bow, he took his leave to bring the boy upstairs with the other, and Lucius and Narcissa were left alone.

"Lucius, what is this?" Narcissa demanded. "You don't intend for that child to stay here, do you?"

"Of course I do," Lucius hissed. "Don't you understand anything, woman? That boy, that child! He defeated the greatest wizard of all time and barely has the scratch to prove it. He survived the bloody killing curse, for Merlin's sake. Do you not think it prudent to keep a child with that much power, that much potential, on our side? Imagine if Albus Dumbledore had been the one to find him." Here, Lucius paused and pulled at the silver clasp of his cloak. "No. I forbid it. I have worked too hard and he is far too valuable. Imagine what we can accomplish, Narcissa. Imagine what having him under our thumb means." His greedy pale eyes darted wildly, as if he were watching possibilities flash all around him in real time. "We will raise him. He will grow alongside our own child and understand the importance of pure blood. He will be our greatest ally. Our greatest weapon..."

Narcissa watched and listened intently, growing more and more anxious as he spoke. She waited a long while before she responded, unsure if he even remembered that she was in the room. "Are you not worried about what our friends will say? The Malfoys, raising a mudblood in their own home? A mudblood who destroyed their Master? Lucius, this is madness. Think about what you're proposing. Do you not realize how foolish it is to rely so heavily on possibility? It would be wonderful if the boy did step up to replace the Dark Lord in the fight for the sanctity of pure blood in our society, but what if he doesn't? What if he's honestly nothing special and we let him live here and cared for him? What about Draco? Have you thought of him once in this whole-"

"Don't you dare assert that I did not think of my son," growled Lucius through gritted teeth. "He is all I thought of. With the right training, this boy will make our world better, Narcissa. Don't you see it? Pure bloods in power, muggles and mudblood filth in their proper place! He can make this a reality!"

"You thought the same thing about the Dark Lord!" shouted Narcissa, having quickly grown weary of her husband's absurdity. "And now you stand here with another champion to put your faith behind, but he isn't Voldemort, Lucius. He's a baby, younger than our own. An unknown that you are forcing into our proper family! For all of your grand proclamations of his assumed greatness, you fail to realize that you are putting us all in danger. Do you think that the other Death Eaters will see things your way? Share your enthusiasm about this child? And the Ministry, Lucius! Do you believe they will just forget that we have supported the Dark Lord, so much so that you took his mark? Do you honestly think that they will allow us to walk free, much less care for the child that defeated he who they feared above all others?"

"I will deal with the others, and the damn Ministry," Lucius said in a cold, deep voice. "My word on this is final. He stays."

Narcissa stared at him incredulously. "Then perhaps I shall take our son and flee while we still can, before they start rounding us all up for Azkaban, and you can care for the Potter boy."

"If you even think about acting on that threat, Narcissa, I swear on the stars that what I do to you will make what your sister did to the Longbottoms look like a cheering charm."

A sharp gasp caught somewhere in her throat, and she stepped back as though she had been slapped. Lucius stared her down, his face taut with conserved rage, and in the time it took him to take two deep breaths, Narcissa shrank back, casting her eyes to the floor.

"Good," he said, coolly. "Now why don't you go introduce yourself and Draco to the boy. And while you're there, do practice your enthusiasm for our new proper family." The smile that he gave her made her skin crawl. It wasn't a suggestion, it was an order, just like the smile wasn't a smile, it was a warning.

She clenched her teeth and squared her shoulders, clasping her hands together in front of her as she walked to the bottom of the stairs and began to ascend. How dare he, she thought, feeling angrier than she had in ages. How dare he bring this strange child into her house and force her to care for him as if he were equal to her own flesh and blood.

As she stepped into the nursery a few moments later, she was met with the rather unexpected display of both boys sitting inches apart and babbling with the intensity of two people having a deep conversation. She had never seen Draco interact so readily and animatedly with anyone, not even the house elves. He looked happy...

She watched them for a few moments, feeling her anger and dislike of the boy and the idea of him staying with her family begin to recede. Stepping away from the door, she turned and leaned against the wall, placing a delicate hand over her brow. This was insane, she thought. But Lucius would eventually come to his senses. He had to. She just needed to play nice for a day or two. And if he stayed, however unlikely, it seemed that Draco, at least, was pleased with the arrangement. Perhaps she could make this work.

*** Harry is raised by the Malfoys, so he and Draco have a brotherly dynamic, Lucius sees him as a tool, Narcissa is very much like she is in canon. I'm playing with how things would be the same or different with him starting out privileged and magical with Harry becoming the chosen one through a different path. My inspiration was Prince of Egypt, so if you know that movie, that's my angle, more or less.

**** Just curious, but how did you explain/bypass/deal with Lily's sacrifice/blood protection? I've seen a couple of stories floating around in this subreddit about people like Snape/Remus/Sirius raising Harry instead of the Dursleys, so it's been a point of interest.

***** It's still there. My version is that Lucius goes with Voldemort that night as a just-in-case (and so Voldy has someone to witness how great he is) and Lucius gets him out of the house first because (borrowing from what Snape said in HBP) he thinks Harry will grow up to be an even more powerful dark wizard. So Lily's sacrifice stands.
