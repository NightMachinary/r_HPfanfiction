#+TITLE: fics where warding is described in detail as process, setting up and creating, preaparing. Lots of focus on actual creation of Wards? Like in super detail, boring, nerdy kinda way?

** Ooh I remember reading one like this!! Hang on I'll go find the link

Edit: I'm pretty sure the downward spiral saga explores wards in depth?? There was another one I read where Harry trained with the curse breakers that I'm trying to find

Edit 2: found it! [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11933512/1/The-House-of-Potter-Rebuilt][House Of Potter Rebuilt]]

** Arithmancer has some stuff about runes. I don't think they were specifically used for wards in that book, but I'd expect that wards are just runes used a particular way.
