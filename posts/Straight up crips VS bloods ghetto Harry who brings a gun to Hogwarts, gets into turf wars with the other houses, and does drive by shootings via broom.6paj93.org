  Harry Potter is a thief and a lawbreaker long before he gets his letter. Upon discovering he's a wizard, he sets out for the wizarding world - but he's doing things his way. Dumbledore has no idea what his decision to leave Harry with the Dursleys has wrought. Harry/Multi, darkish, some Dumbledore bashing, rating may go up later.

********* *Original gangster*

Original gangster or original gangsta (OG) may refer to an individual (regardless of criminal affiliation) who represents ideals the speaker sees as gangster and generally "tough" or "hood" in behavior, looks, or both as well as a connection to the past or being older: commonly used as a sign of respect.

** I swear I read something at least a little something like this before. It was called Gangland, and Harry was basically just a violent nutter who kept shooting people for next to no reason, and kept trying to corrupt Hermione. I think the story must have been deleted.

** Ok, why would you want that? Shouldn't Hogwarts be kind of a save haven? (no, not because of Dumbledore and his bias in favor of granting even rapists, terrorists and murderers second chances - more like because all factions of wizard Britain send their children there...shouldn't there be some accords that kind of keep the peace, even if the rules are unofficial and have never been really writen down (nobody would want a Hogwarts where you have to always keep your guard up, right?))

If so: Wouldn't the purebloods put a stop to that "muggle nonsense"? (supported by everybody else who's not involved, like muggleborns who aren't from criminal families etc.)
