I dont know the exact wording, but apparently the Gryffindors could demand the Head of House to be with them by the Headmaster and than Minerva would have a conflict of interest. And the twins will rake their best of the best pranks and at the end nobody can give them detention or remove them from school for that-

(I read that in a FF where Harry wore a blond wig to escape the trope in the train and then informs Minerva. The woman resigned on the spot from the Gryffindor Head of House position.)


** I'm not quite understanding this. Could someone clarify?

*** I /think/ what they're asking for is a fic in which the twins point out that McGonagall can't really balance the duties of head of house and deputy headmistress at the same time, so she resigns as head of house, and the twins abuse to power vacuum to make mischief.

As for the rest of the word salad in brackets, I have no idea

*** there was a fic where someone could ask for a punishment to be decided by their head of house AND the deputy head so as Mcgonagall held both, any griffindore could have gotten out of any punishment as only one could show up not both. I don't remember the name though
