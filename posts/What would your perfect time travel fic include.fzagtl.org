We all know why we've dropped bad time travel fics. Maybe it was the guy with the mind of a 100 years old trying to date a pre-teen, maybe it was that they wanted to change the future while refusing to change their actions.

So, what would your hypothetical perfect time travel fic include?


** - The character who time travels not knowing all the major points. They might have vague knowledge about something happening but not the specifics.
- Them being unable to plan everything (even if main characters travel back). It is impossible to remember what happened when. One might remember significant encounters or days but remembering the exact day something happens is very difficult especially if some years have passed. All the days mash together in the memory. Try to remember what was the date and day you got scolded by a teacher or what question came on a test 5 years ago just does not work.
- Having significant personality changes that are extremely obvious. It would be extremely difficult to know what you were like at a certain point in time and even more so to act convincingly to fool people you are close to.

I want to read fics in which this happens. Them despite having vague (or even precise) knowledge of future events does not mean they are able to foresee every altercation or event happening and planning for it accordingly.

  Dudley Dursley, 37, has only just put his daughter on the Hogwarts Express and said goodbye when Platform 9 3/4 is attacked. In the ensuing explosion, he blacks out - and wakes up as an eleven year old back in Privet Drive. Confused and wary, he finds himself blundering through his life all over again, and unfortunately, being eleven isn't the only surprise in store.

I think this can be ok if it's something the character is thinking and there's a reason for it. For instance, if Harry is coming out of a terrible war that killed all his friends, I could see him struggling with deciding whether to immediately change things - or not throw away his future knowledge.

After all, once you change one thing, everything will start to change. And a time traveler might /need/ to change something specific, in their mind (eg, Voldemort coming back at the graveyard with the help of Wormtail - if he'd find another way to come back, is it worth giving up the one that you /know/ he'd use?).

There should absolutely be some changes from canon, unless there's an actual constraint stopping it - but I think you can write a conflicted time traveler who's desperately trying to restrain to the minimal amount of changes and struggling with it...

*** "I cannot affect the time stream" can be very good if it's a restriction of the way the time travel works, not something the character says because they fear the consequences. Especially when it forces the character to be creative at influencing things instead of just immediately becoming a god. For example the closed loop in PoA, they technically didn't change anything, only made the things that happened happen in a good way.

*** The 'i cannot affect the time stream' sometimes is nice, but not all the time.

If it's used in a way for an excuse to copy cannon, then it's bad.

But if it's used in a different way e(e.g, in Sisyphus), then it can make a really awesome fic. In this fic I'm talking about, Harry repeats his life again and again, and it starts feeling like a curse. You can just about feel how /bored/ and /dreadfully tired/ harry is.

** - Travel back far enough that the whole question of how Harry should go about interacting with his friends doesn't even come up.

- Keep Harry an adult.

- Don't use 'preserving the timeline so my knowledge remains correct' as an excuse to change literally nothing. Instead, accept that Harry actually doesn't know the locations of things like the Cup or Diary if he's back far enough and centre the plot around actually trying to locate them.

- Or nix horcruxes completely. Go off the beaten track.

- No 'Dumbledore was an idiot for trying to do everything himself, do I'll do everything myself'.

- Add something more than 'Muahahaha! Eeevulz!' as the motives for Voldemort/Death Eater recruits.

- No super-secret James Bond Unspeakables, please.

- Romance should either be with a consenting adult, or simply not exist. A weird creepy romance is worse than no romance.

There's probably more, but that's what occurs to me off the top of my head.

** First and foremost, tell as few people as possible that you're a time traveler. Idk why but I hate it when the whole OoTP (or any other group of people) knows and is working with him.

Then there is the love interest problem, if you send Harry back in time and you want a pairing, either let his lover travel back with him or pair him up with an adult.

Make your story interesting through the butterfly effect and not through "ups, Harry kind of forgot about major plot point and danger to his life xy"

Don't send more than 2 people back in time. I don't like it when there is a whole group, because I want characters to feel somewhat isolated and disconnected. In a Time Travel huge groups just make it easy and lead to fluffy fix-it stories.

When Voldemort finds out this info, he :

1. Hides all horcruxes, cursing his young foolishness and putting them in a place that no one can reach except him.
2. Probably ambushes and kidnaps Harry, to wheedle any extra info, then draught of living death's him and throws him in an unescapable prison because HIS HORCUX MUST BE SAFE.

** A story where time travelling's disadvantages are shown. The time traveller is only human, even with knowledge of the future.

It might be anything, the butterfly effect kicking in (With really bad unexpected consequences that cause reality to spin out of control), the time travellers own weaknesses (e.g a gullible person being tricked into telling his secrets, and then being obliviated, or a person who is not very perceptive and lives in the NOW not foreseeing what horrible things a change will bring).

It could be bad luck, or incomplete knowledge (e.g, if Ron of the start of year 3 got flung back to the start of year 1, he might prevent the escaping of Sirius)

SOmething, I remember, being close to this was in a story where Harry appeared in the middle of the 1st wizarding war in the death eater's lair, with his godson Teddy. He tried to lie to Voldemort, but it only half worked. He told Voldemort that he was the child of lily and james potter, (but didn't say they were dead), and mentioned that they weren't the best parents, and he hated them (while bringing up images of a cupboard). He managed to stop Voldemort from killing him, but at the same time he had to pretend to hate muggles and want to become a death eater. Then, he was tricked into a dark vow that made it so he could not tell anyone of his secrets. So, he was a death eater, and couldn't fix anything. Teddy was leverage to stop him from misbehaving, and when he was captured by the order, his mom and sirius and james instantly thought he was a savage killing death eater and wouldn't hear any of his explainations.

** One thing I like to see in a time-travel fic, is that the time traveller CAN'T manipulate their own fate, because they don't remember the details. Seriously, do you remember all the conversations you had with your friends? They were your friends, and you're in a boarding school where apparently everybody has the exact same schedule for the first two years; you had literally dozens of conversations with your friends every day.

I also like to see him frustrated by school. Too many of them have Harry be a super student the second time around, but I find that unlikely. He was pretty much a slacker the first time around. (Yes, Ron encouraged him to skive off, but Hermione encouraged him to study; it's on him which one he followed.) But the thing is, he still has to do all the school work. Yeah, he can possibly cast the spells, but classwork is largely theory. Essays are essays, and a pain in the butt no matter how old you are. And just because he did it before doesn't mean he retained it: anybody who ever watched the game show "Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?" knows that adults have forgotten much of the schoolwork they learned. So basically, he's an adult being forced to go to school all over again, and it sucks. No, he probably can't just go take his O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s and be hailed as a prodigy.

** Opposition.

That force that works efficiently to oppose the time-traveller. Another time-traveller (and they play a game of cat and mouse to see who it is), some entity watching over time, someone realising someone's travelled across time, fate ... lots of possibilities there.

My biggest grudge with most time travel fics is that they often seem to play out like a rigged game. Reality shouldn't be like that and stories *really* shouldn't be like that.

** Non epilogue compliant

Harry Potter and the Omnipresent Oligarchs

'The boy who lived' became the 'boy who won'. Ginny and Neville developed feelings while leading a rebellion in the year Harry was absent from Hogwarts. Harry always quietly rooted for Neville and only wants Ginny to be happy so though she's willing to try again, he bows out as gracefully as he can. He finds visits to his pseudo-family at the burrow difficult with the ashes of the relationship and his guilt over Fred's death. Molly is still mothering, but he discerns that she deeply wanted him and Ginny to work out and it crushes him. Ron and Hermione worry about him, but their perfect friendship has changed. Now Harry is a third wheel more often than not. His fame shows no signs of lessening and he is hounded by paparazzi, even when he tries to hide in the muggle world - which is changing so fast it makes him feel old before his time

Slightly bitter with it all, Harry finds refuge in the hidden indigenous wizard conclaves. He learns how little he truly knows about magic and how to live his life post Voldemort.

30 YEARS LATER

Ginny and Neville's (adult) kid seeks out and finds Harry. He is apparently wizarding Britians last hope. No dark Lord's are in sight though, the problem is the muggles.

Giant mapping and satellite mega corporations have long since discovered the magical world. Wizards are now all employed by the billionaire class of muggles (often marrying in/using various methods to make sure their children are magical).

The competing intelligence communities of the USA, PRC, and Russia have snapped up the rest of wizard kind and with camera and drone technology, arrest and pressgang any person caught using magic. It is believed that either Russia or the States was responsible for the kidnapping of Hermione Granger, Minister off Magic, and her immediate family. Other prominent voices of dissent such as Wizengamot opposition leader Neville Longbottom and former Quidditch star turned Hit-Witch Ginny Longbottom are also missing.

Harry and Ginny's kid track down Hermione to a government black site. She has been forced to work on a time machine. While Hermione can't send herself back, they can lock themselves in, and she can race to finish the machine and send Harry's mind back to his childhood. Ginny's kid isn't old enough to affect enough change. With firm instructions on getting help from unspeakables, but only after removing the Voldemort sympathisers hidden among their ranks, Harry is sent back to tolerate the dursleys, and figure out how to save the world - twice.

Flash forwards to Harry is 11, and is ecstatic to finally meet his new(old) best friend's on Hogwarts Express. He is determined to follow his exact steps so as not to muck up what he considers his greatest triumph in life; his friendship as part of 'the trio'.

Only, as Hermione rattles off everything she read in Hogwarts, A History, Harry realizes that 11 year olds SUCK. At least she and Ron are cute as buttons, but he's not sure he's going to be able to take years of listening to this before he strangles her; and it will be years before Hermione becomes mature enough to handle the truth of his time travel. Also the hat refuses to put him anywhere other than Slytherin.

Living with the same common room as Malfoy is the hardest test of Harry's patience ever. The twit is insufferable. Slytherin as a whole is both vile and fascinating (in a vile way). Rabid anti-muggle culture permeates. Complicating Harry's feelings on defending his views/fighting the bigots is that he actually fundamentally agrees with some of their deepest fears about muggles. They ARE dangerous; he saw that firsthand. And while he knows his childhood was out of the norm for a variety of reasons, he never actually knew any non magical people very well other than the Dursleys. He has no actual personal experiences to draw on when answering condescending questions about growing up muggle.

Can Harry chart the right course? Voldemort is easy stuff. The hard part is saving his best friendship. And maybe making new ones. And figuring out what to do about Ginny; Harry had endless regret over what could have been if he hadn't broken up with her. Given a chance to do it all again, he knew what he'd choose; it was just that his mental age would make repeating their relationship incredibly unethical. Also, Ginny would be completely insufferable until almost her 4rth year.

And over those anxieties, Harry needs to get Dumbledore and some of wizarding Britian's greatest minds to help him find a new direction for the world. One where wizards weren't captured on sight and the oceans weren't rising. Where refugees didn't die in the millions. Where endangered magical species weren't used in incredibly popular underground blood sports or sold to the highest bidder as a pet.

Well. At least Ron was still as hilarious as ever.

** Not just a single character dropped a few years into the past with future knowledge and improved skill who then lets things mostly play out the same way. That kind of universe rewriting power is OP and makes things one sided and needs a deus ex machina to even start. Instead make it short and frequent time travel hops, like in canon (not cursed child), maybe something where Hermione keeps her time turner but during the battle of the ministry Voldemort also gets one, so things are balanced but you get scenarios where the end happens before the beginning all the time. For example the Trio robs Gringotts, and the moment they open the vault three slightly older versions of themselves jump out with the destroyed Horcrux and then turn back another hour and escape long before they entered the building. And if someone says Voldemort there's a good chance he's been invisibly standing behind you already.

*** That sounds so interesting1 I'd read that.

So to sum it up, Harry gets thrown back in time to when the diary was whole, absorbed into the diary, taking Tom's place, and having to convince the diary's holder to save him (In a freak accident).

It'd be a lot more interesting, in my opinion, if Harry's and Tom's soul merged instead, so that Harry has a lot of sociopathic and murderous tendencies (Like being tempted to just use Ginny and manipulate her), and having to deal with that. Harry'd be a horcrux yet again though...Maybe it could be so that Harry doesn't know that he's merged with Tom, he just thinks that Tom's dissapeared.

My head-canon is that beng trapped inside the diary is terrible, it's like being alive but in a void not being able to see, feel, hear, just you and your thoughts. You can't sleep because you can't close your eyes, you can only wander through the empty halls of your childhood home (e.g for tom the orphanage, for Harry privet drive). That would probably drive him insane quick though, but who said the mc had to be sane.

** So, lets talk about typical fanfic time travel plots, vs. what would logically happen if someone traveled back.

1. Typically these are Peggy Sue plots. Somehow adult Harry (or whomever) ends up back in their child's body, able to redo their own life at will. This seems to have become traditional after the story "Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past" (now sadly permanently removed for no good reason by [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], an organization you should not patronize because of its history of being a bunch of asshats, use Archive of Our Own instead) pioneered the genre. This used to be an interesting premise, but it's gotten a bit hackneyed now.
2. But of course, if you have the more obvious "adult Harry" (or whomever) goes back in time plot, with "child Harry" still present in the new timestream, then we can expect that we're dealing with someone who can literally never recover their old life. Their old friends are children, and are, besides, friends of old them. Their obvious peers are other adults, but of course, they have a Terrible Secret. The biggest part of said secret would have to be that they time traveled at all --- if it got out that this was possible, we could expect lots of people to start trying to disrupt history that way.
3. And yes, although the "don't alter the time stream, you won't be able to predict anything!" idea is kind of silly, as is the "don't tell Dumbledore! If you did, why, he might be able to use your information to allow the good guys to win, could help you, and otherwise might make it possible for you to achieve your goal!" idea is /really/ silly (and basically an idiot plot excuse, as in "why are these people such idiots? If they weren't the plot would be much simpler"), but it does make sense that if you start giving interviews to Rita Skeeter telling her precisely how you traveled back in time, there might be quite serious consequences to the stability of reality itself as everyone and their second cousin try the same thing.
4. All of this, of course, sets up any time traveler as a fundamentally tragic figure.

I'd say that one story that takes this "more realistic" approach into account by someone else is probably linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute by Voice of the Nephilim). I've of course written one myself, though it was a bit too short to be entirely satisfying.

If of course one is going to accept the usual tropes, it's nice when the traveler faces some pretty major obstacles. linkao3(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer) isn't yet complete, and so perhaps it will not end well, but it's pretty good as Peggy Sue plots go. Probably my favorite Peggy Sue plot ever was linkffn(Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always by deadwoodpecker), which really does the traditional version of such things astonishingly well.

2. Ah, yes. The "it's just a story" argument. I already told you it doesn't impress me. It might be "just a story" but the people who write and read these stories are very much real. They are sick and need help.

So what? You still don't have to read it. You aren't required to read things you don't want to --- they're tagged on AO3 for a reason, so you get to know what's in them, and can avoid them. Part of being an adult is learning that the world is full of things you don't like --- and that you don't have to participate in.

I have had people hit on me over the years who I had no interest in a sexual relationship with. I said no. Big deal. You don't have to play a sport you don't like, and the fact that other people enjoy it and brazenly play it in the same city you live in doesn't mean you ought to have the right to tell them to stop. If you don't like a particular kind of clothing, no one forces you to buy it. The fact that you think that some food is disgusting doesn't mean you get to tell other people not to eat it --- just don't eat it yourself.

  Harry Potter never actually beat Voldemort, but rather fought him to a standstill while Europe burned around them. Finding himself an unwilling part of a dark ritual to send him back in time twenty years, he is surprised to see how Dumbledore reacts to proof of obvious child abuse (Harry's), how eleven-year-old super genius and Witch Queen in training Hermione reacts to actually having a socially competent friend (Harry), and how much easier it is to shrug off the insults of munchkins when you're a grizzled war veteran.But there is one huge problem: being sent back blew out his magic entirely. Just waving his wand knocked him out the first time he tried it. Can Hermione help him though his classes even with his magic almost unusable? Will Harry be able to find the secrets to actually killing the Dark Lord and saving his friends from a horrible future without blowing his cover, or even getting mistaken for the Dark Lord himself? Will Neville Longbottom get better grades than him?

- Antagonist either a time traveler too or so powerful/capable that the protogonist is in tangible danger of being outmatched, even with time travel on their side.

  - Extra spicy option: Antagonist is the time traveler, not the protagonist (to clarify, /not/ in the sense that a villainous or antagonist-esque protagonist time travels).

- Author having a deft hand at controlling what information readers are privy to at all times and what information characters are privy to at all times.
- Preferably shorter-term time travel (seconds, minutes, hours) rather than longer-term time travel (months, years, decades)

Slash is preffered, but gen is fine too. Hetero is okay so long as its not harryxharem or daphne, but if its an OC I'd like to see them fleshed out even if the romance isn't key.But ffs the age be balanced.

I like myself a bit of Snape and Slytherin!Harry and well as Harry actually studying and powerful. But I want to see Harry struggle with the secret he's hiding. I want to see the inner debates he has with himself, trying to come of as normal (if it's marauders era) and 11 years old or whatever. To be mentally struggling to cope and breaking down and to hide his knowledge. But! He also can't just cry about it.

** I love time travel.

Okay, so, yeah, there's big problems with the "travel back in time to your eleven year old self" plot if the fic is going to do any romance plots while the characters are /young/. And I'm honest enough to say that I didn't really notice this first time around... one of the earlier fics I read was [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847/chapters/18163144][Hermione as Cathal Rosier]], but I think Hermione got involved with Theo until later on (and travelled back younger than typical). But, of course, having your main characters have a romance is interesting, right?

Solution: send them back in time together. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][There's one I'm reading]] (sort of, I might have stopped reading it now actually... been a few days) where Harry, Ginny and Ron /all/ go back. The problem is that it's still Romione and also Ginny tried to jump Harry when she was physically 11/12 (which is ick even though mentally they're both thirty). But that's simple... just send *all* your OTPs back in time. And wipe their memories of each other. So you've got, say, Harry and Ginny going back since everyone else died, but the way they travel back in time makes them think they're the only time traveller. There we are... age appropriate romantic tension achieved.

Although... if they start telling people they're time travellers this plot falls apart. And that's one thing I didn't really like about Backwards with Purpose... everyone knows now. It was fine when it was just Dumbledore (and I agree he really does need to know), but part of what I like about time travel stories in general is that usually it's just the time travellers who are in the know.

So, I guess, this brings us to the not changing the present idea. There are two takes on this, I think. One, is that they're trying to preserve the advantage of their future knowledge... which is reliant on things happening as they already know they played out. The counter-argument here is "why travel back this far, then?" Two, something like in Endgame where there's a specific aspect of something that needs to be preserved or the end goal is to change the future by making sure certain things/people are in the right place at some specific point in time.

Right... so with that out of the way... In a time travel fic, what I'm after is usually what I like to see regardless. So, that's Hinny or next generation characters, basically. Chuck in some parseltongue, too, I guess.

But there should also be some tension as a result of the time travel that stems from the reader's knowledge of canon. Take [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8550820/1/Strange-Visitors-From-Another-Century][Strange Visitors from Another Century]] which has a Good!Slytherin and a Harry that (imo) is mutually attracted to Helena Ravenclaw. As I remember, the fic's fully established that time travel is /why/ Slytherin left the other founders, but it's unclear if Harry's involved with why the Bloody Baron stabbed Helena.

So, that's another thing I like... the notion that the time travel we're seeing /now/ fits in with canon to at least some extent. Like that fic where [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=306311][Dominique is one of Harry's ancestors]] (sounds weird, I know, but it's actually great).

And then there's tragedy. I like the tragic reasoning for jumping back where you don't know exactly what happened but you do know it's bad, as with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35816418][In The Bleak Midwinter]].

But I don't think putting all of these into one fic would work. But let's see what I can distil from the above:

- a crack fic where Harry and Ginny went back in time to fix things, but forgot they went back together and their plans range from being mutually incompatible to horribly confusing the other and finally to actually being opposed. Good!Dumbledore thinks there's a reason why Ginny and Harry didn't mention they travelled back together so is keeping the secret (even though it makes no sense).
- an angst fic with the same premise... it'd take either Harry or Ginny's perspective (not both as in the crack version). Things went really badly in the first timeline, but travelling back doesn't seem to have helped. Nothing's happening the way it was supposed to... and, even worse, Harry/Ginny is being tortured knowing his/her spouse is forever inaccessible. It'd have a happy ending, though... meaning less that they save everyone and more that they save some people who died the first time (remember, it's still an angst fic).
- some kind of crazy outlandish time travel fic that is ultimately canon compliant (so, like that Fred and George fic whose name I've forgotten except they don't bring the letters back and, instead, merely end up creating the timeline we know about), whether in a sort of Oedipus-like "creating the fate you're trying to avoid" sense or merely a stable loop.
- some kind of pure time travel plot which doesn't have anything to do with canon (e.g. a character travels back to meet Merlin or something)... sort of the same as the previous option, but just a more general case because the plot has nothing to do with Voldemort

Always remember "trying to get home" and "do I really want to go home?" are perfectly valid plots for time travel stories.

- The relationships they had are different because they themselves are effectively different people.

** - No bashing.
- Whoever you send back, let them be an adult with a canon background, as epilogue-compliant as possible. I don't really want to read about an unrecognizable dark!Harry (or Hermione/Ron/Neville/Teddy...) from a world where Voldemort won, I want the characters from the books that I love.
- Don't deage the character. I don't mind the occasional adult-Harry-in-11-year-old-body, but I'd much rather read about head-Auror-and-family-man-Harry getting thrust into the past as he is (and being badass). An adult Harry being seperated from everything he's built and everyone he loves, who really does not want to be in the past, should make for an interesting story.
- Speaking of canon, stick to it as much as possible when telling your story. I'm not talking about the story itself - timetravel is about change after all - but about the universe. Set the story in the world that has been outlined in the books and FB movies, with the same rules and limitations. You can build on it, but within reason. I don't want to read about lordships and convenient inheritances and strangely helpful goblins. I don't want to see characters act wildly OoC either.
- Don't have the character stuck in Hogwarts. There's a large wizarding world out there, and I want to see the timetraveler interact with it and affect it. Having an adult character timetravel should help with that.
- Don't stick to Harry's Hogwarts years. I guess it's tempting, because it's the time period the readers know best, but there are so many other periods when a timetraveler could land. There is the first war with Voldemort, that lasted for years, or the Grindelwald war, that went on for decades. And there were long periods inbetween wars, too. Get creative!

** Saving all my favorite characters. seriously, once there was a fic with Harry traveling in Marauder's era and he just... let Regulus die. just like that. he knew, he could change it, but nada. dropped it then.

Snape included, with his usual snarky self. and more of him than there was in canon. he is refreshing. I would actually prefer him doing the time travel. or Harry with the knowledge and seeking Snape's help, or being busted by Snape.

If someone is time traveling to where Harry is little, they ought to save him from the Dursley's. (it's usually Harry himself being an adult, saving little Harry).

stories not including Lily/Snape or Hermione/Snape. I don't like Lily/Snape pairings at all. I could stomach Hermione, but I don't read them if the relationship is the focus, and not the changing the future.

changing the future being the focus of the story, not romance or friendship.

It actually has to change the future. what's the point otherwise? so HP canon of... whatever happens already happened, I don't like that.

characters still being themselves. a 19yo Harry will still be pretty shy and nice even if he was 11 again. no reason to make him crazy, annoying his professors, making him a prodigy, since he knows this stuff. narcissistic prat. that's Harry sometimes. but if Snape is going into his childhood, they sometimes make him pathetic stuttering wet cloth. nooooope! and I know that Harry changed with the story, but I think he would still try to make the same friends and just try to make everything better. because it's Harry.

the character at least attempting to not get caught as time traveler. failing the spells on purpose, or behaving like a child, NOT being omni potent, all knowing so even the teachers notice something about him. then of course Dumbles finds out, because he stands out and it does down from there.

epilogue? what epilogue? (losing children is just so depressing)

I actually prefer if the time traveler woke up in their younger body, but I can see why others would prefer to have two copies of that person in the story, with one being older. not liking those personally.

** Time travel - as much as I /love/ the genre - has the downsides of the canon plot being /incredibly/ easy to unravel.

So, I'll put my answer with three sub-cases, because that way I can cheat ;)

The first is, in a standard time travel, my 'perfect' one would include a Harry who's competent - but not incredibly powerful. So, perhaps one right after the war (win or lose), who time travels back with pretty severe PTSD to either the start of Hogwarts or the start of the Triwizard tournament, and has to figure out what to do from there.

A second option would be for the criminally underdone /time-loop/ variation - in which case, either another variation of the excellent 'The Many Deaths of Harry Potter' fic would be great fun (it's a concept that's open enough that the one interpretation is not the /only/ one, IMO), or one that's tailored around the Triwizard tournament would be particularly fun.

Then, there's my cop out 3rd option - in which case we add a twist of it taking place in an alternate universe, with a much /harder/ to get rid of plot/power/capability for the enemies. This lets our alternate version of Harry time travel back with knowledge of the past - but also have an actual struggle to change things, unlike canon. So competent Harry, but not overpowered, with actual challenges...

I'll give an honorable mention to a teenage Harry time traveling back to the Marauder's time in Hogwarts, becoming friends with his parents, and having adventures, because that would be very cute. Same with something involving a relationship with someone from another time, like Bellatrix - also could be great fun.
