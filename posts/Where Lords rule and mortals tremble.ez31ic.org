Imagine a world where your family mattered, not because of "family magic" or some other justification for pureblood racism but because your social class truly matters. Where the most Noble House of Malfoy is a dominant political powerhouse that has many cadet branches that serve the house, where many lesser families and peasants serve House Malfoy. Where House Malfoy and House Longbottom have thousands (or hundreds or dozens, whatever your preferred magical society size is - mine is the greater the better) of soldiers that serve their interests. Lucius Malfoy leaves his house to head to Diagon Alley in Summerhall with 4 dozen honor guards and almost fights with Lord Weasley, with only four honor guards (and family members at that - how pathetic). The Wizengamot is a place where different lords work together for their own good. The Ministry of Magic is a concession to muggleborns and the poor that has grown in strength, with their auror and hitwizard force, growing in popularity because they maintain infrastructure. Magical power is prized as much as wealth and political power by lords and society.

Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Grindewald are shocking because they come from cadet branches of lesser lines, and grew so much in magical power and political power that they have many houses serving them. Dumbledore is hated for seeking a more democratic society where the powerful have less influence and Voldemort might have risen from a disgusting lack of good breeding and wealth to the main champion for the reconsolidation of power back from the ministry.

â€‹

Or whatever! Go for it! I look forward to reading whatever or discussing this with you guys! The main inspiration behind this was reading many stories about how houses are very important and wanting to read battles where different house leaders commanded their forces under more powerful lords and battled, sending their subjects into death for them. Also wanted to read Harry cutting his way past Draco's guards in battle.

Apologies for any grammatical errors, very tired right now.


** How would that last with magic? Magic just makes insurgency too easy and that's the sort of society that begs for a bloody revolution

*** True but this would be a society where society is run by the rich and powerful. The populace would be used to it, if not indoctrinated. What are the insurgents going to do? Hit and run on a the property of a lord or the ministry? What happens when some polity simply sends 12 soldiers to remove a dissident's family or the dissident? I disagree that magic makes insurgency too easy, but it's definitely an interesting direction. I could see a good fic where discontent slowly grows before a full blown rebellion.

**** This makes me think of every Xianxia ever. Family clan hold power, sects (school) monopolize knowledge, might makes right.

** Canon fit very well that description, I am sorry if it is not apparent but the Wizengamot Members are Lords of rich families or Lords in fact even without the title. The Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery is a fine example of the power of those families with the exception build of magic use not reported withing wizarding homes. How one become a Wizengamot Member and Minister of Magic is yet another fine example of Aristocracy. The Ministry of Magic is the successor of Wizard Council, name that hints towards Lord Gatherings.

The canon hints a that with the Ancient and Noble House of Black, the family motto something that exist only in nobility. And we are in Britain, the title may have been abandoned to create the illusion that it doesn't exist anymore.

Notwithstanding Malfoy great fortune, the families truly old may have more of it if it is hidden, I would not be surprised if Salazar Slytherin build some very well protected vaults within his chamber of secrets (chamber of secrets is plural, the King of Serpents is only one think and I do not think that the statue is a fine example of statuary art). The Potters for example, nothing is said toward their Properties and Entitlements and yet they are the successors of the Peverells and a daughter of the Ancient and Noble House of Black married into the family and I do not think the Blacks married poor families without status near or equal to them.

There is one think that is suspicious to me is the absence of a reading of the Potters Succession, even if there was not a Last Will and Testament, an meeting that describes the Potters Estate must be held because Harry Vault has been prearranged by his parents it can only be a Trust Vault they have installed for his childhood with or without them but what of their Estate personal to them and to the family ? And what of the House of Godric Hollow, the ministry transformed it into a monument but what about compensation towards the Potter Estate ? How Dumbledore had Harry Key and How it has fallen to him to decide where Harry would be going ?
