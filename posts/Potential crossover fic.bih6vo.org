:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have been looking for this for ages

1) Harry works in a zoo 2) He is known as an old soul 3) His mate is a shape shifter 4) Harry is known as the oldest soul, his first life was as a creature that was known as an "angel" warrior. I believe this happened in the Aztec times. 5) He was alive when the first vampire was created and this vampire had a grudge against him 6) He is involved in another prophecy where he refuses to fight anymore 7) He had a past life where he was a samurai and has a katana? 8) He has wings that manifest in times of need such as when he fell of a bridge??

Those are some points that I can remember, theres more but I think I've got the gist of it. If anyone can help me I'd be very grateful!

EDIT: I've found the fic I was looking for, if you're interested then theres a link in the comments. I recommend reading it!


** This sounds epic! If you find it, let me know. I hope the writing can back it up. :-)

** I remember reading a fic a really long time ago that hits a few of those points. Don't really remember much else about the actual plot, so I'm not sure about some of them. Could it be linkffn(4163392)?

*** linkffn(4163392) ? You're the first person to recognise some part of it at least! Yeah it has been a decent amount of years since I read it. Hopefully it hasn't been deleted...

** If i understood correctly: you are searching for a specific fic that you read but can't find anymore. If that's the case then your title is really misleading, it should've been something along the lines: "Searching for a fic where Harry had previous lives and is known as the oldest soul" or something like that incorporating the most important fact you remember from the fic.

***** Sure, agreed. I'm just arguing that the title isn't misleading. It just doesn't include the more pertinent information.
