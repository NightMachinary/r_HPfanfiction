A look at Mad eye in his prime, or whatever made Madam Bones worthy of her station, or Kinglsey, or whatever. A look at competent wizards approaching the nasties in a professional, balls-to-the-wall way. Does this stuff exist, and do you splendid people know of any good examples?

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.

** A little off topic, but the Dresden Files is a book series about pretty much that. Detective-wizard noir set in Chicago.

*** Yes. I read it ages ago. There was a fairly good fic where Harry drops into that world and bonds with the Queen of the fairies or something. Sadly not complete.
