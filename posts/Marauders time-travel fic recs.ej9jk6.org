Does anyone have any recommendations for a fanfic which the marauders are the time-travellers? Preferably long and well-written. I've read a few in the past but they were very childish and did not have good character rendition.

If you don't know anything like this, do you have any good "(character name) goes back to the marauder era" fics?


** Linkffn(the bureaucratic error by iniga) is my favorite fic, almost purely because of the characterization.

Remus is the time traveler here but it's back to the events of PoA and an AU from there.

Ongoing, but the author updates reliably weekly. (Though it's been on a brief break for the holidays!)

** I wish i had something to fit the first request - following to see what others have read. For the latter, I just read the (unfinished) Turning of the Times by noaacat, and thought it was great, but frustrating: the author has a finished version of it, but hasn't updated for a lack of a good beta. The writing is better than the 90% of fics, regardless. Harry goes back in time here, and things don't go well for him.

  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.
