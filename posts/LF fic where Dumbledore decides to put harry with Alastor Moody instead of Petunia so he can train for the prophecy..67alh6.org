  A chance remark on the night of Halloween 1981 could have changed everything. Fate throws baby Harry into the custody of Kingsley Shacklebolt, assisted by a certain Mad-Eye Moody. And oh boy, heads will roll and history will change when this gets out. Dear Wizarding Britain: Your saviour has arrived. ON HIATUS.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

** Dumbledore was a smile old man who was afraid of 'marked as equal'. A powerful Harry Potter, equal to dark Lord might be the next dark Lord.

Tom Riddle and Dumbledore's failure with him strick deep. He was a staunch believer of 'needs of many supercedes need of of one'.

He might not be evil, but he sure was cunning. And you don't train someone who is prophesied to be 'equal' to most feared 'Dark Lord' of century.

BTW a Harry trained under Moody will screw Hogwart's staff and Dumbledore 100 times for their 'not so' secure protection around stone and his paranoia will make him conclude that a bigger game is going on around his life.

I will happily read if someone has fic that features this. Else I don't want to read rehash of same gullible Harry who jumps into everything, doesn't question and the only difference is that he knew few 1 year spells before coming to Hogwarts.
