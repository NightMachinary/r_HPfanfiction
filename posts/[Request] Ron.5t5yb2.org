As the title kind of says, I'd like your favorite Ron fics. I'd rather no bashing, and I'd prefer fics that, if they do feature pairs, keep it to canon, but beyond that, I'm cool with anything.

1st one is Choices, no pairing decided yet. In this fic Ron is a seer, he can see peoples future by touching them. This gets him sorted into Slytherin.

2 is Australia, canon compliant about Ron and Hermione going to Australia to get her parents back after the war.

3rd is sadly abandoned but I enjoyed it a lot. Ron goes to an alternate universe where Harry became a Slytherin. Worth a read if you can deal with it being Abandoned.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
