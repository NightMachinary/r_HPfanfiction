I liked reading Harry finding out he is a parselmouth because of his mother and not because of the horcrux. Examples would be The Merging by Shaydrall.


** Slight spoilers for linkffn(Harry Potter and The Prince Slytherin)

It's stated pretty early on in Harry's first year that both he and his twin are Parselmouth's through inheritance via Lily, though we don't know which family she's descended from yet

I see this, or a slight variation, on sooooooo many fics. It's a giant red flag at this point to turn back.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

***** It's because of the summary alone that I waited so long before reading it. Then it took forever to make it past the Prologue...

Honestly, the author is too big for his britches. Sure, there's a few twists (Lockhart was pretty cool) but I have yet to see an actual subversion of the tropes.

**** I think it's fantastic, yes it starts out with a lot of dumbledore bashing but the most recent chapter has really begun a redemption arc for dumbledore.

Overall though it tackles a lot of social issues and makes every character morally grey, the only evil character being umbridge and she gets hers

It's mostly fluff though if you want action there is next to none but it's such a good read

***** It's not really Dumbledore bashing. His motivations are believable and he has good qualities in addition to the bad. All in all, he's a well balanced character.

****** To me it was a bit of bashing, not in a bad way but to make Voldemort look like a better alternative. All of the other characters were willing to compromise some but dumbledore was still trying to manipulate harry and using the prophecy to justify any bad decisions. Also how he treats Snape was pretty bad. It was a lot better done than some of the fics where he is just straight up evil, but imo still bashing because it made him so incompetent and against Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
