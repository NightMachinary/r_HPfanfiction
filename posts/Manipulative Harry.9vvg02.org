So I'm kinda new to Harry Potter fanfiction and recently read Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches which I very much enjoyed. The only other fanfiction I enjoyed was the Warlock of Slytherin which was unfortunately dropped it seems. What I'm basically looking for a fanfiction where Harry is:

- Harry is manipulative and smart.
- He's somewhat dark. Probably in Slytherin.
- NO SLASH which seems to be rampant in HP fanfiction.
- Harem will be nice, but considering as it tends to be less than good in quality it's not a must but if there's anything on the level of DPaSW then of course introduce it to me please.
- Long works. I don't want works with less than 100-150k words, preferably something that's either completed or being updated.
- Bashing is fine as long as it's not every other sentence.
- Quality, obviously.
- Time Traveling back with knowledge and power is would be nice. Maybe even he was in Azkaban for w/e reason.
- WBWL also would be nice.

** I think HP and the Prince of Slytherin fits most of your criteria as well.

** Linkffn(Seventh Horcrux)

It's recommended all the time, but since you're new to fan fiction I'll assume you haven't read it yet. It's considered a crack fic, so it's supposed to be taken lightly. Very funny throughout, but very well written. Harry could definitely be considered manipulative in this one.

** I loved linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic]]). This should count as a bit dark and manipulative.

** You might enjoy Harry Potter and the Methods Of Rationality - there's a subplot where Harry is manipulating Malfoy into being a better person. It's well-written, not much bashing, and strikes what I thought was a good balance between Harry being intelligent, capable, and slightly evil, and Harry being eleven years old. There's no slash - in fact there's no shipping at all, because the main cast is 11. It's quite long, and completed last year or so. It also has possibly the best Moody backstory I've ever read.

(It also has a pretty vocal hatedom, so if this comment ends up at -50 with a long chain of angry replies, that's why.)

*** the main cast is 11? are you telling me that massive book doesn't even enter second year WTF!? maybe thats why i dropped it in the past

- Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone: 76,944 words.

- Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: 85,141 words.

- Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: 107,253 words.

- Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: 190,637 words.

- Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix: 257,045 words.

- Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: 168,923 words.

- Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: 198,227 words.

that should be a bit above average word count for each year double that is pointlessly extenting your word count with filler

** I wouldn't say slash is rampant unless you go on Ao3. My favorite fic that isn't recommended all the time is linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle). I don't understand any of the music references but it is great. They are a trilogy. Harry finds out he has been betrayed by the Weasleys and runs away with Bill since he is already going out of the country for the summer. It is a rare case of Weasley betrayal without much (if any) bashing that I can remember.

Edit: I don't know how to read. For dark Harry I recommend linkffn(antithesis)

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay
