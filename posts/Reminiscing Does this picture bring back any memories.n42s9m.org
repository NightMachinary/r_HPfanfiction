I went looking through some very old backups today and found some old fics, from back in the day when people actually saved webpages to read because on dial-up every minute was a few cents and you had to get off the phone line.

Ah, 2005. What a watershed year. We had gone through 2 years of /Order of the Phoenix/ and teenage angst stuff, and it was sinking in that the stakes were ratcheting up. Then came /Half Blood Prince/, where some ships sailed, some sank, there was betrayal, death, and the final quest at hand, plus an awareness that the penultimate was past, and This Was Very Nearly IT.

Like fire through the forums the fan wars spread. Everyone was gobsmacked by the revelations in HBP and everyone had their opinions and theories. Is H/G H/R the right set of pairings? Is Snape good or bad? What are the Horcruxes? And the heated arguments sparked furious competition in fics 'proving' one point or the other.

To this day, I am surprised how very /accurate/ some of the predictions turned out. Between them quite a few FF authors got the major beats down; the fall of the Ministry, the correct list of Horcruxes down to the 7th, the secret Snape/Lily relationship. Some even speculated the Ravenclaw and Slytherin ghosts would be key to the quest; what a crazy hit that was.

Good times...


** I learned English under that banner, sitting at my mom's stationary with four thicc dictionaries. Bless her soul, she really encouraged it too because of how studious I looked while reading... Well. Good times indeed.

** Oh yes. I can't believe it's been that long. I barely feel like I'm the same person anymore, despite being in the same fandom. It's incredible that the Harry Potter fandom is still going strong after all this time.
