I have already read:

Nightmare from future's past

That fic where Hermione goes back in time, falls in love with James Potter and takes care of baby Harry.

That fic where Harry discovers Dumbledore and his parents lied to him about their death, goes back in time and gets sorted to Slytherin.

That fic where Remus sends Hermione back in the marauders' era where Hermione was called Mia or something.

Anything else that is good?

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

** [EDIT: BOT somehow doesn't work with one of the fics below, use direct links then]

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]]*, linkffn(4101650): many say it's the gold standard for time travel fics, which I agree. The writing, characterization, and some of the plot are absolutely brilliant. But several parts of its plot irk me.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]*, linkffn(5511855): Harry was thrown back to 1975 and had to team up with Bellatrix. The story is creative, credible, funny, and contains tons of intrigues. It's also refreshing to see what a sane, non-evil Bellatrix could accomplish. I prefer this one over *Backward with Purpose*.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]]*, linkffn(7405516): to be honest, that story is not very well written as it contains quite a few typos and grammar errors, but is one of my 'guilty pleasure' fics. I just love the way the Trio and a 5 day old Rose handled their unexpected time travel back to 1991. They finished off Voldemort in almost record time (only one fic had it done quicker), without any angst and all those 'must keep timeline' nonsense.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]]*, linkffn(4740107): This is the only completed 'Ginny went back alone' fic. She got rid of Voldemort quite efficiently, but had more trouble with her own love life.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]]*, linkffn(10687059): is mostly from Hermione's POV on a time-traveling Harry, and how she came to terms with what Harry did.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List][The Evil Overlord List]]*, linkffn(10972919): someone died in the 2010s, turned up in young Tom Riddle's head as Jerry (Harry?), and started guiding him towards world domination.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]]*, linkffn(8581093): One of the best Hermione in Marauder era fics.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]]*, linkffn(10871795): A great story showing how 'Hermione traveling back to Marauder Era should have worked'.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The-Moment-It-Began][The Moment It Began]]*, linkffn(3735743): Snape's second chance with Lily.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6548167/1/His-Greatest-Wish][His Greatest Wish]]*, linkffn(6548167): Another Snape/Lily story, with heavy James Potter bashing though.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]]*, linkffn(4536005): is imho the most hilarious time travel fic.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]]*, linkffn(4655545): the brutal war turned Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan into very disturbed people. When Hermione found a way to send their memories and powers back 20 years, they went on a rampage. Lots of dark humors.

** The Unforgiving Minute by VotN is a novella where Harry returns from the future and has 24 hours to destroy Voldemort.

Wastelands of Time by Joe Ducie, with the caveat that it's only technically a HP fic. Still, great book.

**** Looking over those chapters I can see what you mean, however, they were the prologue (assuming you don't skip prologues like I do) and the last chapter and in my experience, those things are rarely ever good. Also, English I'm pretty sure is the author's second language so I tend to give people breaks on that. You really fall in love with the characters and their struggles and it's one of the few time travel Tomione fics that doesn't ruin Tom's character.

I have some oneshots that you may enjoy. linkffn(5492188) Doubting Thomas Luna goes back in time and raises Tom Riddle as her son.

***** Thanks for the second rec! I'll check it out!

#+begin_quote
  Also, English I'm pretty sure is the author's second language so I tend to give people breaks on that.
#+end_quote

For future reference it would probably be better to state that a fic is "well told" (or is well-developed, decently written, has great characterization, etc) as opposed to "well written" since "well written" implies that the author has an exceptionally good grasp on the featured written language. :)

Once again, thanks for the second rec! I'm checking it out now! I never considered LV/HG as a pairing before (I've only ever shipped LV with HP) so I'm excited to find something good to read!

She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.
