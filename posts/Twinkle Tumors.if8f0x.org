Dumbledore's ubiquitous twinkle in the eye is actually caused by a rare form of magical cancer that is slowly crystallizing his eyes, starting with the corneas.


** What, like magical super glaucoma?

** No, I don't think that would be so. In St. Mungo's, there was no place for mundane diseases, meaning these are automatically taken care of by the magic in one's body. But that's my opinion, if I am allowed to have one.

Good day/night. :D

**** Well then, Dumbledore becomes blind. Then two days later starts doing everything normally.

Harry: "Dumbledore sir, How did you do it?"

*** Wrong. Given that wizards still die of old age, they are not immune against mundane illnesses such as overall degeneration of cells/degeneration of their replicative ability. They might be disease resistant and can, occasionally, resist blunt force due to accidental magic (Neville when yeeted out of the window), but given wizards still break bones and die of old age, they are not immune against the mundane.

**** Sorry, perhaps you misinterpreted me. I meant to say that even though they suffer from mundane diseases, their magic supports their body enough that it may cure the disease in their body automatically after some time. That is to say, they have a 100% 'recovery' rate from mundane diseases.

So, I did not mean immune but efficient against mundane diseases, you may say.

Good day/night. :D

  There was a more sinister reason for Hero's short temper in fifth year than adolescence and excess stress. When she has a seizure while gardening outside no. 4 Privet Drive, in full view of the neighbors, the Dursleys have no choice but to take her to a doctor. The devastating news will affect all that is to come.

***** The first few chapters of this kind of read like a self-insertion fic for cancer awareness, like maybe the author or someone they knew died from inoperable cancer. I read something similar a while back where Hermione had leukemia and left the Wizarding World.

It just left me wondering a bunch of stuff which has probably already been covered before, like are Dragon pox and spattergroit The Wizarding equivalent of cancer and such. That's probably been discussed Ad nauseam in this sub.
