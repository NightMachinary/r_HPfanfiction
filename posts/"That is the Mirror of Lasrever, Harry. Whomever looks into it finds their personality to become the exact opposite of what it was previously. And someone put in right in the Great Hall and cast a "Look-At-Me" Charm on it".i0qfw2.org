** -I'm seriously considering making this into a one-shot-

Pandemonium erupted in the Great Hall at dinner. Why, you might ask? Before I explain what the fuck happened, let's go back to one or two hours ago. Gred and Feorge had certainly not skipped History of Magic in favour of plotting one of their devious schemes to push the Professors to the brink of insanity, when they came across a mirror not unlike the one Harry Potter had encountered in his first year at Hogwarts.

“Gred!”

“Feorge!”

“Why is there-“

“A mirror here?“

They both looked at their reflections and were almost knocked off their feet by a strange dizziness that overcame them. When they looked at each other again, their desire for torturing the teachers into residents of St. Mungos via chaos had disappeared, only to be replaced by a yearning for discipline and abode rules.

“Why are we not in class, George?”

“No idea, Fredrick. We have to head back and apologise right away!”

They both marched off back to History, in a fashion that could have bought Percy to his knees. The entirety of their class was appalled at Fred and George's actions, including Binns, who up until now has been thought to be unaware of the twins' antics. One could see Lee Jordan, at the back of the class, gaping like a fish and stuttering until his poor brain couldn't take it anymore and needed to be taken to the infirmary.

After a period of undetermined time in the wake of the twins' bizarre change, Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle we're walking to their Potions class when they too stumbled across this miraculous mirror. Malfoy took in his appearance and struck a pose, and thinking he looked like a movie star when he in fact looked like a blonde troll, stumbled when the wave of dizziness hit him.

He emerged from his near fall a new man, I mean teen, with a newfound slice of humble pie shoved down his throat. His pose relaxed, no longer looking so arrogant, but now so much more intelligence put in. Crabbe and Goyle got a glimpse of their reflections too, and they both turned on Malfoy, demanding that he help bring their bags or they'll punch him into oblivion. Malfoy soundlessly obliged.

Shortly after Malfoy left, Percy trotted along, pompous personality showing all the way. He spotted the mirror and declared with an exaggerated accent, “This will simply not do! A mirror in the middle of a school corridor! When I find out whose this is, I'm going to pack all the punishments I can find on them with trumped-up charges!” He strutted in front of the mirror, admiring himself despite his proclaimed grudge against it, and lost his footing, crashing to the ground. He jumped back up almost immediately, as if there was a spring in his shoes, and a twinkle of mischief in his eyes. He considered the mirror in front of him, and the start of a perfect prank sparked in his head. He wanted a prank so great the untransformed twins would worship him in all his glory. He took the mirror, and dragged it downstairs after disillusioning it.

The Great Hall was full of chatter from the students having dinner. A disillusioned Percy rolled the mirror into the middle of the Hall, lifted the charm off the mirror and added a look-at-me charm on it. The Hall suddenly went quiet while Dumbledore paled. A few brave and curious Gryffindors went up to the mirror, stumbled, and walked back to the table seemingly unaffected. Those Gryffindors were Hermione Granger, Harry Potter, and Ron Weasley. Percy was chuckling all the way, but when his housemates gave him weird looks, he ignored them.

Those who were sitting at the head table were muttering among themselves. Finally, Severus Snape was the one who walked up to the mirror. He almost slipped, and to everyone's surprise and awe, he broke into a face-splitting smile. He waved at the four stunned house tables. “Hey! Those who want extra tutoring lessons and free candy, come to the dungeon and we can discuss the time! Don't deny it,” He said when squawks of shock came from the students, “I know some of you are lagging behind!” He then walked away, humming a muggle song whilst summoning one of Albus Dumbledore's lemon drops and eating it.

The whole hall broke out of its stupor, conversations starting here and there with a whole lot of laughter. The whole head table was chattering while they walked toward the mirror. Not long after, Dumbledore was sprouting out secrets, despising lemon drops, and holding aphis wand the wrong way; Minvera McGonagall was smiling at everyone she passed and joking; Filius Flitwick was shooting dark looks at anybody who looked at him; Argus Flitch kicked away his cat and cleaned the floor while humming an upbeat tune. Pandemonium erupted in the Great Hall.

Everyone wanted a look at the mirror that was the reason the teachers went insane, being the doilems they were. Here is what happened after.

Draco gulped.

“Uh, guys... I don't think you should touch that...”

Goyle and Crabbe retorted.

“Don't you dare order us around, scum. We're the bosses now, Malfoy.”

“Ok.”

Harry was sitting at the table, enjoying the show.

“Huh. Insanity mirror. Serves them right. I can't care less.”

Hermione was observing without interest.

“I don't see the appeal.”

Ron... well, he had disappeared off to the library to see what mirror that was.

Snape, meanwhile, was dancing and handing out candy to students at the same time.

“Here's some candy for trying your best in Potions this afternoon, Neville!”

Neville Longbottom was looking at the candy with distaste.

“Why are you giving me candy? You are a fucker that favours Slytherins over other students and a biased teacher that holds stupid grudges against a dead man's son!”

“Oh.”

Snape patted Neville's back.

“Don't worry, son. The past's the past! That reminds me. You're not doing that great in Potions. Let's go down to the dungeon for some make-up classes!”

He then happily dragged Neville, who had a horrified expression on, down to the Potions Lab. The night dragged on, and when the whole hall hade been personality-reversed, the mirror lay forgotten. Life went on as usual, but with mixed up roles. Luckily for them, the reversal only lasted for a week, and the memories of the reversal stayed intact.

Snape was horrified at what he was wearing when his personality came back first. A neon green and silver robe dressed him, making him look like a Christmas tree ornament more than anything else. He instantly transfigured his robes back into black, with sniggers coming from his class.

The twins noticed their stride, and abruptly stopped in the middle of a corridor.

“What the hell-“

“Just happened?”

They glanced at each other with matching horror, and swore to prank everyone as hard as they can to make up for their pompous attitude and prankless week.

Harry's and Dumbledore's reversal came at the same time. He instantly asked to see Dumbledore at lunch. The door opened.

“Alright. What the hell happened this week?” Dumbledore looked up wearily from his pitch-black robes and trashed lemon drops. They filled up his entire trash can.

“That mirror we all looked into is the Mirror of Lasrever, Harry. Whomever looks into it finds their personality become the exact opposite of it previously. And somebody put it right in the middle of the Great Hall and cast a Look-At-Me charm onto it!”

“And do you know who did it?”

“Nope. Absolutely no idea.”

“Fuck.”

Percy was recovering from what he had done when his personality had been reversed, and he was not going to reveal this secret for a very, very long time.

“Fuck my life. If Fred and George find out that I wanted to worship them, I'm dead. Shit.”

** "Why in the world would anyone do that, Luna?"

The normally willowy and distractable witch focused her gaze on Harry in a way that gave him a shiver. Then her face softened.

She said, "It seemed like a nice idea at the time, since most everyone I've met here has been mean to me."
