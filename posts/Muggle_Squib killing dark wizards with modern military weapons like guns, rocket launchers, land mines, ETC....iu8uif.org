I would greatly appreciate it if anyone knows of any Harry Potter fanfiction with a main character who employs similar tactics to Emiya Kiritsugu (the magus killer) from Fate/Zero for dealing with his/her targets.

Edit: Thank you for all the comments!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978): UK military and allied wizards shot up Death Eaters, Umbridge Ministry, and Voldemort. The Trio helped out with Horcruxes.

--------------

[[/r/WritingPrompts][r/WritingPrompts]] had something [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/cfsvss/eu_vodemort_and_the_death_eaters_have_conquered/][like that]] from time to time, and [[/u/Xavier_Elrose][u/Xavier_Elrose]] wrote a quite nice scene:

#+begin_quote
  "Wave is off, telemetry looks good across the board."

  Magic, it seemed, could cause technology to fail. Certain 'clever' wizards from a particularly nasty faction bent on destroying nonmagical humans- "Moogles", apparently, though I could not have guessed where they got that name from- had though that if they disabled technology, us "moogles" wouldn't be able to fight back.

  "Got a blip in the wave, passing on the coordinates to targeting."

  Wizards, it seemed, could be really stupid.

  "Satellite 37-61 will be in position in three minutes. Impact in six."

  Wizards, apparently, had been more or less stuck about four or five hundred years in the past since...well, since.

  "Rods away. Impact in three."

  It did not exactly make for a balanced war, if one side had magic, and the other had to rely on fallible technology. No, it wasn't fair in the least.

  "Impact in 30 seconds, found another blip. Forwarding coordinates to targeting."

  Because relying on magic apparently meant never learning to think. It wasn't much harder to track technology failing than it was to track it succeeding, which meant these 'clever' wizards had very helpfully painted giant targets on anything and everything they considered important enough to protect. And while shutting off technology did limit our potential strike options...

  It wasn't as though we suffered from any lack of solutions.

  I watched as the screen showed a satellite view of a secluded moor turning into a violent hellscape in an instant, as titanium rods dropped from space annihilated whatever installation these "Death Feeders" had there.

  The lack of boots on the ground was frustrating, as far as gathering intelligence on our foes, but they had seemed entirely incapable of actually coming up with clever ideas that might actually work. There had been a few high level people getting offed by teleporting assassins, early on, but the liberal coverage of their movements by hidden snipers killed a bunch of wizards, and dissuaded the rest.

  In a frustrating failure of intelligence, it sounded conceivable that the snipers had actually gotten all of our opponents, that the orbital bombardment was a waste of time. We didn't have firm numbers, but it sounded like our foes numbered in the hundreds, at the most.

  Still, as a wise man once said: "There is no overkill. There is only 'Open fire' and 'I need to reload.'"

  "Satellite 24-15 will be in position over the next target in two minutes. Impact in five."

  The operation carried on.

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

** linkffn(10595005), Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution by Starfox5. Post Voldermort defeat, the pureblood attempt to force marriages. The halfblood and muggleborn refuse to roll over, joined forces with the Muggle government, defeated and replaced the Ministry of Magic, then face attack from pureblood government in other countries. Pretty much a class warfare fic.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

  We've been fighting this war for a long time. Muggles, they call us. They struck first. England fell. Then France. Spain. Italy. It took us ten years of tactical withdrawals and air strikes to stop their advance. Now it was our turn to push back.
