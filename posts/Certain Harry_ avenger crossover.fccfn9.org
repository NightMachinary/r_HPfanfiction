In the story Harry gets with Sif and has kids. Also Harry becomes the Seider representative to Asgard. I'm pretty sure Harry was turned into an asgardian as well.


** Was it really long and were the first several hundred thousand words pretty much solely an HP fic expect for the temporary presence of Bruce Banner?

***** I checked it out and it's not the one I was thinking of. Although for all I know what I'm thinking could be the combination of a bunch of other fanfics.

****** Well if you do read it I personally found it only worth reading up until the HP arc ends. I mean the Avengers arc is good, but the story hasn't been updated in a long time, and it drags like a Motherfucker. It's good but way too long, and the ending if the HP arc is a satisfying enough ending for me.
