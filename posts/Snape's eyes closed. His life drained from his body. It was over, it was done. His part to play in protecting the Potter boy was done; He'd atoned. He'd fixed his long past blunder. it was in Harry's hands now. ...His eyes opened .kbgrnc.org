Lily was pissed.

"HOW DARE YOU TREAT MY SON THAT WAY!"

TL;DR - When Snape dies, he wakes up in the afterlife only to come face to face with a very angry Lily Potter, who won't stand for his flimsy excuses and misplaced motives and has no trouble letting him know what she really thought of the last years of his life.

The Moment It Began is above kind of fic. I'm not looking for that. I'm looking for one where he is berated for his mistakes like this prompt but then sent back in time anyways.

I know it probably doesn't exist right now. As people who write prompts like this will probably never write a Snape Peggy-sue. Nor vice-a-versa.

***** I've always wanted to see a scenario with a typical Peggy Sue Snape endgame (but without necessarily including the do-over itself) from Lily's pov, exploring why she'd even be at peace with such a scenario in first place, despite the typical implications this leads to for this new universe. Whenever I read those fics, I always imagined that the magic/whatever that allowed it required a joint intervention between Dumbledore and everyone else close to him at that point in time (e.g. Eileen, Lily, Dumbledore, possibly others).

****** Do you mean a scenario where Lily sends Snape back in time?

It can work if you change the outcome of the Battle at Hogwarts. Have the order lose or win at the cost of Harry's life. And since it's Lily who is sending him back, she can send him to the day he heard the prophecy.

Lily of the past is already married to James at this point and is pregnant with Harry. The war notwithstanding, she can lead her sort of happy family life and Snape is free of the guilt of having caused her death. They defeat Voldemort with the help of his foreknowledge. And live happily ever after. Separately.

**** I mean, what happens after events of this prompt?

Does Snape spend eternity in afterlife ruing the day he decided to take out his frustrations about James and co. on Harry?

And as established by the prompt, Dead can see what goes on in the land of the living. How does Lily react to the fact that her son, on whose behalf she is mad at Snape, is calling him a Hero, names his son, her grandson after Severus? What happens when Harry himself comes to afterlife and sees that his mother is still holding grudges on his behalf, for issues that he clearly doesn't give a shit about?

From story telling perspective, pointing out a character's mistakes and flaws, then leaving him/her with no avenues to make amends or rectify the mistakes is just hate masturbation. It is boring. You pointed out his flaws? Great. Now let him do something about that.

***** As the poster, I would just like to say I posted this only with the idea of One-Shots in mind, also I tried to keep it as vague as possible for a starting point. I do not intend it to solely be for bashing.

â€‹

However I will say, it absolute does need to be done first, cause Snape never suffered comeuppeance for his actions against Harry. Oh sure, he died but he died for Albus and Lily, he died to make up for the things he did as a Death Eater. he 'protects' Harry to do that.

â€‹

But the thing I hate possibly most about the ending of the series is there is no actual resolution to Snape and /Harry's/ relationship. He never gets comeuppance for specifically that and if he is to be dealt with that is the first thing that must be attacked.

â€‹

Cause as it is in canon their relationship is just:

"I hate you"

"I don't know you"

"I hate you"

"I hate you too"

"I hate you because I hate your father"

"I hate you and my dads great"

"I hate your father and you. Your dad isn't great."

"My dad isn't great but I still hate you even though I have to trust you, which i don't"

"I hate you"

"I hate you and I hate you more, you betrayer"

"I hate you - Sike, I wanted to bang your mum,"

"I'm going to name my son after you, despite you being a colossal creep and asshole."

â€‹

The end.

****** I like the general idea of this prompt. But I just can't help but dislike afterlife one-shots. While normal one-shots can spawn new takes on the base idea and go down different paths, afterlife one shots seem final. Like whatever conclusion is reached at the end of an afterlife one shot will stay that way until the heat death of the universe. I like a bit back and forth.

And this is my opinion, but any resolution to Snape-vs-Harry, Snape-vs-Neville should happen in the land of the living. Have Snape survive Nagini and face Harry/Neville as the adults they are. They've fought in a war with people who were trying to kill them. They can handle their asshole teacher. They don't need their mothers confronting Big Bad Snape.

Because while he did good in the end and she is grateful for it, he was never as good as she made herself believe when they were friends and he could never live up to what she thought him to be. So she isn't ready to offer her friendship again, because in the end his best, was so much worst than what she had believed him to be and it wouldn't be fair to either of them.

After Lily finished, the Longbottoms arrived in afterlife. And boy, they weren't happy to see Snape either. Snape slowly began to regret ever opening his eyes in afterlife when the usually friendly Alice Longbottom suddenly had a resemblance with a fire breathing horntail.
