I decided to read Vox Corporis, but I saw somewhere that there was an explicit version of the story posted somewhere where it was deleted and that the one on ff.net is in some was censored. Is this true and, if it is, does anyone know where I can find a complete version?


** I've never heard anything about an explicit version. There are, however, additional stories written by different authors that expand on the ending of Vox Corporis.

** There was one. Used to be on port key, but it got taken down. You may be able to find a PDF of it somewhere
