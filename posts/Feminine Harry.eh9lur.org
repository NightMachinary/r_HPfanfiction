Anyone have a fic that has a feminine Harry who embraces that?

No slash please. I understand that heavily restricts it but I'd prefer that.


** While being gay is not a prerequisite to being feminine in real life, there's very little point in using a male character's femininity as a plot device that doesn't, at least, shake hands with slash.

That in mind...

**** Sure. It doesn't. If it's not a plot device, though, it's a rather strong position to give a character for no reason. Not that that means you /can't/, just that it limits the chance that someone's decided to write about it.

** In the Fate/HP Xover series Fate's Gamble Harry is blood adopted and his looks change to be very androgynous and feminine, to the point where he is mistaken as a girl, but he is still very much a straight male, he's just comfortable with his looks.

*** Could you link it?

Is there a quick summary of Fate that I can read to understand it or does it explain itself?

It's not unintelligible without prior knowledge of Fate, but some things are skimmed over. Use the wiki as an aid if you are confused. If you care about spoilers for Fate then I wouldn't recommend it as it heavily spoils Fate Stay Night and Fate Zero and mildly spoils a fair number of other works... Not sure I would recommend it to someone without prior knowledge of Fate, but I did enjoy it quite a bit myself.

It's an OP Harry btw.

** By feminine I'm assuming you don't just mean female Harry but feminine acting/looking/crossdressing or some combination of the three?
