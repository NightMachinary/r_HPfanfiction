It's one that I read YEARS ago when I first started the genre and it follows each characters death (from what I remember) to their eternal reward.

The only chapter I can remember somewhat clearly is the one for Hedwig. She's flying through a bright blue sky and there are no more letters to deliver.

Did I imagine this fic? Am I going crazy? I can't find it on ff.net or any of the other normal sites and this has been bugging me for the past week.

*edit: I realize that's not much to go on at all, but given the vast level of knowledge for the fandom contained here I figured it was worth a shot.


** That's this one.

*** You are AWESOME!

Also, I read through that again and apparently it's a little dusty in my office.

I don't know if I'll ever forgive her for killing Hedwig and Dobby :(
