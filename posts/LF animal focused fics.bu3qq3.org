I recently read a timetravel fic with Harry and Newt scamander, and am now looking for fics where Harry works with animals, the more focus on the interactions between Harry and the animals the better. Prefer no slash, and the longer the better :) (Harry beeing a dragon/beast tamer, -taming/making friends with wild beasts are the best ;) )
