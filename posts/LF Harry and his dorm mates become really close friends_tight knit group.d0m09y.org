Just read a WIP that's unlikely to ever be finished about Harry, Dean, Seamus, and Neville going to an amusement park and bonding and deciding to do it every year, and got pictures of themselves on the rides to put up in the dorm.\\
I'm looking for something similar, to them bonding, becoming friends, and generally having each others backs. It doesn't have to be through amusement parks, or anything, just want them to stick together. Pretty sure the WIP was building up for a Ron is following Dumbledore's orders and keeping everyone else away from Harry, which isn't really what I'm here for, I'd like if he was included in the bonding and friendship, but if there's fics with the others I would still be happy to take it. Just want friends and bros.


** Two distantly related stories came to my mind:

- linkffn(Lion Unity by Fruitality) ... not only Harry's dorm mates, but whole Gryffindor colleague starts to bond together (unfortunately, it is still unfinished)
- linkao3(Summer of '97 by Northumbrian) ... this is more date between two very different persons, but it is so lovely and sweet; besides, I like very much stories which are breaking out from the stalled environment of Hogwarts, Ministry, inside of some wizarding home.

** Gryffindors Never Die by chipmonkonspeed has a lot of bonding between Harry and his dorm mates, and in some chapters is even the main plot. Ron isn't bashed either, has shown very positively. It's also complete!

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD. DISCONTINUED

  In which the Sorting is less of a choice between Dark and Light and more of a fashion statement, Gryffindors are more than reckless, bumbling fools, and Slytherins aren't the only ones playing politics.Because you didn't actually believe that life is so straightforward as to be defined solely by the colour of a tie, did you? Hidden in plain sight, in the one house they least expected, Harry Potter becomes what he was always meant to be. Hogwarts beware, the Dark Lord's equal is rising!

Am on my phone so no fancy link, but it was recommended in the Harry doesn't return to the Dursleys request earlier. Features Harry is richest wizard alive+a clothes shopping spree. But I did like him making friends.
