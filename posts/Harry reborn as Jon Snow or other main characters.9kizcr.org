Looking for stories where Harry is reborn as the main character in another fandom. I've read ones where he's just dropped in or takes an OC persona, but really want one where he actually is Jon Snow. Also, prefer he has no wand or easy access to his original magic.


** Having read a lot of HP and ASOIAF fanfiction as well as the main crossover fics, I don't think that particular kind of fic exists right now.

****** There's an abandoned fic "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283][the black prince]]" where he is the trueborn son of Robert. It is well written and Harry is very limited in his magical abilities. It's worth a read even if it's probably going to remain unfinished.
