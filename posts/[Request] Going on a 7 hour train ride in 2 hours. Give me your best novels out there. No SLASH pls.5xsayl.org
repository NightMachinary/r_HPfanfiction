** Mm, let me pull out my 'fics to read' list.

--------------

For Harry Potter fics, I'd recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel][all of White Squirrel's work]].

I'd also recommend Weasley Girl and its sequel-in-slow-progress: linkffn(8202739)

I'm also currently re-reading Barefoot, it's still in progress but regularly updated: linkffn(11364705)

And, there are the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][various Boy With A Scar one-shots]]; though they largely rehash canon, they have a few original bits and they're overall heartwarming to read, from what I've seen so far. Ignore the adult content warning, I haven't encountered anything really offensive yet.

And, I suppose, you can just read the original books, too. Google an online copy if you don't want to carry the paperbacks with you.

Oh, and, as for non-Harry-Potter fanfics, I'm a fan of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1927254/AntaresTheEighthPleiade][AntaresTheEighthPleiade]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2996114/Saphroneth][Saphroneth]]; The Warlock's Quickening, The King's Shadow, and Ashes of the Past in particular.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

** Black Bond is a decent fic that will easily take all 7 hours of the train ride, it's a long one though so you may not like it if that isn't your cup of tea...
