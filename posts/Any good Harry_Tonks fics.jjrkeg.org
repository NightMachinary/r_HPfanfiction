Any rating is fine, preferably complete and long, but any length is good.


** *Grain of Sand* is great, Highly rec

*Teddy's Excellent Adventure* for Time Traveling Kid getting adopted parent with birth parent.

Unfinished:\\
*Bodacious Bodyguard:* Tonks in disguise at Hogwarts as Harry's Bodyguard\\
*Rotfang Conspiracy:* Smutfic. Tonks characterization pretty good, but Harry's is a bit inconstant. A bit too much independent/super when he is moving the plot along.\\
*Family Matters*: Tonks is knocked out by her mother who takes her place in the final battle, thus she lives. Godfather falls for widowed mother. Lots of potential.

** The Merging by Shaydrall, was a good story IMO. Harry/Tonks is a good part of it. The story is well-written.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF

** Linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist) Sequel is a StarGate crossover which I think is as good despite having not watched StarGate. Several other multi fics are as good if not better but most are kinda smutty. Also a lot of crappy fluff fics etc. as you can expect.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror

***** To me, it was okay, I've seen better and I've seen worse fics in that category. If you want a good HP/Mass Affect story, Harry Potter: Geth is one I would highly recommend, along with a lot of the HP stories by that author.

But I think I enjoyed ItMoaS the most, followed by MatG, and Madness Affect the least in that trilogy.

****** I dont actually follow MA so I dont really have an interest in any other fics but thanks for the suggestion. I agree with the ordering. Although the second was good, the writing and plot of the original was far better.
