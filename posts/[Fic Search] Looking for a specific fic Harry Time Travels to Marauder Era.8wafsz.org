I'm looking for a fic where Harry time travels to the past to the marauders time at Hogwarts. He goes to inform Dumbledore of his presence, who then goes on to inform the Potters, James' parents who take Harry in and disguise it by saying he was a prodigy who was sent away as a child and calling him a 'family secret'. It then goes on to be a kinda super powered Harry fic where he saves the three Black sisters from controlling marriage contracts to known death eaters by duelling someone drugged by potions and then being selected as the representative for Britain for an international championship and he also goes to the yule ball with Bellatrix.

I remember a lot about the fic, just not it's name and I can't seem to find it for some reason, but that may just be me being dense...

Thanks for the help in advance!

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
