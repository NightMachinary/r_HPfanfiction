Okay so I've seen Hermione as a Ravenclaw (obviously), Hermione as a Gryffindor and as a Slytherin (to satisfy whatever edgy power couple wank the fandom has).

But Hermione as a Hufflepuff?

Okay so. Let's review Hufflepuff attributes.

-Hardworking. Does this even need explanation? The knowledge doesn't just magically appear in her brain. She relentlessly worked herself to the bone in third year. She doesn't let Ron or Harry blatantly copy her because she /values/ hard work.

-Loyalty. Hermione believes in following the rules. But she has broken them before. Why? Because her friends needed help.

I can't think of anything else at the moment but comment if you can add anything


** Another trait is "friendship". Hermione pre-Hogwarts had very little if any friends and could easily crave the company of people her age. If she valued friendship and craved it, that could tip her over into Hufflepuff.

** While a bit unrelated, this made me think of how uncommon it is for some of the common pairings to change in different directions.

I mean, I've read Slytherin!Harry with Slytherin!Hermione, as well as Gryffindor!Harry with Slytherin!Hermione, and Ravenclaw!Harry or Hufflepuff!Harry with Gryffindor!Hermione or Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff Hermione, but I don't think i've ever seen Slytherin!Hermione with a Hufflepuff!Harry or Ravenclaw!Harry.

Same goes with Ginny. If she ends up in Slytherin and romances Harry, Harry is either in Gryffindor or Slytherin.

I mean, you'd think you'd have a few things like "Harry/Daphne romance where they get put into Slytherin/Gryffindor respectively and have to confuse it out" or something. (I think I *may* have seen someone do a Draco/Harry one like that, but since I find the whole 'romance your bully' thing only slightly less creepy than 'romance your teacher', those stories get completely skipped)

**** The only ones I (even slightly) recall all fit the 'Harry becomes a minor character' mold.

Usually, Harry gets rescued early by *insert competent adult here*, and the story continues on about *competent adult* resolving issues, while a less burdened Harry goes to Hogwarts, and without the abuse and having some of his insecurities already solved (such as having some friends before coming to Hogwarts), clearly ends up in Hufflepuff.

And is usually a background character after that. I always took it as the author commenting on Harrys... lack of personality... that when you take away the plot driven stuff he doesn't fit where he was? I donno. I honestly can't think of one that was good enough to mention :P.

  Harry is kicked out by the Dursleys at the age of 8. A teenage boy with a large sword on his back named Jett finds him and takes him under his wing. From then on, Harry lives with a group of those who slipped through the cracks of society called the Street Knights. Their motto is: Loyalty to those who deserve it. What will Hogwarts be like for a Harry who has a very different background? Years complete: 1 and 2. Year in progress: 3

** Canon Hermione would go home. Or die via Troll.

- It's book1, she /knows/ better. Because she read it in some books.
- The hat isn't a person, so it's not an adult or a point of authority. Thus she will argue with it with impunity.
- She walked into Hogwarts with the houses already ranked:

  - Gryffindor (Dumbledore)
  - Ravenclaw (Knowledge)
  - Hufflepuff (Leftovers)
  - Slytherin (Dark Lords)

Hufflepuff would be very insulting to her. If she didn't go home immediately, she would alienate her house, and then everybody else. Which would lead to wanting to go home. Or death by troll.

*** I honestly find myself agreeing with this, the only reason she stuck around with Harry and Ron was because of Harry, she would hardly associate with Ron otherwise.

That's why I heartily agree in fics where Harry doesn't go through the very specific and coincidental chain of events before the sorting and as a result gets into another House(normally Slytherin because he wouldn't have all the prejudice), Ron and Hermione do not associate with each other.

In one of the most realistic ones Hermione get's into Ravenclaw and ends up bullied Luna style because she has poor social skills and shows up everyone else in her year at the classes.
