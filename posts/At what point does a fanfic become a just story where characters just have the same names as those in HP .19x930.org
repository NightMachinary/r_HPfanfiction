** It is quite similar to haystack definition problem: remove straws one by one, define moment when former haystack is something else.

Story where this happened, or at least is near this: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son]]

But I would define it as moment when simply changing characters name will allow normal story publication without risk of rabid lawyers running around you.

** Easy one is removing the magic, all of the "normal high school" fic are basically "insert-teen-school-drama" plot with HP characters, regardless of how many other plot points they try to include. It's like an HP episode of Degrassi.

Changing schools, especially if it is to an original school...I can think of one or two REALLY GOOD stories, where Harry moves to a different school and it barely pays lip service to the fact that he is Harry Potter...in fact in one of them he actually changes his name. The whole story could stand on its own by removing the HP portions.

Complete personality switch, especially for main characters or multiple characters.

*** I've never seen the appeal to remove magic, but its seems like a pretty big one because there are loads of fics with it removed. I'm pretty sure I read one where Harry and Draco were lawyers at rival firms, it sounded interesting but my god was it dull, story and writing

**** I want to be kind, and say that people write these kinds of stories because they are tired of reading a rehash of the magic events in HP's life, or they are trying to be "original". But those kinds of fic have been around as long as fanfiction.

** Most of the characters have established personalities, or at least the bare bones of one, based in canon. When the very basics of their personality are thrown out the window or ignored, it's just an OC with a shared name. Like, I personally like time travel Hermione/Sirius, but a major problem with the genre is Hermione's personality when in Marauder era. It tends to devolve into giggly teenage girl, which she is not.

Another way- lack of magic. There's no point. I understand AU and all, but seriously. The characters are magical, with a few Muggle/Squib/family exceptions.

Pairings that are ridiculous and far fetched, like Severus/Ron, can still be defended in an amazingly well written and developed plot. Anything can happen. But don't start a story where Snape and Ron are raising two gingers.
