I've always loved to read H/Hr, but i'm tired of seeing those fics where Harry and Hermione are both perfect, or Hermione is the most perfect woman to exist who can't make any mistakes (except spew of course, Harry has to lovingly explain that elfs love their enslavement). I'm looking for fics where they both have multiple flaws. Doesn't have to be focused on romance, i'm okay with it happening in the background.


** RemindMe! 3 days.

I'll try to look for one, but it's hard to find. linkffn(3787073). linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal by Lens of Sanity).

I'll try to find something. I suppose Patron by Starfox5 might count as well as Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution, but it generally falls under personality flaws, but she's always right.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Harry/Hermione eventually happens when they're both adults after a bunch of other relationships fail, Harry dates Ginny and Romilda for a while in Hogwarts while Hermione dates a muggle (she's expelled from Hogwarts and learns magic from Mundungus Fletcher).

They relationship is really difficult, especially after Hermione makes a mistake and Harry finds out that she was the thief he's hunting all along.

Harry, Ron, Hermione and Dumbledore are all competent and a bit more powerful than in canon, especially once they're adults and work as aurors or thieves and don't get bashed.

Voldemort is a little less powerful and gets defeated around the middle of the story since the war against him isn't the main plot.

Lucius Malfoy is really sneaky and despicable but quite competent, Draco a lot less competent but just as loathsome.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
