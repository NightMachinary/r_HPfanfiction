For those who don't know, Shadowrun is a tabletop roleplaying game set in a futuristic corporate dystopia where fantasy races and magic have come back to the world. Imagine if someone took Bladerunner and Lord of the Rings and slammed the two together until all the idealistic bits fell off and then they plugged up the holes with pieces from The Matrix and Neuromancer. Also, Dragons are a thing and one runs the biggest corporation in the world.

Are there any fics that capture this kind of thing? Doesn't have to be set in Shadowrun world precisely, but anything close in setting or tone would be cool. Corporate warfare, subterfuge and espionage, dystopian oppression, fantasy magic and cyberpunk tech co-existing, people eking out a living in the underworld of society, etc.

Also, Shadowrun has an amusingly ironic-yet-appropriate quote from a character named Harlequin: "It's a series of conspiracies, conflicting agendas and petty jealousies, all building upon, feeding upon, and excreting into an unending web of drek that people wade through every day and call it Life. If there was one Dark Lord controlling everything and we could drive a magic sword through his heart to free the world, that would be grand. Such clarity! Such focus! Alas."
