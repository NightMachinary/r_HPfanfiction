I recently read [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2004/10/28/dyou-really-think-theyre-suited-why-hermione-is-not-the-right-girl-for-harry/][this essay]] and I'd really like to read a story where Harry and Hermione get together written by someone who might have read this essay and taken it seriously. Is there anything like that out there?

I guess given the essay this might be a little harder, but I don't want to feel like bashing is involved. Like, their flaws should be within 20% of what they are in canon either direction.

I think [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]] is the closest. Hermione having an unrequited crush on Harry is compatible with canon, and Harry being put in a situation where Hermione's in more danger than he is would probably help reverse their dynamic where she gives and he takes.


** That essay seems strangely focused on the physical aspects of attraction, as if peoples physical attraction doesn't evolve with the relationship.

I think a large part of the issue with the lack of issues to work through in a h/hr relationship is that the 'easy' way to do this is to use misunderstanding/trust issues/"do you believe in me" plots.

However, the driving characterization of the H/Hr relationship is one of loyalty. Hermione is characterized as steadfast behind Harry, and Harry is displayed as extremely loyal to his friends

Thus, common romantic conflicts are hard to have. Such as:

- Harry/Hermione are concerned the others are hiding their true feeling (neither is ever set up to keep secrets from each other)
- Harry/Hermione is worried the other is staying with them due to duty instead of love
- Harry/Hermione can't advance the relationship because they feel like the other is hiding things.
- Harry/Hermione have romantic misunderstanding that they don't clear causing drama

They can be done, but it is harder.

The ones that do work tend to be used in fics that alienate Hermione from Harry, rather than a romantic challenge:

- Hermione decides she has to do something for Harry against his wishes for his own.
- Harry decides to 'protect' his friends by shutting them out.

**** Yeah, I prefer stories where the couple backs each other up against an external threat than one where a couple deals with internal drama.

Um...that's the first point of discussion in the essay, /and they are explicitly ordered from least important to most important/. The rest of it talks about her manner of talking, her sense of humor, how they spend time together. The last, and thus officially "most important", problem is "Hermione is too rational and not tactful or intuitive enough to deal sensitively with Harry's dark moods."

So I'm not sure how you got the idea that the essay is fixated on physical attraction.

** Thank you for the essay link. It was a decent read. I would love fics that explore Harry standing up to his friends more. Not a bashing fic, but the DA probably wouldn't have taken off if Harry had done so.

*** Hermione tends to do whatever is necessary, even if it's somewhat dubious, to reach her goals but those tend to be 'good'. She's extremely unlikely to join up with Voldemort as his movement would never accept her but her own movement of rebellious muggleborns overthrowing the pureblood government to install 'democracy'? There's plenty of stories like that.

**** I would have love a fic where she has to learn that her extreme actions have consequences. She got away with permanently scarring Edgecombe (yes, she's a traitor and socially should be ostracized, but if Harry did the same to Malfoy, would anyone care?).

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** I agree. That and the fact her character ended up stealing lines. I at least respect the books for making her flawed, if a major karma houdini.

It's kinda like people romanticising Snape even though he was a bitter man with pretty much no redeeming qualities. I do however admit movie Snape is a superior character narrative wise.
