So here's the thing --- I've been writing a story (a point-of-departure sort of thing), currently beginning Third Yeard. The main character is Hermione, but she /is/ still friends with Ron and Harry, although they aren't her /only/ friends. And here's the thing --- I'm the farthest thing from a Ron-basher, I /want/ him to be in the story, but I keep having trouble giving him things to /do/, especially ever since I got the Scabbers plotline wrapped up. What sorts of contributions /can/ a third-year, canon-like Ron make to the plot?


** I like Ron as a character and with Harry moping half the time and Hermione being strung up like the guitars of Brian May, Ron was definitely a warm and much-needed comic relief. His purpose, in my eyes, was to make everything more light-hearted in an increasingly dark progression of the series. Not sure if my answer helps (as I too have a hard time writing Ron) but I thought I would give you my thoughts.

**** You could then add an extra dimension to Ron and make him a touch of sadness. Got nothing bad to say about Mrs Weasley, she was a great mum. But for a kid, who's already overshadowed by all his siblings, I could see it being a source of hurt that she could never remember his dislikes. I mean, he's a pretty easy going guy, eats just about anything, and deals with shabby clothes pretty well, but he dislikes corned beef and maroon. I'm not even sure he got his initial on his. Ginny got decent dress robes....but she wasn't even old enough to go. So they would not have been on her supplies list. Ron got old-fashioned mouldy lace.....in maroon.

Or you could make him found a chess club.

** Maybe you could get into, how creepy it would actually be having a human disguised as pet rat in your family, and maybe start a character arc for Ron, like him starting to research magic that can uncover deceptions or help with keeping secrets, you could set him on a path to be some sort of detective for lack of a better word, that could have an interesting pay off in book 4, when you look at Crouch or Skeeter. The problem with this is that you´re going off canon quite a bit and him researching stuff, doesn´t give him much stuff to do immediately, though him researching stuff in the library of his own accord, could be used for a comedic moment or two. Or to be short when you don´t know what Ron can contribute to plot, make Ron think about this himself and go from there.

** The thing with Ron and things to do is that Ron as a character is the most social of the trio, but also the most outspoken one and definitely with a dark sense of humour. This means that it is hard to have “something to do” for him because, as you can already see in the books, Ron's acts are often enough those that could have come from anyone if only they were clever/brave/whatever enough, but came specifically from him because he is the kind of person who doesn't think about whether it is worth for him to do something for the sake of someone else but simply does it. He may not be the most loyal person ever (both he and Hermione are more or less equally loyal but in different ways, and both of them do betray Harry in different ways and for different, but always somewhat excusable, reasons), and he may not be the most [insert anything] person ever, but he does provide humour in the series, he does daring rescues and has “you can get him over my dead body” moments just because he feels something may be wrong, and ultimately he did serve his part in keeping the trio together (despite people claiming that it was Harry and only Harry).

So, let's try to make a list, shall we:

- Whenever he's present and Malfoy starts being an annoyance, he's always the first one to reach for his wand.
- He convinced the twins to take their father's car and rescue Harry because something may have been wrong; by that point he did not know enough about Harry's life to really know that wrong something was.
- He went with Harry down to the Chamber of Secrets, and while sure, it was his sister that got taken, he had to know he can't really contribute because of his wand so he went outmatched.
- Heck, he went with Harry to the Forbidden Forests, knowing there are spiders involved.
- He stood between Harry and Sirius, with a broken leg, knowing he stands no chance really.

We could go further, but I think at this point you can easily tell that there is a theme with Ron's ... things to do, so to say, in the books. I do not know what your story is about and if it even needs stuff like that, but really situations where help is needed but anyone with a proper judgment of the situation would go and hide instead are situations for Ron to shine.

** What does the other characters do in the story? Ron is usually helping out Harry or Hermione with their problems, and spends most of the books doing that. He is the street smarts of the group, and he knows a lot about the wizarding world that Harry and Hermione doesn't, he is usually the one to explain common magical words or things. He has a good intuition, and often notices when things are a bit off. He is also good at imitating voices and sounds. He gets good grades at school, even though he likes to complain about homework. He even does research when it's important, contrary to what his haters like to believe. He is able to change his beliefs when he learns they're wrong, and is not stuck in his ways. Ron loves chess and quidditch, and is very good at both things, he also knows a lot of quidditch trivia. He's a genuinely funny guy, but also a very kind one.

Exactly the point I want to make. Many fanfic authors fail to see this point and use Hermione or Harry to provide certain knowledge that is more logical for Ron to know.

I would personally rate his marks average (which is not a bad thing). He will not compete with hermione for the top-position in the class but neither will he compete with certain students for the bottom place.

Also Ron is a real Gryffindor. In the second book he did follow the spiders, despite his arachnophobia. In the third book he stood up against what he thought to be a murderer. (Or at least, tried to, but yeah he had a broken leg at that time). Give him a backbone.

** Well, write him as one of the bravest kids you know - he sacrificed himself for harry and Hermione in year 1 in canon, and stood on a broken leg and told a suspected mass-murderer he had to go through him to get to Harry in year 3. But also write him as insecure, and feeling overshadowed by his older brothers. He is jealous, but not really any more than most other teenagers. He is also close in skill to Harry, and much less prone to angst. And among the trio, he's the expert for wizards, so to speak, and he grew up with six siblings.

So, should either Harry or Hermione need help or an intervention, he's the first to come to mind. He's also - as mentioned already - one of the bravest kids in school, and ready to break the rules when needed. So, while Hermione has other friends, I doubt she has a friend like Ron who will be there when it counts, even if he might annoy her at times.

As another option, you could use "Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived" by DianeCastle as an inspiration, and have Hermione crush on Ron early on - that would certainly keep him in the story as the two inexperienced teenagers dance around each other.

Although --- you couldn't know this, of course, you'd have to have read my story, but --- "while Hermione has other friends, I doubt she has a friend like Ron who will be there when it counts"... well, that part made me chuckle a bit because Hermione's friends include the Basilisk, who has obviously been a great help so far.

** What contributions a third-year, canon-like Ron can make to a plot... that does depend a lot on what exactly the plot IS.

I do love Ron, but he's hardly a prodigy, and compared to Harry and Hermione he's not really exceptional... so it's easy to just delegate him into the "comic relief" role; be the one who stands on the sidelines and snarks, or has humiliating things happen to him cause it's funny (that did happen to him in canon, after all).

One thing that might be worth pursuing is that Ron has pretty good insincts. Unless blinded by some sort of bias (like deciding he hates Viktor Krum because Krum likes Hermione), he's generally pretty good at assessing the trustworthiness of people, places and situations. If Ron's suspicious of someone or something, there's generally a good reason to be.

Also, he's often a lot more perceptive than people, including Ron himself, gives him credit for. There was a running joke in the fandom, at least with the first four book, that Ron might be a Seer, because whenever he joked or snarked about something, or said something in jest, he usually turned out to be right on the money.

Perhaps the biggest thing Ron can do, though, is provide a counterbalance to Hermione. Usually, Hermione is the one who is rational and logical, while Ron is more likely to leap before he looks... but in some instances where Hermione gets carried away with her own emotions, Ron's the one who provides the down-to-Earth rationale. If one of them goes too far in one direction, the other will be there to try and keep them from falling over.

** Give him his own plotline of some sort. Give him another person he wants to interact with. Figure out a way he wants to interact with someone that isn't from canon. Find someone who needs help who feels they can go to him and no one else, or find someone he wants to impress or beat in some way, or get him into some kind of trouble.

Maybe Ginny is having trouble with bullying so she goes to Ron for help. Bullying is an honored tradition at Hogwarts, and she /was/ responsible in a way. Maybe she's struggling with her course material since she missed most of a year, and Hermione's teaching style seriously fails for her. I can see Hermione being worse at teaching -- she's the sort who would be very confused at people not understanding something and then she'd try to go more thorough. But Ron might listen better and come up with something that's easier to understand.

I mean, he's a solid B student at fifth year and better at graduation. He's not exactly a dunce.

** Another piece of advice that I use for my stories: to understand canon characters a little better, I use MBTI. It really helps me understand how they think, how they process information, and a general overview of their personalities. It helps me keep them in character, also to understand how they would react in different situations. Now, MBTI is not in canon (except for Remus Lupin and Dumbledore-- JKR has typed them as ENFJ and INFJ respectively). But many people (you can search up MBTI Ron Weasley) have him typed as an ESFP, this I tend to agree with.

***** You're describing fanon-Ron, not the canon one.

/"He ate like an animal."/

Apart from a few instances of talking with his mouth full, and one instance of Hermione chiding him for "always eating" in the movies, this never happens in canon. This is a classic example of how fandom takes a VERY minor trait of a character and blows it out of proportion until the trait doesn't resemble what's in canon at all.

/"He abandoned his friends when things got tough in 7th book,"/

Does everyone keep forgetting that Harry explicitly TOLD HIM to leave? Ron was wearing the Horcrux, which was exaggerating his already-prominent temper. It goes like this, more or less:

RON: This camping trip sucks, we're not getting anywhere!\\
HARRY: Boo-hoo, cry me a river. Nobody said it would be easy!\\
RON: I'm worried about my family!\\
HARRY: Hah! MY family is DEAD!\\
RON: You're being a total jerk!\\
HARRY: Well then, leave! Get out of here!\\
RON: Fine!

And so he storms off. Only to regret it and try to return immediately after, but then he's attacked by Snatchers, then he Splinches himself, then he gets lost in the forest and can't find the campsite again. Not a great moment for Ron, but this "abandoned his friends when things got tough" is a blatant misrepresentation of the character.

/"he was complaining about lack of food in that adventure."/

Ever gone hungry? I mean, REALLY hungry, and you don't know where your next meal is coming from? All three characters were snappish and surly over the lack of food. Ron was the loudest, true, but this is a really silly complaint.

/"He was so jealous of Harry in 4th book that he abandoned Harry like an angry, edgy moron."/

He stopped talking to Harry for a while because he felt betrayed. The entire thing wasn't about Harry being in the spotlight again, but about Ron being left behind again -- and Harry not being very understanding. Read the book again, Harry is downright NASTY to Ron here; Ron just sulks and pulls away -- Harry hurls insults and throws badges at him. This entire idea that everything is Ron's fault is bull -- on the whole, Ron is a much better friend to Harry than Harry is to Ron.

Ron is the one who supports Harry when nobody else does. In first and second year, during the periods when everyone hates Harry, Ron sticks by him and becomes hated by association. In third year, Ron tries to stand up on a broken leg to what he thinks is a deranged killer, to say "if you want Harry, go through me." In fifth year, Harry is an arsehole to EVERYONE and Ron doesn't even raise his voice to him. This isn't the actions of a fair-weather friend who runs off the moment things get hard.

/"He was so jealous of Harry in 4th book that he abandoned Harry like an angry, edgy moron."/

Read the books again. Of the three main characters, Ron makes by FAR the least anti-Slytherin comments. He barely even mentions Slytherin at all, outside a few isolated incidents. Harry is the real anti-Slytherin bigot here; he tends to go on about how unpleasant the house is.

Not the first fight they had? Well then, what WAS the first fight they had? I can't think of any! Seriously, Harry and Ron NEVER fight. Ron and Hermione, yes, but Harry and Ron are almost always on the same page. They come to blows TWICE over the course of seven books; both fights are BIG and both fights involve both of them acting like jerkish teenage boys... but they both get over themselves and make up. Which is a hell of a lot more mature than a "drop 'em the moment they do things I don't like."

Always seething, angry and jealous? Since when? He's got a temper and a fair amount of insecurity and self-loathing, but have you seen his normal reaction to Harry experiencing cool stuff? He's more thrilled than Harry is! He's like "it's so awesome that you got an invisibilty cloak!" "You didn't face charges for blowing up your aunt because you're famous, that's SO COOL!"

And if it was just the "Boy Who Lived" he wanted to be friends with, he would not have stuck by Harry like he did.

While Ron was not particularly well-utilised in the books, and even less so in the movies, writing him off in this way is doing a serious disservice to him as a character. And, again -- it's just describing fanon-Ron, not the canon one.

In second, far as he knew Ginny was not in danger until the very end, and once AGAIN he stuck with Harry even if most of the school shunned him.

In third, I have no idea what you're even talking about.

In fourth, Harry was a douchebag to him.

In fifth... seriously, about his dad? His dad is in danger once, during Christmas. He endures a LOT of Harry yelling in CAPS LOCK before that.

In sixth, what the hell?

In seventh, he left because Harry told him to. And came back to save Harry's life.

Ridiculed and abused Tom Riddle became a model student, learned stuff and controlled every bigot who ever bullied him in school for being a half blood.

He even went to Dumbledore, begged him to let him stay at school, but was sent away by him to abusive people. They very people who taught him rule of 'survival of fittest'. Tom had to be stronger and meaner than bullies to avoid getting bullied.

If only Dumbledore, the very Dumbledore who fed and raised Harry as pig to be slaughtered at appropriate time, had helped Tom, we might not even have a Voldemort to worry about.

*************** /I'm seeing a pattern here. He is always there when it suits him./

He goes out of his way to be there for Harry, to a much bigger degree than Harry is there for him. This is typical of Harry, by the way -- both Ron and Hermione are MUCH more supportive of Harry than Harry is of them. Partly this is for plot-reasons, because Harry plain NEEDS more support... but saying that Ron is "always there when it suits him" is something that actually fits Harry better as a character.

But even if it WAS true... for someone who used that Ron "wouldn't be useful to me" as an argument for why harry shouldn't be friends with him, that's a pretty hypocritical argument. You seem far more interested in what YOU can get out of a friendship, not what's in it for your friend. That's a trait I cannot assess to Ron.

/Harry had money, fame, power. You make it sound like Ron wasn't there for anything./

Harry was hated, shunned, feared and ridiculed several times. You make it sound like Ron was just trying to edge up to the famous kid.

/Harry's circle of friends stunted after him. Most famous person and his only friend in that world is a bigoted Weasely who on his first meeting tells you that Slythwira are bad./

Except he doesn't. It's HAGRID who on first meeting tells you Slytherins are bad, not Ron. The movie changed it to Ron, but the movie butchered Ron's character anyway.

I've gone through the books specifically looking for parts where Ron mentions Slytherin, and he BARELY mentions it at all. When he mentions Slytherin, it's mostly in the context of how they did in the Quidditch games. Not counting speaking about Malffoy or Snape (whom he don't like as PEOPLE), he says something negative about Slytherin like THREE times in the entire series.

First, he says "what if I'm in Slytherin?" but doesn't elaborate, because the discussion turns to Harry not knowing anything about the wizarding world and Ron trying to cheer him up.

Then, in the second book, he's astonished that Salazar Slytherin was the one who started the entire "pureblood" thing, calls him a "twisted old loony" and says he's glad he's not in his house.

And I think it's in the fifth or sixth book he says that he doesn't want to stand together with Slytherins.

Contrast this to Harry, who can't mention Slytherin without mentioning how much he dislikes them. Ron is NOT an anti-Slytherin bigot, no more than Harry is LONG before he discusses it with Ron.

If you're going to blame anyone for turning Harry against Slytherin, blame Malfoy and Hagrid. Malfoy was the unpleasant guy who said "I'll be in Slytherin," which gave Harry a negative opinion of Slytherin before he knew what it even was, Hagrid was the one who said that all Dark wizards came from Slytherin. Ron had nothing to do with it.

/The one who bullied a girl to tears./

You mean, the one who called Hermione a "nightmare" behind her back, didn't intend for her to hear it, and felt really guilty after he realised she had? That's not mentioning the fact that Hermione had been nagging, insulting and belittling him every single chance she got up until then, and he barely said a word to her in his own defence before he decided to vent to Harry how much she annoyed him. Yeah, what a TERRIBLE AND HORRIBLE bully.

/Who know who else he drove away to keep the most famous and notably rich kid as his friend./

You've been reading too much fanfiction. There is NO part of canon that even suggests that Ron EVER did anything of the sort.

There are several things that hint that Ron was doing it.

But before that we should establish another thing. Was Ron stupid or Smart?

I believe he was smart. He was good at chess. He even beat a hurdle set by teacher when he was 11 year old. Unless you are one of those who believe Dumbledore set it easy so that Harry's confrontation with Voldemort could be arranged, you should agree that Ron did awesome.

I think Ron understood complex situations. He was master at chess. He knew importance of powerful, well placed pieces, strategies and could plot and execute complex action plans to achieve his goals.

Do you see it now? He was a worthless friend, since he never was a friend. He was jealous. He spent his time eating. He was jealous of Harry's success. As soon as keeping close to Harry became tougher than whatever goal he had planned, he dropped Harry, and ate more food. He left Harry more than once.

Now that we understand he wasn't a brain dead idiot, and was a master chess player, a game that needs not only careful planning but overall keen eye on whole board, we can say that Ron was smart enough to make strategies for his own goals in life.

Harry was a naive, idiot boy, from an abused home. Ron was a cunning, chess player, with knack for strategy. Ron isolates Harry, keep him close for benefits, uses him, leaves when it isn't worth it, come back, leaves again when it gets tough, comes back again.

He was a glory hound. JKR revealed in book 1, in front of mirror.

Besides, two flaws in your argument:

ONE: He wanted to be noticed by others. Being Harry's friend made him LESS noticed because everyone was already looking at HARRY. Even Ron himself knew this. The "strategy" is a bad one.

TWO: If he's such a manipulative genius, why on earth would he ever do anything that would make him seem like anything less than the perfect friend? You are the one insisting that he whines, complains and betrays Harry all the time. That's not a sign of a good manipulator.
