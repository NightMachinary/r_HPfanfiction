#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** Black Luminary is the first and foremost, being an incredibly unique AU. I am very much invested in guessing and puzzling over all the differences from canon going on as well as trying to figure out more about the history of things.

Antithesis is also up there, as it is similar to the Darkness Within, although it is much better written. Harry is evil, he knows it and he struggles greatly with his actions.

You'll be the Death of Me is my favorite romance in the fandom and the author had their baby and is writing again. Graces Malfoy is an incredible OC.

Questions and Answers and Strangers at Drakeshaugh are both solid but don't update frequently.

DPSW and PoS I also eagerly look forward to updates as well.

***** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=129801&textsize=1&chapter=3][Here]]. Chapter 3 of The Prevailing Counterpoint. From the start of the chapter until "/"Late,” grumbled Argus Filch/". 1282 words describing how Harry and Ginny walked through Hogsmeade to Hogwarts. Including this kiss:

#+begin_quote
  A very important part of her world agreed. He swept her into a kiss, as passionate as he dared without upsetting the cat. The touch of their lips was an enlivening spark to compensate for a late night and early morning. The soft pressure of their mouths was a tonic of joy to dispell worries and pain. A gentle tickle, from whiskers of a curious cat, was a reminder that for all their responsibilities and dedication ... there was still time for the occasional giggle

  They didn't always remember it, but that Harry and Ginny were still young; they had every right to play, be carefree, and laugh. And right now they were in just the right mood for it. But somewhere in the giocoso melody of their tender exchange was a droning tanpura, rising up to remind them that they had a schedule to keep.

  They pulled back an inch --- just enough distance to permit their shining eyes to beam into each other's souls for one more long moment. The fingers of Harry's free hand traced a crescent along Ginny's cheek then drifted off. Harry's smile kissed Ginny's nose and they reluctantly separated ...

  Todd Ollivander can't seem to shake his feelings for the new apprentice at his father's wand shop. It's not a good time to be distracted, as it's becoming clearer and clearer that Ollivander's is a major target of Lord Voldemort's during the First Wizarding War. (For those who like to skip around to get a sense of a fic, in Chapter One I suggest which chapters I think are my best.)

** Linkffn(11483591) is my favorite in-progress fic right now. It's a fem!Harry story that begins when Mary Potter receives all of Harry's memories, up until the point he dies. It semi-follows the books, but has a lot of twists and turns that makes it enjoyable.

I would also put down Soul Scars, but it hasn't been very enjoyable for me lately. It's been getting a little too repetitive for my tastes. Actually thinking about removing it from my favorites tbh.

So then I will link my favorite currently updating story, which happens to be in the Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire universe. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/][Purple Days]] which is a Joffrey Baratheon stuck in a Groundhog Day style timeloop. The story is pretty amazing. I first saw it in a link over in the [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] sub. Because the spacebattles story formatting is a little wonky I'm not exactly sure how long the story is but somewhere around 50 chapters have been posted so far with anywhere from 2k to 12k words each. Having familiarity with show or book canon may be helpful.

#+begin_quote
  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?
