No friendship with the goblins please. Basically treat every fanon goblin trope as sketchy.


** [12 Grimmauld Place, London, September 18, 2008]

Harry: I'm going straight down to the business. The Goblins have refused the Ministry's offer, and killed its emissary.

[Big murmurs erupted among attendants]

Ginny: Harry, give us the order! Let's storm that damned place and kill those buggers!

Neville: Ginny, we must not rush into war with such haste. Storming Gringotts could have wide economic and political repercussions. We need to weigh our options.

Harry: You are both right. We /will/ declare war on the Goblins. But we will do so after careful considerations. First thing to consider is, do we need to take their vaults intact? Daphne and Justin, I want to hear your opinions.

Daphne Greengrass: Of course it would be better if we can take the remaining vaults intact, but not necessary. During our purge two years ago, we have confiscated enough gold from the conspirators that we can pay off any obligations to the neutral members of the public. Those within our Network should have no reason to worry about any interruptions of goods and services. Still, I maintain the opinion that it would be far more beneficial to take over the vaults and Gringotts intact.

Justin: I concur. Our decoupling effort in the past 6 years has made us fully independent from Goblins's banking system. Crushing them is just going to be the last piece to fall and will finally lead us to great prosperity in the future. I've been saying again and again that us Wizards are magnitudes more productive than Muggles, and our society should be post scarcity a long time ago. And yet, we could observe extreme material poverty all over the Magical world. By tying our superb productivity to a very limited currency, our economy is all but guaranteed to stay in perpetual depression. I think it's utterly insane to surrender our country's monetary authority to such a hostile specie.

Justin: Just three years after introducing our Network Credit and the Exchange, our people have never again experienced material hardships. Everyone in this room should be able to attest to that. Now it's time to expand our new economic system to the rest of Wizarding Britain!

Justin: And finally, those filthy scumbags have betrayed so many of us. You should all know better than to trust them. I'm with Ginny. Let's storm that place and kill them all!

Harry: Very well put, Justin. We shall avenge your suffering and everyone whom they had betrayed. Now to our next point, do we have to worry about international backlashes?

Percy Weasley: ICW wouldn't intervene as long as SoS is not threatened. Individual countries have even less motivations to get on our bad side. They didn't get involved during Voldemort's time, and they didn't during the last Goblin Rebellion almost ten years ago. I think as long as we are not significantly weakened in the coming war, no foreign country will dare to challenge us.

Harry: Do these answers adequately address your concerns, Neville?

Neville: Yes. Would Professor Flitwick object to a war?

Susan: I can answer that question, Neville. It's not a well know fact but Professor Flitwick never knew his father, and he was raised by his witch mother alone.

Harry: That was another crime Goblins perpetrated against us. I say enough is enough. If you all have kept up with the news, you should know that Lee has been writing about their transgressions for weeks. The public I believe is incensed enough to go to war, but is also deterred by the potential loss of their gold.

Harry: Therefore, it will be to our benefits if we let Goblins fire the first shot. Before I continue, anyone else having objections?

Luna: Harry, I have one. Gringotts is a strong fortress. Taking it will be costly for us. In the Goblin Rebellion of 1999, Kingsley lost more than 50 people, and they barely managed to enter the bank.

Harry: Ron and Hermione have already devised an excellent plan, or rather plans to attack Gringotts. Our task will be made even easier if someone here can find a way to lure them out and make them attack us first. Ron?

This Harry had extremely poor relationship with the Goblins, and I assume that after he had consolidated his hold over Britain in 2002, he would find a good opportunity to end the Goblin banking monopoly and remove Magical Britain's dependence on Gringotts.

*** I thoroughly enjoyed that.

I posted this looking for someone to make fun of the fanon tropes, but you wrote something great.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
