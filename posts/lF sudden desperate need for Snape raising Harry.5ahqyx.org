I just watched a YouTube video that gave me incredible amounts of feels, and I have a sudden desire for a fic where, for whatever reason, Snape ends up having to raise baby Harry. He can raise him at Hogwarts or at his house, I don't care, I don't care about the details at all, all I want is for Snape to turn out to be a surprisingly good dad to Harry.

Does such a thing exist, or am I going to have to write it myself?


** There is linkffn(1963825). Harry is 5 years old but it is well written. It's only 20k but it's sequel is 100k+ I believe.

** This is my favorite one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] It's not exactly Snape raising a baby Harry, Harry's older, but it's incredibly well written and I've read it 3-4 times by now. Basically Snape sees the letter addressed to the cupboard under the stairs, goes to see what it's about, and realized Harry is abused by the Dursleys. He then recruits McGonagel to help him.

** I mostly read stories where Harry is in Hogwarts before he comes into Snape's care. I've read and liked one other story other than Mine (rec'd elsewhere) that featured a Pre-Hogwarts Harry:

[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewseries.php?seriesid=43][A Boy Called Whelp]] series on Potions and Snitches. Harry was 7 in the story.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter, abused by the Dursleys and literally treated like a dog, finds safety and solace in a place it's least expected. Severus Snape, new Potions Master at Hogwarts, finds family and purpose. The two lives intertwine in this series.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/][Potionsandsnitches.org]], a Snape and Harry gen archive, has a whole section on [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/browse.php?type=categories&catid=7][*Parental Snape*]]. There are subcategories at the top of the page and 7 pages of uncategorized Parental Snape stories if you scroll down on the link provided.

Also, if you use the filtering system within the categories, such as after you've clicked on, say the Guardian Snape link, you can change the /Takes Place/ filter to Pre-Hogwarts if you're only interested in Guardian Snape stories where Harry is under 11, for example.

*** I wouldn't, personally. She has interesting storylines but she clearly hasn't plotted them out properly and her grammar is atrocious. It's not worth the effort.

I edit a newspaper so bad grammar makes me cringe.

**** OP asked if these types of stories already existed. I'm just providing the info. Besides, I'm sure we all have "badly written guilty pleasure" reads. I'll let OP decide for themselves if it's worth it.
