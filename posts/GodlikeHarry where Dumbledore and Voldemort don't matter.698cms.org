Are there any godlike harry fics where dumbledore and Voldemort or even wizarding Britain are considered unimportant and harry is NOT a whiny bitch who throws a tantrum everytime something does not go his way.


** /Core Threads/. Just... /Core Threads/. It's the ultimate godlike Harry, and it's hilarious. Dumbledore is a very secondary presence and Voldemort is... well, there, somewhere, in the background, maybe... but Harry doesn't give a darn about him.

**** ...yes? But the whole "skeleton" thing is just incidental. (The story is delightfully insane like that.)

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
