  Hermione is a sister to Harry, a mother to Rose and Hugo, a wife to Ron, and a Legilimens and Unspeakable. She is also very, very angry.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

** The darkest one I can think of is Tender Vengence, but I am sure there are much darker ones out there... I wouldn't say Hermione is particularly dark in any of these, the overall themes are though.

Sorry if its not what you are looking for...!

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=22][Tender Vengeance by Margot Le Faye]] Setting out to capture Ginny Weasley, the Death Eaters also take Hermione Granger. Instead of killing the Muggle-born outright, Voldemort subjects her to an insidious bit of dark magic which turns her into a prize for one of his faithful.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1][The Fallout by everythursday]] Hermione learns about growing up through the redemption of Draco Malfoy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027125/1/The-Green-Girl][The Green Girl by Colubrina]] Hermione is sorted into Slytherin; how will things play out differently when the brains of the Golden Trio has different friends? AU. Darkish Dramione. COMPLETE.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation by Bex-chan]] He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.

Note: There's a whole bunch of fics by Colubrina that I absolutely love for HermionexDraco and HermionexTom pairings. Just check her out, her writing is good and I love her portrayals of the characters. I won't link anymore from Colubrina, because if I did, we'd be here all day.

There's also Children of the Dark by cleotheo. It's a seven-part story, and six out of seven are complete, with the final book in progress. It's updated pretty regularly, so definitely not abandoned.

Hopefully this satisfies you. Enjoy!

Linkao3(The Anti-Heroine)

Edit: I found more

Linkffn(The Diary) LittleMullatoKitten She's not extremely dark but it's a Riddle/Voldie/Slytherin Hermione

Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents) I loved this one until the author seemed to give up ad just write the future down on it. It's Harry/Hermione. Or was supposed to be. But it's still well written

Linkffn(Broken Hearts on a Canvas) it's AU Riddle/Hermione. She's not very "dark" at all but it's very well written

  When a terrible turn of events lands Hermione Granger in an orphanage, nothing could possibly get worse. Or at least, nothing could get worse until Hermione meets Tom Riddle, the sulky handsome boy who likes to draw and thinks she's his newest toy...

Unfortunately, protecting her when he's 50 years in the past is tricky at best. No TTs, horcruxes, or prophecy. Slytherin!Hermione/Harry. Tomione. Some Anti-Ron&Dumblehate. T at first, M later on.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.

** I just read one named *Fervidity*. I think someone rec'd it in a previous thread a couple of weeks ago.

It's a WIP but the author has been updating it. It features Hermione with Draco and Rabastan LeStrange (triad) as well as her and Snape (at least so far).

*** Ah, Fervidity...

Gave it a try a while ago.

- More-BAMF-than-canon!Hermione who is still recognizable --- cool.
- Poses as Snape's illegitimate daughter to help subvert Death Eaters from within --- OK.
- Gets challenged by Bellatrix, fights, actually pulls off a win, and only spares her because Voldemort orders it --- cool.
- Builds a reputation and develops relationships (positive and negative) with members of the Death Eater inner circle, making moral compromises along the way --- cool.
- Is not a blushing virgin (Ron having been her first) --- good.
- Learns that these monthly "revels" involve participating in, and I'll phrase this as mechanistically as possible, group sex in which the female DEs must serve as bottoms to multiple partners whom they do not necessarily choose, and nor are the female DEs given control over the mode and style of the intercourse; and where a surprising number of male DEs avail themselves of this opportunity to inflict abuse, despite the fact that in HP setting, women are just as good at violence as men, and the fact that the next day, they have to rely on those very women to have their backs in battle --- NOPE.

Different strokes for different folks.

Going by the name Mina Graziana-Snape, Hermione must navigate this new world where she's rubbing shoulders with Death Eaters, forced to participate in revels, marked as a Death Eater herself and balancing light and dark.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** linkao3(Surprise, Bitches! by OfHealingLove) is kind of amusing, with Hermione out to do what Tom Riddle did, except do it right; doesn't take itself too seariously.

linkffn(Mudblood Mistress I & II by JoseHood) and sequels are decent Slytherin!Hermione fics that do 'ship Draco and have her going increasingly dark.

  Hermione's parents were killed by Death Eaters just before the fall of Voldemort and she was adopted by Severus Snape as part of his reparations to the post-war Wizarding World. Hermione grows up with a distant father, a library full of Dark magic, and the knowledge that Voldemort has taken away her one chance for a happy, loving family. With a father who is the Head of Slytherin House, a Muggle-born being sorted into it isn't all that surprising - even if nobody knows she is one.However, her plans to steal the next generation of Voldemort's supporters, usurp him, and take his throne as the Darkest Lady of the century, might be a little surprising. But only a little.The fact that Dumbledore doesn't bother to stop her is possibly the most surprising of all.
