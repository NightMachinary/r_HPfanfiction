I think it may have been a series, and they eventually gathered a list of spells and potions and tactics to combat death eaters. They had a memorial for Cedric and the series ended with Harry passing on his master copy of the enchanted books to Teddy


** That's the Dangerverse series that starts with linkffn(Living with Danger).
