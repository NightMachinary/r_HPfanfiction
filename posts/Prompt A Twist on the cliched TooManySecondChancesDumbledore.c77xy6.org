In so many Indy!Harry fics, Dumbledore is depicted as overly forgiving of Death Eaters and their crimes, constantly preaching about how everyone deserves a second chance (and a third, fourth, fifth, two hundred and thirty seventh, etc). I want to see a fic where he extends this to a deranged Harry. Harry "accidentally" murders a student, Dumbledore covers it up, saying he deserves a second chance to be good. Harry murders another random student, Dumbledore covers it up again. Meanwhile, Snape keeps having to help hide the bodies, while the students are told things like "Draco Malfoy tragically passed away after an accident involving him nailing himself to the dungeon wall and pulling out his organs."

Off to the side, Harry's friends of choice (whomever they may be) keep trying to convince Harry /not/ to kill people who piss him off. They don't have much luck.

Obviously this would have to be crack, since Hogwarts would quickly get shut down with students being casually killed every few months or so in a serious fic.


** *Theodore Nott falls against the wall after taking a piercing hex to the stomach. Harry Potter walks towards him, and Nott manages to get out his final words.. "It was just a FUK'N" before a Reducto to the head put him out of his misery.

â€‹

D: Mr. Potter, was that really necessary? What could he have done to deserve this?

H: He squished my beetle in Transfiguration sir, I had just named him.

D: Very well Mr. Potter, I can see you weren't left with many choices, I shall give you another chance, and have Severus cover it up again. You may go.

**** He once was an associate of ours, they call him 'The Dark Lord." Well Harry wasn't exactly the Dark Lord.. He was the one you sent to kill the fucking Dark Lord! Harry is a man of focus, commitment, sheer will.. Something you know very little about. I once saw him kill three men in a bar with his wand, only he didn't use any spells. Three men, with a Fuckin .. Stick!

But it'd be even funnier if Hagrid also treated Harry like Norbert. Aww bless him, he doesn't know his own strength!

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

Not necessarily. It /is/ the only school worth a damn in the United Kingdom, so there's as many reasons to keep it open as not even if people /do/ get killed in mysterious circumstances now and then. (After all, Dumbledore could always point out, this is routine in Durmstrang, and /they/ manage.)

Certainly, there'd be significant popular support if the Ministry motioned to close down Hogwarts, but if the Minister /isn't/ hostile to Dumbledore due to being turned against him by Lucius Malfoy (which could come to be through Harry murdering Malfoy), then I don't think a man of Dumbledore's influence would have too much difficulty keeping Hogwarts open.
