#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1038392/chapters/2071555][Teddy Lupin and the Forest Guard]] by Fernwithy. This is the link to the 1st year, but it's a complete series -- there's three other fics, one for 1st year, 3rd year, 5th year and 7th year. The author put a lot of thought into the story and the world. It parallels Harry's almost -- 1st year he does get into a bit of trouble where he finds a certain stone -- 3rd year, someone breaks out of Azkaban, etc. I won't spoil anymore, but it's great, and you'll feel everything reading this - crying, to laughing, to wishing this was completely canon.

... As you can tell, it's my favourite :)
