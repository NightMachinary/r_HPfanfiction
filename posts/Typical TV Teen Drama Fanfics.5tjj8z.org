I love those super obnoxious teen drama tv shows. Boarding School. Evil and sexy Teachers (at least one student is banging a teacher). Backstabbing. Bitchy girls. I live for this nonsense. Are there any fanfics that have some of that classic high school hormone-driven drama? Slash is ok.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4260581/1/Lessons-Learned][Lessons Learned]] and the sequel [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4619108/1/Finding-the-Future][Finding the Future]] are next gen fics that might scratch that itch for you although they aren't quite as salacious as gossip girl or something.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1875756][Tempus]] is a Harry/ male OC (Dracos Greatgrandfather) time travel fic where Harry is in Slytherin.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/344335][Starts with a Spin]] is a good Drarry, 6th year, drinking games etc fic that might scratch this itch for you.
