Something that popped into my head - are there any fics where multiple people travel back with different aims and try to make their change to the timeline while countering the other person's changes?

As an example - Harry goes back to save Sirius, and Draco goes back to make sure he dies. Harry might try to keep Sirius from leaving Grimmauld Place to go to the DoM, but Draco recruits Kreacher to help Sirius get there.

O-oÂ¬O-o_O-o-O

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches has this as a major plot point. Harry is the BWL and is trying to drastically alter the course of events, while his WBWL brother is constantly attempting to steer things back on course. It's one of the better elements of the fic.

There's no smut, but the fic does have some... uncomfortable sexual undertones at times

*** Heh. I'm impressed with your diplomacy in that last line. :)

That fic really is a fascinating phenomenon, and does have the most amusing ability to create rather intense discussions about it. :D

Thanks for the rec!
