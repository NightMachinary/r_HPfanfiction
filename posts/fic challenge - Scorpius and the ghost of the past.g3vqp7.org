Hello

Before I start, I'm blind, so any mis spellings are due to my screen-reader not always picking up on them. I'm not good at describing scenes otherwise I'd write a fic for you to beat.

anyway, to business:

I'll make a shell for the story and in the comments or else on a fan fiction website, you guys can write a story based around this shell, and consider this my fan fic challenge. If you do post it on another website, you must post a link in the comments section.

You must use all 3 of the main characters I will lay out as well as the villain, because thisis a challenge.

I'll give the shell of the plot and the 3 main characters and the main villain, and you must work from there. Feel fre eto add your own stuff to it as well, and try to use the Scorpius story to better the Cursed Child and even fix aspects of the CC characters to make them even better.

here's the plot:

Scorpius is graduating Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry after 7 years of adventure and fun. However, he gets wind of the possibility that his mother Astoria did not die due to the curse, but was transformed into an animal, and sent to the Congo so some Congolese wizards can try to reverse the curse. This rumor was told to him by a woman named Iris burbage-Gaunt, the mother of a fellow Hogwarts graduate named Heather Gaunt and the younger sister of the late Charity Burbage.

Scorpius, Albus and Heather go on a long adventure to see if it is true that Astoria really is alive, and if so, can she be removed from the curse?

​

​

Characters:

Scorpius is just as he was in the Cursed Child, however, upon graduating, the Ministry of Magic hires him to join an international group to stop the creation of illegal time turners. His motivations for joining this group and becoming the person who arrests those creating illegal time turners are due to his and Albus's experiences with time turners back in 2020. Scorpius is the main hero of the story and he finds out from Iris Burbage-Gaunt that his mother may not be dead after all, despite his father's insistance that she is indeed dead. Will Scorpius come to realize by time he sets out on his adventure that Iris Burbage is setting a trap for him to get back at the Malfoys for the death of her sister Charity? Will he realize Albus's affections towards him are genuine and true, and will he come to terms with his secret feelings towards Albus? most of all, when he finds out that his mother is not a cheetah and is indeed dead even after his adventures in Africa and various other places around the magical parts of the world that his mother is dead and there's no way to bring her back?

​

Albus Potter is just how he is in the Cursed Child, and he accompanies Scorpius on his missions to stop illegal time turner operations, and he secretly has feelings for Scorpius.

​

Heather Gaunt (born November 7, 2005 in Manchester) is the grand daughter of Morfin Gaunt, who had a son while in Azkaban with a ministry worker who he had tricked into having a kid with him. Her father's name is Phinneas Gaunt, who proved to be a great defiance to the gaunt and Slytherin blood purity traditions, as the woman he'd have Heather with, Iris Burbage was a muggle-born, thus making Heather a halfblood. Due to a curse in the Gaunt blood where those born to a "mud blood" and a gaunt, in other words halfblood-born Gaunts would have some kind of physical defect at some point in their life, Heather has deformed hands that are really thin, wide and slightly webbed fingers. She als ohas wide slightly webbed feet as well. Heather has made it her personal mission to change the reputation of the Gaunt name, as she is the first Gaunt to be born in the 21st century. She openly revolts the old Gaunt ways and is repulsed to find out that she is related to the man who would become Voldamort. She is skilled in magic, and she can use her deformed hands to act as handcuffs in conjunction with a spell she would invent in her 4th year she called th "handcuff spell" where she or somebody else taps the back ofone or both of Heather's hands while saying "incarsohand" and her hands can then close around a person's arm, wrist or hand like a hand cuff and lock. Her hands do not change shape when she does this, but they do make a clicking sound when they lock. She is cunning, can be scarry at times but in the end, has a kind heart and ends up proving to be the voice of reason when even the normally rational Scorpius becomes overrun with his desire to see his mother again. In fact, Heather disowns her mother for starting the rumor that Astoria Malfoy was alive and was in the southernmost part of the Congo. She was born in Manchester and uses Mancunian slang quite oftne. She is also the only member of the Gaunt family to have been born in a city, and the only member of the gaunt family to be born after Harry Potter was born. She can speak parseltongue, which proves useful during the part of the story when the trio are in Africa.

​

​

Iris Burbage:

Iris Burbage is the mother of Heather Gaunt and the sister of the late hogwarts professor Charity Burbage. Iris is vengeful and wishes to make the malfoys pay for her sister's death, as despite Voldamort being the one to have done it, it did happen in Malfoy manner. Iris, who is a teacher at Hogwarts herself,taking over the Muggle Studies position in 1999, decided to use Scorpius's emotions over the loss of his mother as well as Draco's emotions over the loss of his beloved wife to have Scorpius embark on a mission to the Congo, where she would confront and kill Scorpius as revenge for Charity Burbage's death. Once her daughter Heather Gaunt becomes aware of the rumors, she sees through them right away and angrily disowns her mother, saying that her aunt Charity would never want such a thing to happen to an innocent man. Despite this, Iris convinces Scorpius to use the opertunity for a time turner mission in Angola to go to the Congo and find the wizards that are supposedly trying to restore Astoria to human form, despite Astoria not even being there at all.

​

​

Well those are the main characters and the main villain. You can add to these characters and you can edit them somewhat if you like, as long as Heather Gaunt is a good character and is the one to see right through her mother's lies.

​

Good luck.


** Part 1 chapter 1

January of 2024.

The sun beats down on all that it can. On the hot dirt roads, on the many stalls and vender stands, on the musicians that are trying to hide under the shade of a palm tree, it's hot, hot, hot.

The smell of spices and incense fill the air and the sounds of the musicians, many people and the occasional camel grunts and moped growls form a mix of noise that assaults the ears.

Two men walk down a dirt road as the wind blows the sand and dirt around them.

“crappy place this is.” A middle-aged American man says wiping some sand from his forehead with the back of his hand.

“Well this is where she said to meet the man who has them, isn't it?” says a British man about his mid 40's or so. “Yes yes.” Says the American man sounding annoyed, “I just don't know why we had to come to the middle of the god damn desert of all places.”

“If the UK or American ministry catches us then we're sunk.” The British man says exasperatedly, “as it is we're lucky she was able to get me out of Azkaban in the first place.”

“yes now where's Ahmad?” the American man says sounding annoyed again.

“Over there!” the British man says pointing to a small stall under a palm tree on the North side of the square.

The two head over to the stall, meandering through the many people crouded about around the various stalls.

They come across an old Arab man under the palm tree playing with what looks like a round piece for a necklace with a clock face.

“Theodore and Benjamin!” the man says with a heavy Syrian accent, “Glad you make it!”

“Hello Ahmad.” Theodore, the British man says kindly, “sorry about the delay.”

“It no problem” Ahmad says, “you come here at just the right time.” The old man then grabs Theodore's hand and presses the round object into it. “Happy to see you again, but I'm afraid this is the last one. I have for now.”

“Thanks.” Theodore says, “will you have more soon?”

“My friend.” Ahmad says, “You know I will, it is my invention after all. I've been doing this for 136 year and I never fail.”

“So I see.” Benjamin says, “So why is this your last one?”

“They take a while to make.” Ahmad says, “time turners are precise magic, and must always be used with great care. For when you have the power to change time, you have power to change the world, and that not always a good thing my friend.”

“We'll remember that, thanks Ahmad.” Theodore says.

“Come again my friend.” Ahmad says.Ben walks off as Theodore makes like he is following him.

Suddenly, Theodore pulls out his wand, “Obli...”

“Expelliarmus!”

The wand flies out of Theodore's hand and lands in Ahmad's left hand.

He laughs, “ha ha ha ha, you try that trick on me? “ he then throws Theodore's want back at him and then gets up and walks off, before he is out of site however, he says, “You should have learned last time Nott, I have 175 years on you. I know all tricks your kind do as well.” With that, Ahmad then apparates away with a loud crack.

“Why did you try to do that again?” Benjamin asks angrily, “That's what got you cought last time!”

“Just a precaution, benny, I do wish you'd stop being such a worrying weasel.”

“Do you want that Potter to catch us again?” Ben asks angrily.

“We're not even in the UK, so he has...”

“We weren't in the UK when he cought us last time, we were here, in this hell whole!” Ben says angrily as they continue walking.

Suddenly a large golden wasp like creature appears in front of them, it appears to be fluid but shiny.

“Return to England and meet me you know where, there's a port key near where the band plays, you'll recognize it!” the creature says in a British female's voice, “I'm counting on you.” With that, the large wasp disintegrates leaving a bunch of mist behind it, which looks yellowish as the blowing sand mingls with the tiny droplets.

“that's her.” Theodore says, “Let's go.”

The two walk off towards the small group of musicians who's instruments magically play themselves.

A man on a moped drives by, and a wizard runs up and uses his wand to lift the man off his small motorized bike, then lets him back on.

“Are they mad?” Theodore asks.

“Bathsheba doesn't recognize the statute of secrecy.” Ben replies, “filthy muggle dunghole.”

“oh never mind them let's find our portkey before I end up with the whole god damn desert in my hair.” Theodore says,

** Chapter 2:

June 2024

In the great hall of Hogwarts, Professor McGonagall and the teachers are at the head of the hall while the 4 house tables have many students sitting eager to await the speech. At the Slytherin table, two boys sit next to each other, with one fiddling with his hands as he looks around the hall. A couple seats down is a tall thin girl with odd looking hands tapping her fingers nervously as she awaits the announcements too, though she is glairing at a teacher sitting on the far left hand side of the staff table.

“Can I have your attention?” Mcgonagall says. The students fall silent quickly due to eagerness. “Alright. So, here we are! Another year has come to pass, and I hope you've all learned so much! For some of you, this is your last, and for others, you have still more to come. Regardless, I know that you have all made great friends, and hopefully have learned valuable lessons during your term here at Hogwarts! “ Mcgonagall then looks stern, “it has come to my attention that some people have been spreading rumors about a student at our school, and I would like to encourage you not to act on this rumor. I will not name the student to whom the rumor concerns, but I will warn you all against blind belief, especially in regards to sensitive topics such as loss. I hope that Hogwarts students are above such immoral acts as to judge other students based on rumors and gossip, especially those graduating this year.” Mcgonagall then relaxes her face into a happier expression. “Now, with that out of the way, I think some final house points are in order. With 220 points, we have hufflepuff house. Remember, last place does not mean loss, but rather it just means a chance to learn more and do better next time. However, 220 points is an impressive number, especially for 4th place. In 3rd, we have Gryffindor house with 250 points. These students have shown their bravery and their skill with relative ease and willingngness to help others in times of need. In second, we have Ravenclaw house with 285 points. Their wisdom, thirst for knowledge and their ability to strategize and improvise is admirable, to say the least. I also want to acknowledge a phraise that a student said to me at the beginning of the year. It's not just the knowledge that counts, but rather it's how you use your knowledge that also counts. Wise words indeed. Finally, with 310 points, we have a house that has undergone a great evolution. A house that for ages has been seen as a place for only those who had a certain lineage, and those not of that lineage were lesser than. The students of this house have shown that cunning, ambition and strength do not come from one's lineage, but rather one's own person, and that negative beliefs and sentiments tought for generations can be broken. I'm proud to award the house cup to... Slytherin house!”

The hall erupts in a big cheer as Mcgonagall waves her wand and a flurry of green and silver decorates the hall with a painted snake slithering around the banners.

“WE DID IT AL!” Scorpius shouts as everyone stands up and high-fives, hugs or shakes each other's hands.

The girl a couple seats down has tears flowing down her face and a huge smile as she screams with pure joy.

“Well Father, we did it.” she whispers to herself.

A few minutes later, the graduating students all walk out on to the sweeping lawns next to the lake and sit downin chairs that had suddenly appeared there. Scorpius and Albus sit together, and the tall girl with the odd-looking hands sits next to them.

“Hello!” she says with a heavy Manchester accent.

“Hey Heather!” Scorpius says.

“Quite the year wasn't it?” Albus says high-fiving Heather.

“yeah it was!” Scorpius says, “I thought I'd get chewed out for not handing in that assignment for Longbottom but I didn't!”

Mcgonagall then comes out on to the lawn and all the 7th years fall silent.

Mcgonnagal then waves her wand and another rrow of chairs revealed to show all the family members of the graduating students sitting and beaming, laughing and in general elated for their sons, daughters, siblings and friends.

“When I call out your name, please come up to the front, and you'll see what happens. Rowen Anthony, of Gryffindor!”

A tall young man walks up from a back row to the podium and he is suddenly enveloped in golden light that forms into a broomstick shape with Rowen sitting on it as if flying. The light broom then becomes an actual fancy new broomstick with the words “ultra firebolt” in firey red and yellow letters.

Various students are called up, and when they are, the golden light becomes a gift that is related to the skill they best developed over the course of their time at the school. Some get fancy caldrons with hieroglyph-style writing on them, others get ultra firebolt broomsticks, others get random objects, and others still get golden telescopes or charmed objects.

“Heather Gaunt, from Slytherin.” McGonagall says.

The tall girl next to Scorpius gets up nervously, and walks to the podium and is enveloped in light. The light then becomes a gigantic snake in the shape of a g, then the gigantic snake becomes a green and silver translucent pendant with a small heart at the tale of the G.

“ms. Gaunt, this shows how you constantly strived to show the world that while your family has a past, that you are not that past. The heart is the kindness you have shown people and the willingness to love even those who have made fun of you in the past. I can safely say that you will be a great witch and an even better Gaunt.”

Several other students go up and receive their symbolic gifts, some objects they can use and others objects that best represent them.

“Scorpius Malfoy, of Slytherin!” mcgonagall says.

Scorpius walks up to the podium and feels a sensation of warmpth as the golden light envelopes him, and he steps out with a green and silver clock-shaped pendant with an S and a scorpion with a heart on its chest with the letter A inside the heart.

“This represents how you have been able to show not just Slytherin house but also all of Hogwarts that the greatest gift one can have is love, even when they are faced with judgement and loneliness from others. It also represents how you helped to ensure that time would always remain on the side of good, even if that meant sacrifice and loss.“

After several other students.

“Albus Potter, of Slytherin.”

Albus walks up and after being enveloped in the golden light, a bracelet appears on his right arm with a lightning bolt shape, the Slytherin snake in silver and green, and various shapes on the band.

“this shows your quick whit, your kindness and your refusal to cave even when judge by peers. I know that all of us are proud of all you have done. I also want to thank you for showing us that while we may not always be fond of past memories, that we can learn from them and that time will always lead us to the right path.”

After the rest of the students are given their gifts, they all gather at the lake where the boats they once arrived in, now somewhat larger are lined up.

“I'm proud of you Al!” Harry says as he helps Albus on to the boat.

Scorpius sees his father coming up to him.

“I know it's ockword.” Draco says, then he hugs his son, then shakes his hand and high-fives him, “Your mother would be so proud! And I'm proud too!”

“She said that Slytherin is evolving!” Scorpius says.

“Of course it is.” Draco says helping Scorpius into the boat. “They couldn't hate muggle borns for ever could they?”

The two high-five as the boats begin to move.

Heather looks towards Scorpius and joins them on their side.

“Where's your parents?” Scorpius asks.

“My father's dead but my mother, well, better she not be here, especially after what she did.”

“Sorry to hear about that.” Scorpius says.

“It's fine.”

The boats take off from the shore back towards the platform just as they did 7 years ago when all the students started at Hogwarts.
