There was a post yesterday for a PJxHP crossover fic and in the comments there was a mini argument (I joined in at the end) about how the PJ series would destroy the HP series and I agree it would. But it got me wondering is there any other series that would destroy or be destroyed if they were to somehow meet up/fight.


** A lot of 'verses have more powerful magic, but I think HP's selling point lies in its versatility and abstractness. What other magic system has a spell that can so completely hide a secret that, when properly cast, you can't even comprehend the fact that a secret is hidden? Instant teleportation? Tenfold dimensional expansion with a few words?

A lot of 'verses are more powerful in scale, but properly cast (and properly /extrapolated/, damn Rowling's reticence about worldbuilding to hell) HP magic can be both extremely versatile and extremely subtle.

*** I would say it another way : HP magic is the kind of magic that support a society, or more precisely most magic was discovered/created with the sustainment of a society in mind.\\
Rand Al Thor has the capacity to litterally destroy existence. Vin can see what her opponent will do in the immediate future and has the capacity to process it; and the Lord ruler and Sazed moved a whole planet. Gandalf goes against and survives a thousand years old demon. The wizard and witches of the Discworld consider breaking into hell a normal day-to-day occurence.\\
Every single one of these magic would just destroy Dumbledore or Voldemort. But none shows the capacity to support a society.

** Er, pretty much any sci-fi novel you care to speak of would destroy HP. There's not much a bunch of backwater technophobes can do about their planet being nuked from orbit. Bonus points for throwing HP into a fun 'verse like WH40K.

*** It's more a fantasy than sci-fi, but the /Inkworld/ trilogy by German author Cornelia Funke would also destroy HP, character power-wise. Why? Its main character, Meggie Folchart, and her father, Mortimer ("Mo"), have the ability to make any part, of /any/ book or written content, come into their reality by reading the words aloud. Despite being Muggles otherwise (though some in the Inkworld call Meggie a "witch"), their kind is called "Silvertongues", and they basically have the power of gods to make whatever's written exist. Had Meggie and her father existed in the HP world, they'd probably have to go into hiding like the Potters, as Voldemort (like the villain of /Inkheart/, Capricorn) would seek them out to force them into his servitude.

**** You think a society that writes with quills will know what a nuclear device or a fission reactor is? They barely understand electricity as it is. HP magic is powerful, but it's wielded by some of the most myopic, close-minded dunderheads I've ever seen in published fiction. No contest - Star Wars shows up, gets dismissed as uppity muggles by the idiots in charge, and blows up the wizards. Even your best case scenario cripples ONE world when the SW verse numbers in the thousands.

If HP Wizards think they're superior to muggles, that's because they are. As we see from the first chapter of HBP, the wizard government has the ability to control the muggle one freely and completely. They rearrange the British PM's schedule on a whim! But more importantly, Kingsley (future minister, btw) was stationed there by the ministry and had already become the PM's right hand man. He was so good at understanding muggles that even the Dursleys felt comfortable with him. Obliviators have been doing a perfect job of keeping the muggle world secret for years, and you can't do that without understanding technology. Dumbledore reads Muggle Newspapers regularly and had connected Frank Bryce's death with all that had been happening with Lord Voldemort.

TL;DR The average wizard may not know much about muggles, but there are plenty of people high up that do. I'm sure any threat posed by uppity muggles will be dealt with appropriately.

You don't need to know anything about critical mass or all that stuff. You need to know politics. The scientists are controlled by the Government, and the wizards control the Government. They possess tools that will always ensure that they remain in control. Hell, they can directly control the scientists if needed. No war between wizards and non-wizards will ever reach the state of direct war, because wizards would have won the war well before it begun.

Not to mention that it's a two-way relationship. The Muggle governments and militaries know as well, and unlike the Ministry of Magic are actually fairly competent and plan things ahead of time. Or do you think no militaries in the HP verse have anti-magical considerations?

And has potential AOEs so vast that it literally does not care about your country hopping (which, mind you, Wizards can't do without aids such as Portkeys)

Or most importantly, the part where the characters on the HP side are honestly amongst the biggest set of dunderheads to ever grace fiction

********* But the power balance is so unreal that it would only take one muggle born with a basic education to take down a death star, and really entire galaxies. The argument isn't at all about how stupid most wizards are, since it would literally take only one.

If you are interested in rationality, check out hpmor, written by one of the head advocates of Bayesian logic and more intelligent AI development. In it, he briefly touches on how a modern mind could really wreck shit in our world, which almost mirrors star wars but with the most powerful magicians lifting a plane, computerized systems that can't aim, and more natural resources than normal (enough metal to build a moon? Not efficient at all...)

All it would take is sending a timed dark matter bomb of arbitrary mass into the core of a ship.

Because this is something all wizards can do /s Never mind that explosive decompression would fuck the wizard's shit up anyway if they're on the same ship, and wizards have a space-time limit on their teleportation.

And ah yes, the fabled speed of thought, so overpowered against people that can literally move and react faster than eyesight. Poor wizard's head is going to be on the floor before he can think his pseudo-Latin.

Not to mention that magic and magic-like abilities are not exclusive to the HP world. In the EU Darth Vader has choked people to death from across the vast reaches of space.

A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Powerful, versatile magic isn't much of a help when you're so slow and so weak that your opponent can beat you to a bloody pulp before you can shoot off a spell.

I'm not sure bringing a god into the fight is...fair?...acceptable?...I don't know what I want to use here.

Madoka turns the Magical Girl setting into a terrifying concept with the end result being a goddess.

The implications of the HPverse versus other established verses is what Taure had pointed out.

We've yet to see wizards and witches become exhausted (in regards to their powers in HP because that isn't (so far) how their world is built. Other established works have set limits on these types of things (excluding god hood)

Since JKR hasn't built her world to include gods (again so far) we can't compare a universe where gods walk the verse to one where it doesn't.

Well. I mean, we can but gods always win in those match ups.
