§§ Note that "Powerful" is being used as a shorthand for 'magically proficient' here. This doesn't have to be "magical power" as understood with stories that have magical cores --- though it's fine if it is.§§

Shortly put, I was just wondering how you'd rank the most powerful wizards and witches we know from canon, by a loose definition that's /mostly/ based on their abilities in battle (so being a great alchemist but being rubbish with spells won't get you on the list --- looking at you, Flamel).

Without further ado, here's the way I feel they'd rank from most to least powerful:

 

*ESSENTIALLY A PHYSICAL GOD:*

Merlin.

*EXCEPTIONALLY POWERFUL:*

Albus Dumbledore, Lord Voldemort, the Hogwarts Founders, Gellert Grindelwald.

*SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE-AVERAGE WIZARDS:*

/Loosely by order of power:/

Severus Snape, "Mad-Eye" Moody, Bellatrix Lestrange, Minerva McGonagall, Filius Flitwick, Lily Evans, the Marauders, Barty Crouch Jr., Delphini Riddle, Adult!Twins, Adult!Harry, Adult!Hermione, Newton Scamander, Seraphina.


** Basically your list.

*Legendary status:* Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald

*Exceptional:* Snape, Moody, Bellatrix, McGonagall

*Probably Exceptional:* Sirius, Remus, James Potter, Lily Potter, most of the Order of the Phoenix, most of the upper echelon of Death Eaters, the Aurors

*On the best way:* Hermione, the Twins, Fleur

I excluded Harry because he basically doesn't give a shit about learning anything beyond the necessary. The pattern I see in the legendary ranking alone, is that all of them are one thing first and foremost: scholars. HP magic fuels itself with knowledge by a big margin. Willpower, strength of mind and concentration, and control over your emotions are big parts too, but for the most part magic is /knowing/ what to use, how to use it and when to use it.

*** Yup, we agree on most things, including the way magic works. And oops, I forgot Fleur! Shame on me! (I'd really put Flitwick in the "exceptional" or "probably exceptional" category though. He was a duelling champion for goodness' sake!)

As for Harry, as I noted, all the "child" characters were judged by their adult counterparts in my list. He was nothing special as a kid, but I assume he wised up with time, since Adult!Harry became Head of the Aurors Department, which, if it doesn't get you in at least 'Probably Exceptional', I don't know what does.

And concerning Harry... He never had to get his NEWTS to become that, if I recall correctly. Chances are that he never had to proof his academic skills to anyone. I don't know, but I kinda penned him down as "not interested". And apparently you /can/ take down a Dark Lord with schoolyard jinxes and a shitton of luck. Maybe he remained lucky. Maybe he learned on the job. Maybe Auror Academy drilled his lazy ass to some goddamn usable potion brewing. We'll probably never know.

** Most of the rankings here rank Hogwarts Founders next to Merlin, Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Riddle. But, what evidence is there for them being so powerful? Back when they were around, some spells in common in 20th century hadn't even been invented yet.

They were legends not for the magic they themselves could do but for the impact their organizational efforts have had on the subsequent generations.

*** I feel (and bear in mind this is personal speculation, not stone-hard canon) that while the average wizard (say, Arthur Weasley) of the 20th century is far more capable than the average wizard of the 13th century, the greatest magic has remained stable --- in that usually, what happens is that gifted geniuses are born, gain their own understanding of magic far beyond anything known at the time, create a couple of lasting artifacts, die, and what they created will live on to puzzle future generations. Thanks to Hogwarts spreading knowledge, this scheme is slowly fading away, with the knowledge of modern geniuses being passed on, but the point is that Rowena Ravenclaw could have advanced in some areas to the same stage as Dumbledore (remember no one apparently has any idea how to remake the Diadem or the Room of Requirements) without it lastingly impacting the wider world's magical knowledge. And she may have had a less magical everyday life, ironically lacking in everyday charms and potions, while being largely unhindered when it came to powerful magic.

As for the Room of Requirement, it's not much "smarter" than a talking portrait or a mirror that gives you fashion advice, and the rest is just lots of conjuration and perhaps a version of Undetectable Extension Charm. For that matter, we don't actually know when it was added. I wouldn't be surprised if recreating it were well within Dumbledore's capabilities, if not necessarily worth his time.

** I disagree with Lily being more powerful than Sirius and James. No evidence she was while there was evidence they were. What makes you think that? I would rank her just below them in the second category. She was only exceptional at Potions and she couldn't have dueled Voldemort three times and thwarted him. He'd have stomped her like a fly. As for being Head girl: that position isn't just for good grades. It's for decent grades, good leadership abilities and a good personality. There might've been tons of girls more exceptional and outstanding than her but were just socially awkward, downright racists or lazy and couldn't handle responsibility.

Voldemort could've just wanted to recruit Lily for her Potions abilities and not for dueling ones because that wouldn't be strategic. Voldemort can't only have good duelists. I personally believe Lily was only exceptional at Potions and slightly above average in DADA. Other than that I believe her grades were like Harry's.

Sirius and James were outstanding child prodigies.

We have to remember that Lily was dead and people would only rant about how intelligent, selfless, talented, powerful, beautiful, kind etc. she was. A lot of things would've been exaggerated. She was laos a Wizarding icon by then.

Take this brutal example: Hermione (not that I'm comparing Lily to Hermione, Hermione was better) is dead. How would she seem? Much more powerful than Merlin, I think because Harry and Ron would rant on about how amazing she was and exaggerate stuff.

*** You do make good points. As I said, the order inside that third category was /loose/, not strict. I more or less put here there because Lily was presumably more serious than Sirius, James and Peter, who, while in theory as or more talented than her, were probably spending more time Maraudering than they were studying. But you have a good case too. Anyway, the only thing I don't really agree in your comment:

#+begin_quote
  she couldn't have dueled Voldemort three times and thwarted him.

...What are you even saying here? We /know/ she /did/. Harry is born to "those" who have thrice defined the Dark Lord. It couldn't have been just James. Personally, I like to believe in at least one of those encounters James and Lily fought Voldemort /together/, allowing them to hold him off until Order reinforcements came in. This accounts for the "defied" him bit without conflicting with the fact that they couldn't have been Dumbledore-level.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The thrice defied part of the prophecy is vague. Do you honestly believe that Lily and James, together, fought Voldemort three times and defeated him? Nope. Lily and James were inexperienced teenagers barely out of school so they can't thwart Voldemort, who was in his /fifties/. Voldemort was a child prodigy. He was arguably more powerful than Dumbledore. If /Dumbledore/ had trouble holding off Voldemort then Lily and James certainly did. Let's face it: two teenagers with zero experience compared to one of the most powerful wizards in history aren't going to thwart him. Maybe they were held hostage by the Death Eaters but escaped against Voldemort's wishes. I see thrice defied as this, personally: Joining the Order, refusing Voldemort's offer to join him, and getting /married/.

The thrice defied thing is very vague and left to the imagination. For all we know they could've been cursing his mother at the top of their lungs in a huge battle for the Order or something. Like, all members were involved, the ministry, etc.

If they /did/ duel him (which I highly doubt) then I think it was this huge battle like /The Battle of Hogwarts/ where like, everyone, was holding him off or something. They were kids. Let's face it.

We actually have no evidence of Lily being more serious than Sirius and James. She seems like a mixture of Ginny and Tonks from her descriptions of her personality in canon. Relaxed, a tad too forgiving, extroverted, popular, very funny, goofy, vivacious, cheeky, lively and bubbly.

I'd go as far as to say that Lily didn't even read but would much rather party or take on a dare. She strikes me as someone who wants to live life to fullest. Someone who only focuses on the subjects that they excel at (Potions) and wouldn't care less if she flunked Transfiguration or not. But that's how I interpret her academic level.

I also think that Voldemort wanted to recruit Lily and James because the Potters were filthy rich and well-connected. So they'd give him advantages socially. Just like Lucius and Narcissa, who were incompetent (I'm not saying Lily and James weren't but they were just kids). Or he wanted Lily for her potion skills and James for his duelling ability.

Sirius and James /did/ receive straight 'O's after all. They were child prodigies. They didn't spend effort but were just naturally brilliant.

***** Hm... After summarily rescrutinizing canon, it is true nothing actually confirms my view of Lily as a "warmer" Hermione, rather than the Ginny/Tonks cross you describe. Then again, neither does anything contradict it. We /don't/ know what marks she got for her NEWTS. Allow me to list the arguments in favour of my interpretation --- though again, none is damning evidence and it could go either way.

- We know she had the same control over underage wandless magic that Tom Riddle had, though to a lesser extent, with the flower-petals thing.

- Petunia says she came home with "singing teapots" and she "turned teacups into rats", showing a proficiency with Charms and Transfiguration. Nothing beyond curriculum, but pretty good. Ollivander also describes her wand as "good for Charms", for what it's worth.

- She could cast the Patronus Charm, which, again, is meant to be pretty advanced (though that might have more to do with ability to focus on happiness than magical ability; canon is undecisive).

- There's the fish-transfiguration anecdote from the movies, too. If you accept it as canon, it also supports a well-roundedly competent Lily (Professor Slughorn unambiguously states that such a transfiguration was a "remarkable" bit of magic, so presumably not something on curriculum --- though I can see how this particular instance could fit into your "she's dead so people put her on a pedestal" interpretation).

- /She was recruited into the Order of the Phoenix/.

(By the way, the folks on the Wiki do hold the 'defying' to have been of a duelling nature.)

I don't consider the movies canon, they tend to glorify her more than the books. She did have control over underage magic but Riddle was using it quite differently and much more powerfully. Besides, we don't know because that was underage so how it actually evolved is unknown.

I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.

He took part in making the Map, /managed the insanely difficult Animagus transformation/, participated in countless elaborate Weasley-Twins-style pranks, was smart enough to cook up a successful way to fake his death in a short time-span (while presumably under incalculable stress, judging from his almost crippling cowardice), cast that advanced explosion curse Sirius was blamed for, and later very successfully helped Voldemort come back to life (first locating him, then successfully brewing the experimental potion that created Voldemort's temporary baby body and finally carrying out an old and powerful Dark Ritual). While he's pathetic in other regards (such as a complete lack of fortitude under threat), I'm really quite convinced Pettigrew was one heck of a wizard, magically speaking, though he may not have been as useful in the field as the other Marauders and DEs because of his fear.

Take Harry for example, it's not that he produces a patronus at thirteen that makes him powerful, as, if given the same learning at that age i'm sure someone like hermione could do it. What makes him powerful is that fact that he used it to drive off over a 100 dementors, which is something fully fledged adults, most likely including trained aurors, have trouble with.

Also as i said my list was brief so no Grindelwald, but he'd probably have to go in one of the top two, as I have no idea how much was power and how much was skill, having never read a description or seen him actually fight, but I'm assuming you have to be damn good to take on Dumbledore.

***** While there is a fair share of circumstantial evidence that could fit the "inherent power" idea, I (and the others in the "it's all skill and learning and anybody could do it" camp) hold that Harry's Patronus is a special case because it does not only take magic and the right words to cast it, but the right /emotion/. Someone of very pure heart with a great capacity for happiness would cast a vastly more powerful Patronus. For a matching reverse-example (opposite Harry's goodness shining through into a super-Patronus), take the story of the great historical Dark Wizard who tried to cast a Patronus and ended up producing a fully-corporeal degeneration of the spell that /ate him alive/.

Also, I was unaware of that reverse patronus. I assume it's on Pottermore? I accept it's 'canon' but honestly I don't use it nor read anything from there, especially since the whole sleakeasy thing.

** Voldemort>Dumbledore>Grindelwald*Snape>=McGonagall*Bellatrix/Molly/Sirius>>Harry>Ron/Hermione/Draco

These are the important characters we see duelling in canon, and I'm fairly certain this is more or less accurate.

Voldemort would have killed an Elder Wand wielding Dumbledore had it not been for Fawkes, so I think he should be first. Plus, if Duimbledore had been capable of beating him, he probably would have sometime. Grindelwald being number 3 is rather self-explanatory.

Snape and McGonagall are the only ones in canon outside the big three to use transfiguration and complex spellwork. McGonagall got the better of Snape in their duel after Flitwick's interference, but I get the feeling that Snape was holding back. She is also incapable of occlumency, which is a huge disadvantage when facing a skilled legilimens actually trying to kill you.

Bellatrix doesn't use complex spellwork, but instead relies on quickness and reflexes. Don't think she would stand much of a chance against more technique-oriented fighters like Snape or McG, but everyone else is fair game. Both Sirius and Molly hold their own against her. Sirius laughs instead of taking Bella seriously, and she does him in. Bella doesn't take Molly seriously, and Molly gets a spell past Bella's defenses.

Harry's position is also rather self-explanatory. Both Ron and Hermione do surprisingly well against Death Eaters in DH. Draco showed decent skill in his duel against Harry.

Flitwick would probably be somewhere around McG's level. Remus a bit below Sirius's level. Moody is described as very badass, but mostly loses a lot. May be he grew old? Dolohov killed the Prewett twins and Remus, but also lost to the trio, so I have no idea what that makes him.

When? The only time we saw Voldemort and Dumbledore duelling, in /Order of the Phoenix/, Dumbledore still had the upper hand even tough he had to protect Harry at the same time. He forcefully drove Tom away, and Voldemort notes that even then Dumbledore is /holding back/, not actually going in for the kill (because he knew it'd be futile with the Horcruxes).

As for Moody... yeah, he got old. He was /retired/, for goodness' sake. First-War!Moody must have been /very/ good, but thirty more years and one less leg do bring someone down. And Dolohov I assume lost quite a bit of his skill in Azkaban.

**** Fawkes took a killing curse for Dumbledore in the OotP fight.

#+begin_quote
  But even as he shouted, another jet of green light flew at Dumbledore from Voldemort's wand and the snake had struck.

  Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak wide and swallowed the jet of green light whole: he burst into flame and fell to the floor, small, wrinkled and flightless. At the same moment, Dumbledore brandished his wand in one long, fluid movement - the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke
#+end_quote

Voldemort managed to corner Dumbledore into a two-pronged attack. The snake was an instant away from striking Dumbledore when he managed to parry it. Had Fawkes not taken the killing curse, it would certainly have hit him. Although, I do wonder if Dumbledore could have disapparated in that time, or whether he would have been too slow or opened himself for further attack.

Dumbledore holding back is a fair point, but I think Dumbledore is skilled enough that he can fight for the kill or mere capture with similar effectiveness. Then again, may be not. He did not drive Voldemort away - the pain from possessing Harry (Dumbledore in HBP says that Voldemort had never experienced such pain) plus the threat of detection by aurors were bigger factors.

***** Ah, I'd forgotten that tidbit. Thank you. Though I'd argue, since he was the one who managed to tame Fawkes in the first place, this sort of trick might get a pass as being counted among Dumbledore's own powers. Besides, a single lucky shot (especially with a dealbreaker like the Killing Curse) is probably not enough to establish a clear-cut comparison between two duellists.

****** Yes, and he had to remove Bellatrix too. But both of those are trivial for someone of Voldemort or Dumbledore's level - all he had to do was to animate those statues with a flick of his wrist.

#+begin_quote
  Next second, he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his wand towards the remnants of the fountain. The other statues sprang to life. The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix, who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest, before it dived at her, pinning her to the floor.
#+end_quote

What Dumbledore did probably wouldn't take even a fraction of his concentration. I think Harry may have been a /distraction/, but I also think his presence was as much of a distraction for Voldemort as Dumbledore. Plus, Voldemort had to worry about the approach of the aurors, so he had to be distracted there as well.

  Snape>=McGonagall

I'd say Snape > McGonogall; he beat her in a duel in the Deathly Hallows, was DADA and Potions professor, spy, Dark Arts master, spell inventor, knew occulumency and legilimency, while McGonogall, we see as a Transfiguration Professor, but she could hold more than one patronus (to her credit).

****** What makes you think that? Snape was a superb legilimens, potioneer and occlumens. We have no evidence of him being a great duelist other than that duel with Minnie McG so his duelling feats are none. McGonagall would've beaten him. His job as a spy wasn't to practice duelling.
