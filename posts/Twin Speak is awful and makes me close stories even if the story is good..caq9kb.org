Someone recommended to me Runemaster as a Harry/Luna fic that I'd enjoy. Me being a Harry/Luna fanboy eagerly clicked on it. Only to close the story by the end of chapter 1 because of Fred and George.

"I hate it when..."

"Authors write them like..."

"This as if they are one character..."

"It screws with the flow..."

"Of the story and ruins..."

"My suspension or disbelief."


** Authors forget they speak in full sentences in the books for the most part. So it would be something like:

"I hate it when authors write them like this," Fred said. (I think he always speaks first.)

"Yeah, it screws with the flow of the story," George continued.

"And ruins the suspension of disbelief," they finished together.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

** Man I agree with this comment so much. I absolutely adore the dynamic of Fred and George together but I feel like they are never faithfully represented in slash (which I pretty much exclusively read) They're so frequently written as mindless sycophants to whoever the main pairing is. Just off-screen pranking and being the first to declare Harry as their Lord.

They're caricatures. Difficult to read, and it would be annoying to /speak/ that way too.
