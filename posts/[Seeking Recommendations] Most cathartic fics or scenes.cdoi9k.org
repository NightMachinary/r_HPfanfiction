** The Arithmancer and its sequel Lady Archimedes have some good revenge scenes. To understand, you have to know that Hermione in this story is absolutely horrified by the existence of Dementors and learning about them and their kiss leads her to have an existential crisis. Also, Umbridge tries to destroy Hermione's scientific career, making her lose out on the magical equivalent of the Fields Medal or even the Nobel Prize.

After witnessing Umbridge ordering the dementor's kiss, Hermione absolutely loses it and transfigures her into some sort of gibbering abomination. The only thing the healers can diagnose is that she is somehow still alive.

And the Dementors themselves get their comeuppance in the end as well, as Hermione develops a ritual to slay Dementors and release the souls trapped inside.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005;4655545), are the most comprehensive, most ruthless, and most systematic revenge fics I've ever read. The protagonists not only killed off their enemies, but also fundamentally changed their governing systems. "Reunion" further destroyed the Gringotts, while "Marriage Law Revolution" led to regime changes in several European countries. [[/spoiler][For example, Victor Krum was forced into a rebellion and he overthrew the Bulgarian Ministry]]

--------------

For the most gruesome revenge scene against Umbridge, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), is difficult to beat:

#+begin_quote
  “How did you kill her?”

  “I sneaked into her office, ambushed her while disillusioned. I used a Full Body-Bind Curse on her, then beat her to death with her own blood quill, transfigured into a golf club. Before the death blow, I obliviated her, so even if she became a ghost she'd not be able to reveal me. Then I vanished the body.”

  Hermione felt a shiver run down her spine. Extended answers under Veritaserum were very uncommon, as far as she knew. Allan must have wanted to tell this story. But he spoke of a ‘death blow', as if... “How often did you hit her before you killed her?”

  “I don't remember.”

  She winced. “What did you do to her before the death blow?”

  “I smashed her limbs, broke every bone in them, crippled her. Then I broke her hips and ribs, crushed her shoulders. I spared her spine, so she would live longer.”
#+end_quote

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward with Purpose Part I: Always and Always]], linkffn(4101650), has one nifty scene about executing some Death Eaters in Azkaban:

#+begin_quote
  "Pretoria," Neville said. The Death Eater screeched and fell to the ground. Her kneecap became suddenly unrecognizable -- the bones had been shattered. "I would have done it quickly if you'd lied," Neville told her. Harry, Mr. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie watched, completely silent, as Neville broke nearly every bone in Bellatrix's body.
#+end_quote

Excerpt From: Deadwoodpecker. “Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always.” iBooks.

--------------

But it's Hermione's slow integration of Bellatrix in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]], linkffn(11463030), that tops them all.

*** I feel like there is is a line between cathartic and just edgy crap. That first quote reminded me that I don't particularly like Starfox5's writing despite its objective quality. It just feels masturbatory as each injury is described.

The second really fits a cathartic theme. It gives enough vengeful violence without delving into torture porn. Makes sense, deadwoodpecker's Yellow Submarine if one of the few fics that I feel handles heavy subject matter with anything akin to a deft touch. Makes sense they'd do so well in another fic.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution) has revenge against the Wizengamot and its marriage law (by killing everyone) as well as telling off Dumbledore's portrait. It's after DH but before the epilogue. Then the scenes where they topple every pureblood government that doesn't like what they do are in a similar spirit.
