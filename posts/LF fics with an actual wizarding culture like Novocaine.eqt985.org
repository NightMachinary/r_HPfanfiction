I was re reading Novocaine and the one thing i really liked about the fic was the way wizarding culture was introduced like something some people did and some didn't and that it had nothing to do with blood purity and more to do with the fact that it was passed down by word of mouth so it wasn't that open and that James and Lily both followed those traditions

Are there more fics like that? doesnt matter what era

no slash no bashing


** I haven't read Novocaine, as I generally seek out completed stories, but based on what you're describing I enjoyed the Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven series by BakenandEggs. In my notes I keep to remind me of what I've read, I wrote, "This was an interesting story with a far more developed Traditional culture, in which Harry is a Ravenclaw. There is a traditional hierarchy among the old houses, and Harry find his family sits high in it. There is some ongoing fighting between Traditionalists and Anti-Traditionalists. Ron-bashing, Dumbledore-bashing." So, it doesn't meet your non-bashing requirements, but I thought I'd mention it anyway.
