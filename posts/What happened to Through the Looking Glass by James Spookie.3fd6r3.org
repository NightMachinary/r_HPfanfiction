I missed the last chapter and suddenly it's been taken down. Apparently the last chapter went a bit off the wire, readers where pretty universally hateful and disgusted, and the author decided to take the whole thing down.

So, anyone know what the big deal with the last chapter was?


** Here's a link to the last chapter on FictionHunt.

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/11072187/12][Through the Looking Glass: Chapter 12]]

Edit: Just read it myself and I have to agree that it's not exactly his finest work.

*** Yeah. I would have stopped reading there if the story hadn't been taken down.

Although I agree that Harry and Hermione getting together would have been ridiculous the way he went about changing that - Harry can't have Hermione so he needs a new girl, I've selected a new girl!, here's the new girl! - was sloppy at best.

**** I'd have stopped reading as soon as it was revealed that Hermione is apparently incapable of staying in Hogwarts without Harry's amazing presence.

Frankly, I think that Spookie should not write fics involving Hermione. He seems to be constitutionally incapable of writing her without taking away her agency so that The Mighty and Benevolent Harry Potter could swoop in and rescue her.

Why, oh why did I click on that link?!

****** James, that was hyperbole, which most people (who could read English) would have no trouble parsing. I'll try to explain in more direct terms. Relative to canon, the only major change in Hermione's first two months at Hogwarts was the absence of Harry. She dropped out, which she did not do in canon. Therefore, at least judging by this fic, Hermione drops out /because/ Harry isn't there.

#+end_quote

Not quite. /You/ chose to put her in that situation, and /you/ chose to have her make that "choice", despite it being pretty OOC behavior for her. If nothing else, consider her infamous line, "We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled.": she considers being kicked out of the wizarding world a fate worse than death. Being made fun of by Ron (which, by the way, would be OOC for him to do, unless /she/ bothered him with her unwanted helpfulness) does not qualify.

*** Interesting. I can understand the backlash over the ending of that chapter - I dislike it, too.

He changed it in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11420452/12/Through-The-Looking-Glass][the repost at FFN]]. Much better IMO.

I'm a bit sad, always looked forward to it updating.

  "In Regards to the disappearance of Through The Looking Glass, apparently the last chapter really alienated, well, all of its readers. no one was willing to give it a chance and most all of its readers unfollowed and just were disgusted by it. Hey, at least i didn't get death threats this time... Anyway, i'll finish it on my own because i like it and when it's complete, i'll decide what to do with it. Sorry, but it just isn't worth the drams and hate. it's just a stupid story.

  And No, I'm not going to send out copies so please stop asking."

****** Ahh my bad.

Basically at the end, Hermionie was given a letter from Lily asking for her to come meet Harry. She decides that since Harry is basically a stranger (from a different dimension as well!!?) that she wants to stay away from magic, so she ignores it. I believe that's what got everyone hating it.

** as the author, I feel slightly insulted by the insinuation that I can't write Hermione without harry saving her. I've done it once and it was more about both Harry and Hermione learning from each other. This new story Hermione is much better off for leaving the magical world. Also, If Harry wanted Hermione, I could make that happen, but he knows it would be weird and he wouldn't like her for her, but what she reminded him of.

*** Hey, thanks for commenting. I agree that Harry and Hermione getting together would be weird, but I don't think that introducing some new girl at the very beginning of the chapter was particularly elegant.

I think I probably would have stopped reading after the unedited 12th chapter because of Lily's comments about being disgusted with Harry for trying to commit suicide.

I don't think that anybody's saying that you can't (outside of snark and hyperbole). Of course you can. You are physically and cognitively capable of typing almost anything, including a fic where Hermione is a significant character, yet does not need to be rescued by Harry (or, if she does, she gets to return the favor about as often). It's that you repeatedly /choose/ not to.

#+begin_quote
  I've done it once and it was more about both Harry and Hermione learning from each other.
#+end_quote

Well, there's the whole of WWFF and the TtLG Chapter 9 incident. So, that's two, at least. As for them learning from each other, there was some of that, yes, but 1) it was accompanied by Harry actually physically rescuing her from bullies or avenging her; and 2) what Harry learned from Hermione, he could have learned from any decent friend; there was little Hermione in that.

#+begin_quote
  This new story Hermione is much better off for leaving the magical world.
#+end_quote

That, again, is a decision /you/ made. If you subtract Harry, a thousand options remain. Hermione could make friends in other houses --- as Ravenclaws would respect her intelligence and Hufflepuffs her industriousness and helpfulness; Hermione could latch on to McGonagall and focus on her studies, and be busy working on her Animagus transformation when Harry shows up; Hermione could become a target of bullying, and end up showing her bullies that "Knowledge is Power" is not just a pithy expression when wands are involved, gaining a reputation as a dangerous loner. However, /you chose/ the (OOC, in my opinion) option where she disempowers herself and has to be rescued from some Muggle thugs by the Mighty Harry Potter.

#+begin_quote
  Also, If Harry wanted Hermione, I could make that happen, but he knows it would be weird and he wouldn't like her for her, but what she reminded him of.
#+end_quote

Eh... Myself, I don't particularly care whether or not you pair them up. Frankly, at this point in the story, I'd rather you not.

*** My difficulty with the story is less the suicide angst (which, while tiresome twelve chapters in, isn't quite enough to make me close up shop) and more the ham-handed way you've handed everyone idiot balls. This, together with some contrived plot lines--for instance, slaying the basilisk in exactly the same way as in canon--strains credulity. Additionally, you have subplots that appear wholly elective (the "this world" Hermione subplot, e.g.) and do little for cohesion.
