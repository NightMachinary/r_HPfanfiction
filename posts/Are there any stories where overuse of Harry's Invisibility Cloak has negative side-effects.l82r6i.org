** Based on this Dumbledore quote;

‘Strange how short-sighted being invisible can make you.'

And further based on older discussions, I am of the opinion that the Hallows don't have negative consequences to the owners health directly, but rather try to entice the owner into the grasp of Death. The wand was requested by a Antioch Peverell, a ‘combative' man, therefore it will make the bearer more likely to put themselves in those situations directly, a violent death. Cadmus, ‘an arrogant man' requested the stone which if the bearer is arrogant enough to fully understand what they are doing by using it; They will feel a continuous ‘Call of the Void' until they act on it. Ignotus, ‘The youngest and the wisest of the three' requested the cloak and gave it to his son on his death bed. The cloak is the most unassuming but also the most insidious of the Hallows. It will lead it's bearer into increasingly reckless situations and influence the Bearer to make more rash decisions, like a devil on the shoulder.

This is how I interpret the line ‘Use it well' You have to be on your guard most with the cloak. I also think that being of Peverell blood might influence something in some way. Not in a Superpower way but a curse, though some may call it a blessing, something that makes the cloak keen to return to Ignotus' line hence it's semi-mysterious return on a few occasions. Realistically, it was Dumbledore, but the Wizarding World literally has Physical entities of the literal concepts of Time and Love, why not stretch it further? This I think works really well with both interpretations of the Tale. If Ignotus created it then something linking it to his line might make sense. If they are actually from some deific personification of Death, then it has taken some interest here.

I find the Deathly Hallows to be a really interesting part of the story. What does it mean to be ‘Hallowed by Death?' Death being the central figure of a wizarding pseudo-religion is really intriguing to me.

*** Anything that tries to deny death is usually regarded as the worst forms of Dark Magic, though that may have more to do with the atrocities that must be commited in the process, seeing as anyone who creates a horcrux is a cold-blooded murderer.

**** I think you are right in your second guess about the atrocities, Flammel's creation was a world wonder after all. And it allowed he and his wife to deny death for as long as they wished. (Although I read a story once where the stone was picked apart and found to have been made with thousands of the sacrificed souls of men women and children)

***** There's one I read that had the actual "stone" be just a fancy rock, to distract from what the Flamels were truly doing: sacrificing the souls and existence of their unborn children to absorb the lifespan of the person that could have been. Every 50 years, they would do this, splitting that hypothetical lifeforce between them and causing a stillbirth.

It was dark as fuck.

*** And I'd play them straight instead.

Wand would indeed make the user invincible in a duel, even against the Death itself - but do nothing to prevent it being taken, or the wearer dying to a danger they'd not forseen. There would be no curse, save the illusion of invincibility borne of experience, a continous string of victories preventing the wirlder of the Deathstick from ever learning humility.

Stone would indeed call back the dead - but not restore their bodies, long decayed, not destroy the sense of belonging to the Other Side. There too, a curse was absent. But as the Second asked for ability to deny the laws of death, so he got that. And while there was no divine retribution coming, no part of his wish requested protection for those he'd call up - and so there was none. They would always long for the Afterworld.

The cloak was perhaps the most insidious - it provided genuine protection from Death for its wielder. Where Ignotus went, Death could not follow... Here too, there was no curse. But while it is easy to fear the Reaper when it stands above you in all its glory and holds your life in its hands. It is harder to take them seriously when they stumble around like a man devoid of sight - swaying around and walking into walls and crawling right past their target without noticing them... There is no magic here, no compulsion... Just Death's willingness to drop to her knees and be humiliated. Endure every indignity and insult. So pathetic. So powerless. And in doing so erode the last vestiges of self-preservation and justified fear in the bearer of Cloak.

And so, the one best protected against Death's gaze is not protected from their own. Devoid of fear, they walk to their doom with a smile.

** I read a story once where the Cloak was actually just as insidious as the Wand and the Stone. Basically, it /seemed/ to help owners survive but when looked at over generations, all the Potters who used the Cloak died way sooner than they should have, and almost never of natural causes. The Cloak was always there for its owner, except when they needed it most (James Potter not having the Cloak when Voldemort came to Godric's Hollow anyone?).

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

**** Actually, the Fallout series (video games) do that. In the series, there's a species called the Supermutants, who originally were humans who were mutated. They are bigger and stronger than regular humans, but generally complete idiots, very aggressive and very intent to either mutate other humans into fellow Supermutants (Supermutants are sterile) or eat them. Anyway, amongst them is a special type called the Nightkin. In this universe, there's an object called a Stealthboy that allows its wearer to be invisible. Nightkin use them constantly and it affected both their biology by turning their green skin grey (and thicker skin and other stuff). But more importantly, it made them developed mental instability such as schizophrenia, delusions, split personalities. The more they use it, the worse it gets.

A constant use of the Invisibility Cloak could do something like that. For exemple, Harry could begin developing an aversion to be seen and other mental disorders related to that. In a particular cruel type of negative side-effects, when the user wears it constantly, it could eventually alter how other people perceive them. As in, eventually, in the worst case, other people wouldn't be able to see the wearer at all, even with the cloak off (as if there was a field over the wearer that would stop people to be able to pay attention to/see them).

*** Well we only see the invisibility used as a spying/sneaking tool but invisibility in real world conversation is typically associated with people who lack confidence so much that nobody even pays attention to them. So maybe the more you stay invisible, the more addicted you become to going about unnoticed to the point that if you wear it too much you become so isolated that you don't feel like ever taking it off.
