Seen several fics now where Snape treats Harry like utter shit, and then Harry APOLOGISES. Snape verbally harrasses Harry constantly, vanishes Harry's perfectly good potion and Harry walks out? 2 Chapters later, Harry apologises to Snape as if Harry was in the wrong.

I don't want to read Jesus Potter, I want to see Snarky bastard Harry that can't be bothered with the shit that people give him. I don't think I've even seen a fic where someone calls out the Twins in First Year for being hypocritical dickbags.

Fred and George, who lose points constantly, treat Harry badly, not even referring to him by name during Quidditch, to the point Harry wanted to quit.

  But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn't speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him "the Seeker. "

That's just ridiculously hypocritical. So they lost 150 points, whoop tee fucking doo. No one ever gives a shit about point loss for the rest of the entire book series. Snape takes points off of people for breathing too loudly, and yet the 2 "Pranksters" got pissy about first years losing points.

Yea - He does that in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3933832/1/][Harry Potter and the Invincible TechnoMage]] chapters 2 and 3. Snape destroys Harry's Datapad and then the next day Harry apologizes to him. Such utter crap. It pisses me off so much that I end up dropping the story at that point every time I try to read it.

After all, growing up with Tony Stark as your father would teach you to let people walk all over you and get away with destroying your stuff, right? Tony Stark is well known for his kind and gentle nature.

*** It's abandoned, no real use in trying to read past that point anyways. It's taken nearly 11 years to get where it is now, and the author has 40 other stories they're not gonna finish as well.

** Jbern generally treats the Twins how you see them. There's also linkffn(9198497), although that one has choppy writing and seems to quote another author verbatim for the first chapter.

  What if after loosing the hundred and fifty points in first year Harry's housemates took a more,... violent approach against him. Will contain bashing of a lot of people and eventual Super Harry but he has to earn it.
