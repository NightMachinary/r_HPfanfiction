It seems like in the HP fanfiction community, if someone is going to write a gender bender fic they follow one of two paths in regard to Harry's name. Either Harry is named Harriet, or Harry is given a flower name (Iris, Jasmine, etc) to fit with the apparent Evans family naming convention. As a name, Iris Lily Potter works for me for the same reason that Orestes Granger does: it's selecting the name based on textual clues about what sort of names the parents would select for their children.

That being said, I've seen some complaints recently about the use of flower names, and wanted to propose an alternative strategy. We have very few clues about what sorts of things James and Lily value, but the popularity of names have been fairly well charted in the last 120-ish years, so I tried to use James and Lily's selection of the name Harry as an indicator of how much of a slave to naming trends the Potters were.

In the UK, Harry is a name that was in the top 20 baby names in 1904, and steadily lost popularity every decade until it fell out of the top 100 around 1954. The name then reappeared in the top 30 in 1994. In terms of their naming conventions, James and Lily were 30 years behind and 10 years ahead of the trends. I used [[https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/articles/babynamessince1904howhasyoursperformed/2016-09-02][this tool]] to look for female names that had a similar path to Harry.

If you're sick of Harriet and Jasmine but still want to write a fem!Harry story (and please do, because I want more), may I suggest Florence, Ellen, Emily, Grace, Eva, Amy, or Charlotte. Incidentally, there are four flower names (Violet, Ivy, Lily, and Daisy) that fit the trend enough that they could have made my list if I wasn't specifically avoiding them. I still suggest Lily as a middle name (cuz James), though if you want to be a rebel you could go for James' mother's name, which is Dorea (fanon) or Euphemia (canon-ish).


** Interesting post.

I agree with you that Harriet sucks.

My favorites are Holly, Iris, Rose, and Violet. But if her middle name is Lily, I can see her first name using one from her father's side. Dorea/Euphemia Lily Potter is definitely a possibility.

** Yeah, in my opinion the most important thing is for the name to sound /normal./ Petunia comments on this at the beginning of the series (“Nasty, common, name, if you ask me”) and there's a clear contrast drawn between Harry and the types of names favored by purebloods. Giving her an exceptional name implies a very different thought process for James and Lily.

*** I recommend [[http://www.babynamewizard.com/archives/2010/4/the-generational-sweet-spot-or-why-your-parents-have-such-bad-taste][this post]] about baby names. Names seem to follow a cycle of 4 generations in popularity, so it could be that Petunia thinks Harry is nasty and common precisely because it's a name of their parents' and grandparents' generations, which, as the writer says, sounds "boring" and "old." From this perspective, matching the pattern in the naming trends is a good way to go.

Apart from Draco, almost everyone in Harry's year has ‘normal' English names. You seem to completely ignore their examples such as Greg Goyle, Daphne Greengrass, Pansy Parkinson, and Vincent Crabbe.

****** I'm not ignoring them, I'm using stronger examples to argue my point. Harry's classmates have more normal names because Rowling wants to make the story as relatable as possible, so she limited the truly exceptional names to one, Draco. There's yet another name comment on their first train ride, when Ron laughs at Draco's name. Even among those others you've mentioned, there's a difference between Gregory (/not/ Greg), Vincent, Daphne, and Harry.

I'm a little confused as to what you're arguing, honestly. Do you really not believe that Rowling intended to make a clear difference between “magical” names and “normal” names?

No, I don't believe it. For older generations maybe, but the change is very obvious in younger generations, since even Death Eater spawns have the same normal anglicized names (with the exception of Draco Malfoy). Ironically, the top Muggleborn in the story has a very old pureblood sounding name.

*** I too found Victoria Potter to be a breath of fresh air, haha.

That is kind of the core problem with fanfiction as a community. Something original that's read by a lot of people has its unique elements stripped out and dumped into the trope sludge and then people with no actual ideas for their stories just vomit the tropes into countless interchangeable fics until we're all sick of them. The problem is figuring out who predates the trope swarm, and figuring out who may be using a trope but is doing it artfully or for a good reason.

To be realistic, I think that's exactly what happened with Harriet, even though I do think that it was a bad and lazy choice the very first time someone did it.

** While I do tend to like the flower names of fem!Harry, for the sake of discussion I'll say that we really don't have any reason to believe that the Evans family had a naming tradition at all. Flower names for girls are common and a pair of parents deciding to give their childrens' names a theme doesn't mean it's a tradition. For example, I know of three siblings with names all starting with "J" but that wasn't tradition, just the parents' choice. The Evanses were just your average muggle family too.

That said, according to the canon-ish Pottermore, James Potter's grandfather was called Henry but went by Harry so if there is any naming tradition at work then it's likely on James's side which would lend fem!Harry to be called Iolanthe, Euphemia, Dorea, or after an unnamed Potter relative.

But all three of those women married into the family and we don't have examples of any Potter daughters to go off of. The names of modern day Potter sons we have are Henry, James, and Harry, Fleamont not counting as he was named for his grandmother's maiden name.

If fem!Harry's name is based on tradition then it would be a name with similar origin to one of those, and wizarding families in general appear to have a tradition regarding middle names. Firstborns are named after their parent (Sirius Orion, Harry James, William Arthur, Ginevra Molly, Albus Percival) however there are exceptions (Tom Marvolo, Fleur Isabelle, Remus John) so it is likely that fem!Harry's middle name would be Lily.

Personally, I like the name Iolanthe, however unlikely it is to be used. It's both a Potter ancestor name and a flower name and it can be shortened to just first two syllables which would be pronounced like "Aya"

I read one where her name was Mary Jane Potter, Mary seeming like a Potter-ish name but then Mary Jane turning it into not quite a flower name, but at least a plant, and the implication was funny.

Holly is good too. Similar to Harry but different enough that it doesn't make Lily and James seem like lazy baby namers:

"We'll name him Harry."

"And if it's a girl?"

"...Harriet."

The names tend to influence how I read the character too, with female variations on "Harry" reading more as being the same character we know, but as a girl, while names more distant to that read more as "Lily and James had a daughter instead of Harry."

Both of those have their strengths.

I really like etymology and name discussion.

** My personal preference for Fem!Harry is Holly, both because it sounds the most similar to Harry and because it matches her wand. Even though it didn't appear in the top 100 at all until 1983, that sounds like exactly the kind of thing JKR would do.

(Also for similarity reasons, I would use Daisy for a Fem!Dudley or a second Dursley child. That probably would have been unique enough for Petunia at the time based on the chart.)

*** It's been around since 2011. linkffn(6893492)

I'd say it originated in HP crossover fics where Harry needs a different name to fit in with the characters of the cast, where "Harry" sticks out when everyone else is "Sayuri-san" or "Ellesmira". Obviously, the authors of those fics don't care about retaining the spirit, tone, and characterization of the original, which is why it doesn't matter to them that Harry always imagined himself to be "Just Harry", and cared more about having a family than being famous and cool.

From crossovers, it was watered down to fantasy AU's where creature inheritances exist, and down to your everyday genderflip AU's.

** Harriet is bad, only as it is read as 'Harry-et', rather than the actual pronounciation.

Harriet (or Harriot/Harriott) is however, quite an old fashioned British name, and while Harry is a shortening and casualising of another traditional, old fashioned name (Harold), Harriet doesn't lend itself to shortening as well.

A good alternative that both fits the old fashioned orgin if Harry's name, and the shortening/casualising of it, would be Harleen/Harley, but that probably wouldn't be popular for obvious reasons.

I think it's all pronounciation any way, if Harriet was read correctly ([[https://youtu.be/1fz1QAds9Wo]]) it wouldn't be much of an issue.

Side note, Hermes (pronounced Her-mees) and Veronica are best names for a genderbent Hermione or Ron, and no one can tell me otherwise.

** I hate the flower names, like I get that Lily and Petunia were named after flowers, but whose to say that their mom was? Or their grandmother or whoever else? I honestly don't see Lily or Petunia using a flower name for their female child, if they were to have one.

I like the name Sophia or Elizabeth for a female Harry. Elizabeth, you can shorten in a couple of different ways, and they both roll off the tongue nicely.

I hate Harriet, because it's just such a cheap pull to Harry, oh her name can be shortened to Harry! I also don't like Rose or Iris for a female Harry, just doesn't fit.

If I have to use a name like a type of flower or whatever, I don't mind Holly, but even that is just kind same-y or whatever.

But then again you don't want a crazy name like Primrose or something, pretty name, but just wouldn't fit a female Harry Potter (imo)

I have a rather unique name that I hate, I hate it because my mom decided to name my two sisters normal names, and gave me the odd one. So I could see someone like Hermione hate her name, but not want it shortened or anything, but would want to name her children somewhat normal names. (Maybe that's why they chose Rose and Hugo for their kids names). While Hugo is different enough, it's still kind of normal enough as well).

I tend to stick with Sophia or Elizabeth myself, when naming a female Harry, when I first started writing female Harry, I used Holly; but now, it's a nice name, but I just don't like it for a female Harry.

*** Why thank you for asking. I went through my FFN favorites, and this is what I came up with. You've probably read most/all of these, but /shrug/

linkffn(9860311) is my pick for best fic, period. A Long Journey Home has everything you could want in a fic except for a regular update schedule. I don't want to say any details about it because I don't want to ruin anything or put my own slant on anything.

linkffn(9911469) Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus is this incredible surrealist comedy that still has phenomenal dramatic moments. There's a line later in the story that I love so much that I have to share it. To set the scene, two characters who know each other intimately begin to fight,

#+end_quote

I don't want anyone to interpret what I'm about to say as putting any authors down, because there are so many amazing people who write in this community and I couldn't do a hundredth as good a job if I tried (and even worse I've never actually tried), but the writing in this story is on another level. Surrealism and comedy are so hard to actually do well, but this works for me completely. It isn't something you find often, and the fact that it's free on the internet for all of us is frankly astounding.

linkffn(12713828) Victoria Potter is one of those fics where you read it and you're like, this is the apotheosis of so many concepts that have been floating around in this community. I'm so glad to have finally found someone (this subreddit's very own Taure, in fact) who can do pull this off. That probably sounds like I'm saying it's unoriginal, which couldn't be further from the truth. The only reason this one isn't listed first is because there are two other astoundingly great fics in the same category.

linkffn(11197701) Yule Ball Panic is the start of a three part story. I haven't read it in a long time, but from what I remember it's a really charming story about love. That isn't to say that there isn't a plot, just that the key theme is love.

linkffn(4916690) I'm sort of hesitant to recommend Holly Evans and the Spiral Path because even though I really enjoyed it, it's insanely sexual as it goes forward, and a lot of really dark things happen. Like if I described the events I'm thinking of you almost certainly wouldn't read it. A great deal of it is told as Holly writing in a journal that McGonagall gives her to communicate with her half brother Harry Potter (who is living in seclusion and can't take visitors) as a way to be closer to each other. I get that that isn't really fem!Harry story per se, but I'm counting it because Harry isn't there, and Holly is at Hogwarts, friends with Hermione, the whole nine yards.

Honorable mention: Even though it's a canon-compliant fic set in America years after the books ended featuring none of the original cast rather than a fem!Harry story, I can't help but recommend Alexandra Quick because it's really great, and the protagonist is my favorite brand of plucky heroine. linkffn(3964606) Alexandra Quick is actually the first fan fiction that I read (well, technically HPMoR was the first, but I don't count that because I read it in spite of the fact that it was fan fiction, not because of it), and I think it still holds up. JKR's version of America kinda blows in comparison to AQ's, in my opinion anyway.

** I always found Harriet to be just lazy -- basically Harry modified to fit a female.

For some reason, Violet is stuck in my headcanon as Lily's mother (unsure if she has a canon name), probably originates in some fic featuring her prominently. This makes it a rather likely fem!Harry name if I was trying to not just select the first name that pops into my head but try to consider the actual ramifications (IIRC the Evans parents dies around 1978-1979, making it plausible for Lily and James to name their offspring to honor them).

When I think "fem!Harry name", my first go-to is always Rose Lily Potter. Yeah, a flower name, I'm boring like that.
