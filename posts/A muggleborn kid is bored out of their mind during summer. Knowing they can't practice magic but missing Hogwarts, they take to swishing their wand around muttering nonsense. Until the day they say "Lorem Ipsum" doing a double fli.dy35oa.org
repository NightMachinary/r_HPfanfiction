** A stand-in spell that can be replaced with a real spell later.

The spell is inserted in to the timeline at the moment Lorem Ipsum was cast, essentially allowing you to send spells back in time, or from another perspective, open a window to receive communication from your future self.

Also handy if you don't know the right spell for the current situation, but can go practice it later.

** It references a nonsense Latin phrase used in typesetting to showcase typefaces originally taken (and changed) from a phrase written by Cicero in 45 BCE that translates to: "There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it simply because it is pain."

Cast this spell as a counter to the Cruciatus - it absorbs the pain like a sponge and vanishes it.

This prompt oddly reminds me of "Hello" scene from "Evil Overlord List"

** Did some quick research, turns out that "dolorem ipsum" is Latin for "the pain" according to Google Translate. (So take that with a grain of salt.)

Thus, the spell inflicts pain.

Turns out the spell is a dark curse that was the inspiration for the Cruciatus curse. Aurors rush into the scene and berate the kid for both messing with unknown spells, wasting a bunch of ministry funds, and casting a dark curse.

The kid is let off with a warning.

** The spell creates a void in reality the size of the student's hand, which just stays there spewing gibberish and slowly growing. When they come back next year, it's as big as their head. The year after, it's as big as a cat. By their seventh year, the void could encompass a house, and the world just twists and stretches around it to make room. They have tried to remove it, to no avail. Them one day, they incant "Control-C! Control-V!" And the rift is replaced with a copy of their house.
