For those who don't know , wolfstar is Remus/Sirius , the only Wolfstar fic I've read had it as a background comedy thing , please send me some good wolfstar fics.


** There are a /lot/ of Remus/Sirius fics out there. Do you have a preference for era (Hogwarts, first war, book era) or genre (angst, fluff, etc), or anything else that would narrow your request a little?

**** I don't read a ton of Remus/Sirius fics, so I can't really say if these are regarded as "the best," but I enjoyed them:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12540852][They're Hiding Inside Me]] linkao3(12540852) - dark, note the warnings
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5204258][annual honesty]] linkao3(5204258) - oneshot
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1110486][the lost generation]] linkao3(1110486) - WIP, ensemble cast with all the Marauders + Lily

And if you're into angst, then these two fics with a past Remus/Sirius relationship are quite good:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3225137][the aftermath.]] linkao3(3225137) - oneshot
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/235547][The Prisoner's Remorse]] linkao3(235547) - oneshot

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

  “It is hard to keep the truth from clever friends,” Dumbledore had said, first. “I had hoped --”Remus had looked down at his hands. There were little, half-moon scars around his knuckles, too inconsequential to see unless light hit them at an angle and made them silvery with scar tissue. He wondered if other werewolves had these scars too, whether they were a telltale sign too mundane to have made it into the textbooks.Remus had hoped, too.

  Remus lives a quiet life after the war. He works on his book, thinks of the past, and spends all his spare moments with Sirius. It all seems so perfect. Only when have things ever been perfect?A story of friendship, loss, second chances, and a complicated love that endures beyond reason.
