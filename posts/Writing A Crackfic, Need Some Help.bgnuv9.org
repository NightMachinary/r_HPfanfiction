So I was writing a Crackfic parodying a "11 year old Harry Potter merges with his alternate self" in which, yes that happened, but it also happened to every other first year right after the sorting finished, and the type of world the alternate came from depended on their house. They would still embody the traits that their houses focus on, it would just be really twisted.

Slytherins are from a Xianxia cultivation world, where everyone is subtle and cunning around other cultivators, but the moment they see a mortal they basically become Gryffindors because of their immense pride.

Hufflepuffs are holy paladins, but every one is from a different religion that thinks they're the one true religion. They're very loyal to their religion, and hard-working to see it's upheld.

Ravenclaws just come from a super high tech world. Yes they're studious, but magic really doesn't interest them and they're always busy with technology that really shouldn't work at Hogwarts, but works anyway.

I got this far and realized I have no idea what to do for Gryffindor. Any ideas?


** make em like a gang of barbarians or something, running into situation yelling and screaming of their bravery

** Maybe the mentality of "Isekai" character from Japanese novels.

So fairly normal (for high scholers at least) , but each of them had died and met God, who brought them back with one special "Cheat" ability. Give them an ultimate Plot Armor while you are at it (like every Gryffindor go to the forbiden 3rd Floor corridor, meet Fluffy and every time Fluffy is tamed by the student for the night).

** Make them into samurai who follow the strict samurai code and commit ritual suicide when they are dishonored. And then to mix it up, make them belong to different clans so that they are constantly fighting each other ala warring states period until some Nobunaga or Tokugawa figure unites them all.

** First thought is straight up knights/heroes type, or some variety of police force.

More far-out-there ideas include a downtrodden-dystopia style rebel force, extreme sports fanatics/daredevils, or controversial political commentators.

*** But they're supposed to be twisted to the standards of a different world, so that they seem nothing like they should normally have.

** GTA character Or undertale esque.... Where they are filled with determination.

Mainly I like the isekai

A heroic character/ Gamer that has a Quest tab and Appreciate ability that states the obviousbut no map, no power ups but has Honor counters that one accumulate that can be traded for an object in virtual shop or a Title.. it has Daily mission, special mission, quick time event, Random encounters and boss fights.... It could be a reason why eryone assumes Harry will be a grifindor since he has a title.... Fun titles like, Ferret boy, Bottomless pit, It needs more clashing colors, kilts are not skirts, in love with the floor

The Marauder's official title is Star of Misfortune, Deerly Beloved, a Literal Son Of a Bitch, Et tu Brutus

** - Standard Shonen protagonist tropes (e.g. Naruto)

- If you're familiar with Discworld, the Wizards of Unseen University, Vimes, Cohen the Barbarian and crew...
