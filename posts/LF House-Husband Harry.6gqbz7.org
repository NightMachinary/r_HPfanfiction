So I'm actually surprised I haven't run into this anywhere. Maybe it is because Harry is so set on being an Auror in the books. Plus I'm pretty sure its written somewhere it isn't a fate given to main characters. But still, anyone read anything good that has Harry ending up as the domestic spouse / not primary breadwinner?

This could be as simple as his career actively taking a backseat to his spouse, being a stay-at-home dad, or anything similar.

Given the amount of non-traditional households represented in HPFanfiction, I'm surprised I haven't run into this.

For obvious reasons, M/M and Harem don't really apply, as they are not really breaking away from the nuclear family concept in that way. Fem-Harry also probably doesn't make sense for this either ("Hey we swapped everyone's genders, and the results happen to have the same family dynamics as their pre-swap counterparts" doesn't really lead to an exploration of this concept. Maybe if it was a gender-bend in story, but even then...). Also "I'm a rich lord we just don't work" doesn't really result in the dynamic I'm looking for.

I'd imagine Harry/Tonks would play pretty well into this. Harry/Hermione would work, if you do the whole 'Hermione is on her way to becoming minister of magic and Harry is making compromises in his career to see this happen' tack. Even Harry/Ginny could work good, particularly if it is Harry/Ginny pushing back against societal/family pressures to do otherwise (Harry staying home to allow Ginny to pursue a Quidditch Career, with Ron/Molly pressuring them to be more like them).

The only one I saw close to this was a 'Ginny pursues her career and Harry breaks it off with her because of it'. Harry either ends up suing for custody of children of fighting off spousal support thing, It was a pleasant excuse for a H/HR story, but I'm kinda looking for the opposite of what I am looking for here....

Edit: Doesn't have to be the main point of the story. I'd be interested in hearing of stories that use it as a setup or as an ending/epilogue


** Given how much Harry values family, I too am surprised you don't see him as a stay-at-home dad more often. I can't think of a single one I've read where this is the case. I suppose it would somewhat hinder most plots to have him working out what to do with the kids every time he wants to go on an adventure though, unless the trials of raising magical kids was the adventure.

*** I donno, isn't 'duty calls to the retired-to-the-country vet' more sensible (and in the context of broader fiction, more widely used) than 'retired and became a cop then called back to duty'.

I've seen a few fics put Harry in the 'mundane' part of the Aurors (All he does is chase down disgruntled kids and file paperwork, and that is the way Harry likes it, without attention), that way they can have some tension when he is drawn back into the adventuring business. But wouldn't "I have kids now I can't just go galleyvanting off"; "But you are the only one who can, its your duty damn it, your duty" be a lot more natural tension?

Honestly, I was expecting to run into this concept a lot more in H/Hr fanfiction, it just seems so natural. She is ambitious and wants to change the world, he is loyal but doesn't want attention and wants focus on family. Both have been burned by society are not overly characterized by trying to 'fit in' to higher class functions (at least not unless they are trying to get something out of it).

Sadly, most stories that could do this go for "You are a screwed-up patriarchal society, we are going to be equal partners and show you what we can do" instead of "You are a screwed-up patriarchal society, she is going to take you on, and I'm going to be standing behind her as she does". Not that anything is wrong with the first one, I'm just surprised to not see any of the second....

**** Under 5k has some great stories because usually the conflict is dealt with rather efficiently instead of the twenty unresolved subplots you see in many abandoned stories. And if it's a fluffy oneshot it keeps the cuteness overload at bay.

There are even a few good 1k stories although they tend to focus on a single scene. For example linkffn(3660901).

*** Doesn't really fit (at least, not yet). Seems like this might end that way given how the h/hr romance is developing, but right now it is more 'single dad'. Single Dad is very similar, but it is also a lot more common (not overly common, but I can think of a dozen fics or so that I remember reading that try it. The exact extent of how domestic Harry is varies, of course, but it is a bit more common).

Slightly longer answer:

This saga is a post-GoF AU, begun before OttP was published. It's unabashedly Harry/Cho.

Since I don't have the presence of mind to write an essay, I'll just make two lists of things I liked.

What I liked about the writing:

- It's sort of unique. It reads (at least to me) as very fresh and creative. The author is probably not a native english speaker, but they are extremely competent in the use of language and they use a lot of turns of phrase that are unusual; as well, the way the writing is structured brings to mind a different language. But the result resonated with my tastes excellently (your mileage may vary).

- The author is well-traveled and it shows. His depiction of places rings true and realistic.

What I liked about the content:

- Harry works to better himself constantly.

- Harry learns martial arts and the whole thing is actually done very well. In fact his trip to Japan is my favorite part of the story.

- Harry is proactive. As problems arise he actively works out solutions, utilising human and magical resources.

- Probably my favorite depiction of goblins in the whole fandom.

- The Harry/Cho dynamic I enjoyed a lot; Cho is kind of a bitch, while Harry is pretty self-centered. As they develop feelings for each other, they try to work through their shit (a good note of realism in the relationship)

- Adults are generally competent

- Sex. There's a lot of it later in the stories and it's extremely well-depicted. It shows that someone that's actually sexually experienced wrote this.

- Even during the Hogwarts years, a LOT of stuff happens beyond the school microcosm - which is a pet peeve of mine about a lot of fics.

- No horcruxes, no prophecies, nothing of that tired old bullshit. The plot is FRESH!

And probably lots of other stuff I'm forgetting now.

As a final note, I find the first story in the series to perhaps be the weakest. If you feel ready to give up, check on HP and the Magical Tours, for a bit, it may change your mind.
