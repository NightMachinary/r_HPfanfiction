Reason is I'm homeless and despondent.


** Hey, I know its not related to the stories, but some advice for you:

Sign up for a 24 hours gym is possible; they're great for having access to a reasonable environment, showers, wifi, etc.

Public libraries are your friend! Wifi/computers/internet access. Some even offer minor technical training and help with job placement. Also, don't give up! try applying for jobs, but also make sure you look up social assitace programs in your area! See if you can get food stamps/WIC. Every dollar you can save at this point will help you in the long run.

Speaking of that, be extra careful with your bank account. Right now it may seem like it doesn't matter, but DONT overdraft on your account. When you get back on you feet (because don't forget, this is temporary), you will require some kind of bank account receive money.

If possible, ask a friend if you can use their home as a place of address; many companies will not hire someone that does not have a permeant address, or even people that only have PO boxes.

If you need anything, let me know in a PM. Also let me know where you're at, if you're comfortable telling a stranger that is. Honestly, this has got to be super tough on you, but stay strong. You are strong enough to handle this and get out on the other side.

*** Not sure if salem, or has a 24 hour gym but i'll check.

I have a tablet with internet (my mom gave it to me, so i'm good there). I have a job atm though i don't particularly love it. Am applying other places.

My gran's bffs will let me use their homes for an address i'm sure.

**** Thats still great! It doesn't need to be a 24 hour, its just more convenient. Even if its only open during the day, its somewhere safe, fun, and sanitary to be.

Something you should also look into is if you're job has a â€˜grief fund' or something similar. When I used to work for a major burger chain that rhymes with med mobin, I paid into a fund, something small like 2 dollars a pay check, so that if something ever happened (i.e., house fire, car accident, etc) they would help me with funds if they could. Losing your home for almost any reason could possibly qualify you if your job provides it! You don't have to pay into it to be eligible either if I remember correctly. Again, best of luck! You can handle this, as long as you sit down, make a plan, and stay focused, even when it gets tough.

***** Went to the salvation army, they're not doing intakes until mid august. Heading to union gospel next.

Stopped by the job i really wanted, they plan to hire someone else on wednesday. Maybe my eagerness will get me a callback if he falls through or they have another opening.
