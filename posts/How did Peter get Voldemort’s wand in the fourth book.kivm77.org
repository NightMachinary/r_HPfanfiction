I'm in the middle of doing my outline for the fourth book in my female Slytherin Harry series and have run into a question I can't seem to solve.

Clearly the wand Voldemort has in the graveyard scene is his own wand because of the twin cores. How did Pettigrew (or Crouch Jr or Voldemort himself) get his wand back? Presumably he dropped it when he got kicked out of his body in the Potter house when the Killing Curse reflected back at him.

I would think that the Ministry or Dumbledore would have picked it up when examining the scene, but maybe not.

Do you think the wand was just waiting there the whole time?


** I think it makes sense that Pettigrew joined Voldemort on his trip to Godric's Hollow (at least for Voldemort to be sure he is not bluffing), so he might be actually the very first ho came to the scene of crime and picked up the wand. Sirius, Hagrid, and Snape (is this the correct order?) came only after him. Then he hide it somewhere, and picked it up only after the end of PoA.

Don't recall what books say but according to movies order is Snape, Sirius & Hagrid, last movie shows Snape's memories in which Harry is still in his crib when Snape visits.

**** He just however indirectly witnessed demise of Voldy at the hands of this boy or some complex magic, why the hell would he try to do the same when he is an ant compared to his master? .. he would get the hell of there and taking something of his master to curry favor later(if there was one) would be a good idea too.

**** Good question. I am not sure about the answer. Perhaps, he recognized that Dark Lord is gone, so supporting him was not in his best interest any more?

** When you solve that question, I have another one to give you: where was Peter hiding that wand for all those years until Voldemort's return?

JKR handwaved these plot points, which makes it harder to come up with a very good answer to them. She gave this answer in a web chat, but it brings up its own set of questions:

#+begin_quote
  Wormtail, desperate to curry favour, salvaged it from the place it had fallen and carried it to him. I admit that would have been a bit of a feat for a rat, but they are highly intelligent creatures!
#+end_quote

I think someone experienced like Dumbledore or an auror like Moody would've checked, so it's unlikely the wand was there in Godric's Hollow the whole time.

**** When you are an animagus, your clothes and wand transform with you (although I've seen some funny fics where you have to learn to transform your clothes as well, and end up naked a lot when learning). I assume that the contents of your pockets get transformed also.
