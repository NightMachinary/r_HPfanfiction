:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey there! I've tried searching, because I saw this one-shot on here previously, but I can't seem to find it. I'm trying to find a one-shot (that isn't too long, either - maybe a couple thousand words, max) after Snape ends occlumency lessons with Harry. It's basically where Dumbledore is disappointed in Shape, and tries to make him see where he failed - not that he'll let Snape go back to teaching Harry occlumency. That door has closed. At the end of the fic, Snape notices Harry's sleep-deprived state, from his nightmares, and he says something like "At least I'll see you tortured" or something along those lines. Anyone know this fic?
