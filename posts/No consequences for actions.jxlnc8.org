*Fred and George*

#+begin_quote
  During morning break on his first day as a member, Montague tried to take House points from [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Fred_Weasley][Fred]] and [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/George_Weasley][George Weasley]], but the twins shoved him into the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Vanishing_Cabinet][Vanishing Cabinet]] before he could finish speaking. While trapped inside, Montague could occasionally hear goings-on at [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry][Hogwarts]], as well as at Borgin and Burkes, where the Cabinet's counterpart was located. He managed to [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Apparition][Apparate]] out the next day, despite never having obtained an [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Apparition_(class][Apparition licence]]), but ended up lodged inside a toilet on the fourth floor.

  *The Apparition nearly proved fatal to Montague.* He was left in a disoriented state for weeks afterwards. In May, his parents, [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Graham_Montague%27s_parents][Mr and Mrs Montague]], came to the school, looking furious. Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger watched the couple arrive, and Hermione suggested that they should tell Madam Pomfrey what had happened to Montague, in case it would help her treat him. However, both Ron and Harry dismissed this idea, so Hermione apparently let the matter drop. Several weeks later, during the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ordinary_Wizarding_Level][O.W.L.]] exams in June, Harry went to the Hospital Wing, where he saw Madam Pomfrey spoon-feeding a vivid blue [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Potion][potion]] to Montague.
#+end_quote

Another thing that disappoints me is the fact that Ron and Harry don't want Hermione telling Madam Pomfrey what happened, despite the fact that it could help him.

#+begin_quote
  Although neither George nor Fred were very concerned about completing their educations, they returned to Hogwarts for their seventh year, and continued to develop and sell their joke products. Hermione managed to stop them from testing out their products on younger students after threatening to tell their mother that they had been tricking first-years into trying out treats from the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Skiving_Snackbox][Skiving Snackboxes]], a threat George considered "below the belt".

*Sirius Black*

#+begin_quote
  In his fifth-year at Hogwarts years, Sirius played a potentially lethal practical joke on Snape. He informed Snape of how to enter a tunnel under the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Whomping_Willow][Whomping Willow]] that would lead to the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Shrieking_Shack][Shrieking Shack]] where, unknown to Snape, Remus Lupin was confined during his transformations into a werewolf. Snape went there during a full moon, and James was forced to rescue him. Sirius excused his own actions, explaining that he had simply told Snape what he wanted to know about the tunnel while omitting crucial information. He simultaneously claimed it "/served Snape right/." The resentment Snape felt for Sirius was never healed. Snape was not the only student whom Sirius and James tormented during their years at Hogwarts. They also used an illegal hex on a boy named [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Bertram_Aubrey][Bertram Aubrey]] that caused his head to grow twice its original size. It is unknown why they hexed him.
#+end_quote

The result of this is a pat on the shoulder from Dumbledore to James for saving Snape, and a warning to Sirius. Nothing more.

In Muggle schools, you'd most likely be expelled or at the least be suspended if you pulled a prank that could've lead to the death of a student and lead to your friend being sent to Azkaban for murder.

** Given that expulsion is a metaphorical death sentence (wand snapped and forbidden to do magic ever, possibly also obliviated of magic if you're muggle born) is it any surprise that the harshest realistic punishment means pretty much nothing to the students. Especially when there are teachers that throw around the threat of expulsion like candy.

*** The wand was snapped if the expulsion happened before they took the OWLs, I think. (I also think they couldn't monitor forever who is or isn't doing magic. Hagrid didn't use magic only when rescuing Harry. He propably wouldn't even have his wmbrelland if this was the case.)

And the obliviation of magic is fanon. Even if people were obliviated, they would still be magic anyway, and could become aware of it again (even if not of the magical society).

** You are talking about the universe where about half of a group of known terrorists that tortured and murdered (and probably raped) people and caused who knows how much property damage bought their ways out of prison and weren't even put under observation, much less prevented from gaining positions within the government.

This is also the universe where there were no investigations on the 3 attempted murders of an 11 year old, 1 in plain sight of over 100 people in the first year. It's also the universe where one student gets 20 points taken from him alone and detention in a forest that's supposed to be off limits to students with good reason while another trio lost 50 each. No real investigation on the troll incident either in spite of three first year students being found with it knocked out, and a basic unlocking spell can get you into a forbidden corridor where there's a 20 foot tall Cerberus sitting around, much less the rest of what was in there. Do we even learn whether anyone else accidentally or on purpose visited the place? Of course we hear about the investigation into the break in at Gringotts', but not much else due to it being outside Hogwarts.

Next year there's the complete lack of investigation of a being petrifying students along with the result being to kick out the headmaster of the school (with no replacement) and to lock up someone who had his wand snapped and his education halted with no investigation on hearsay in the past 'to be seen doing something'. There was also no obvious investigation into Malfoy Snr's actions regarding the claimed blackmail/threats to the board of governors or that his elf was responsible for attacking Harry Potter and that he was presented as a potential suspect in how Ginny got hold of Riddle's journal causing the whole incident.

Third year includes stationing soul devouring undead that have a dread aura around a bunch of impressionable teens and pre-teens because one man escaped them once. They also effectively had a teacher practically steal a broom because it might be cursed, something they didn't do when Harry's previous broom was actively cursed in full view of the school. That's not even getting into the minimum of three attempts on Harry's life by the dementors (two in front of teachers), the attempt on Sirius and the other kids. It's also the year that a hippogriff was nearly 'put down' because someone was an arse to its face after being warned about doing exactly that. They also never called in the aurors/DMLE to investigate either attempt by Sirius to get at Pettigrew or the claims by the students that encountered him, not to mention the kill on sight order from Fudge. The guy just wrote them off because Snape claimed they had been be spelled, with no investigation or check to see if that was true or not.

Fourth year starts with a bang, literally, since Arthur had the Dursleys' fireplace hooked to the floo network, without so much as a ‘by your leave' from them resulting in him destroying part of their living room, then he pretty much forces them into being ‘polite' to Harry while his sons engage in what probably counts as ‘muggle baiting' leaving enchanted sweets in plain view of someone that they knew was supposed to be dieting. Next we get the mess at the World Cup, where Crouch tries to pin blame for the dark mark on a group of school kids with little to no investigation, and when he's called on it and they eventually get things, he casts out Winky for what appears to be nothing more than her reacting on instinct and bugging out of trouble. There's also no real investigation into the riot, it's just pinned on Sirius, and we're introduced to Skeeter, who can't even get names right.

Throughout the year following we get Skeeter writing slander/libel (can never recall which way up those are) about Harry with nothing done about it or any sort of investigation. We also have what appears to be Moody not only showing off the unforgivable, but also using them on students (imperious) and a tourney where the students are placed in situations that can be lethal quite readily, dragons for a start, damned near frozen lake and a maze with monsters.

There's also no seen investigation into the fact Harry is forced in, in spite of ‘Moody' telling people pretty much how he did it. There's also no investigation regarding Harry's claims or the death of a student. Fudge just writes it off and does worse by bringing a dementor with him to a school where there's supposedly no threat only to allow said dementor to kill a suspect in plain view and write it off as ‘not being a great loss'. There's nothing done about Crouch Snr or the woman that Pettigrew murdered either, they're just written off.

Fifth year there's the attempt on Harry by dementors sent by Umbridge resulting in him being hauled into a full on court for defending himself and his cousin. In fact, one of the trumped up charges could be knocked out just by pointing that factoid out, if Fudge wasn't intent on railroading things. Once again, no investigation in spite of the fact that even a rumour of rogue dementors should be investigated because those things can cause all sorts of trouble, but once again it's written off.

We also see Molly Weasley effectively stealing from Sirius because she's more or less taken over control of Sirius' inherited house and forces the kids into acting as cleaning crew in spite of there being a dedicated servant, not even getting into what is ‘gotten rid of for safety's sakes' or the things Fletcher half-inched, and while Sirius has pretty much traded one jail for another, Snape (who Dumbledore claimed was a spy and got him let loose) struts around and rails at everyone, particularly Sirius and Harry.

There's also the breaking and entering by the Order in order to collect Harry from Privet Drive, done by at least one auror (Tonks), possibly as many as four active and a retired (Moody).

Back at the school, Umbridge is instated as a professor and proceeds to make all years use a book for toddlers or young children instead of teens to young adults. She also starts baiting Harry and dumping him in detentions where he's made to write lines in his own blood to the point the words scar onto his arm. He can't be the only one, but it's either not reported or not investigated. McGonagall's response, ‘keep your head down'. Later she steals the brooms from not only the twins, who had been irritated to the point of lashing out at Malfoy (who got no punishment besides the interrupted beating) but also Harry's.

Later there's Granger's cursed register, which doesn't get tracked back to her, when she talks Harry into starting a club and almost gets them caught out the gate because she's an idiot and doesn't get ‘stealthy/covert = not standing out/hide in plain sight'. After Umbridge manages to force Dumbledore out again, things quiet for a time, but she attempts to have aurors assault Hagrid, and ends up nearly killing McGonagall, which should have been investigated. She also attempts to torture Harry with an unforgivable, an automatic life sentence, except when you have the minister's ear, and might have nearly started a war with the centaurs for attacking them.

Of course that's without the mind rape from both Snape and Riddle on Harry that's not checked because the former is ‘on Dumbledore's orders' and the latter is from Riddle.

Sixth year, while little enough happens, there's still the assault on Hogwarts by Riddle's stooges and the attempted murders by Malfoy. Neither is investigated, again, meaning that two of Riddles sycophants end up teaching the next year and torture the students, again. There's also Granger's reactions to the book that border on psychotic, without her attack on Ronald and the scuffle between Harry and Malfoy that winds up with Malfoy getting hit by the sectumsempra curse when he tried the torture curse. Harry gets blamed, nothing is investigated, in spite of that level of assault being something that should result in aurors called in.

I'm not so convinced by this. Sirius has been on the run for a couple of years and before that he's spent 13 years in an archaic prison with literal depression monsters creeping about the place. He lost his actual family, his adopted family and everyone else he knows. He was barely an adult when he went into prison and shows signs of mental health problems.

Molly, really, was doing him a kindness. He obviously couldn't cope/manage by himself and without her, there's no chance Dumbledore would allow Harry to be cared for by Sirius.

**** Molly may have been better at house keeping, but it was still Sirius' house, even if he wasn't the most capable there probably should have been something for Harry or someone pointing it out and things coming out. It's not her property, that what we see is her running roughshod over a man that doesn't need a mouthy, bossy bint of a woman coming in to his house and forcing her ideals on it, he needs someone medically trained to help him work through the effects of the past and get him to take responsibility, not take it from him and sideline him in his own house.

There's also the fact that she's the one forcing the cleanup, meaning she's the one yanking anything 'dark' to be destroyed/passed to Dumbledore, in spite of the fact that without us as the readers finding out, it's stealing Sirius' legacy, however little he may have wanted it.

There's also the point Deixa_Carol_Mesmo mentioned that hello, Bill is in town and he's a /trained/ cursebreaker. If anyone /should/ be going over things that might be dark/cursed, it's him. It also would have brought up the locket earlier, along with Kreacher's tale.

Between simply tossing items, passing them to Dumbledore who for all his possible knowledge is officially a school headmaster, or not putting feet on Dung's neck and preventing him nicking things, it did end up wasting time and lives in the long run.

Hell, there were, as mentioned previously, at least two active and a retired auror in the Order, even if Bill wasn't available, they could at least look at things before destroying them to ensure the right things got dealt with, and they could have stepped on both Fletcher's stealing and the Snape/Black crap, or even just make Snape actually cough up some information.

***** We only really see Harry's side on it. We don't know what was said or done in the weeks leading up to that date.

'he needs someone medically trained to help him'

Absolutely, but given that he's a convict on the run - there is no such person.

Incidentally, when helping people dealing with grief, health issues - especially mental health issues - having a listening ear is only one part of it. Helping with meals or around the house is important.

Yes, they absolutely do clash at times - but we also know that Sirius hated those dark objects in his house and, well, the house full stop. His choice would have been to never step a foot in there again.

Unlike Mungungus, we don't know what happens to those objects or who looks at them afterwards.

There could have been plenty of reasons why the others didn't look, not least having both order work and their own lives to balance.

In the end, finding the horcrux earlier is only something we can think about with the benefit of hindsight. Dumbledore knew the cleaning was taking place and had access to the house. At no point do the books suggest that he thought a horcrux would be within the Black house. The Blacks - like many old houses - had lots of dodgy stuff but Horcruxes are rare and unusual.

It's quite possible Bill would never have come across one - we simply don't know.

Plus, if all those things had been smoothed out it would just be a series of magic solutions, too easy, too unlikely.

As for Harry bringing it up, he's a literal child. No adult in their right mind would put that sort of responsibility on a child if there was any other alternative.

** So, we don't know what the consequences for the werewolf prank were. We don't know that it was just a "warning" to Sirius. He might have had detentions until the end of the year, a letter sent home, points taken from his house. He wasn't expelled and arguably should have been, but I took that as Dumbledore protecting Remus, who might have faced serious consequences for Sirius' actions, unfair as that would be. (Although you might say that the werewolf prank played a role in Remus believing Sirius capable of betraying the Potters when Peter framed Sirius.)

It is comparable to what we see happen in HBP: Harry almost kills Draco with Sectumsempra. He gets...detention on Saturdays. Meanwhile, Draco's attempts to kill Dumbledore almost lead to the deaths of Katie Bell and Ron. Dumbledore never does anything about it/Draco gets away with it. (Bonus: Romilda Vane never gets in trouble for slipping Harry the love potion that affected Ron. Ginny gets rewarded for hexing Zacharias Smith on the train by receiving an invitation into the Slug Club. Hermione sets a conjured flock of birds on Ron. Harry cheated in Potions class. Draco used Imperio on Rosmerta.)

Characters get away with bad actions all the time in the books in-Universe and loads of fans are willing to minimize the bad/questionable actions of their faves, as we can see by the people justifying that the twins did nothing wrong to Montague. I guarantee that if a Slytherin student pushed any other kid into the Vanishing Cabinet leaving them messed up in the Hospital Wing for weeks, it would be perceived as more proof Slytherin is evil. But you could also make the argument that the indirect consequence of pushing Montague into the cabinet is that Dumbledore dies since Draco learns about the connection between Hogwarts and Borgin and Burkes from Montague, thus devising his plan of how to let Death Eaters into Hogwarts. (Not to say Dumbledore's death is the fault of the twins.) Bill is also mauled because Fenrir came through the cabinets.

I've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2968636/1/What-If-Snape-Died][one fanfiction]] that goes down this rabbit hole. The way it goes in this one is that Lupin and Sirius get expelled for the prank, while James is forced to spend the following summer scrubbing floors in Hogwarts under Filch's watch. Dumbledore covers up Lupin's lycanthropy by publicly attributing Snape's death to the Whomping Willow.

** What is with all the Montague love recently? To copy some things from a previous comment of mine:

1) He was a member of the Inquisitorial Squad, so he probably deserved it.

2) He was only in there for a day (if the wiki is accurate, at least).

3) His injuries seem much more likely to have come from his own attempts at unlicensed apparation out of a vanishing cabinet into Hogwarts, which sounds like an incredibly stupid idea for several reasons.

4) There's nothing that indicates that they thought he was trapped between cabinets and not just lost wherever the other cabinet happened to be.

5) His only mention before OotP was in a Quidditch game in PoA, when he grabbed Katie's head. Considering the speeds and heights involved, that seems like a much more credible attempt at murder or at least serious injury than anything the twins did to him. And considering the Slytherin team's reputation, that sort of thing was probably very common.

6) They were already at war at that point, and Montague picked the other side. We don't know for sure if Montague or any of his family members were Death Eaters, but we (and the twins) know that plenty of Slytherins did know about Voldemort's return, so it's not unreasonable to assume that it was common knowledge amongst them. And the fact that he was in the Inquisitorial Squad is strong evidence that his parents were in the same sort of social circles as known Death Eaters, which makes it very likely that there were Death Eaters in his family.

So in summary, the twins were not actually trying to harm Montague, and did not even do so directly. If he had been killed, they probably would have felt some guilt, but he wasn't and he was fine. And he frankly deserved it.

And in a Hogwarts with reasonable and just punishments, Montague, along with most of the named Slytherins in the books, would have been expelled or otherwise harshly punished long ago.

That's an incredibly stupid comparison that reeks of false equivalence. A much better comparison would be "I didn't know that someone had dumped piranhas in the lake before I pushed him in."

There were seven named students in the squad. Of them, four were known to be children of Death Eaters (Malfoy, Parkinson, Crabbe, and Goyle). We barely know anything about the other three (Bulstrode, Montague, and Warrington), but two of them were members of the notoriously large and violent Quidditch team. (And there was at least one unnamed student, but we can't really speculate much about them.)

The students in the squad were hand-picked by Umbridge for being supportive of the Ministry of Magic. And in this case, that means that they are pushing the idea that Voldemort is not back and Harry and Dumbledore are lying to try to undermine the ministry. But there were plenty of students who didn't believe Harry. Why wasn't Seamus part of the squad, since he was vocally against Harry? Well, we know that Lucius was very close to Fudge and was helping to push the idea that Voldemort wasn't back, and that Parkinson, Crabbe, and Goyle were (likely rich) pureblood acquaintances of his, so it follows that they were likely in the same social circles, which Fudge wanted to keep himself integrated into, which leads to Umbridge giving their kids power.

So yes, I think it is reasonable to assume that Montague is related to Death Eaters, or at least Death Eater supporters/sympathizers. Because the Ministry at that point basically is a Death Eater sympathizing regime at that point.

And if you're going to claim that the Inquisitorial Squad is justified because it's "a school organization run by a member of the ministry" and ignore any context about it, then you also have to say that Umbridge was justified in all of her actions just because she had the legal authority to do so. Congratulations, you're the first Umbridge defender I've ever seen.

​Maybe. And maybe there was a better way to get out, and maybe not. But we don't know because Rowling is very loose with her magic rules. But since Montague could hear people in Borgin and Burkes, it's hard to imagine that they wouldn't have been able to hear him too.

I can see how my words were unclear, but I meant that he deserved what he got, not that he would have necessarily deserved death.

But I think you are forgetting my previous point: *they were at war*. And while it is unfortunate, people die in wars. The twins are not hardened soldiers, so I would expect them to feel bad about it. But since it was both an accident and he was on the other side of a war, they should be able to accept it and move on.

It's just like if Harry had actually killed Malfoy in HBP. It would be an unfortunate accident that would weigh on Harry's conscience for a time, but it wouldn't make him a bad person.

I think you're forgetting that the "war". Didn't involve students. The war was mainly fought between the Order and Voldemort. Most Hogwarts students were worried about submitting assignments and going on dates.

And the reason Fred and George even pushed Montague into the vanishing cabinet was because he wanted to dock points from them. Not because he's the son of a death eater. Even Harry who is the chosen one doesn't have thoughts of being at war with Slytherin students.

"Being at war" is quite ridiculous and makes no sense.

****** I think you're forgetting that a few months earlier they were all complaining about how they really wanted to join the Order, but the adults wouldn't let them. And at that point in the story, Harry and his friends, including the twins, were very much worried about Voldemort, the Ministry's smear campaign and denial of Voldemort's return, and their ability to defend themselves. And while they might not have called it a war yet, they did call themselves "Dumbledore's Army," so the idea was clearly in their heads.

And to pull a few quotes I found:

#+begin_quote
  “Why not?” said Harry quickly. “I'll join, I want to join, I want to fight --- ”
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  “He's not very definite on anything, is he?” said Ron in a low voice, as they put out their mallowsweet fire. “I mean, I could do with a few more details about this war we're about to have, couldn't you?”
#+end_quote

It sounds to me like they realize that they are at war, or are at least very quickly approaching all-out war.

Yes, Montague was just docking points. Yes, that's a pretty minor offence. But he was still being a willing weapon of the Ministry, which in turn was a weapon of Voldemort and the Death Eaters. And even if the Fudge and Umbridge didn't realize that they were being used by Voldemort, I have already proved that Montague probably did, and the twins would have known that. And they responded with an appropriate retribution, which just happened to go wrong through no fault of their own.

I recall a good amount of fighting between the Inquisitorial Squad and Umbridge and the rest of the school, and everything involving Malfoy in HBP probably counts. And of course the entire school year in DH.

"We're not at war" is the exact argument that Umbridge and the ministry used. You are literally using Voldemort's propaganda to support your argument.

#+begin_quote
  Is it okay to hiss at 11 year old children because they are Slytherin?
#+end_quote

Let's actually look at that line from GoF.

#+begin_quote
  The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; Harry could see Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins. Harry wondered whether Baddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other. Fred and George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat down.
#+end_quote

First of all, do you really think that anyone on the other side of a cheering room would be able to hear two people hissing? Second, considering the kid was just sorted into Slytherin, it's not exactly much of an insult or anything, unless the kid didn't want to be a Slytherin, but there's nothing to support that idea. Third, that's the only mention the twins have during the sorting, so you can't say for sure that they did it more than once or that they weren't also cawing at every Ravenclaw and roaring at every Gryffindor.

So in that instance, yes I do think it is okay to hiss at Slytherins. It would only be offensive if someone is ashamed to be a Slytherin. But if I was sorted into Slytherin and there was some hissing mixed in with the cheers, I would probably just assume it was an odd way of cheering.

#+begin_quote

So they don't know where he is. Specifically they don't know that he's stuck in limbo, because they wouldn't have said they didn't know where he was if they knew that. It seems clear to me that they just thought he was dumped off wherever the other vanishing cabinet is, because that's what "where we sent him" clearly means. And if that other cabinet happened to have found its way to another country, it could easily have taken weeks for him to get back, despite never being in any danger.
