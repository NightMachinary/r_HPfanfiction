** There is a list of betas in the subs wiki, or alternatively, I may be able to help. I say this since I signed up to be added to that list, but it's not been updated yet.

** In case anyone else checks this post, it is also possible to hit up [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]]. There's also a weekly post I think when people offer to beta or when people can look for betas. On Wednesdays or Thursdays, if I remember correctly.
