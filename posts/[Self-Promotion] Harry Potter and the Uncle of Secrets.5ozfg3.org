hi evry1 i wrot somethign pls revoiw

More seriously, now that we're done with the prologue and the "setting up Harry's friendgroup" chapters and are finally about to leave the rails of sanity forever, I feel confident enough to unleash this monstrosity upon you all.

I know the summary doesn't say a lot, so here's another one: an AU Harry potter dies after becoming the Master of Death and decides to improve another AU Harry Potter's life via five years of badassery training. Witness the aftermath and lose your braincells! Fun for probably no one!

I'm mostly writing this as a warm-up to test my English and how much embarrassment at my own bullshit I can take, but I do have an entire plot mapped out, so this has good chances of being completed. Prolly won't be too long (it totally will), crack tends to overstay its welcome.
