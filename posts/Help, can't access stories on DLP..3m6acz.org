So I know I probably should ask guys on DLP for help, but honestly, I have no idea how to do that, so I'll just ask here.

So I wanted to re-read [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021&page=3][Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived by The Santi]] for the... 4th time I think, but I got [[http://imgur.com/T6Xzsbw][this error.]] So how to I get privileges? This error also shows for other WIP fics on the site, so maybe it isn't an error but something intentional? Regardless I just wan't to read my favorite fic once for, please help.


** One of the Mods for DLP had some sort of rant about only letting 'approved' people read stories hosted on their site; after some random nobody uploaded copies elsewhere onto FFnet. They must have gone through with it.

****** I can't speak for Santi, I don't know why he didn't update his FF.net account. I will say though that OTTOMH, HP & TBWL is the only story with that issue. I would hold that most stories do end up posted on fanfiction archive sites eventually.

Look at the bright side: If the entire story is completed first, there'll be a polished version on FF.net with regular updates at some point. And if it's posted chapter by chapter, the delay is really neglible, so it's no issue to begin with.

And of course, everyone can always start posting and then leave comments in the WbA threads after reading. The purpose literally is "post your opinion", and everyone has an opinion. The author wants to hear that opinion, that's why he's posting the story.

******** The WbA is a small portion, even though it's the most popular portion, of DLP. There are tons of other places to post, including hundreds of story threads where you can post your opinion about a fanfiction you've liked/hated, discussion threads, politics, gaming, and more. The post count you need isn't high, one person got to the necessary number by just inquiring as to why the change happened in a thread he made.

**** Work By Author is not a story-hosting section. Authors don't post stories to DLP to be hosted for general reading, there's FF.Net for that and it does a perfectly good job at it.

WBA is a betaing forum for authors who want assistance in writing and is designed to be a private forum where authors can refine their work prior to general publication. People who just want to read fics without giving feedback have no business having access to this forum. Further, the pre-publication nature of the forum is such that it requires greater protection from plagiarism.

If authors stop posting their work to DLP WBA in response to this, then they were using WBA incorrectly anyway.

But they won't, because the vast majority of users posting stories to WBA are active DLP members who /are/ using the forum correctly.

***** I'm not talking about hurting the authors. It will hurt new writers potentially, but mostly it stops people from reading. And if this is in response to a bot copying stories I don't see why they think it will actually stop that. Either the restrictions are so severe it will stop the bot, or they're so lax that they will only inconvenience the more casual audience.

Good. As I said, it's not a forum for general publication. If you're only interested in reading and you're not going to contribute to betaing the story, then you have no business having access to and being able to read the stories in WBA.

And it's not about bots, it's about malicious individuals manually copying stories and posting them as their own.

I do.

When I post a story to WBA it's because I want the DLP community and the DLP community alone to read it. Otherwise I'd be posting it to FF.Net.

  This is a fair point and I concede it. However its futile, as I can easily make the required posts to gain access again, in which point I will go back to my undeserving reading. The bigger point here is that someone stealing content, not just reading it, can do so just as easily. So in the end this does nothing except force more posts, which is why I alluded that this was a movement for a increase in community activity instead of an attempt to thwart plagiarism.

*********** You're missing my point I think. I like reading wba, so I can and will easily gain access to the forum again. I recognize FF authors don't like this, and I am not entitled to it. However it isn't going to stop me, because it is there and easy to access.

My point however is that the alleged reason for this change is to stop plagiarizing, except someone intent on doing so can gain access as easily as myself. So what is the point of the exercise?

************ I think that the concept is that DLP is an active forum for discussion. If you start posting, people will read what you say and respond. Posts generated solely to create postcount are readily detected as such and the membership takes venal joy in taunting new members to make certain they have something real to say.

If you're thinking you'll be able to put in a few reviews like 'story was good, wish it would update', and then get access to the WbA, you'll find that the local bouncers want to have a word with you.

It's sorta like Fight Club- to be a member, you have to fight.

************** I'm a bit saddened by that remark. ;-;

Many people on DLP are a close knit group who have talked with each other for years and years, so looking in from the outside it might seem like they're being assholes and elitist, but we're still very accepting of new members. Hell, some members only lurk on the forums and only participate in IRC, so they're not very well known even though tons of regular members know them very well.

The only time DLP members are actually assholes is when people like Luke post stupid, spammy stuff. Otherwise, like I said, if you're genuine, no one cares if you're new or not, only that you contribute.

***** This is good to know, you get several people recommending stories on the WBA section of DLP with no mention to review and offer constructive criticism. Often times linking directly to the story, so the sticky about forum rules never crosses their screen. Even when they do read the rules though, it only casually mentions the point of WBA and instead lists the hard rules, which only define what to do if you do post, not that you should.
