** I'm pretty sure good Harrys will vastly outnumber Harrys supporting Voldemort.

Anyway, after sufficient Harrys got summoned, they decide to bury their own differences, smack down both Dumbledore and Voldemort, and take over the current dimension.

*** Armed with hundreds of Harrys apiece, Dumbledore and Voldemort meet with their armies on the battlefield. The final showdown looks like it's going to be brutal, but only 2 curses are cast. One at Dumbledore, one at Voldemort. Both fall to the ground, dead. A cheer goes up amongst all the Harrys, laughing with joy. As if they could be convinced to fight themselves. They open a rift to another universe with an Earth void of humans. They then bring whoever they want from their own universes, and within a few hours the whole world has dissolved into a massive Harry-Draco-Hermione-Luna orgy with a few Snapes thrown in for good measure. A sea of writhing bodies billions of people wide. They isolate themselves from all other universes and live happily ever after.

*** Yeah but a lot of good Harry will be useless wimp which were undertrained, lucky and relied on the help of literally everyone else (/cough/ canon /cough/) or too nice to kill which will let enemies alive while they're mowed down by evil Harrys

*** And that leads to a Council of Harrys made to fight against manipulations of the Galactic Ministry Federation, the Order of Dumbledores and the Syndicate of Voldemorts. They can travel through dimensions to fight injustice and also chase rogue Harrys. The worst of them is an particularly violent and cynical indy one dubbed "Harry C-137".

** Its ends with whole wizard britain being replaced by Harrys.

On the good side you have

- a op indy Harry with fake beard as Dumbledore
- a paranoid Harry with Moodys fake eye
- a genius fem harry as Hermione
- Harry the hufflepuff as Ron

On the bad side

- A Dark Harry with Hocruxes as Voldemort
- A Insane fem Harry as Bellatrix
- etc

And a Harry from a crackfix as useless Minister
