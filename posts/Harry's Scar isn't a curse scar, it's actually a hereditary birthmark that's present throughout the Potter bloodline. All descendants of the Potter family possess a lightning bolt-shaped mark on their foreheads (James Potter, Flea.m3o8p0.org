Bonus: Voldemort is a non-recorded descendent of the Potters, giving him the birthmark as well. This creates his link with Harry


** No, no, wait. Make it instead so that Voldemort was decapitated and nearly defeated by Lily and James, but managed to turn tables on them at the last moment, before possessing James' body and gaining the birthmark (and connection to Harry) through that. Cue bizarre adventures.

** ... When James Sirius Potter gets his birthmark on his buttcheek instead of forehead, he is teased over and over about not being a Potter. James swears he has the birthmark, though people say they won't believe it until he shows it, something James is not eager to do.

**** If that's the case, then I'm sure Moony would have been James' Marauder name instead of Prongs.

***** James Potter, aka Prongs, had the forehead mark.

James Sirius Potter, his grandson, was nicknamed "Full Moony" on account of showing his butt so often.
