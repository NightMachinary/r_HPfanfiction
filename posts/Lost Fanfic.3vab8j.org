I know this is a long shot, but i would really like to find a fan fiction I was reading ages ago and lost it. Based in the Harry Potter world but where Harry was raised by Sirius and Lupin rather than the Dursleys. The fan fiction was really long, and I'm pretty sure had an instalment for each book (maybe up to 5??). Sirius rescued Harry as a baby and initially they lived in the muggle community before moving into the magical world when Harry started to discover his powers Thanks for helping!!

I love you guys!


** I've never actually read this series, so I may be way off-base, but it's possible you're looking for the Stealing Harry 'verse:

Oops, forgot to say it's an abandoned WiP, but readers still seem to love it.

** Unfortunately "Sirius and Lupin raise Harry" covers roughly 10,000 stories at minimum, and "really long" only narrows that down to about 1000. By installment, do you mean chapter or story post? That particular detail might be important.

Do you have any specific scenes or conversations that you remember? What site was it on? Was it complete, in progress, or abandoned when you read it? Did it have a lot of views/reviews/favs/follows?
