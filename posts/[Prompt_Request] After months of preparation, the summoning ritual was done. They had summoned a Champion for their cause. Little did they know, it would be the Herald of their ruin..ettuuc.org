- The good or the bad guys summon a being from another universe (crossover)

- It proceds to singlehandedly win the war for them. Bonus points for curbstomp battles and horrific scenarios.

- Once the battle Is done, it turns against its summoners.

Damn I got another idea but I don't want to spam: a group of squibs filled with hate and jealousy develop an anti-magic gas. It destroys any ítem or building in contact with magic, and it /melts/ magical flesh. They release this weapon on the Battle of Hogwarts. Bonus points if they dress like plague doctors. Double bonus points if they have a Battle scream similar to /"Death to the Dark, and death to MAGIC!"/

Watch "the Wrathgate" on YouTube if you don't know what I'm talking about.


** Albus Dumbledore was crawling on the black, marble floor, blood flowing from his mouth and many cuts, trying to get to the Elder Wand. He slowly made his way through dismembered corpses, pushing the remains of his friends and colleagues aside, trying to reach his last hope of ever making it out of there alive. He felt an increasing desperation as he heard the spells darting out of wands and finishing off any survivor. He needed not hear any incanctation. The green light reflecting on the marble walls was enough indication as to what curse was being used.

'Come now, Albus, leaving already?' The old Headmaster felt a violent yanking and his body was lifted from the floor and placed on his knees, not able to move a single inch out of his own volition. The injured wizard felt his heart shatter at the sight in front of him. The ancient halls of the Wizangamot, shattered. Its members, dead. And in the middle stood Albus Dumbledore's greatest ever mistake: Harry Potter.

Or rather, /a/ Harry Potter. One he summoned from a whole different universe three years ago, after his own Harry died fighting Voldemort in the cemetery, during the dark lord's revival. He should have known! By Merlin, how he should have known! He spent almost a year preparing a Summoning Ritual. And when he finally performed it, instead of a teenage Harry Potter from the most similar universe to their own, came a man in his mid thirties. A man with black hair, no glasses, a pointy beard, and the most elegant black and dark green robes that Albus ever saw. He should have known right in that moment that something went horribly wrong. That the man, the Harry Potter he summoned, could only spell bad news. He should have known from the spells he used. From the way he talked. From his eyes. But Albus ignored everything, it was to that extent that the fear of Voldemort paralyzed his senses. After all, Voldemort was essentially in control of all of Magical Britain except for Hogwarts when this Harry was summoned. Albus did not afford not giving the man a chance. Although, deep down, he did hope the two prophesised enemies would just kill one another. But it was not to be. Harry Potter, in the span of a few months, rallied a small militia independent of the Order, and lead them into vicious battles. Battles which, they won. Always. /The Knights Immortal./ That was their name. Liberating Britain inch by inch, and gaining the support of every witch and wizard in the process. And now, here they were. During the ceremony of awarding the Orders of Merlin by the new Minister of Magic, Amelia Bones, the Knights turned their wands on the ones they claimed to fight for.

Albus looked sadly at the group in front of him, and felt his terror grow tenfold when sounds of vicious battles started being heard outside the halls. Eventually, a horrifying Goblin entered the hall, both he and Potter bowing in respect at one another.

'I have to say, Wizard! I did not truly expect you to deliver!'

Harry merely smiled and raised an eyebrow. 'You saw my memories, old friend. You knew I always deliver!'

The Goblin's face was splattered in blood, probably from the Wizards and Witches he killed on his way there. 'Still, seeing a version of me from an alternate universe interact with you, and actually doing it myself are different things. I may not be /your/ Ragnok, Lord Potter, but I am honored to call you friend.'

The two smiled at one another, the Goblin more like grinning fiercely. 'My men are cleaning up the upper floors. Your Knights are assaulting the Department of Mysteries.' Potter actually looked surprised at that. He thought his agents in the DoM would ensure a peaceful takeover of the department. Ragnok saw his surprise and waved off a clawed hand. 'Dont worry! It's just a few idiots causing problems. Your commander, Delacour, just wanted to make sure they won't be able to take off with whatever it is they are experimenting with.

Potter nodded and looked at his inner circle. Hermione Granger, Ronald Weasley, Alexis Ollivander, Severus Snape and Remus Lupin. People he trained into being murderers, thought Albus sadly. As if sensing his thoughts, Potter turned towards the old Headmaster and walked towards him, grinning. He held him in his tight, magical grip, wandlessly. He merely kept his fist tightly shut and focused his magic through it, towards Albus. He then extended his other hand and Albus felt something fly by next to his ear. In that moment, the Elder Wand snapped into Potter's hand, letting out sparks of red light. The young man smiled and performed some elegant movements with his new wand.

'How I missed you!' he said slowly. 'I have not felt my old wand in my grip ever since you summoned me, Dumbledore!'

They all had the distinct feeling they heard Alexis mutter something along the lines of /I definitely have to study that thing/, eliciting a smile from everyone, including Potter. He merely wiggled it between his fingers and looked at Albus. The old man, channeling whatever strength he had left, spoke to him.

'Harry, why this?! This is... this is madness! I do not understand you!'

Potter only looked at him, the distaste on his face made clear. He slowly approached him, walking over the mangled bodies of the former members of the now extinct Wizengamot. When he reached Dumbledore, he squatted down and looked him in the eyes.

'There are so many reasons for me to hate you, Dumbledore' he said, his voice filled with venom. 'Both the you from my universe, and the you from here. Tearing me from my own home right in the eve of my second son's birth would be the biggest of them all!' His final words were more a blend of English and Parseltongue, in his anger losing the distinction between the two. 'I could tell you so much. So many reasons. But I won't. No, I think... I think I will tell you the same thing I told you when I killed you in my own universe.'

Albus's eyes widened upon hearing that, making Potter chuckle darkly. 'Oh, yes. That silly story, with Severus killing you in one of your contrived plans... Absolute nonsense. Though, the fact you believed it, and thus consider it something you /would/ concoct, is quite concerning, even when it's you we're talking about.' He rubbed the tip of the Elder Wand on Albus's beard. 'Your hubris has always been your greatest flaw, Albus Dumbledore.' He lifted his eyes from the Elder Wand and looked at him, and in that moment, he saw a rage and hatred which Albus could not remember seeing even in Tom Riddle. 'Did you truly think we would not return, Dumbledore? That we would not remember? That we would not punish?'

'My boy...Harry... what are you talking about? Who are you talking about? Your Knights?'

The man shook his head. 'Me and my Knights... we are just people. If we die, new warriors will take our place. Our ideal is immortal.'

He then put his hands inside his dark robe and pulled a necklace. A small silver necklace, with an elegant design. And in that moment, Albus knew that everything he worked for his entire life was doomed to failure. His blood froze, and he felt tears rising in his eyes. /Everything was in vain!/ Filled with bitter thoughts, he did not notice the cold smile on Potter's face. He held the necklace in his palm, for a clear view. The symbol of the /Deathly Hallows!/ The symbol which Dumbledore fought with his entire life. The symbol which he thought long defeated.

Harry Potter tightened his grip on the Elder Wand and sent Albus Dumbledore on his next great adventure with a few, chilling words. '/Für das Größere Wohl'./

The last thing Albus Dumbledore saw was a jet of green light, and then he saw no more.

** It was only at the end that Albus realised the irony.

He was so pretty.

Even as he lay on the cold marble, disemboweled for daring to stand against the being he'd summoned, he still felt guilty for that admission. Like a filthy lech for even acknowledging the raw beauty of the being he had summoned.

He glowed with an aura of both power and adoration, as if an angel had deigned to walk among the mortals and had fallen for their bumbling charm. There was no other way to put it: his gait, his cadence, all that made him he reeked of divinity. Yet, the green eyes, the messy black hair, the features of his face, he was still recognisable as Harry James Potter. As old as he would have been had he not perished in that graveyard three years prior to his successful summoning.

Those soft full lips had pouted in confusion, Dumbledore (and later the whole Order) had felt their heart break at the small frown that he fought off when they explained their plight and why they had kidnapped him from his timeline.

Even as he apologised for stripping him so selfishly from his world, he pulled him into his embrace and he spoke so softly, /"I forgive you, Professor."/ It was the first time in decades he'd shed tears before another human being.

His plans were reckless, he saw that then moreso than he saw now. But he couldn't bear the heartbroken expression when he'd refused and caved to his requests quite quickly. Tactical decisions and complete oversight of the Order and their allies was allowed to this Harry as soon as Dumbledore revealed him to them all. Many a civilian and fighter injured or dead under his complex yet ingenious strategies. Never once failing to reach an objective and complete a goal in their inch by inch reclamation of the British isles, regardless of the losses incurred.

And why wouldn't he allow it? He'd defeated Voldemort in his own time, at fourteen no less. Acting alone with the aide of treacherous Death Eaters (he'd personally turned to the light) to hunt down the horcruxes before Tom would even attempt returning to life. So, though Moody constantly complained that the boy had never known war, thus should not have been thrust the responsibility and control of every operation they were allowed to perform, he daren't take that control away from him.

But Albus found excuse after excuse to shut him, and his concerns down. Which only became easier to supply when they began winning...

Plucking Death Eaters and sympathisers from the street, dropping them into the lap of their resident angel, and in minutes they were redeemed. An entire change of heart JUST as Albus had claimed possible all these years. The main crux of Harry's plots. Anything to take them alive, bringing them back to Headquarters for interrogation and the Order would be gifted with crucial intelligence and a new ally.

They had it down to a science by the end of the conflict...

He'd observed a few of course, not at all believing such results could be reached without dark means, pleasantly surprised each time as he found Harry gathering them up into his arms and hushing away their anguish like a gentle mother.

Heart wrenching sobs and tears for their past crimes, desperate pleas for forgiveness and determined snarls that they would repent and atone.

All met with the soft,

/"I know."/ and, /"I forgive you."/ That had ensnared Dumbledore himself at the beginning.

Malfoy, Greyback, Rosier, the Carrows. One by one the devout followers of the Dark Lord fell to the bewitching Boy Who Lived from another world. The entire support base of the Dark Lord ripped from the fear and control of their master, then expertly deployed in plots against him.

It was some time into this that Moody, paranoid as he could be, made the comment, /"What's stopping Potter from turning them on us?"/ A thought process mirrored by dear Remus, Nymphadora and the darling Hermione.

Here's hoping they rest in peace now, they died fighting and died heroes not long after their sentiments were voiced. Red flags Albus could only see in hindsight...

Harry's charm did not only work on the enemy. Of course they ensnared his allies. The students and staff were bending over backwards to accommodate any whim he even alluded to, an Auror contingent assigned to him at a desperate Fudge's command, the entire corp collapsing into civil war in order to be a part of the five man unit. Even ICW representatives were swearing their countries allegiance to the cause after brief talks with the boy.

But it was the Weasley's that came closest to undoing it all in Dumbledore's mind.

The Weasley's adored him, hoping to protect him the way they felt they failed to before. Percy Weasley, stunningly, even going so far as to throw away his own life in service of the boy.

The only time Albus questioned anything, the first time he almost failed to convince himself that there was nothing amiss. Even now he could not comprehend how he'd justified Harry's order to, /"Fight. Don't stop, don't flee, just fight."/ And seen nothing wrong with Percy's enthusiastic, /"Of course."/ The boy who had chosen the Ministry over them all...

Albus Dumbledore could only hope that others would see what he saw now. He wished he had some warning to leave the others, but he was up against a being who did not win a war with spells and fear and violence. He won with words, and nothing he could say would ever beat this adversaries.

Whatever he'd summoned could walk the walk and talk the talk of Harry James Potter. Somewhat more mellow, more mature than his counterpart, but definitive in his impersonation.

But the being he'd summoned had Bellatrix Lestrange gore her husband and brother-in-law (who gratefully allowed their own massacre) at the drop of a hat. Had Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy perform unspeakable actions to their tearful and screaming child. Had the Dark Lord himself bared before him like a common whore, desperately awaiting commands from the boy in his throne like a desperate pup... all for this */things/* amusement and adoration.

It was when Voldemort 'fell', the circumstances of Tom's turn to "their side" that the cracks formed. But Harry was far from them at that point. He was in the Wireless, his voice in the household of every man, woman and child who called themselves a witch or wizard, those same sweet words that turned a nation (and all those beyond it that heard his whispers) into fanatics. The goblins pledged their allegiance in an afternoon when he simply arrived at their bank. Bane and Aragog vowed their servitude and bowed down before him after a smile and a oh-so-soft order to do so. The Minister refused re-election to allow him his position, the Wizagmot throwing him complete executive power of the nation after the smallest of pouts.

The Dark Side fell. As did democracy and freedom, all to the pretty boy with the soft words and the gentle smile.

Albus Dumbledore, he stood behind him in the Minsitry Atrium, press snapping photos as he finally, and publically condemned Harry's move to reach out to Europe personally. To unite all nations and peoples, magical and otherwise, under his message of peace and love.

It was when a press member screeched he was a war monger that Albus truly realised the depth of his mistake. When the crowd rushed the barrier and attempted to shove past the Aurors to get to him. When his wand was literally pulled from between his fingers and used to slay the phoenix that had dove in for the rescue.

It was only then that he realised the irony. Only when Harry vanished with a snap and issued his final words,

To the Aurors: /"No need to get hurt, stand aside and let them come."/ To him, /"You had me killed, you raised me to fight and die. But I forgive you, Professor."/ And he Disapparated and allowed the bloodthirsty crowd to fall down upon him.

Only at the end that he saw the irony. He'd never fallen for the charm and the tricks when Tom Riddle had attempted them. But whatever this thing was, that took the form of a child he held so dear to his heart, it had already won long before he'd caught on.

** Those things... they'd come out of nowhere. Like a plague. Locusts, fire, lighthouse keepers, this plague was worse than them all. They'd been fine at first. Useful, even. People loved them. But then they'd turned. Those monsters... They'd started with the food. One day, the farms were providing and the farmers prosperous, the next, the fields were destroyed. Gone in a matter of hours. That only made them worse. Then, they began on the people. You'd wake up to feel teeth digging into you and find a skeleton lying next to you where your partner had been. The Wizarding World fell to its knees in a couple of months. Nobody could've predicted it. So much fur. So much death. So many... chitters. That was the trouble with Tribbles. Too cute to die.
