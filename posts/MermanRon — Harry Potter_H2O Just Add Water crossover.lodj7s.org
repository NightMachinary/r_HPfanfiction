Let's say instead of going to Egypt the summer before third year, the entire Weasley family goes to Australia. Ron somehow falls into a magical pool, becomes a merboy and tries to keep it a secret from everyone. The main conflict, I'd imagine, would be how he would control his newfound power(s) over water (In the original show the girls got powers over water - one could increase or decrease the amount of water present, manipulate it into shapes and later control the wind, one could heat water up and later control fire and lightening, one could freeze water, and later develops the ability to control clouds, ice, and snow and the last could change water into gelatine and a crystalline substance), deal with the ‚Äúyou become a merman ten seconds after touching water‚Äù thing, dealing with full moon weirdness (the girls couldn't look at the full moon, either directly or indirectly, or else they began acting strange/out of control) and keeping it a secret so that he doesn't lose his human rights (merpeople are considered beasts in HP canon). Could make the Second Task and the aftermath more interesting, or work as a fun one-shot crackfic.


** That sounds so cool, someone write this!

*** Someone probably will but with Hermione instead of Ron and throw in bashing for good measure :/ If I had the time I definitely would, though.

**** Can you please stop complaining about Ron bashing and Hermione at every occasion?

***** It's a free country. You get to write a lot of Hermione-centric fics, and I get to comment on the prevalent Ron-bashing in HP fanfics.

****** Sure it's a free country, but it's also counterproductive. I was actually contempalting such a plot - I'm familiar with the series and I write Ron-centric stories, among others - but reading another complaint about Hermione and Ron bashing pretty much shot that down.

My complaints are nothing new. If they bother you so much you shouldn't have clicked on my post.

** The powers are not imporant - compared to magic, they are mostly mere party tricks. The political struggle seems most interesting - though I see Ron telling Harry and Hermione the truth quickly.

*** Magic mostly needs a wand or a potion though, so would definitely be cool powers to play around with. Especially with how much water is in the human body....

**** Would it be cool? Yes. But it's pretty much just fluff. Story-wise, there's no significant difference between wandless and wanded magic. Not when a wizard almost always has their wand on them. Sure, you can create situations where such magic will save the day - but that's it, situations created specifically for that. Ultimately, it's not a source of conflict, nor for character growth - it's just a gimmick.

**** Exactly. 'Wandless' magic.
