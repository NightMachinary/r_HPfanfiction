I really want to read a fic where he is raising Harry (probably forced to by Dumbledore or something) but i just don't want him to be this amazing father for Harry because it feels out of character for Snape, i think it needs to be much more complicated than that, like it always is with Snape. (Not saying he needs to be abusive or something, even tho that would also be interesting to read i think so i don't have a problem with the fic being like that too). He could try to make Harry think James was an awful human... Or other things like that idk. And if he isn't abusive he still probably tries to distance himself from him at first but than gets attached to him with time... God i need a fic like that lmao

** The sacrifices arc series by Lightning on Wave is pretty amazing with its Snape as a fatherly figure. He starts taking on that role more in the third fic if the series and he is far from perfect in many ways. Still hates James and lets that cloud his judgment a lot, sometimes is overly protective etc. I love watching the relationship grow between them and Snape has a very hard time accepting his own emotions when it comes to Harry. He loves him as a father, but sometimes is embarrassed of those sentimental emotions and for a long time is poor at showing it. He considers Harry his son and Harry considers him his father over time. It's sweet and complicated and just overall well executed.

Harry is also an abused child in this. He was made to be this child solider/ protector of his twin brother Conner who is believed to be the boy who lived. At first you think Harry is very marysue, but then you realize that he's all kinds of messed up and because of the abuse he doesn't think or act like a child should. Snape notices this too and tries to get Harry to overcome his training and Harry resents him at times for it. But Snape is determined to undo the abuse and get him help.

*** I'd love to read something like that tbh. I can see them just having a very complex relationship but still getting attached to each other and having a strange father-son relationship if Snape raised him but i can also see Snape abusing him, well probably because it literally happened in the actual seires in potion class. But for some reason it's hard for me to believe he'd be as harsh as the Durslys (making him sleep in the basement and stuff like that) but it's probably just because i don't want to believe people are capable of doing that.

I always found it odd that for a series about magic and wizards i always thought the begining of every book at Privet Drive were the weirdest parts of the books (weirdest in the worst way tho lmao). So i don't think it makes less sense for them to abuse him, they aren't normal, they just want to be, or think they are.

** I'm reminded of *Whelp*, by /jharad17/. A story where Snape is sent by Dumbledore to do a cursory check on Harry when he's 7, and suffers extreme abuse at the hands of the Dursleys. Snape rescues Harry, and in order to get adequate protections at his own home that Dumbledore thinks are adequate, is forced to adopt Harry and help him recover.

The mentions of child abuse get pretty damn heavy, and Snape is far from the perfect father figure (but isn't in any way mean or abusive to Harry, just woefully inexperienced and stumbles through a fair bit of it).

linkffn(3659602)

It even has a pretty good sequel, which was also completed. While the previous fic took place during the holiday period during which Snape was hired to be potions master, the sequel has Snape trying to juggle his teaching responsibilities while also raising Harry, and there's a lot of stumbles along the way here as well.

I don't think it would be a problem for him to block Voldemort out at any moment. And even if he didn't block him, Voldemort would probably assume that Snape is being nice to Harry to keep his cover as a good guy, which is actually a way more reasonable thing to do rather than bully the children that you're supposed to have their trust so they won't suspect you even tho you're actually on their side.

************* Um, i have mixed feelings about Snape but i can see why a lot of people like him! He's very well written and very interesting. I don't really agree about him redeeming himself but he was indeed very brave and trustworthy.

  Snape most likely suffered worse abuse at the hands of his father

Isn't this a fanon invention? The only reference to Snape's parents in canon that I can remember was the memory where it's mentioned that they're "arguing again."

**** Hmm. But Snape was really scrawny as a kid, so he was most likely neglected.

***** Lots of kids are underweight/overweight. That doesn't mean they're all abused.

All we know of Snape's father is that there was a scene when he yelled at his wife while boy!Snape cried - small children do cry when they hear their parents arguing/yelling at each other, and that Tobias Snape used to argue with Eileen.

It is a big jump from what's actually seen to Tobias Snape being abusive.

****** Okay, he may not have been abused PHYSICALLY, but he was probably abused mentally because he was most /definitely/ neglected as a child. I'm not saying his father whipped him or anything, but he was most certainly neglected.
