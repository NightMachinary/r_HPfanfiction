With the update of The merging I decided to re read it, and wow, the author changed it a lot, really. So what are you guys thoughts ? Is it better? Worse? Same?

I'm having a little problem with it, mostly because I'm fighting my memory all the time. And I'm looking for a less biased opinion and to discuss what everyone thinks.

Just to clarify, English is not my first language so go easy on me.


** How's it changed?

*** He is editing little by little for a good time, so I don't know exactly when your read it the first time, but some of them from the first time I read are :

- No more magic suppressing potion,be it on Hogwarts or sirius house, so te training could be all day.

- The first Daphne a Tracy scene on the ice cream shop is gone.

- Took out the scene of him discovering his "felling people's magic ability" With Hermione and Ginny. He just have it know, no build up.

- Lots of small interactions with Tonks on the summer was taken off (is it the right way to write?), like the clothes shopping.

- Harry's detention with McGonagall was changed to the rune's teacher and Tracy.

- After that most of it is just he changing the things to reflect the mentioned alterations (like: how there is no more suppressing magic potion, his scene with Su Li on charms make no more sense) .

- Oh and of course ( I agree 100% with this one, but it is a change) the dimensional trip was transformed into an omake.

There is some more, but most of them are just pretty small or I just don't remember. A lot of the changes were just to clean the story up, but there was a lot of them that didn't make a lot of sense to me and that are, mainly, the ones I want to discuss about.

Edit: sorry for the awful formatting, I'm on the phone

**** Damn, I knew something was missing cause I distinctly remembered the Su Li scene when Harry says something like "my magic doesn't work in the mornings." I'm not a huge fan of the changes as you described, I think HP on the whole is built on the little moments of wonder and exploration and those are all gone now, it makes the story feel less alive.

I still greatly enjoyed it after re-reading it when the new chapters came out, hopefully there's more coming to keep fleshing it out.

***** Exactly, I was saying to a friend that the story is "prettier" Now but it lost part of it's personality. There were a lot of small things that I loved on this fic that now don't exist

I still love it though, I'm re-reading right now, but I just feel a little sad with a lot of this small moments that I really liked before

**** A big one you can add, and I'll be vague to avoid spoilers is the source of a certain ring. I re-read it the other day and this was definitely the reason for the length between updates.

*** Sure, the link ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/]]) It is an amazing fic, the author was MIA for some time but he decided to come back to conclude the story so it is complete and totally worth it

** Saw the billions of update posts so decided to read it for the first time. Gave up reading around the halfway point and stopped skimming like 10 chapters before the last...
