** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4721967/1/Biscuits-A-Love-Story][Biscuits: A Love Story]] by Pinky Brown covers up through early (pre-Lavender) 6th year. Each chapter focuses on interactions between Ron and Hermione with biscuits somehow playing a role. It is very well-written and, if memory serves, 100% canon compliant.
