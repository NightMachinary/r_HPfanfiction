... Spoiler alert?

Anyway, I remember reading this about a year ago, I guess, and I am not sure if the author was actually finished writing it or not. I enjoyed it well enough, though, but the issue is, I can't remember what it's called.

There's a bit where Harry is caught by Death Eaters and sent to Draco's. He is in a carriagehouse (quite injured) and sees Draco and Ginny together. That's what I can remember specifically. Ginny "died" by falling to her death, but it turns out Draco saved her. It's not really a Draco/Ginny fic, but that's what I remember.

Also, if anyone knows any good Harry-centric fics that are well written and have great action scenes (with consequences, if you want), that'd be awesome. I don't care if it's Harry/Hermione or Harry/Ginny so long as it's well written. It can be post-Hogwarts, post-DH, I don't care. I've read everything by *Little0Bird* and *Northumbrian*. I love a good drama.

Thanks.
