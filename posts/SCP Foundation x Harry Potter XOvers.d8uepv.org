I've read one called "SCP 5536 and The Magical Pebble" and was wondering if there were any other fics like it.


** Unfortunately, I haven't found any SCP Foundation and Harry Potter crossovers that weren't oneshots or abandoned after only a few chapters. To my knowledge, my fanfic is both the largest one and the only one on still being updated.
