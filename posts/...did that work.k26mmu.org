Tom Riddle rises again in the Chamber of Secrets, escapes out into the world and reinserted himself into wizarding society.

When asked where he'd been (and why he looked so young) he told the world he had been on a sabbatical since 1965, to gain enough knowledge and experience so that Albus Dumbledore could not reject him for the Defense Against the Dark Arts position again.

To his incredulous horror, EVERYONE believes him.

When Voldemort returns, he is persuaded to fight against his older self, both working against each other but desperate not to let on who they actually are...


** Love this. I'm working on a story where young Tom gets roped into fighting against Voldemort, and I'd love to read some other examples of it.

** Ok headcanon that I have

Creating a horcrux taints your soul not the soul shard you put in the object. Its what makes horcruxes discreet and not stand out as dark objects.

But that only applies if you only make one horcrux. Voldemort made multiple so all other horcruxes after the first one comes from an already tainted soul.

Its that tainted curse that stops your soul from healing. If Tom Riddle comes back to life as a full person from the diary then his soul shard will heal since its not tainted. But he's also in a different time a different life with new experiences to shape and change him that Voldemort never had. This new soul that forms is a new thing entirely its no longer a soul shard. Its no longer Voldemort's horcrux but Tom Riddle's soul. Despite the Diary not being destroyed, a year after Tom Riddle Jr emerges from it Voldemort is down one horcrux.
