Hi everyone!

i'm looking for new stories where draco & harry are actually friends but (no slash) , they don't fall for each other ?

preferably completed ones :)

I don't mind if it has dumbles and weasley bashing

tbh, it pretty entertaining to read :))

thank youuu <3


** I was looking for this a while ago. A story where Harry and Draco sort out their differences during Hogwarts and start up an unlikely friendship.

** If you haven't read it, the Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven series is great. Harry and Draco are besties, and it is just overall well done. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4762385]]
