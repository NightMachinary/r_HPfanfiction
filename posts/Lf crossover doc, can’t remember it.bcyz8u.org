I think it was where a young Harry was sent to Azkaban for a group people being kill in room and he was the only one lived and in the room. Later he turns out to be Dante or Nero (can't remember which).

I think lily played a big role too, like it focus on her and Harry's POV


** *James and Lily alive,

*Harry's brother(?) is the BWL

*That group of people killing in the party for BWL's 6. birthday.

*Lily punch Harry and shape of her ring form on his cheek

*Harry warns about demons(?) but no one believes him and later they come and they understand Harry is innocent, they tried to release him but the leader(?) of the demons (she) rescue him and broadcast the WW, and Harry's hair is white.

*Lily call other witches to find Harry or something like that.

If these true I remember I read the story on ffn but don't remember the name and several fics deleted from ffn.
