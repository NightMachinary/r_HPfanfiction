** I loved the bit with him trying out the wand woods. It was cool that the only explanation we got for the pine was Harry's description of the tree and Daewen's technical read of the branch. It's up to the reader to draw the connections to Harry's character.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

*** Lord of the rings crossovers are hands down the best fics in every fandom I read. I think there's something about that universe in particular that draws fantastic writers.

**** I never used to read crossovers but then I read a particularly good lotr one and now I'm hooked I agree that the middle earth ones are some of the best but the avenger crossovers workout pretty well as in the two worlds fit well together.
