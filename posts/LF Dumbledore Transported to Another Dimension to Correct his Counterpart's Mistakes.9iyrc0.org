Or at least, I think that was the premise of the story. The Dumbledore there was either messing up or maybe purposefully doing bad shit, and canon Dumbledore is either Transported there or reborn there to fix things. Possibly in a new body, but I don't remember; maybe he supplanted the Dumbledore there

Might have been an HHR, but honestly I can't remember much since I only recall seeing the summary. Sorry if this is too vague.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
