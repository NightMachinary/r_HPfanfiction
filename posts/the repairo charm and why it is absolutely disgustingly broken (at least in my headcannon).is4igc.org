first of, the repairo charm could be used as a multipurpose healing charm of legend, from my understanding it is meant to repair anything that the spell is cast on so why cant it heal a broken bone together or fuse areas of skin that a split like in a cut or laceration. on top of this i dont think you would ever really have to care about body maintenance like washing, brushing, giving yourself a heart attack by fat buildup, chipping teeth.... the charm to my understanding takes something to its prime condition from the condition that it was at - even if it has to add material to said structure - so lets say you had a few chipped teeth after getting in a back alley brawl, youve been passed out for 15 days and you as fat as a whale (cough cough dursley cough) and then had the charm cast on you the dirt would be removed the unwanted and degrading materials from the body would be removed (fat, toxins, potential dislodged bone fragments) his. teeth would become whole again.that brought up an interesting thought actually - if it causes the body to become the prime self it can be in its current form then would it remove irregularities from the body such as bacteria not native to the body, virus', and fungi because if so right there you have an effective cure to all ailments caused by outside biology - like no more malaria or cholera or corona......

the other aspect is that it could be used to cheat in gaining and saving a lot of money. if you continually went to things like charity, junk, pawn and artefact (the places that sell like really old stuff which is usually just forms of furniture or decorations but can also sell thing things like olden Japanese katanas from the samurai age that have rusted and broken but would still be cool to own, things like this i forget the actual type of shops name) shops, buy everything you can repair it then sell it back fully repaired and good as new while keeping anything that strikes your fancy making a profit. you can then also use it for once you have something never having to buy anything new again unless it is clothes and you out grow them as if their is ever a scratch or curt - gone - if it ever stops working for whatever reason - working again - if there is ever a scuff mark of dirt - what scuff mark of dirt?

like i said this is probably just headcannon but eh, i didnt look up the official laws regarding the subject and it was interesting to think about. hope you had a good time while i jumped from subject to subject like a kangaroo on coke :)


** It's up to the author to balance the power of magic in their story. Elsewise you have people conjuring nukes and and surviving trips into space with first year charms. It's important to note that while you can do something (and maybe justify it with flimsy logic), doesn't mean you should.

*** i understand you but at the same time i resent that, however that may just be my way of thinking that if you can abuse the system with something (like the repairo charm) which by its very principles that it is made up of to accomplish can do something why ignore it and council out the possibility entirely doing otherwise to me (and you have to understand it is just the way i am i am not necessarily insulting you) is like asking a strict rule-bent authority figure in the Church who is the pope to sign the death warrant on hundreds of innocent people then executing the execution personally. the concept of having something so primal powerful and yet so totally ignored and diminished to nothing but what is essentially the square set of the spells category (barely ever used) is insulting as it grates across my being like holding pelvis to a sander using the roughest sandpaper there is to rip across my groin. i dont want it and i dont understand why that would come to happen at all. like hell if you want reasoning you can just claim that wizards are plain idiotic in how they do things why is there repairo then oculos repairo, why does transfiguration have like 100 different spells for 5 different transfiguration when for the most part transfiguration is all the same on a fundamental level - imagine what you want and every aspect of said wants and will it to said imagination - instead of just having a universal transfiguration spell which applies to anything in general rather than having a spell that transfigures a cup into a mouse and a different one for a piece of parchment into a mouse.

sorry about the rant but eh, who cares, even i will admit but point being limiting something from their fundamental capabilities just because you can even though it like i said goes against the fundamental capabilities of something that most people are to blind to see or ignorant to use the possible gains from for the sake of ye you can and ye you can back it up with 'flimsy' logic but just because you can doesn't mean you should is absolutely stupid.

hope you have a good evening gentlemen.

** Reparo has strict limits in canon though... Harry's Nimbus can't be fixed after flying into the Whomping Willow and neither Ron in CoS nor Harry in DH can fix their wands.

** Healing charms would require the healing of live cells and tissue whereas repairing an inanimate object is just that, maybe?

*** and this my good friend is why i stated headcannon, their might not be proof that you can but their is at least reason to not count of the possibility and for the other section it is talking of inanimate things so going by your silence i think you might agree with me on that one.

have a good say my good saw and be happy knowing that you gave a brother of you at least the tiniest bit of hope that we aren't all entire failures and waste's of space with your open mindfulness in your response - just becuase there is no proof of something does not meen it is impossible givern that it doesnt have any proof against it.

** Pretty sure Repairo only works on inanimate objects.

And even then there are limits and power involved. Harry's Nimbus couldn't be repaired. His wand could only be repaired by the Elder Wand.
