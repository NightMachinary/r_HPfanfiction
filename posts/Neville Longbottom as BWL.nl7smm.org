Hi I'm looking for a Harry Potter fanfiction that has Neville Longbottom as the BWL and has Harry being another prodigy that would change the world in his own way?


** Sounds like linkffn(The Art Of Self-Fashioning) where Harry is a Transfiguration prodigy.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  Harry isn't the Boy-Who-Lived, but his parents still died, and Albus Dumbledore, concerned that Death Eaters might seek the boy's death, cast a powerful charm on him to make wizards ignore him before Harry was left with the Dursleys. Except, with the Elder Wand in play, the charm was far too powerful, and made others essentially forget Harry existed when not directly interacting with him. Sorted into Ravenclaw at Hogwarts, Harry lives a contented life with no one either loving or hating him...until the charm breaks on his seventeenth birthday, and he's suddenly plunged directly into the middle of a living world at war.

*** I absolutely loved C'est La Vie ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è it's a shame that it hasn't been updated in such a long time. The author on Tumblr said that it wasn't discontinued but I wouldn't keep your hopes up if I were you.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** I highly suggest the odds were never in my favor by Antony444.

Has female harry (Alexandra potter) and neville is BWL.

Story is really really good. Currantly at 700k words and is actively updated.

There a lot of good things about the fic, honestly, too much to list.

Just read it and thank me!
