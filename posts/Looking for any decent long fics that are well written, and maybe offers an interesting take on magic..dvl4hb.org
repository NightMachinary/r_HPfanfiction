Like the title says. I'm looking for any well written fic that that is decently long that has, at the very least, one unique take on magic. The best fic that can summarize what I'm looking for is The Archeologist.

Edit: I just want to say thanks to those of you who have suggested fics and those of you who saw the post and upvoted it. I know it's not a lot of traffic but this was my first time posting to reddit and honestly wasn't expecting to see anything on this post. So thanks again.


** Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and sequels have my favorite take on Potions as a subject. The universe greatly fleshes out Potions theory and makes it much more magical, being not just about the physical natures of the ingredients, but what magic is put into a potion and the conceptual nature of the art. Dueling is also fleshed out, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea, since it introduces physical weapons to the mix.

Linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) doesn't feature a ton of magic, as it's more a Hero's Journey story than an in-depth dive into HP magic, but the dueling it does include is very, very well done and it has some interesting concepts that are relics of the time before HBP and DH when the magic system was still much more up in the air. TPatS also has my favorite, bar none, Power He Knows Not. It's a perfect power that allows someone like Harry to stand against Voldemort despite the gap in their age/training and conceptually it would also be something that would never, ever occur to Voldemort to try. Unfortunately, we never get to see it used in direct combat against Voldemort, but it still gets one very good utilization before the fic is abandoned.

Which brings me to the downside for both - TPatS is abandoned and the Pureblood Pretense series is theoretically updating, but gets maybe 1-2 chapters a year. There's still a ton of words in each (Pureblood Pretense series is as long as canon currently and TPaTS is about the length of HBP and DH combined), but you won't get a perfect ending to either.

** linkffn(The Arithmancer) focuses on Hermione, as a mathematical prodigy, inventing spells. Not sure if it's quite what you're looking for, but I found the author's exploration of the subject very interesting. It covers 1-4 years but has a sequel that is 5-7. Both are completed.

*** It was a great fic up to a point, but Umbridge had unbelievable plot armor in year 5. It's a pity because Hermione had really good development. But Umbridge did a ton of shit and the only explanation why no one did anything was "because she's friends with the minister".

**** Well, it was the same in the originals, wasn't it? Umbridge tortured people and nothing happened. Now, I'm not saying that that excuses it all, but also keep in mind that the Ministry had information control in the form of the Prophet and that Hermione, as an underage student, would have her wand snapped if she had been expelled.

***** I don't remember if she tortured anyone besides Harry in the books even though the movies played it up quite a bit. And if I remember correctly she also tortured Cedric and Ginny (or was it the twins?) in this fic. Now torturing a muggleborn like Hermione or someone who's been slandered by the press like Harry for months is one thing. Torturing the pureblood children of ministry workers would be another matter I think. Not to mention the many, many possibilities like going to the minister, going to the muggle prime minister, going to the ICW, hiring mercenaries or assassins, literally dozens of methods of assassination, etc.

It's a pity because the fic really was great up until year five. But Umbridge's plot armor just killed it for me. I think it got so ridiculous she had a whipping post installed in the Great hall and the teachers did literally nothing. It seems the author was simply hell-bent on following the end of the year showdown formula like Rowling.

(It's a bit offtopic but I remember another fic where Hogwarts had an ex- military muggle caretaker. So when Umbridge tried to torture his daughter he just pulled out a gun and shot her in the face. Ah, it was absolutely glorious. Not everything has to happen in June, you know)

Veeeeerry old Harry/Draco (written pre-OotP) - 71k word one-shot. May or may not fit the bill for what you're looking for, but has the most interesting magic system I've ever seen. You figure out the magic as the characters do, so I don't want to spoil it, but whenever someone says "unique magic" this is the fic I immediately think of.
