:END:
I remembered reading this fic 3 yrs ago and i'm craving in insane to read it again. The plot was Harry turn into a magical creature and Draco was taking care of him in an abandon house while trying to survive the war are breaking out between wizard and muggles. There are boms and military plane thingy going on there. (Sorry for my bad typing). Hope someone anyone found the fic cause i'm running on my last attempt here guys.
