In every single fanfic I've read that contained Arcturus, no one has a bad word for him. He is literally portrayed as just and fair but why? Why do so many people like Arcturus Black?


** I remember reading a few fics in which he was a drug addict, in which he was a sniveling coward, in which he was basically male Walburga.

Those fics all had two things in common: they showed Orion in a positive light and only featured Arcturus marginally. Get the drift?

There's not much of a point in featuring Arcturus specifically if you're just gonna make him yet another evil Black family member. He's usually there to play the role of the wise old man turning his family back from the brink of disaster and extinction, if he's shit he doesn't fit the role.

** I think part of it is that Arcturus sounds old-fashioned, like it'd be the name of a stern older man. So I think when people want to write about an older, more level-headed Black, that's who they go for.

** I think it is because most of the fics that contain Arcturus Black are fics that are pro-pureblood and that means that the writers have no reason to make Arcturus Black a bad guy but every reason to make him a good person.

I have read exactly one fic where he was a truly awful person. And in that one he was already dead so he only came up when Sirius explained how awful his family was.

*** I always thought it was because he never disowned Sirius which made lots of people like him.

**** We don't know that actually. Arcturus is never mentioned in the books and neither is how he reacted to Sirius running away. But many have come to the conclusion that since Sirius could still inherit Grimauld Place must he not have been truly disowned and that it must be thanks to Arcturus since he was the oldest male family member alive at the time.
