I'd love a story where we give Dumbledore the benefit of the doubt.

I should note that find bashing stories cringey, since I feel like those characters could be written as antagonists without turning them into parodies of themselves with only their worst possible traits. Makes me feel like the characters lack depth when their sole motivation as a character is to be horrible to the main character and be the authors target for showing how strong/smart/powerful their main character is.

If at all possible, anything like the below:

Give me a story where Dumbledore put Harry with the Dursleys due to Lily's wishes, because Lily did love her sister. At most making Petunia hate wizard kind because they took away her sister, even before she was murdered.

A story where Dumbledore isn't this manipulative bastard of a character who is always trying to throw Harry into danger every year with trials and tribulations. Where he really is trying his best to help Harry, but he is also trying to run a school, be supreme mugwump and chief warlock. Where the blood wards aren't worthless, actually keeping Harry safe, since that was one of the few options Dumbledore had. Where if Dumbledore was using the money from Harry's vault, it's for a good reason, whether that be paying his tuition or helping cover his food or whatever. However, also where Dumbledore isn't trying to block and confine Harry at every turn. He wants Harry to have a happy life since Harry has had enough bad stuff happen as it is without being made miserable. Where Quirrel really was able to avoid detection. Where Dumbledore didn't leave Sirius in prison while knowing he was innocent.

I guess I want a Dumbledore that acts more like a grandfather to Harry. A lot of the above is what bash fics usually use to target Dumbledore, though it isn't an exhaustive list by any means. Fics that throw these bash tropes on their head are great too :)

Sorry if this was rather rambly and thank you in advance for any fic recs!

Thanks loves!


** That sounds like canon, to be honest.

Most fics /don't/ bash Dumbledore. Bashing is frowned upon, for good reasons, so most (good) authors don't bash him.

** The closest fic I can think of is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13553343][Albus Dumbledore and the Boy Who Lived]] linkao3(13553343), which follows canon events from Dumbledore's POV, and has great characterization. However, it's a WIP (and hasn't been updated in a while).

I also know a couple of oneshots that don't really go into Dumbledore's decision-making, but do focus on a (positive) relationship with Harry:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5641464/1/Forgive-an-Old-Man][Forgive an Old Man]] linkffn(5641464)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8788265/1/Tis-the-Season][Tis the Season]] linkffn(8788265)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1130031][Golden]] linkao3(1130031)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14392005][pity the living]] linkao3(14392005) - I wrote this one; please forgive the self-promotion

And if you're interested in a general Dumbledore character study, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10799454][Dulce et decorum est]] linkao3(10799454) packs an incredible amount of characterization into 800 words.

I hope at least one of these is of interest to you - I know from personal experience how hard it is to find non-bashing Dumbledore fics.

  Albus Dumbledore never dreamed he would have such a person on his hands. He had never imagined how quickly even the best laid plans could be derailed by something as simple as love. Snippets of the Harry Potter series from Dumbledore's point of view. Will eventually cover all seven books.

** My thoughts on it are this: Dumbledore had zero control over who Harry went to. Harry went exactly to who did have control - his next of kin. Dumbledore had /no say/ in who Harry went to. There were no other relatives to go to.

The unfortunate thing, and the basis of all bashing fics, is a quote where he says "I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years". That's where it becomes messed up, and implies he had control over anything to do with Harry, and also that he knowingly put Harry in an abusive home. That's a part of canon I tend to ignore because it contradicts a larger part of canon. It happens a lot in the books.

**** Sort of, but you have to stretch it a bit. Dumbledore was implying pretty heavily Harry was there solely so he wouldn't grow up spoiled and used to the fame. Which is a fair assessment, James grew up adored and spoiled by his parents, and was a pretty horrible child. You can see some celebrities' children, and child stars who grow up in the limelight also have pretty troubled lives from puberty onward (sometimes even before then :( ).

It's certainly a far cry from "I didn't want you to grow up to be Corey Feldman" to "I wanted you to grow up abused so you'd be easily manipulated". But I think JK wrote that bit badly, trying to write a quotable line about "dark and difficult years".

So anyway, what I'm trying to say is, I pretend Dumbledore is being overly dramatic and saying "I knew I was sending you to a childhood without magic, in a starched and sterile environment". It ties in with Mcgonagall calling them "the worst sort of Muggles" - what she meant was, the bland, unimaginative, cookie cutter lifestyle of the upper middle class.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
