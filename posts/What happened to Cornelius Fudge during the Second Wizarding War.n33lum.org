We lose track of Fudge at the beginning of book 6. How does his life continue after that?


** My headcanon is that Voldemort and the Death Eaters left him alone because:

- He was such a useful idiot during their first year of regaining power.

- He wasn't worth killing anyway.

Fudge probably disappeared from public view at some point due to his disgrace. Maybe he spent the rest of his days keeping a low profile within Britain, or he emigrated overseas. He did, however, stay in an 'advisory capacity' within Scrimgeour's Ministry, though it's not clear as to how long or whether or not the Voldemort-seized Ministry kept him.

Then again, JKR did say that Fudge was based on Winston Churchill's predecessor, Neville Chamberlain, who tried to negotiate with Hitler in the hopes of securing peace (Chamberlain did eventually declare war on Germany once they invaded Poland). Chamberlain died roughly six months after resigning as Prime Minister.
