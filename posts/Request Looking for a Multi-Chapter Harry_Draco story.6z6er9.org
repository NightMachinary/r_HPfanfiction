Looking for any Harry/Draco stories that don't bash Ron Weasley, the other Weasleys or Hermione. Would rather not bash Dumbledore either.

Any rating is fine.


** Any particular tropes or themes you want - like Hogwarts Era, War Fic, Auror Partners, Creature Fic, Bonding Fic, etc.? There are over 41 thousand stories written in English with Harry and Draco on FF.net and nearly 23 thousand on AO3 so I would say there are literally thousands of fics out there that meet your criteria.

My personal favorite is *Turn*. It's an Epliogue compliant fic that doesn't involve bashing.

Also as pempskins said, come over to [[/r/HPSlashFic]]. Asking more specifically what you are looking for there would probably give you more replies than here.

  One good turn always deserves another. Apparently. Epilogue compliant/AU. HPDM slash but some canon het along the way. Please trust me - I promise the epilogue will not bite you.

** Try linkao3(secrets by vorabiza). Long, well-written, unique plot, slow development of the relationship - necessary considering their starting point, no bashing of anyone. AU sixth year, I believe. Maybe seventh after a non-canon sixth.
