Pretty much the title. Are there any stories out there like the Seventh Horcrux in that Harry is Voldemort but not evil that aren't crack?


** There was one where harrymort makes a deal with riddlemort and the piece of riddle in harry returns to riddle himself. Actually, a couple like that. One has the newly resane riddle work in secret to undo his shit, the other the fragment was a trojan horse and immediately murdered his followers then suicided, I think.

**** Never read Abraxas, both of those were one-shots, I think. Didn't really like them so I didn't fave, just the plots remained behind.

  When Voldemort gave Harry that scar he gave him two other things; a part of his soul and a friend. The last remnant of Tom Riddle's humanity mentors Harry. (1st year complete, now on hiatus until inspiration for second year strikes)

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be woth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
