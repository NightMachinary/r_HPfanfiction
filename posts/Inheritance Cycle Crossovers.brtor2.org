Just reread the Inheritsnce cycle and I'm in the mood for some Galbatorix, already read linkffn(To train a dragon rider). Thanks in advance.


** Jesus, 'To Train a Dragon Rider' is terrible. I checked it out, and I couldn't get past the first chapter. Huge paragraphs and a ridiculous amount of run-on sentences made it unbearable.

Do they get better at writing, or does this stay that way?

** Regrettably the two that I most want to see update are abandoned. Naturally. I'll link them anyways, as they really are quite interesting.

linkffn(Who am I? by epsi10n) is a unique premise where MOD!Harry gets summoned by Galbatorix and made into a Shade with Shruikan. Understandably, he takes offense to this.

linkffn(Last Wish and Testament by Silent.Storm) is another abandoned one that I remember fondly, Although it is regrettably kind of short.

  Eager for more power, Galbatorix tried to create the first dragon Shade. The spirit he'd summoned, the Master of Death, took pity on the poor dragon and merged their souls rather than simply taking control of the body. Now with a mind to match his rage, the new Shruikan plans to dish out justice while he searches for his new Name. [On indefinite hiatus: Please see Ch28 for details]

** The only ones I've enjoyed are linkffn(By Courage and Love; Slowly then All at Once)

BCaL is sort of a spin-off based on StAaO, but with the author's permission and its actually completely different after the first 3 chapters, not to mention both Helena's personality and Godric's.

**** Both are femHarry, there's no slash in it. Sorry, but yeah, its femHarry. If you can get past that, both are fantastic stories with intricate magic system-mesh, fairly original plotlines(mostly on Slowly) a good romance(on BCaL) and it scratches that Inheritance Cycle Itch. Really do give it a try, its worth it, imo.

***** Yeah, I just can't get into fics where the MC/primary narrator is female, it just doesn't do it for me. As a guy, it's just much easier to identify with a male narrator.

Don't get me wrong, I like reading different perspectives within a story - recently I read a ASoIAF crossover that had great chapters from Aeryn (female OC) and Margery - but for the main character, it doesn't work for me.

It's just a personal preference, and part of it is the different interests and focuses women naturally have; it's especially strange when the romance/lemons come in.

Funnily enough, I actually read and liked a couple fem!Harry and fem! Voldemort stories - but the MC was Harry. So I don't know if that makes the first pairing incest or masturbation... Or what that says about me, lol.

****** I know, I can't read slash at all, even if the plot seems good. Though curiously enough, I love and sometimes prefer femHarry. Never other genderbend characters, but I do read and like female MCs just as much as male(i'm a dude). I also usually read for the romance, so there's that. I can't read femVoldemort or any fics where he/she is the pairing, though. It would be just too OoC for me. The only one I've enjoyed was one where femHarry became a wolf animagus and started living in a forest and was found by Nagini, who adopted her. Really cute fic and funny.
