This occurs during 5th year and the trio decide to help. Sirius seeing the chaos uses his wealth to overwhelmingly arm them and also sell the "good" side faulty goods. Voldemort quickly finds out his dueling skills don't matter when a centaur can fire an arrow so far away he can't even see it coming. Within 5 years, Hogwarts the once overly large castle with a relatively small inhabitants inside is now acually filled with a variety of human and not quite so human students. Harry also decides to become a teacher because I dislike cop Harry.


** Why should they have any say in the matter? The ministry of magic, Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmead and generally what we call "the wizarding world" is made by wiches and wizards for witches and wizard. The creatures you named have their own society and shouldn't interfere in witches and wizard's affairs.

** And it turns out that they exchanged one faulty government for another - but this one discriminates them because they are humans ;)

And the fic ends with invasion from other magical governments of Europe because "We cannot allow this British Revolution to spread. It would be just like that Muggle debacle all those years ago with that Napoleon chap"

*** I cackled, I just watched Oversimplified's Napoleon videos and I couldn't help but laugh at the idea of this happening!

Also would be nice for Magical Britain to be in France's place when everyone in Europe is against them (*not that they aren't already*) and oh gosh this could turn into a war fic in which the British and other nations in the Commonwealth have a full scale war with the other parts of the world!!
