So, I wonder if I violated etiquette or courtesy...

Someone asked about possible interest in a story they were considering writing.

I answered the question, but then I went on to cite two other stories that included that same premise.

I wonder if my mentioning the other stories was inappropriate in some way? What does the culture of this subreddit say?

Kinda wondering if I did something wrong...


** I don't think so? But in that case I would generally try to remember to just ask if they would like the links when it's a post that isn't expressly asking for recs. But I don't think it's a full on faux pas, at least from what I've seen?

*** I went back and others also had made fic suggestions, so I guess I am okay?

** I think you did nothing wrong as long as you didn't spoil any fics you recommended or used the appropriate tool to hide any spoilers.

*** Thanks.

I was pretty vague on details, other than my opinion on the original question.
