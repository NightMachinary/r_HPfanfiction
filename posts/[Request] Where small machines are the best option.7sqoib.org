So I am looking for more stories that have people taking advantage of nanomachines, nanites, micromachines, nanobots, nanotech, or any other term for lots of nearly invisible robots being used for awesomeness!

An example (old, but still great... complete even!) is here: Harry Janus Potter - Dances with his Destiny ~ linkffn(10524500)

Not everyone's cup of tea, I accept, but I LOVE stories where these things are a factor.

Obviously I find these stories in other categories too, but I'm hoping Harry Potter will have a few thanks to Magic letting us cut corners.

//That said, if you know ANY story with nanobots, let me know!

** Not a fanfic at all, but contains nanomachines bending space/reality as if it's magic.

Is actually a light novel with overpowered protagonist. [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/i-said-make-my-abilities-average/?pg=12][I Said Make My Abilities Average!]]

This is plagued however, by mediocre translations from the original language.
