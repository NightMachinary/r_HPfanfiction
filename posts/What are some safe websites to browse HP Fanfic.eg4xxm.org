I love a good fanfic, but some of the sites I've seen look questionable based off of URL.


** archiveofourown.org is my favorite due to the lack of ads and 100% fan support. No monetizing of fanfic, and run by a non-profit organization.

Other big one is fanfiction.net. Not a fan, but many people here are.

*** What are you recommendations on ao3? I've read a lot on FanFiction.Net and would love to expand my reading. I have read some on ao3 before but not many as they aren't as commonly suggested

******** I should probably mention, the majority of these are 100k+ words, very little M/M, a few F/F in there, no multi, no/minimal bashing, and lots of crossovers

all of my favorites are the really big ones

**** I have no idea if my interests align with your interests. Fortunately, Ao3's search function and tagging functions allow you to find fics that many people tend to find good, so let me share my method of finding good fics on Ao3.

Go to the "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/search][Search -> Works]]" link.

Scroll down to the "Work Tags" section. Type in some things you're interested in by character (under "character"), pairing under "relationships", or plot element such as "Slytherin Harry Potter" (under "additional tags"). Existing tags will prompt you to autofill, so when you start typing click on the one that pops up that is relevant to your interests.

Now that you have your tag(s) selected, you can start sorting things out. If you want only completed fics or no crossovers (or ONLY crossovers), scroll back up to "Work Info" and select the relevant filters. You can also use this section to find one shots or longgggg fics (under "word count" - typing in <5000 will net you short fics, >100000 will net you long fics).

At the bottom of the search page, under "Search," here are my pro-tips for finding good reads:

For fics that people enjoyed, change the "sort by" to *kudos*. This tends to get me a good mix of good one-shots and plotty things. Sometimes it'll return the hilarious joke fics as the top result, but there will still like be some good reads.

For fics that people tend to re-read or recommend to others, change the "sort by" to *bookmarks*. This tends to return more longfics than one-shots.

If you're there for smutty shit, change the "sort by" to *hits*. Scroll back up to "Work Info" and check the "single chapter" box. This will return porny one-shots that people return to again and again for /reasons/.

You can also use these same methods in filtering tags. Click on a character tag, relationship tag, or additional tag (one that's fandom specific tends to work best), then click on "filter works" if it doesn't automatically take you to a page full of fic. This page is most useful for filtering OUT things you don't want to read (for example, if you want to read "Slytherin Harry Potter" but not "Dark Harry" fics, go to the Slytherin Harry Potter tag and go to "exclude" on the filters). Filtering tags is one of my FAVORITE Ao3 features.

Have fun!
