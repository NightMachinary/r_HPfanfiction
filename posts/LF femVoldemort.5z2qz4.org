  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

  Harry's in the past. There is no 'Lord' Voldemort. However, if he expects things to be easier just because he's older and Riddle's younger, he's going to be sorely disappointed. Harry's never been one for giving up, but neither has Riddle, and as they both are forced to work together- in more ways than one- the stakes slowly change.

  Harry Potter is neglected and mocked by his family, who prefer his brother Charles, the Boy-Who-Lived. Seeking vengeance against those who scorned him, he becomes the most powerful wizard ever. After all, nothing less is sufficient for the Master of the Hallows. WBWL/MoD!Harry, HP/fem!Voldemort (TR) AU

**** It used to be on his tumblr, but he has completely removed himself from there.

On the other hand, he has said he is rewriting His Dark Lady, so fingers crossed it will be up in smut and non-smut form.

Scryer has some problems with punctuation in the search keywords which leads to a bunch of false positives. However, since there are only 16 results anyways you should be able to filter through them on your own without any problems.

I guess there simply aren't that many stories with a female Voldemort.
