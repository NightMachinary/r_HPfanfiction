I'm not looking for any fic in particular, just one where Ron, Harry and Hermione travel back to time to the Marauder Era where they meet James, Sirius, Peter and Remus. Thanks!


** I don't think I've come across any that were finished that had the entire trio sent back in time. Usually it's just Harry, Hermione, or both. I'll take a look when I get home and see what I can find, but I'm hoping someone else has some suggestions!
