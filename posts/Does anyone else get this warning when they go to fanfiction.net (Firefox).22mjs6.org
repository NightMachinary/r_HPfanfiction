I just got this message now.

"This Connection is Untrusted

You have asked Firefox to connect securely to [[http://www.fanfiction.net][www.fanfiction.net]], but we can't confirm that your connection is secure.

Normally, when you try to connect securely, sites will present trusted identification to prove that you are going to the right place. However, this site's identity can't be verified.

If you usually connect to this site without problems, this error could mean that someone is trying to impersonate the site, and you shouldn't continue."

This isn't good, it won't let me on the site at all.


** They are using SSL with a self-signed certificate. Or something like that. If you don't sign in, you will be fine.

Unless you think someone's intercepting your internet traffic and you don't want them to know what your favorite slash pairing is.

** Looks like they sorted out their Cert uncertainty somewhat succinctly.
