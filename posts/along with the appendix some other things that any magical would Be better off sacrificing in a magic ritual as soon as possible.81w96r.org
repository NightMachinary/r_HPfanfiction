** Depends how granular you can get, but technically kidney stones, cancerous tumors, blackheads, ingrown hairs, and puss filled cysts are all parts of a person.

** I think that most animals and magical creatures as long as they're not sapient, then, there's clear exceptions like unicorns, dementors, fenix, mostly because of rarity or danger. In context a creature that's ''too magical'' could boost or ruin a magic ritual, then again using parts for potions seem to work just fine as long as you know what you are doing.

*** I was more think of self sacrifice but that works to.

Like a witch who is sick of shaving her legs might permanently sacrifice there leg hair. A person with freckles might sacrifice them, ect

**** Doesn't look like much of a sacrifice if it's something they don't like. I've seen fic where harry sacrifices the marauders map, the cloak, his broom,etc . Or maybe sacrifice a sense, like taste or touch. The whole sacrifice thing is the more you gamble the bigger the effect, I guess that's where the babies and virgin sacrifices come from.

***** They would probably get minor rewards but it would also be a win-win.

Another this they might sacrifice is there wisdom teeth.

******* If you are getting ride of something you may as well get somethings out of it. A bit like when you want to get rid of that exercise bike you never use you could just throw it out but someone else might take the time to sell it and get somethings out of it.

Also with sacrifices I guess it would depend on if it was a physical or emotional sacrifice. You get more for the emotional sacrifices but some rituals probably only need the physical sacrifices.

******** It mostly depends on context and the way magic reacts. If it's a ''mathematical magic'' then it could work as you say, something like FMA equivalence. Then if it's something like ''sentient magic'' using your bike example, it would be like selling the bike to yourself. If it isn't in some way truly important then it's not really a sacrifice, since you would be ''using'' not ''sacrificing''

********* A better way to put it would be following the letter or spirit of the law.

Like say a wizard is blinded in one eye(but there is a chance that one day magic might be able to fix his eye). They could sacrifice the eye and then go on to get a new eye like mad eye moody following the letter of the law or they could follow the spirit of the law were they sacrifice the concept of ever being able to see out of that eye again.

Both are valid sacrifices but one is worth more than the other

***** On one hand you are aspiring sacrifice to a sense of loss. So the baby m/virgin sacrifice should only work if the person values the sacrifice and/or is capable of feeling remorse.

A sociopath wouldn't be able to sacrifice some person/creature to any effect sinc he doesn't value it.

*** This times a hundred. If all you need for a magic spell or whatever is a piece of yourself, you can use whatever. That particular spell would likely work with anything that contains your DNA (which is likely why nails, hair, blood, whatever will work). If the ritual specifies something exacting, it's because folk have seen the results with random shit and saw that it didn't work, so they specify.

** My headcanon requires ritual sacrifices to be equal to what you receive. Thus, if you were using the one thousand dollars worth of steel(about two metric tonnes worth i believe) and used the philosopher's stone to transmute it to gold, you would get one thousand dollars worth of gold or less than an ounce.

So, sacrificing a kidney stone or gallstone or appendix would do nothing as that sacrifice is relatively worthless. A hand or a foot or an eye is worth so much more.
