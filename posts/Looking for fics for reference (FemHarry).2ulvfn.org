I'm currently writing a fic where Harry becomes female, I started this after having a Gender Bender Manga reading spree.

And I'll be trying to focus more in the differences between women and men and how they are treated differently rather than how fast can you hook up him with Draco. (not to say that I wont explore shipping from a gender issues PoV)

So I'm looking for stories where Harry suffers this fate, not ones where he was born female but the ones where he was born male and for some reason ends up becoming a girl and preferably stays that way and in the focus of the stories.

so all your recs are welcome


** Just for the love of Merlin, don't have him turn into a straight girl stereotype as soon as it happens. Seems like in a lot of the fics I've read in this genre as soon as he becomes a girl he's like "welp, I'm a girl now, guess I need to start liking boys and clothes and shopping!"

** I think the best fem!Harry fic available (arguably better than A Long Journey Home, which is fantastic but not really... Harry) is The Never-ending Road by laventadorn. It's Snarry, which is icky, but we're 500k words in and they haven't done anything particularly icky yet so I've let the quality of writing win me over.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6343543/1/Harry-the-Mysterious-Curse-of-the-GirlWhoLived][Harry and the Mysterious Curse of the GirlWhoLived]] has Harry as a boy, but for some reason everything magical sees him as a girl. He ends up just rolling with it. Incomplete, but updating.

I read this and loved it, but it's been a year. He's dead, Jim.

Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.

Not saying this one is good for emulation, but it's a known example.

Being the Master of Death was a curse, plain and simple. That had been death's intention when he 'gifted' his trinkets to the brothers three. The sound of shedding skin crackled loudly in his ear as he got up to look over his new body, he was a girl this time, maybe eight or nine years old. Time travel fic Tom RiddleX Harry potter

Incomplete and slow-moving, but has a very spooky feel and gets in the head of pre-Hogwarts Tom Riddle in an honest fashion.

It's a Fullmetal Alchemist gender bend fanfiction, but I think it does it really well. There are some bits where it's lame, like it's super long and nothing really happens at first.

The rest, although recommended by [[/u/aberrance/]], aren't actually gender-switching (as requested by OP), as far as I can tell.

Part of a trilogy, with the third story currently in progress, VERY GOOD and well written Fem!Harry, and Slytherin!Harry, I thought it was refreshingly different, and it doesn't seem to be often mentioned here.
