I really enjoyed this Remus time-travel story. The author took great care to explore every aspect of their story and characters.

** I was just reading this fantastic story, but it's no longer online. Has someone any idea how I could possibly get to read the last 50 chapters? I'm hooked but it seems like she removed all of her storys...

**** I guess I didn't notice the email for the last two chapters. I just went through my 'fav stories', because I wanted to see when I subscribed to it. Because it's felt like years, and I wondered if it was early on. But the story was nowhere!

So Thank You!

** I am obsessed with this fic. I picked it up a few months ago, so I got to binge the majority of it. It's honestly one of the best explorations of Remus and post-Azkaba Sirius I've ever seen--super nuanced and real and moving---and I enjoyed it so much.

My only complaint is that there was a pacing lag towards the end. It seems that Harry seeing Teddy in his limbo state should have come much closer to the end, and after Voldemort's death and Remus' release it felt like the story should have been over, but of course Remus still had to find out the last kicker.

But it's still so so beautiful and I"m so glad it's finished :)

*** Can you tell me what the last twist was in spoiler text? I stopped reading this fic about 2/3's of the way through, but then at the time it wasn't finished so that was as far as I could go. Now it's been long enough that the story isn't fresh in my mind, but too recent for me to want to reread it all again yet.

**** It's basically that Teddy cannot be reborn as Remus' child. In this time-travel AU, Teddy will cease to exist. I can't remember specifically, but I think Teddy saves Harry somehow and comes to Harry in limbo, telling him that he won't exist anymore. The last few chapters of the story is Remus finding this out and dealing with the ramifications, but it just felt like the pacing of putting this revelation at the end was a little off

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. He's going to need his old friend Sirius to help him with this one. But Sirius has a lot of grieving and catching up to do if he's to be friend, godfather, and cousin in a post-Azkaban world. COMPLETE!

** Don't you know how can I text Iniga? I liked bureaucratic error and want to ask her permission to translate fic into Russian. She closed comments on AO3 and PM on [[https://ff.net/][ff.net]] and I can't find any opportunity to contact with her.
