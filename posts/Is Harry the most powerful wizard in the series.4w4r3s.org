** Short answer: No.

Long Answer: No, he's just a very competent wizard and a quick-witted duelist. Harry and all of the other children in the series grow up to be powerful wizards and witches in the vein of Sirius, James, and Lily: extremely competent, but not exceptional once-in-a-lifetime talents like Dumbledore or Voldemort. None of them, not even Hermione, who everyone /loves/ to tout as being a genius, are even close to those two.

*** Don't say Sirius and the other Marauders weren't geniuses who died before their time (I mean look at the Marauder's Map (I don't think Voldemort could just whip one up on the fly! No, that takes research, dedication etc.)...that thing is a piece of pure genius and it was made by students - not only that: they were all animagi (ok: Not Remus, but he doesn't count))

I agree with your assessment of Harry's generation! They are competent, but not really outstanding not even the "smartest witch of her generation" (stupid name, oh: Don't get me wrong! Hermione is not stupid, but she's no Dumbledore and she certainly is no Voldemort!)! No one of them excels like Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Voldemort and a very few others did!

** In canon, Harry is a bit above average at best. I don't see him becoming any more good at dueling than Snape, McGonagall, or Bellatrix, if he wants to, anyhow.

** No. You see Snape easily beat Harry, and Voldemort and Dumbledore are clearly better than Harry given their duel in OotP.

Out of the students at Hogwarts there is reason to believe he's at least best in his year. Probably better than most of the sixth and seventh years in OotP too. But since Harry decides learning more magic was a bad idea in HBP, he probably never goes beyond the best in his year.

*** Don't know if he actively decides that...I think he's never treated magic like the wounderful thing it should be to anybody not growing up surrounded by it (he treats learning it like a chore when he should be curious and decide to try out things etc.)

He's the best in defense in his year, but not because of power (his signature spell isn't especially advanced for example):

It's experience, being quick on your feet etc. (note: IMHO he's wasting his potential...that's why I asked for fictions were someone tells him that he's pathetic and that his parents would be ashamed a while ago!)

ps: The only time Harry really applies his talent is learning the PATRONUS (because Dementors hinder him playing quidditch!)!

**** In PoA, Harry learns the Patronus, a spell many adults never master. In GoF, he learns magic for the tournament. In OotP, he actively learns Defence magic.

And then we hit HBP where he doesn't learn anything beyond his classes except for the couple spells in the HBP's book. I was being somewhat sarcastic in my 'Harry decides to not learn magic', but he definitely stops working on learning any magic outside of classes.

***** Yeah, magic he should already know or would learn at school - he never progresses past that (like say his father, Sirius and Peter with the animagus transformation!), with the exception of the patronus ("Can't play Quidditch unless I master this charm, so let's do it" - but other than that Harry is a damned slacker and should IMHO have died (sorry, but a hero who doesn't apply himself doesn't deserve to win through Deus Ex Machina))

Yeah, the prince's dark spells - he doesn't really learn them, does he? He uses ONE (!) and only one (Sectum Sempra!)...maybe there was only one (I doubt it, Snape likes his curses too much!)?

Yeah, actively...right - sorry, but: NO!

Harry gets taught and shown by others, it's never his own initiative (he even had to rely on Dobby for the damned Gilly-Weed!)...even the DA was something he was "forced" (by peer-/group-pressure and by Hermione) into and what did he show them? The shield charm? A stunner? A disarming charm? (and a few other minor things...the only thing he really gave them is the believe that they could fight and stand up for themselves aka self-confidence - note: Sure, it helps with the magic, but over all Harry didn't teach half as much as people think he did IMHO!)...the only thing of note is, again (!), the Patronus!

*** There is no evidence in canon for Harry being more powerful than other six or seventh years in OotP. All of Harrys peers (and him) grow up to be powerful witches and wizards. All Harry has is more experience than them.

Though if you would be willing to give your reasons for stating that, I'm all ears.

** Hmm. I'd say that he has superlative willpower. So any spells that could be reduced to pure effort of will without the need to visualize or focus overmuch could be done best by Harry.

Willpower is supported by resisting Voldemort's imperius and beating him in the priori incantatum and assuming that Voldemort has a not insignificant amount of willpower.

Assuming that he can build a repertoire of will-based, emotionally driven spells without requiring too much focus, he could be amongst the most powerful, but it is unlikely that he would become a transfiguration master, or even be the most well-rounded of wizards.

Oh, and he has great reflexes and good combat instincts, which would aid greatly in any duel he might find himself in. Probably not the best at either of these, but it would help.

*** How do you see him as driven? People who are driven work tirelessly at their craft with no need for motivation other than their own desire to succeed. Harry never a shows an initiative to study extra or learn more than is asked of him. Half the time he only does his work because Hermione forces him to.

**** Studious or not, he still managed to get through multiple years of people trying to murder him or slander him or bring ruin upon him. People with less drive to see things through would have quit after their first near-death experience. I'm not saying he's driven in the classical sense, but at very least he put himself towards the goal of defeating Voldemort and didn't let anything stop him from getting there.

** Honestly, the only reason Harry won the war is by luck and the fact, that Rowling wanted a happy end, I suppose. He is at best a bit above average. Since he never really tried to succeed in school, his knowledge and variety of spells is very limited, and he is known to use Expelliarmus or Stupefy in life threatening situations lol. Dumbledore and Voldemort are on a whole new level.

** There are no power levels in Harry Potter magic. No one is more powerful than anyone else. Harry is an above average student with a crazy amount of willpower and he keeps his head under stress.

Other wizards are smarter, they work harder, or they're just more experienced. So no definitely not the most powerful.

** If you had any doubts about it, CC canonized not-super-powerful Harry with terrible finality. Obviously Dumbledore and Voldemort are in a league of their own, but even without considering them, I would say that among his peers, Harry is an above average wizard whose determination elevates him to higher ranks. He's not crap, but he's not amazing either.

** The short answer is no, but I don't think that it's necessarily telling the whole story. Harry lacks skill and experience and that would put him at a serious disadvantage against Dumbledore, Voldemort, Lestrange, Snape, and really any other adult out there. That being said, I think he's probably the most powerful of his generation and in terms of raw magical ability and ahead of quite a few adults as evidenced by the patronus charm his third year. He's also hampered by starting at zero as a muggle raised and losing ground each summer because of how his relatives treat him.

To use an analogy, think of it like being a hitter in baseball. Dumbledore and Voldemort would be great hitters with great power, .325 with 35 home runs. Snape and McGonagall would hit .310 with 15 home runs, not insignificant power but still good hitters. Harry would hit .240 with 30 home runs, his threat comes almost exclusively from raw power, specifically when his emotions are driving him. By the time he's 50 or 60 I don't think it's unreasonable to say he's the greatest wizard of his generation.

*** We can't compare Harry to others with the Patronus charm seeing as we have no other 13 year olds attempt to do it. We know it's hard, but I think with the right motivation anyone could have done it.

the Awesome Patronus of Awesomeness at the end of PoA.

others disagree with me, and they have evidence in canon.. Voldies little rowboat to the Isle of the Awful Potion didn't even register Harry because Albus was with him.

*** I believe it was explained that he didn't register because he was underage. I remember Albus telling him that in Tom's arrogance he wouldn't expect an underage wizard to find and get into the cave. It was explained as more of a loophole in the logic of the protections and less of a Harry not being any sort of a threat.

*** I think the reason that Harry could beat Voldemort in the graveyard was that he (Voldemort) was bat shit insane. Or it could be that Harry had a stronger will. Either way it has nothing to do with how powerful a person is magically.

But no other 13 year old attempted it. The charm isn't about magical power anyways, it's about your ability to summon up a happy memory in the face of depression. So again more about Harrys will power more than magical power.
