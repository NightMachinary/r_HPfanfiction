I'm searching for the best fanfiction that differ quite heavily from the original Harry Potter books. Obviously the events that happen in each year could be the same but I really enjoy different author's take on each year. Really this post is for me to get an idea of what the community thinks are good unique stories that feature different characters and relationships than the original series. To give you some context I'll put in some of the pairings/plot that I tend to read (* is most common/favorite).

Some of the pairings I favor are: Harry/Fleur*, Harry/Angelina, Harry/Susan, and sometimes Harry/Hermione

Some of the plot I favor are: Time Travel/Dimension Travel*, Marvel Crossovers, Evil!Dumbledore/Manipulative!Dumbledore, MOD! Harry, WBWL!Neville/WBWL!Harry's Sibling, and Powerful!Harry


** Linkffn(A Wizard's guide to Banking)

Harry's going to have A LOT of muggleborn classmates.

  The problem: muggleborns face terrible discrimination, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things are only getting worse. The solution: Find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them, even if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way!

** Brothers by SazzyAuzzy on AO3, it's a Harry/Fleur fic, where Harry's younger half-brother Harvey is the BWL, and James and Lily live. It has Mentor!Snape, and is just overall amazing. It's a WIP, but it's being updated regularly - almost every day, really.
