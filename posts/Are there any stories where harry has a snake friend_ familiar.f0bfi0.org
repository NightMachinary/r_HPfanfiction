** I'm trying to remember this one Fanfic with Harry having a snake friend and being raised in an orphanage.It has Harry getting tricked by the Basilisk into making the snake a Horcrux so that he won't lose his friend.It was a Harry/Luna pairing and was super super depressing.

**** That's it.Yeah it's honestly one of the best I've read but god did it hurt reading.It does such a great job making it so you can't help but feel terrible for Harry even though he's done some awful things.Like the fact that Harry makes a Horcrux just to keep his best friend alive who happens to be a common garden snake.He does such an evil act to split his soul just to save his friend.

***** You do not. >! He kills Wormtail. He also doesn't really understand what he's doing, just doing what the basilisk tells him to do to keep his snake alive. Right after this the Basilisk kills Luna. !<

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  To escape the cold night on November 1, 1981, little Harry Potter's accidental magic kicks in, and he manages to turn himself into a snake and slither away before his aunt can find him in the morning. Raised by snakes, he forgets that he is actually a boy...and then one day he accidentally wanders into a place known by humans as the "Forbidden Forest".

  As he slays the Basilisk, Harry is doused in blood and venom... some gets in his eyes. Blind!Harry. Disabled OCs. Very slow-build. No pairings.
