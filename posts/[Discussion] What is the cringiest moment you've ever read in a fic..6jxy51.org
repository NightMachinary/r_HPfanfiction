Link not mandatory, but appreciated.

The cringiest moment I've ever read is a HP/Percy Jacksonverse crossover where Draco calls Hermione a Mudblood, and Nico basically says "Yeah, it may be mud, but that mud is covering diamonds!"


** Literally everything in Hogwarts Exposed (and sequels), but special props for:

- Underage student getting naked and trying to seduce Harry, her DADA teacher

- Harry engaging in naked wrestling with his adopted, underage daughters-- but it's totes innocent because they're all nudists

- Hooch biting off Hermione's nipple and Snape reattaching it by groping her

...That entire fic series is a trainwreck.

**** 50% of the fic is super dull and generic post-canon EWE fic. It's full of unnecessary description of characters' daily routines, uses words it doesn't understand, the works.

The other 50% is BATSHIT CRAZY. With nudist children, Harry and Hermione falling in love, Ron being a werewolf, Ron falling in love with an American woman who had Draco's child, Ginny's non-canonical sister being Snape's dead lover, Ginny and Snape falling in love, and lots and lots of underage children in sexual situations the author clearly kinks on.

****** So, so true. There's a bunch of pretty good oneshots, but anything longer and you're pretty much screwed, especially if don't want to read Fem!Harry. Most Hermione fics involving Luna, Fleur or Ginny are so full of fluff with practically no conflict they get really boring really fast, with Minerva they're usually average at best, with the Black sisters they are either bad, unfinished or the plot went totally nuts (or any combination of the 3), and the other females are extremely rare in femslash.

Still pisses me off how rare femslash is compared to general slash, in most fandoms (aside from Overwatch, Carmilla, The 100 and Once Upon a Time) it's like 10% of the overall content

TBF, a lot of fandoms only have 1-2 female characters who may or may not interact. It's a lot harder to ship them if you're not into crack pairs. The fandoms where femslash takes off are fandoms that have lots of female characters-- with bonus points if they are interesting and flawed and interact in fun ways. Brooklyn Nine-Nine has a pretty decent proportion of femslash, for its size, and so does Wynonna Earp (although that's to be expected, with a canon f/f couple). It's a media problem.

OTOH, ugh, yes. I just want femslash that's as interesting as the slash, where the authors don't act like they have to play it safe and make everything fluffy all the time.

********* In some ways, yes. Speaking generally, femslash tends to be centered around fluff and canon-compliant fic, and unless the fandom has tons of femslash fics, there's not a lot of tropey femslash. It's easy to find m/m arranged marriage fics, or space au, or whatever you're in the mood for. It's a lot harder to find any particular trope for f/f, because the authors tend to play things safe.

Plus, femslash suffers from the “if you squint” problem. In most fandoms, explicit slash is the norm. I've read countless stories (some written for /femslash exchanges/ that feature 2 female characters sitting and talking, with nothing sexual or romantic happening or being discussed. It's friendship fic that the author slapped a f/f tag on.

It's not the fault of any individual fandom or author; it happens because slash is much more prominent than femslash. But still. I want more femslash that's free to be dumb and tropey, or dark and fucked up, or just generally something other than canon-compliant fluff or mislabelled friendship fic.

TL;DR: when I say I'd like femslash to be more like slash, I mean I want more variety in my femslash. Even in my femslash heavy fandoms.

** Don't recall the exact name right now, but Harry goes to an alternate dimension where it's the Girl Who Lived.

Everything is fine for the first couple chapters, then it suddenly drops the bombshell that Ron went crazy when Hermione and Harry got together, raped and killed Hermione, and then killed Harry's child.

There was no flashback to it, and it honestly came entirely out of left field. Harry was just walking or something when the narrative just calmly dumps that onto us.

** It was a Draco SI, which is why I began. The reason i kept with it was for the wtf factor, and I'm not even sure that the author meant for it to be crack, but I've read Crack that's way less out there. Like the grammer was alright and stuff, but the story was crazy bizzar and and first I refused to believe that it was a SI because the protagonist 'Draco' was a massive Alcoholic and Drug consumer.

Spoiler form here on, but don't read it seriously.

And at first it was somewhat clever in that his actions resulted in Voldemort gaining the Stone. So like any rational person he tricked Voldemort into consuming massive quantities of drugs while building a spaceship with Hermiones help behind Voldemorts back. That was rather neat, but then it got fucking weird, like 'my immortal' made sorta sense in comparison, weird.

And the cringiest moment was when he raped a refugee alien from the starwars series, the story became a crossover when they hit space, to death literally. The alien was described as weighing a near ton and having several fat rolls and 6 tits and sorta cow looking. And then he kidnapped the resulting child, let it grow up, and then forced Hermione to rape the alien cow child with a bed post... Which resulted in her becoming fat, "pear shaped 250 pounds" which in the eyes of the protagonist is an improvement over the previous Emma Watson form.

Don't do drugs kids... because I think the author might just have hit the SI bulls eye.

** There was one I read where Ron becomes the Boy Who Lived. His entire family dead he is raised by the Malfoy's I think. Harry is from another world (alternate reality) where he had a harem and they and he arrived together rewriting the minds of the local them. Then in Hogwarts Ron rapes Harry's sisters and uses a ritual to bind them into his slaves with many others. However towards the end the Ron Harry knew in the other world comes over and takes over bad Ron and is forced to live with his evil selfs choices because he can't undo it. It's cringe inducing because the sisters are young lit 12 or so. But the oldest is forced to help Ron rape the other.

Only other one I know that bad was one where Harry had a twin and everyone believed the twin was the BWL. Harry starts dating Hermione and his brother gets angry about it and jealous. Then he finds Slytherins locket and gives it to her and it makes her betray Harry and sleep with his brother nearly driving him to kill himself (Harry).
