** I don't know of one where he's under Order protection, but it sounds interesting. I hope someone knows it so I can read it, too.

  A very AU Severus/Harry mentor fic with Lucius as a friend as well. Petunia dies and the Dursley's flee Privet Drive along with Harry. They end up hiding in an unexpected place when the Hogwarts letter arrives.
