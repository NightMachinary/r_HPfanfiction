We know that Dumbledore tells Sirius to 'reassemble' the Order but what about the time period /before/ Harry came to Grimmauld Place, what was it like learning of Sirius's innocence, the first meeting back, remembering the dead and getting introduced to the new members, etc? We can have an insight into their meetings and how Sirius and Molly's relationship is with each other. Better yet, get a reaction of the Order learning of Sirius's innocence, him meeting Tonks again (which would likely be emotional). Are there any fanfictions which include that?


** A late upvote from me ! I'd really want to read that fic !

  “We've set up Headquarters somewhere undetectable. It's taken a while...” Remus Lupin to Harry in OotP - Here's the story of the rebuilding of the Order, bridging the gap between GoF and OotP from Sirius's point of view - all canon. COMPLETE!

This might fit. Everything is canon up until the start 4th year I think. Harry is sorta taken under Dumbledor's wing and he trains him. Sirius is in charge of the Order more or less, and Albus is still doing his thing for most of it.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
