I read a ridiculous amount of stories. I used to be fairly picky, but now I just really don't care. I need something to read, really just about anything will do. Typically I find my fics by searching through the most favorited fics in the past month, and I find a lot of really good stuff there. I also find a lot of really terrible stuff out there, too. I am now out of stories to read, my backlog has run dry. I want novel-length hidden gems, the stuff off the beaten path. Typically I'm not a fan of slash, but that's just because it generally lacks in quality and, at least to me, isn't very compelling and can get very boring. That isn't to say that I won't read it though, I just don't like the slog to get to the good ones. I also don't ever like fics that feature an older, suave, seductive Draco Malfoy. Other than that I'm game for just about anything as long as it is interesting.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** Linkffn(The Return of the Marauders By TheLastZion)

It's not a perfect story but even with it's flaws, it's one of my favorites. Harry's much more confident, there's a fair amount of banter between the characters and the action/emotional scenes can be pretty intense.
