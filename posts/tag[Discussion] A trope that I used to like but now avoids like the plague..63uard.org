So when I was very new to the Harry Potter fan fiction scene, female Harry fics are my all time favorites!

However as I read a lot more I grew to really dislike the trope because of a certain author. Mind you, the author is very popular. Her/His stories usually have an interesting idea/plot but the way they write Harry made me now avoid the trope. Have you ever had the moment when you are so captivated by a story but you just suddenly stop reading with an eyebrow raised because the story suddenly goes something like this:

"Sure Person A may act like the class queen but that's only because Harriet doesn't give a fuck;Harriet is actually the real queen bee, and sure Person A is scary but she doesn't have the power to terrorize people with only a smile like Harriet, yah Person A is wealthy but her wealth can't be compared to Harriet's immense fortune!" BLAHBLAHBLAH! And it goes on and on, with that being repeated in the next chapters.

Sure promoting your character is nice but repeating it over and over again is just ughhhh!

/Cough/ Enough about that, I'mma list the things that irks me in most female Harry stories I've read.

- Gorgeous emerald "orbs".
- Messy but very soft "ravenette" hair.
- A heavenly beauty with ethereal "elfin" features.
- A voluptuous/lithe body.
- Has a chill/saintly personality but then turns into a fiery spitfire when angered.
- Harriet Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Emrys-Peverell etc etc.
- Part fae/dragon/veela/phoenix/angel etc ect.
- A super politician/strategist/leader etc etc.
- Bajillioner.
- Has a great fashion sense.
- Out of character. And many many more.

Sure there must be great female Harry fan fictions but I don't think I'll be reading them anytime soon because I got so fed up with the things I mentioned. How about you guys? Any tropes that you used to like but now hates?


** How new to the HP fanfiction party are you?

Because, honestly, those things aren't fem!Harry exclusives at all. Just exchange the "petite but busty" with "muscles of steel" and you have /every Lord Potter EVER/. Whomever that author is, they seem to fall into the Mary-Sue/Gary-Stu trap, which is, again, far from exclusive to this genre.

So I agree, the Mary-Sue protagonist is extremely annoying and the main reason I try to avoid /Lord Potter/ fics. I'm actually kind of surprised that you link this so heavily with fem!Harry. Who is that author you mentioned?

**** Erm ... not to be mean to the author but between the random nonsense on their profile page and eleventy bajilion favourited fics I have to say that their profile page is a crimson-coloured flag already. And then I tried to get into some of her fics featuring Harry ... well, grammar-wise there seems to be nothing wrong with them which is pleasantly surprising, but it felt more like a chronological fact-listing with some word dressing rather than an actual story, which generally tends to be a thing (the latter one, not the actually decent grammar thing) for people who write stuff that is so much about wish fulfilment that that it's just boring.

So ... yeah, well, that. I do admit that the whole “turn a character female” thing is a bit niche (in a way) and as such it can be quite hard to find good stories featuring that element, but in this particular case I'll say it most likely is about the author themselves rather than the trope and it's just that you came to associate the trope with their ... well, whatever its level and value is, writing.

**** Mary-Sueing is a trope as old as storytelling. People like to imagine the perfect human that they can dream of being. They just make for shit stories.

I think every author eventually makes a Mary-Sue. Maybe they catch themselves doing it, maybe they leave the character in. Its such a common mistake that I can't really be mad at people, who write for no money, in their free time, for doing it.

** A lot of the problems you've highlighted are - /unfortunately/ - not limited to fem!Harry stories. Fanfiction can be such a /wonderful/ place sometimes.

In terms of a trope I dislike, I'd happily say Manipulative!Dumbledore or Independent!Harry. These two often go hand-in-hand, and aside from the numerous structural issues inherent to so many of the indy!Harry stories (post GOF, Nice Goblins, Gringotts blood tests, the /dreaded/ shopping list/trip, etc.), I've yet to see manipulative!Dumbledore done particularly well.

The issue, as many people have said before on this subreddit is that if Dumbledore really /is/ a villain, then he can't be too competent, as Harry will never be able to outsmart him, save the day, imprison/kill all the Death Eaters and get the girl.

But even so, I feel like so much potential for a manipulative!Dumbledore is totally wasted, and many authors turn him into a moustache-twiddling, lemon-drop-eating cardboard cutout of a villain for Harry to topple in a stroke of uncharacteristic, poorly-thought-out brilliance.

I'd love to see a /really/ competent manipulative!Dumbledore, and some real narrative obstacles for Harry to get past.

*** The problem with competent manipulative dumbledore is that competent manipulative people are usually some kind of sociopath. And because they aren't restrained by shame or guilt, a sociopath can be /ruthless/. Because of his power and resources, a ruthless dumbledore will always have one more step he can take that the protagonist has no way of knowing about or countering that can cripple their best efforts and cast doubt on their own self-worth. Harry does not have remotely the kind of experience needed to deal with an emotional predator like that. Grown-ass adults generally don't have the experience needed for that.

So basically, a competent manipulative dumbledore would win 99% of the time. The only ways I can see him failing are legitimately underestimating the lengths Harry would go to, falling prey to his own pride and humiliation, and obsession. And of course, blind deus ex luck.

I'm sure it can be done, but it would take a better writer than I.

** I've never really had a problem with most of those. Orbs is fine, it doesn't really matter.\\
Ravenette? I would just assume black hair.\\
People can be beautiful, and sometimes people are described as 'elfin', and this is a magical world.\\
Err, whats wrong with describing their body?\\
Do you dislike canon Harry then? He's pretty chill usually but when angered it's usually bad. I don't really like all the names.\\
I've only seen like two of those. One with phoenix blood changing her, and another where the main character was related to the fae.\\
Meh, I'd rather it not, but most fics would just have Harry not really care about money anyway so why not?\\
They can't have a fashion sense? They are living with other girls in the dorm, and someone can have a fashion sense even if they haven't gotten their own clothes.\\
Meh, most stories are out of character otherwise you'd have to spend at least a school year molding them, unless you said that they were hiding it.

** I used to like WBWL or Powerful!Harry fics, I used to think that him being better than everyone, automatically made the fic of better quality, but I soon realised that it's not worth dumbing down magical combat, so Harry can one-hit KO Voldedore with a Piercing Hex.

WBWL was for a different reason. After you sit down and think for a while, you wonder the logistics of a family like Lily and James' having another child after Harry. I mean, the two of them have to uproot their entire lives, were just almost killed by a Dark Lord and survived (defied him thrice remember?), yet they somehow decide that having another kid is a smart idea, despite being very young parents from the get-go. Then there's the "Harry has a twin" situation, which still doesn't automatically mean that the other child won't die, since there is no sacrificial protection and Harry has to survive on power alone.
