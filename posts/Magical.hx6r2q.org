I've read hundreds of fics, and I'm wondering why writers can't seem to make the world seem magical, it just feels like reading action/adventure and whatnot, but I've yet to see a story where I feel how magical the world is.


** Say whatever about plot holes and inconsistencies, but Rowling creates a sense of wonder and amazement like no one else.

And that is the reason why you will probably never see a fic come even close to imitating that.

*** Not a fic, but Diana Wynne Jones has that exact same vibe, if you haven't read her books already. If I remember correctly, Rowling even called her an inspiration when writing the Potter books.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

** Because it's an utter miracle that Rowling managed it despite her... Rowling-ness. It's the one writing thing I give her strong kudos on, and the one thing that the fandom seems to agree on, no matter their position on anything else - her world felt magical to explore.

But well... her world really isn't magical. Like Rowling said once, Magic for her world was a tool and nothing more. Her entire approach just made magic mundane and everyday so it'd fit her whole "British Boarding School Culture" macrocosm. It's not meant to be something you marvel at, it's something you use to achieve a goal like a spanner or a hammer. It's why the magic isn't so much a system as a toolkit. Learning Wingardium Leviosa isn't like poring through tomes and recapturing the wisdom of great sages, but rather like buying a new screwdriver with a really long manual. :D

But yeah. Her world isn't magical, it's just the way she wrote it that made it feel that way. So, you don't see that much in the fanfiction community because first we're not professional writers, and second because there seems to be far more focus on what she wrote than how she wrote it, so we mimic the content and not the style.

*** There's a few fics I've read that have mimicked the style well and it's like a breath of fresh air. I'd love for more fic to pull it off.

**** Really? That is quite surprising. I don't remember any myself. I know it's slight bad form to ask for recs on someone else's post, but do you have any links to hand? I don't mind what tropes, cliches, or pairings they're for - I'm mostly curious about the stylistic elements. :)

No biggie if you don't. Like I said, I'm just curious.

*** That's a bit shitty to be honest, if you're going to create a world of magic, at least explore it in depth, I mean the whole Harry Potter books hardly have any other settings then Hogwarts, Hogsmede, Privet Drive, the Burrow and Grimauld Palace, there is so much more potential there.

**** Yep. But she didn't need to. She had her plot and everything she wrote catered to it beyond all other considerations. Hence why supposedly smart people agreed to the Seven Potters insanity, amongst other things. Exploring the neighbourhoods of magical Peru wouldn't exactly contribute to the plot she was telling, so she didn't bother. That kind of detail would've been the remit of another book series, if she hadn't gotten distracted with whatever the new non-HP one was called and the Grindelwald movies. But even if I understand why she didn't explore it, I agree that it's disappointing.

But hey, that's why we have fanfiction - to build our own sandcastles in Rowling's playground sandpit. :)

Also, Harry was so incurious and oblivious that he never explored anything ever. It took him four years to find out what a Death Eater was and I don't think he knew about floo until second year or apparition 'til third year. And it never occurred to him that other schools might exist (nor did he run across this concept in books) until fourth year either. It's like he asked Dumbledore about the Prophecy in first year, got no answer, then decided to never ever ask about anything ever again. He's a stranger in a strange land with a strange lack of interest in said land, as I usually put it. :)

****** True. I'm not commenting on their quality, as I haven't seen them and thus can't do that, only that she focused on them and didn't write books on anywhere else in the HP World.

Before you say anything, they're on my list, but I'm really behind on movies these days. I still haven't seen a single new Star Wars or Star Trek film and it's been a decade since JJ's first Trek and five years since Force Awakens. I'll get to them before I die, but that's the best I can promise right now. :D

****** I mean, they are the main methods of transportation available to Magical people. It's like going to New York and not knowing what a Taxi is, or to Oxford with no awareness of bicycles, or to Asia and not know what a Rickshaw is. They're central parts of Wizarding Existence to the point there's a Ministry department regulating them and a test everyone in the entire country has to take to do one of them. The idea that his first year books wouldn't at least mention their existence is odd, at best.

**** Indeed, but it is hard to do that if it isn't relevant for the plot. We already see so much about Harry's life and the people around him, adding more worldbuilding to the pile would make scenes feel unnecessarily long.\\
That is what I think, at least.
