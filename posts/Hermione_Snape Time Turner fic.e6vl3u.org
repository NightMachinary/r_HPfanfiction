:END:
Hey, I read a fic about Hermione being sent back to the Maurader's Era RIGHT after the Battle of Hogwarts to save Snape. And I think that they make a potion together? Does this ring any bells for anyone?

I really want to read it again! If anyone knows which fic I'm talking about...


** Is it linkao3(Saving Severus Snape by MegGonagall) ?

Edit: Sorry I fail at reading, I missed your reply to another comment saying it's not SSS. MegGonagall has written a bunch of SS/HG fics, however, and the others may also involve time turners.

*** Nope, it's not that. But I recognize it so I'll keep thinking!

Edit: Could it be [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3677889/chapters/8132811]]

**** It's not Pride of Time, Saving Severus Snape, or Fate Set Right. But it is VERY similar to those.

No. But thank you. Also, I know the fic was on AO3 if that helps?

#+begin_quote
  In the midst of the Battle of Hogwarts Hermione is given the opportunity to help save Snape's life. Little did she know it would require visiting Hogwarts twenty years prior. She has thirty-one days to befriend the sullen Slytherin, and perhaps save his life. But, as always, things don't always go as planned. HG/SS, time-travel, EWE
