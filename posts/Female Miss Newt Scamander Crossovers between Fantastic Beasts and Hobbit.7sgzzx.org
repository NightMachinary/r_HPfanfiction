After losing myself in a Fem Harry trope for a couple of months, I was wondering if anyone here can point me to a story that has a Female Newt Scamander? I have been trying to find one for the past hour, but have no success so far. Is there any story with this idea at all?

Also, I was wondering if there is any crossovers between Fantastic Beasts and the Hobbit. For some reason I just find the idea of a female Newt joining Thorin Oakenshied's company appealing... please, tell me this already exists? I need it soooo badly!


** I'm not sure there's any fem!Newt fics, much less one as a Hobbit crossover.

*** Thanks for replying. Yeah, I thought it would be almost impossible to find both combined. But a girl can dream, right? But I would be VERY happy with any Fem/Newt..
