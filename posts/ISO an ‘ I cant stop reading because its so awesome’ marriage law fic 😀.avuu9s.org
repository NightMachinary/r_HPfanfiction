** The only way a marriage law fic is interesting to me is if the characters fight back. Otherwise it's just a (in my opinion) bad trope to force together two characters that never would get together by choice.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/Escape][Escape]] is interesting because it has a realistic reaction to the law, Horribly unjust law past just to subjugate you? Flee the country. Also I can't see Hermione "free the elfs" Granger being ok with being forcibly married to someone.

  A marriage law has been passed, Hermione has to choose between Snape and Draco. She takes the third option and nopes out of the country with Harry.

The only other fic that I find interesting with a marriage law in it is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]] It explores the fact that these things are still happening in 90s UK not 1790s uk

#+begin_quote
  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

*** If you haven't I highly recommend you look at Rorschach's Blot's Odd Ideas. It's his collection of HP drabbles and several of them deal with either marriage law or contracts, my favorite is called The Marriage Goat.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play

*** In that regard, I'm rather fond of linkffn(The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic by Luan Mao), which has Harry fighting back.

There's at least one more with Harry (and others) fighting back, but I've lost the title - it was written from the point of view of a mercenary that Harry hired because he was too injured beating Riddle to take direct action himself.

** I am surprised no one has brought up linkffn(Contractual Invalidation by R-dude) yet. You can argue its over-rated since its so highly rated already, but as far as marriage law fics go this is one of the best.

#+begin_quote
  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return. Rated M, so once again if you are easily offended, just don't read it.
