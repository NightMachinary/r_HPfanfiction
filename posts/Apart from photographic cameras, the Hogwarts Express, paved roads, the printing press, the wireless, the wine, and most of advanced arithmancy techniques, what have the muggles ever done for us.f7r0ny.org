**** People don't like acknowledging that muggles may actually be necessary for wizard life. They don't like acknowledging that muggles could be influential or possibly even better than wizards at something at all.

Taking the number of people in Harry's year and using it to extrapolate the general wizard population, there's ~4000 wizards in the entirety of Britain. We hear nothing about their agricultural industry, and it's implied that there isn't one by the fact that 'farmer' is never brought up as a job possibility in the only school for wizards in Britain. People seen managing animals are managing them specifically for animal control or magical purposes (like harvesting dragon hide for cloth or just as a hobby in Hagrid's case), and Professor Sprout is never shown teaching how to sustainably grow, manage, and harvest food crops. As far as we know, there isn't even an elective for that, and we've been told before that it's not possible to conjure edible food from thin air.

So this implies that the wizarding world is heavily dependent on muggle agricultural infrastructure. It seems that they're also dependent on muggles for technological advancements (like plumbing, trains, etc.) and infrastructure (since we also don't hear about wizards physically building things like bridges or even houses). Wizards would probably be screwed if muggles disappeared one day.

I did to the math on baby booms and busts and how a civil war could have affected the birth rate, too. The most accessible numbers for a birthrate affected by civil war were from the American Civil War. Using the percentages from that, I did the math and puzzled out that, assuming that the 33 was actually from a baby bust, then the average wizard birth rate is actually around 37-40 babies per year. Even if you wanted to be generous and say that all the original forty were in his year whether or not the book mentioned them, the average non-war birth rate would still be between 45 and 50 babies.

******* This is also implying that every single wizarding child goes to Hogwarts. I believe Draco mentions that his father initially wanted to send him to Durmstrang, which whether he was lying to brag or not suggests that British children don't /have/ to go to Hogwarts. And the big 3: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang, aren't necessarily the only schools in Europe, just the ones involved in the Triwizard. So there could be multiple other options, including home-schooling, private tutoring, smaller schools (or just other British schools in general), and other European schools that they can go to.

I don't know what JKR or Pottermore has to say about this, but since you're only focusing on what's in the books so am I, and the books say that there are schools open to British children other than Hogwarts. Since we have no idea how many there are or what percentage of British students do go to Hogwarts, it's impossible to determine the actual population based on the number of Hogwarts students and post-American Civil War birth rates.

******** It's true that we can't perfectly determine the population based on Hogwarts students and previous civil war baby boom/bust records (especially since with numbers like that, one family blessed with twins or triplets throws the whole year off), but we can get a damn good ballpark. The fact that Hogwarts is the only school that sends a letter to Harry is pretty telling to me, as is the fact that Hogwarts is such a politically significant cornerstone in Wizard Britain. The headmaster rivals the Minister for influence, everyone in the Ministry knows all the teachers by name, all the pureblood families are going there alongside all the muggleborn children... the impression I get from this is that Hogwarts is the only magical school in Britain, and if there are other magical schools, they're set aside for people who specifically opt for them and don't have a lot of prestige. Magical special education, maybe, or schools for squibs. Either way, it seems like all the magical adults we meet from Britain have gone to Hogwarts, which says to me that, if there are magical special education schools, they aren't popular, and neither is sending a British witch or wizard to another country's school.

Let's be generous and say fifteen young witches and wizards get sent to other schools or homeschooled every year. Going with the forty-per-Hogwarts-year, that would bring up our birth rate to fifty-five per year, with 27% of all British witches and wizards getting a non-Hogwarts education, and for various reasons, that population isn't in a position to be in extended contact with Harry so he has no idea these other methods of education in the magical world exists. Personally, I think it's a stretch for nearly a third of the magical population to have gone somewhere other than Hogwarts and for Harry to not have heard about it. I think that it would be more realistic if there were only a handful of wizards every year who did, like two or three, but it would explain what happens to wizards and witches who are born with learning disabilities or special needs that can't be adequately addressed with magic.

Hagrid tells the Dursleys that Harry has had his name written down for Hogwarts since he was born. This suggests that his parents signed him up for Hogwarts before they died, and that's why he only received a letter from them.

#+begin_quote
  as is the fact that Hogwarts is such a politically significant cornerstone in Wizard Britain
#+end_quote

That's more likely due to Dumbledore running it, a political figure who ends up butting heads with the Minister, and it being well known as the best (and assuredly most popular) wizarding school in Britian, so it would seemingly hold education of the future of wizarding Britain.

As for most people we see going to Hogwarts, we only see things from Harry's perspective. His friends' families would have obviously gone there, since if two parents went to the school and think it's the best then they'd want their kids to go there. That can be expanded to entire families sending their kids there over generations. We really don't hear much from other people, though. There are plenty of Ministry workers, and some Order members and Death Eaters, who we don't know about. It's possible they all went to Hogwarts, or maybe only the ones whose families we know go there.

Something I'm surprised you didn't mention is that Hogwarts is responsible for introducing Muggle-borns into their world rather than the Ministry. Although this could possibly be due to Dumbledore's political influence, and so the Ministry allows Hogwarts to handle those cases. Either way I feel like there would have to be other options for families who were weary about sending their kids off to some boarding school in Scotland with these strange people they've never met, and only be able to see their kids on holidays and only communicate with them via mail, not even over the phone. So I would think the private tutoring or a small day school would have to be available for these cases, unless the wizards just manipulates the parents with magic, or obliviates everyone and risks the Muggle-born becoming an Obscurus or something. I'd imagine there are also wizarding families who would choose to see their kids every day over sending them off to boarding school.

But, again, I really don't think we have enough info to go on to really know or even guess accurately as to how big the population. JKR wrote it through Harry's eyes, so that's one limitation to our knowledge, and she never really gave us a true scope as to what the world was like. Hell, if we just go by who's in the Order, who's a Death Eater, and count up the named Aurors, the whole war against Voldemort is like 20-50 people on each side. The HP books really don't seem to give us an accurate representation of the wizarding world at all, or, if it does, there's far less than 1000 people in Wizarding Britain.

********** This is a conflict between British and American culture, I think. British kids have historically (and currently) gone to boarding school much more than American kids. In Britain, it's not as much of a stretch to imagine sending your child away to school for a year as it is in America (and I speak as a former boarding school student).

But even so, I think the argument still stands that given how few people it would take to significantly change the percentage of people who went to Hogwarts vs somewhere else that Harry would meet, I think it's a stretch to think that there are a lot of people using other educational options and Harry didn't hear about any of them in seven years.

I agree that the book doesn't really reflect a large population, which is part of why I feel comfortable with the '~40 babies per year' figure, as ridiculously minuscule as it seems. ~4000 people seems to me like it's enough to cover Hogsmeade, Godric's Hollow, a smattering of wizard households on the countryside, and the wizards who live in London (or at least the ones who commute there for work). It's a struggle to think of what they all actually do, though, and it looks like the main employers in the wizarding world are Diagon Alley, St. Mungo's, and the Ministry. (Maybe that's why Charlie left the country.)

***** Completely ignoring the logical fallacy of "if we don't see wizards do it, then it must be attributable to Muggles": it's simply factually inaccurate that we're not told about wizards growing food.

1. We see Hagrid growing giant pumpkins, indicating that magic is capable of significantly magnifying food production compared to Muggle farming.

2. We know that the Malfoys' wealth comes from the award of land made to them by William the Conqueror, and the way you extract an income from land (especially in the era we're talking of) is farming.

Given wizarding population, and the ability of magic to augment production, one or two wizarding farms are probably enough to feed the whole of wizarding Britain.

****** Hagrid is seen growing giant pumpkins, but how many of those pumpkins are going into the kitchen to be prepared for students and how many are being used either as Halloween decorations, personal use, and/or magical creature chow?

You make a point about the landed gentry thing, but I think it's more accurate to say that the way you extract an income from land is by charging rent. I've worked on farms, and unless you're a massive farming conglomerate with a nationwide distribution network, it's a struggle to turn any kind of profit as a farmer. The landed gentry of Britain were mainly wealthy because people had to pay taxes to them for the privilege of living on (and farming) their land, and once upon a time, those taxes were usually paid in the form of sacks of grain and other foodstuffs farmed from the land.

Modern 'landed gentry' still make money the same way: by making people pay to use their land, usually as homes. It's just that these days, most people aren't depending on their own farms to feed their families, so now those who own land can generate more income because they don't have to worry about leaving enough space for people to farm; they can squish a whole ton of dwellings together and charge the same rent on each dwelling that they would have charged to one acre of land hundreds of years ago. I think that it would make more sense financially for the Malfoys to have become major landlords of the wizarding world (maybe they own a magical town like Godric's Hollow or Hogsmeade) and for the wizard world to outsource food production to muggles.

****** That's what convinces me that wizards are often settling in buildings that were already built a long time ago, probably by muggles. To Harry, the Weasley house was visibly magical, and it was probably literally held together by magic. There aren't any other buildings save for the Ministry and Hogwarts that's described as visibly magical, though--everything else may be modified with magic, but it seems like every other building in London. We see that the Weasleys have put together a building with magic, but for some reason, it doesn't look like any other family did that, and I suspect it's because buildings made by hand rather than magic are less temperamental (Hogwarts keeps switching up stairs and the Burrow has a ghoul in the attic). But construction is a skill, and wizard Britain doesn't seem to have the population and growth to sustain an actual construction industry, so that makes me think that they outsource by just settling into buildings that muggles already built and modifying it to suit their needs.

Magic does not follow physics. They don't need equations to see how physics work as they are above it.

Internet: easy communication (email). Again, wizards don't need fast communication when you can literally pop over to your co-worker, friend, etc and say hi to them in person.

Space Travel: We have no idea if wizards have been to the moon or not.

Satellite Imaging: Invented for military intelligence mostly. Once again useless with apparation.

A society with near instant teleportation would be unrecognizable to our world today. It's actually crazy how similar their society is to Muggles.

***** Whether or not physics could explain magic within the fictional universe is just a matter of interpretation, but if we're going to try to deconstruct and build on JKR's world in interesting ways, it's best to try considering how it fits in real world rules. For the sake of this, let's say that physics /can/ explain magic, even if no one has discovered how yet. This gives the potential for clever people to explain it and harness it in new and interesting ways.

The Internet also allows for more than the equivalent of popping over to your coworker to chat. Look at us now. Two perfect strangers who know nothing about each other's lives who very well could be on opposite ends of the Earth, talking about a fictional world from a book we've both read. The power of the Internet is in its ability to connect strangers, and thus its ability to spread ideas and galvanize movements for better or for worse. Wizards have no equivalent for this. The best they have are letters you could write to magazines or newspapers, and those are vetted and controlled by said magazines and newspapers.

As for space travel, if wizards had been to the moon, I'm pretty sure we would have heard something about it, especially when Harry stumbled through the Department of Mysteries and ran roughshod over all their cutting edge advancements in research. We see them studying the placement of the planets and stars, but nothing to imply that they're thinking of actually putting someone there, much less have already done it.

As for satellite imaging, are you kidding? In this day and age, most of us have the fruits of satellite imaging in our pockets, ready to be consulted when we get lost on our way to our mother in law's house. Satellite imaging allows for GPS, and it allows someone on the opposite end of the world to see what this one store in Lagos looks like. Apparation doesn't even begin to allow that, and as for transportation, it's said repeatedly that you need to know what a place looks like in order to Apparate there and it is risky to the point of stupid to try apparating too far in one leg.

In the 90s when Muggles were building the internet, there was never a need in the wizarding world because everyone could just meet up at a specific location and talk in person. I'm certain the internet would have never developed if we had that ability. It is the same with phones. Why develop the telephone when you could Floo chat and see the person with whom you are talking.

If diaries and maps can write back to you, I'm sure devices similar to text messaging were common place. It was just Harry didn't need them as all his friends were in the same school as him.

Wizards could have gone to the moon ages ago, found it a lifeless husk and left it at that. They could be far beyond what we are with placement of the moon and stars than we are now. We have no idea. Moreso, perhaps it wasn't British wizards who went to the moon?

While apparation can only take you places you have been before. Floo travel and Portkeys can take you farther. International portkeys are a thing, and again... far better than airplanes or trains. Again, Satellite imaging would be never even thought of because there would be little use for its basic purposes. It would never be invented. Instead you would have systems such as HP underage magic.

******* They did take decades to develop and commercialize, but that goes to my original point: muggle capabilities expand exponentially while wizard capabilities remain mostly static. The biggest innovations we hear about in wizard culture are +not shitting themselves anymore when muggles have already invented plumbing forever ago+ the creative use of radios to send coded messages during the war. An important innovation that could lead to wider cultural implications if people pick it up more after the war, but one that's almost a hundred years out of step with muggles and dependent on an invention muggles already created. We don't see a lot of similar innovation--it seems like most major facets of wizard life were invented a few hundred to even a few thousand years ago and didn't change much since then.

Muggles meanwhile have been inventing new things constantly and gradually getting closer and closer to the quality of life that wizards had from the get go. If I were in the Minister's shoes, I would consider this a cause for concern, because wizarding society is dependent on their ability to circumvent muggle society, and that becomes harder and harder the more powerful muggles become. But the Ministers we see generally dismiss muggles entirely, ranging from paternalism to contempt, and none of them seem to actually consider that maybe muggles could ever outpace wizard capabilities and pose a real threat to wizard society. The fact that they are so assured of this that they won't even learn about something like electricity opens up an opportunity for muggles to grow beyond wizarding capabilities unfettered and eventually take them down should they be discovered and war declared.

It seems that most of the recent inventions we hear about are usually relatively minor, like inventing new ways that dragon hide can be used or discovering a new potion that's good for niche uses. The big things, like portkeys and wands and apparition, seems to either be confirmed thousands of years old or treated as so everyday by ghosts and paintings that it's likely they were around when the ghosts and paintings were made.

As for commentary on wizard society... wizard society is literally built on slavery, and it's implied that it veers dangerously close to apartheid. The wizard economy is based almost entirely on goblins, who are legally discriminated against and we do hear about legislation considered in the Ministry (and possibly legislation that had previously been passed) that specifically targeted people who were 'halfbreeds' and effectively criminalized interspecies relationships. The absence of pure goblins in any space besides the banks implies that there's probably job discrimination against them as well that's widespread enough that it might be legally enforced, and it's illegal to give them a wand and teach them how to use it, effectively disabling them against wizards. And this is to say nothing of house elves and how Britains biggest (and probably only) educational institution is dependent on their labor, or the ways that other intelligent and feeling creatures are legally pigeonholed into certain jobs convenient for wizards. Don't try to paint wizard society as any more moral or stable than regular ol' Britain.

As for muggles vs. wizards... there are ways to defeat forces that have more firepower and skills than you. History is littered with them. It usually just takes a lot of cleverness, and I can think of a few different scenarios where muggles could take advantage of wizarding society's weak points to take their magical capabilities out of the game.

*** That's /highly/ debatable. First we would have to assume magical protections couldn't protect against nukes. Secondly, even if they couldn't, plenty of wizards live outside of London.

Really, the existence of nukes would be an argument against muggles. "They're literally wiping out entire cities, the barbarians!"

--------------

Edit: Since someone will probably argue nukes can get past magical protections, let me make my argument first:

First, it's magic. It bypasses all logic and science. Protecting against nukes would not be the craziest thing we see magic do.

Secondly, even if we want to look at magic from a "scientific" view, the energy of nukes is /nothing/ compared to the energy we see wizards use. Creating matter is no easy thing, and wizards do it with absurd ease.

Scientists have concluded that creating even one glass of water would need the energy of the equivalent of 250 nuclear bombs (the ones we dropped on Japan, I believe). If I wasn't on my phone, I'd gather sources for this. But look it up, creating matter is immensely difficult.

And yet wizards casually create huge amounts of water. So, energy wise, wizards make nukes look like TV remote batteries.

So either way you look at it, blocking nukes is completely reasonable.

Ok, first, why would they need to know it? Kids don't know the anatomy of all the living creatures they create. Wizards don't understand the human mind but they still use memory charms.

Well, we do have switching spells, but there's no reason to believe Aguamenti is one of them. Secondly, we see them conjure or trsnsfigure other matter too. There's zero evidence that all these trsnsfigured animals are just disappearing from somewhere.

The implications of your argument here, if true, would be /huuuge/ in the wizarding world. Why haven't we ever seen anything disappear if everything conjured or trsnsfigured is just being switched places from somewhere else?

Thirdly, magic does not care for science. It doesn't function by science logic. So why would it combine existing oxygen and hydrogen molecules?

Why would it even need to? The magic we see in canon is shown to be immensely more complex and incredible (Fidelius, fiendfyre, curse on the Dada position, the taboo, Horcruxes, time turners, acrruate models of the entire galaxy, etc).

I mean, just look at the human mind. We understand nukes. We created them. We do not understand the human mind. Yet wizards casually manipulate it. Wizards can literally manipulate time and fate itself.

But for some reason blocking nukes is too far? We can disagree on this of course! But there are so many things wizards can do that we can't, and we /can/ protect against nukes.

********* If you look at the passage in question, it was never just 'food'- it was specifically "good food". The trio were had edible things, they were not in danger of starving, but it all tasted like crap, because none of them had any real skill (magical or mundane) at food prep and cooking. Ron's complaint was that he wanted his mum's cooking because it tasted great, not that he was hungry. And Hermione's response was "well, if my cooking's rubbish, /you do it then/".

So I'm of the belief that you can conjure/transfigure raw food stuff- ie. a thing that theoretically edible, but you cannot directly magically create a finished meal. ie. you can create a pig, but you cannot instantly create bacon.

This generally fits in with some other possible exemptions- finished products, of a sorts. Things like books and the like. You could conjure paper, and form it into a book. You could use magic to do the physical act of writing for you. You could use magic to duplicate the finished book. But the actual ah, creation, or art, the knowledge or story or whatever you're trying to impart, has to be done by you, not summoned from the aether. Or things like potions ingredients, or cooking ingredients, are prepared by, well not by hand necessarily, but the act of chopping is done to them for example. Like, you have to chop carrots, you can't transfigure a carrot directly into a chopped carrot, though the knife could be enchanted to do so automatically or you could use a cutting spell.

That said, we do see people transfigure or conjure other finished products- furniture, teapots, clothes I believe. An expertly carved chair is for sure a work of art, so 'having some element of craft or work' can't be the totality of the exception.

There's something intrinsically different about something that was conjured and something that wasn't, but whatever that 'thing' is, it doesn't affect the quality of things like chairs or teapots or what have you. But it does affect the quality of food.

It makes sense if you think about it. Food and how it's absorbed into the body is very complicated. Some proteins do this and some do that or some do this other thing but only when paired with this other naturally occurring compound. One altered bond between molecules and artificial sugar flows through the body without being absorbed at all. So maybe you can conjure food after all, but the body just can't absorb it like natural food, so you're basically starving and malnourished even when you're consuming nonstop food. This might expand to trying to cook bacon from a conjured pig, which would explain why the Weasleys have a garden instead of just conjuring vegetables.

It's magic. It doesn't matter how complicated the act of digestion is. Magic works on a conceptual level, not a physical. They can turn a desk into a living pig. Does McGonagall know every little detail of the biology of a pig? No, of course not. But it doesn't matter. It's still 100% an actual pig. Magic can make things self-animate or even sentient, transform or create molecules/atoms, things that are incredibly difficult or energy intensive or impossible by conventional physics. It works on abstract concepts like love, secrets, and promises, which are not even things as far as mundane science is concerned.

The context of the conversation about conjuring food was completely about "we are not cooks, and our food tastes bad", NOT "we are in danger of starving, we need nutrition". So it makes far, far more sense to me, that the exception is "can't magically create cooked/prepared meals".

Now, you do raise a point about things like fruits and vegetables that can be eaten raw. It would've helped all the students hiding in the Room of Requirement, instead of having to get supplies from Aberforth. One option is that such things do run afoul of the exceptions- ie. you can't conjure an apple, but you could transfigure an apple tree. Alternatively, conjuration and transfiguration is difficult (conjuration is 7th year NEWT level). So honestly just having a garden might be easier in the long run. For someone like Molly, she's probably a better gardener and cook than she is at transfiguration, so it'd yield better tasting results too.

I'd imagine there are very few professional nutritionists who know exactly how nutrients work, what they're made of, etc by heart without needing to reference anything and, if they had magic, could then take all of that knowledge and successfully making an anatomically correct animal complete with nutrients. Just the nutrients would be bad enough id think. And why would a person try very hard to get past that limitation when there are so many easier, more effective options.

**** The issue with a nuke isn't the initial blast. The initial blast is bad enough. The issue with a nuke is the radiation. There is a reason why nuclear war would be the end of the world, and it's not because people think that every country in the world would be hit directly.

Think of Chernobyl. Think of how over thirty years after the disaster, it's still considered uninhabitable. Now think of a bomb designed to create that effect across a country.

The radiation would first hit everything--organic and inorganic--well beyond the blast radius. Billions upon billions of particles hitting you so hard and fast that it literally knocks electrons out of your molecules, destroying your DNA irreparably. Your DNA will struggle to keep doing its job to replicate and keep you going, and if you're lucky, it'll fail quickly and you won't have to go through the excruciating process of dying slowly and painfully. The radiation will linger in the cement, in the buildings, in the trees, so that anyone who handles them will also start getting sick. The radiation will poison the ground, and for decades afterwards every crop it produces will be full of poison, irradiating the jaws and stomachs and colons of every human and animal that consumes it, no matter how far it travels from the blast. Animals will die from radiation, and those that don't will die from starvation.

And even worse, the cherry on top, is that nuclear winter will begin. The soot caused by the blast will be ejected into the atmosphere, covering the sky in a black blanket and chilling the temperatures. The sky will hold the radiation, bringing it back down to the ground across the entirety of Europe in the form of rain and snow that poisons the ground and people there as well. Britain will have a winter that lasts for years, choking off even their poisoned crops, and after the winter is finally over and perhaps some people managed to survive, nuclear summer will begin.

The radiation and soot has destroyed the ozone layer. There is little to nothing protecting the world from UV rays. It becomes dangerous to go outside during the daytime because the sun burns so fast and hot and skin cancer is now on the rise. Temperatures increase, the glaciers melt, and the oceans rise. Most land is cracked from the heat or underwater, and there is little airable land left.

So no. It doesn't matter if Hogwarts gets over its sense of superiority and can wiggle its fingers and survive the initial blast. If the blast doesn't get wizards, and even if they magically cure all cancers, the starvation will still get them, along with a large chunk of the muggle population (though muggles have stronger protections against the effects of nuclear winter due to their food infrastructure (plus greater knowledge of nuclear holocaust) and thus would probably outlast wizards, there would still be mass death). If muggles really saw the need to nuke wizards, it would be all over.

**** Can't defend against something if you don't know it exists. Americans kept Manhattan Project extremely secret, it would be obvious that Germany in alternative universe would do the same. And even if they knew it existed, there's another problem to consider:

During the Blitz, Germany used mostly He-111 which usually carried 8x SC-250 or 32x SC-50, or one SC-2000 and one SC-500. The biggest one, SC-2000, has around *900 kg of TNT* equivalent. Now, the Little Boy, weakest of the two, was 15kt TNT equivalent, not counting the flash and radiation, that's 16 times more than the biggest baddest bomb Germans dropped on London. So any ward that would straight up block the blast is out, because they were designed to withstand 900kg TNT, maybe double that, but not *15 times* more.

And... all that I said is useless because most likely wizards won't defend against bombs by blocking the blast and shrapnel, instead they would probably just redirect the bomb somewhere else, which won't work on Little Boy kind of bomb because it was air bursted at 1900-ish m, aka quite far from the ground.

** I hate this assumption.

First off, our introduction to the wizarding world is through the eyes of a child in one specific area of the Wizarding World: Hogwarts. We know almost nothing about the magical society and how it functions.

Secondly, in a world with instant teleportation, society would be vastly different than what we have today.

Why would wizards need paved roads? They teleport.

Printing Press: We know there are copying quills in HP (during OOTP and cheating methods). You have a couple hundred of these and your papers are copied in a few hours with no effort.

Arithmancy: Why do wizards need advanced techniques. Magic does not follow physics.

Photography: We have no idea who invented it first. Moreso, Photography in the wizarding world is more like a short video.

Wine: uh... Wine has been around for over 8,000 years. Not the best example. Especially as you have elf-wine in canon.

Food: They could probably grow food in a fraction of the time (look how big Hagrid's pumpkins got in a few weeks). We literally have no idea as it's never mentioned.

All in all, it is amazing that wizard culture is as similar to muggle culture as it is. If George RR Martin had done the world building, wizard culture would be more akin to entering an alien world than ours. Whole values of society would be different; our fears, goals and everything that matters in society...

Arithmancy is a study of magic, and we're never shown if any Muggle mathematics even come into play. Hell, we don't even know if, in the Potterverse, mathematics are a purely Muggle concept or if wizards had a hand in creating them before the two societies separated.

I think Colin mentions that the film has to be developed into a certain potion before the pictures will move, although perhaps that's just for Muggle film and actual wizard film is different.

For food, Herbology is an entire core subject at Hogwarts, and, as you said, we see Hagrid having a garden, and the Weasleys are said to have a garden but the description is vague enough to either be an actual garden (but not well kept) or a "garden" of wild-growing vegetation. We do only see them shop for school supplies and not groceries. Is there even a grocer in Diagon Alley?

Now sure, Herbology is about magical plants, but if they're learning how to grow and harvest those then normal plants would be no problem. It's the same basic skill set, but the magical and dangerous plants require more care and caution. So I don't see any reason why most families wouldn't have their own gardens and grow most of their own food. Especially with magic being able to make it grow faster, duplicate it, and probably protect it from pests and keep it ripe. Families like the Weasleys would probably tend to their garden themselves, while families like the Malfoys would have their House Elf(ves) take care of it.

*** I like reading printed/typed text more than handwriting. And an enchanted press is probably easier to run than to cast thousands of duplication charms a day for a newspaper. Plus a press produces consistent quality while duplicated books might have mistakes if the duplicator got sloppy with the wand movement. I don't want to cast hundreds of duplication charms a day only to then have to proof-read every book I made for errors. With a printing press it's enough to proof-read one copy and you can be pretty sure the others are the same.

**** You dont need to cast hundreds of duplication charms, a single one is enough to create hundreds of duplicates as we see in the lestrange vault in Deathly Hallows.

***** Aren't duplicates made by geminio are far less durable than the original? Would be kinda shitty business practice to sell books/newspapers that rot away in few years.

****** The only source for that is from a video game, and Hermione thought that the duplicated Locket would fool Umbridge who is a skilled witch, so I doubt it.

***** Flying is something WAY easier when you can break the laws of physics. A printing press is a quite simple mechanical thing, probably a little easier to build with magic but not that much more than without. Given that there's way more creative muggles than creative wizards (population sizes) it's likely muggles came up with it first. And it's a way bigger game-changer when you don't have magic.
