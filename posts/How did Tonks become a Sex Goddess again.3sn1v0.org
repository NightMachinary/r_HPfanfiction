I mean Tonks is a kinda cool character in a goofy kinda way. I just can't wrap my head around the fact that the fandom seemed to elevate her to this paragon of hotness only rivaled by Fleur. Was this ever implied in the books? Has Harry even commented on her physical attractiveness? This has left me really scratching my head.

***** Did we watch or read the same series? The underdeveloped nature of Ginny's character is, in my opinion, one of the worst flaws of the Harry Potter universe.

Book 1 - She exists.

Book 2 - Childhood crush. Next appearance is the end of the year during which she is possessed and saved. No further interaction.

Book 3 - Who is Ginny again?

Book 4 - Who is Ginny again?

Book 5 - Who is Ginny again?

Book 6 - Well I suppose hooking up with my best friends sister is a good side hobby to go with the pressure of saving the world. She supports me about an edited textbook.

Book 7 - Pining over short term girlfriend to distract from shit luck and living conditions. No interaction until successfully killing self is completed. 19 years later, married with 3 kids.

Maybe I wouldn't prefer Harry/Hermione if Ginny had a couple paragraphs of personality development.

But you're right about Ginny appearing in OOtP. She's at the final showdown, which I think goes unnoticed sometimes.

****** She starts off with a fangirl crush on Harry, vents to Diary!Riddle, gets possessed. Her vulnerability and affection for Harry were exploited. She becomes more outgoing, a good Quidditch player, dates, is talented and combative (Bat-Bogey hex). Goes with Neville to the Yule Ball even though she could have later went w/ Harry. Cares about Luna, an outcast. Book 6 Harry's chest monster wants to fuck her, they get together, you know the rest.

Not directed at you, but I've always wondered why people at say, DLP, loathe Ginny. She's hot, skilled and fierce. Every shallow thing people look for to pair someone with Harry.

******* Your point about her vulnerability and affection for Harry is a bit misleading. She was already being possessed thanks to the natural vulnerability of an 11 year old girl, her crush on Harry was just a topic that she naturally talked about.

I don't see how she could have gone with Harry to the ball, that was never brought up. If I recall correctly it was Cho -> Parvati.

I agree with your conclusions about her personality type but I feel it's a shame that most of that comes from how well Bonnie Wright managed to portray Ginny with how little material she had to work with. It feels like both she and Harry were just paired off for the sake of closing the matter.

Mhm that's what I meant, I was more listing what she wrote. Riddle fed on her 'soul', so, her feelings and I imagine her crush on Harry was a not insignificant part of that.

And:

#+begin_quote
  “Right,” said Ron, who looked extremely put out, “this is getting stupid. Ginny, you can go with Harry, and I'll just ---”

  “I can't,” said Ginny, and she went scarlet too. “I'm going with --- with Neville. He asked me when Hermione said no, and I thought ... well ... I'm not going to be able to go otherwise, I'm not in fourth year.” She looked extremely miserable. “I think I'll go and have dinner,” she said, and she got up and walked off to the portrait hole, her head bowed.
#+end_quote

And I disagree. I think movie!Ginny had less fire than book!Ginny. She awkwardly tied his shoe laces. And I don't see how it's unrealistic, he was attracted to her, she has a cool personality, she was attracted to him, they got together.

The Ginny you're talking about? I have no idea. Because the Ginny Weasley I remember from the books was mentioned in OoTP 230 times (compared to Tonks's 102 times, Luna's 155 and Neville's 275), and if that doesn't give you any of Ginny's character quirks and leads you to ask 'Who is Ginny again?', the blame definitely lies in you and not the books.

I could go on about this, but I have a lot of work to do and I get the feeling that arguing with you would be as useful as shouting at the wall.

********* Your post attempted to force a conclusion regarding the number of mentions a character receives and the ease in which their 'quirks' come to the fore. To that end you drew a comparison with Ginny against background characters who only contribute to the plot in infrequent (but occasionally significant) ways. Tonks doesn't even attend Hogwarts anymore, making that an unfair contrast. Luna is in Ravenclaw. Another dodgy example. Neville is the only other Gryffindor - and hence someone more likely to be interacted with on a regular basis by the three main characters - and he has a higher mention count.

My post pointed out that character mentions don't merit much consideration, given that H/G happens despite there being more instances of Stupefy than Ginny's name. [Hyperbole but you get the point.]

I hope you aren't taking this too seriously. This is a friendly subreddit. Both [[/u/DZCreeper]] and I believe that compared to the rest of the characters in the series, Ginny's personality traits are given insufficient exposition. You're welcome to feel differently, but please don't resort to childish antics. Reddit would be a really boring place if everyone agreed about everything.

....yes, and? In most instances, the more interactions a character has with the main characters, the more we know about them and the more quirks it adds to their characters. Neville got more mentions in OoTP than Ginny or Luna or Tonks, and indeed got more added to his character than any of them. I don't see the issue here, and in no way does it does it invalidate this:

#+end_quote

Number of mentions might not be a perfect way to measure the personality of a character, but it is by far the most objective method that gives any handle on the matter. It also invalidates obviously false statements, like Tonks having more of a character than Ginny, or Ginny barely being present in OoTP, which were statements made by others that I was aiming to refute.

#+begin_quote

An obvious case of apples and oranges. Do I really have to point this out?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That depends on what you mean by 'rest of the characters'. Compared to the main cast of the Trio or Dumbledore or Snape or Sirius? Sure, and that's the way it should be. Given that Ginny isn't a main character, and is more comparable in her role in the series to other secondary characters like Luna or the Twins, I can comfortably say her characterization is fine. The number of mentions of the characters seems to support me here.

Okay, but I've never argued for the former and made my views on the latter known [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3sn1v0/how_did_tonks_become_a_sex_goddess_again/cx0fdn1][here]]. I know you're not trying to strawman me, so I'll just say again that in contrast to DZCreeper's original post I understand that Ginny played *a* role in OOtP. I think where we differ (and are unlikely to find any common ground) is in the subjective scale of that role. I don't find it as noteworthy as you do, but we can just agree to disagree on that point.

#+begin_quote
  Number of mentions [...] is by far the most objective method
#+end_quote

Eh, it still feels like an attempt to quantify a character. I understand what you're saying, though (and correct me if I'm wrong): the more often a character is mentioned, the more likely it is that we as readers will gain insights into their motivations and values system. It's a persuasive argument, I don't think you can throw out the qualitative aspect. Ginny's mentions don't do enough to demonstrate her own unique character, which I'll admit is purely subjective.

#+begin_quote
  That depends on what you mean by 'rest of the characters'.
#+end_quote

A good point. I should have qualified my meaning to say that I don't believe Ginny's personality traits do enough to explain how other characters in the series react to her.

** Honestly, probably a combination of two things: first, Tonks is likable. Secondly, she's a shape-shifter.

People get all fetish-fueled up by the shape-shifting thing, and then the fact that she's friendly and likable just makes it easier for them to go "oh, we can hook Harry up with her" or whatever.

** She's funny. She's capable. She's young enough to have dated a couple of the Weasley brothers. Her mother and Aunts are known for their beauty. She seems very non-deceitful despite her particular superpower and occupation. Even Molly considers her likely to jump out of her attempted relationship with Remus to hopefully bounce Fleur out of range of Bill's attention span. She's a very physical, interactive and warm person.

Then there's the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential][Power Perversion Potential]].

Simply put, she's the Hufflepuff with the sexy stuff and it seems more likely she'd ignore age differences given her fascination with older men and flirting with Harry. Sin-minded people might even see her interactions with Ginny and Hermione at Grimmauld Place to be flirtatious as well.
