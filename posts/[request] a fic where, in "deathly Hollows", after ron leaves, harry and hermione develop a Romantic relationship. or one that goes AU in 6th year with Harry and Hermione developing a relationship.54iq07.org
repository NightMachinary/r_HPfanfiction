** Thank you for giving the exact specifications where I find H/Hr believable. It's actually harder to believe that neither of them would have developed any kind of feelings during these times.

*** Yeah, I don't much care for the whole Harry/Hermione, Harry/Ginny or Hermione/Ron ships but I can see these moments as having the potential for Harry and Hermione to develop something. It's unrealistic to think that during the horcrux hunt something wouldn't happen between two emotionally charged young adults suffering from abandonment.

**** Are we allowed to review things a bit here? I couldn't make it through the first chapter of this one. Harry has the rather excellent impulse to go try and make Hermione feel better after Ron leaves. Sadly, this takes the form of him calling Hermione "both cute and beautiful, and yes there is a difference," which leads to Hermione agreeing to be his girlfriend by the end of the chapter.
