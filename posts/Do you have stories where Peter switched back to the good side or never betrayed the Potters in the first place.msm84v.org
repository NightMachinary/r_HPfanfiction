If read one where he is visiting the Potters with Sirius and comes clean after Sirius explained to Harry what his necklace meant.

Does anyone know what the name is?


** That was the one where Sirius used some spell to take away Voldemort's magic and where Dumbledore was bashed and knew about Peter being a spy right? I didn't save it because of the bashing and the incredibly convenient spell Sirius had, but I'll try looking for it to see if it's in my history somewhere

** In mine Peter has to choose between saving Sirius' wife or her daughter and he lets his friend die to hide the girl. Though he can't save the potters when the girl is eleven she finds Peter as Scabbers and they talk and come to an agreement that he'll work with her to bring down Voldy.

** There used to be an old fic (Web Archive seems to have two chapters out of 20+) where he had the location tortured out of him, and then some Death Eater took a prototype Polyjuice to impersonate him... the potion turned out to be permanent duration. Then, during the fic, the real Peter escapes just as the good guys catch the impersonator.

** I read one where Peter betrayed the potters, but then broke down and fought off Voldemort, dying in the process but I don't remember what it was called. I'll look for it though.

** Peter betrays the Potters by a series of unfortunate choices, and then tries to redeem himself by taking care of Harry afterwards.(Then he and Harry die in a car crash and Peter takes over Harry's body, going through canon events as Peter in Harry's body.)

  Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.

  Joining the Order was easy, a chance to die for their beliefs. It was much harder to live with his own choices, each worse than the next, until all he had left was to face the person he had become.This is the story of a man who survived, like a cockroach. This is the story of a man who did the wrong things for the right reasons, a man who betrayed everything he was and is now trying to make things right. A Peter reincarnated as Harry redemption fic you didn't even know you wanted. No character bashing---Peter's character is very relatable. Falling down the slippery slope of your own decision-making is so much more human than rat.AN: No Horcruxes AU. The pairings are tagged, so slash-haters are forewarned of some fleeting teenage crushes, but there won't be any underage relationships. Betad by Eider Down.
