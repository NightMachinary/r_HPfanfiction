In his second year of school, Draco Malfoy is staying at Hogwarts for Christmas. Is there any explanation as to why this is so?

I'm currently writing a fanfiction and I'm just now in second year at Christmas. Because Harry is a Slytherin he would know more about Draco even if they aren't friends in my fanfic.

Now I'm trying to find an explanation for it, but I can't find anything about it in canon that explains this. On the contrary: in the first book, Draco makes fun of Harry because he is not wanted at home. And in second year he stays there himself? That doesn't make any sense. Does anyone have a canon explanation or at least an idea why he would do that?


** Perhaps Lucius (& Narcissa) take a vacation together or reconnect with business partners where Draco would be in the way

Lucius wants Draco to be in school to a) connect with Harry Potter bc it would still be a political advantage at that time (or to connect with other ppl) or b) wants him to report if something has happened to the Weasleys bc of the diary or chamber, though seeing as he didn't know what the diary was I doubt that's the case

Draco might have wanted to stay at Hogwarts to prove his "independence" or to be like "Potter" I mean he was canonically obsessed with him

Perhaps it was a tradition to at least once stay at Hogwarts to observe whatever happenings in the school or bc "it builds character" or whatever

*** Draco doesn't need to be aware of the diary to be a good source of information on the diary's progress; I'm sure he wrote about the "Enemies of the heir beware" thing. Lucius would probably tell Draco something different like the business partner trip or something though.

****** Dobby also knew that Lucius's plot of making "most terrible things happen at Hogwarts" involved a young Voldemort. We know this from these two conversations of Harry and Dobby.

Their first conversation:

#+begin_quote
  “All right!” cried Harry, grabbing the elf's arm to stop him. “You can't tell me. I understand. But why are you warning me?” A sudden, unpleasant thought struck him. “Hang on --- this hasn't got anything to do with Vol --- sorry --- with You-Know-Who, has it? You could just shake or nod,” he added hastily as Dobby's head tilted worryingly close to the wall again.

  Slowly, Dobby shook his head.

  “Not --- not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir --- ”

  But Dobby's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a hint.
#+end_quote

And from the end of the book:

#+begin_quote
  “I've just got one question, Dobby,” said Harry as Dobby pulled on Harry's sock with shaking hands. “You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well --- ”

  “It was a clue, sir,” said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this was obvious. “Was giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he changed his name, could be freely named, you see?”
#+end_quote

It is unlikely that Dobby would have known more than Lucius did, therefore Lucius had to have known that the diary had something to do with young Voldemort.

Most likely this was just one of those things JKR did not think through very well.

Those are incredibly vague statements, that would also apply to... idk Sauron? So they don't really scream Horcrux to me. They probably apply to all kinds of undead from speculative Fiction (Fantasy and SciFi alike)

Just so we understand each other, obviously JKR planned, from the beginning, some kind of method/technique that ensured Voldemort's survival. I just don't believe she had a very concrete plan about that and shoehorned the Horcruxes onto it later on ("Hey, that weird book could've been one of those1!!")

I largely agree with this. Especially because the diary is called the whole time a "memory" not a part of his soul.

I believe that she had even thought about using the diary as one of this means because it is stated in the second book that he could have come back thanks to this, but the concrete idea of horcruxes/soul parts came later.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I read that much of the Prince Half-Blood storyline was originally from the second book, which would explain the focus on the hocruxes and Voldemort's past.\\
On the other hand, the idea of "there are seven hocruxes and we have to destroy them all" may have been an afterthought.

I am not saying that the author is perfect and of course she may have invented some things, but it would be interesting to see more examples of this (perhaps deathy hollows).

** I wondered the same while writing my own story, and I came up with an explanation but forgot to mention it in the appropriate point. Here it is: the Malfoys traditionally host the prestigious Yule Ball of the pure-blood high society, and in this ball dancing is a mandatory part even for children. In his second year Draco was old enough to rebel against his parents and young enough to consider girls icky. His solution was to stay at Hogwarts to avoid having to dance. Lucius and Narcissa thought that it was better for Draco to be away from the ball than to be there and possibly ruin the Malfoys' perfect image in the eyes of the high society by sulking.

The real explanation is, of course, that JKR needed Draco to be at Hogwarts. That's all.

*** I've decided now that I will use Abraxas' illness as an explanation like Demandred3000 suggested. It's not exactly stated when Abraxas died, but it has to be before 1996 but not too long before, because Draco obviously hoped he could use his connection with his Grandfather, alas 1992/93 is fitting. Narcissa didn't want Draco to catch Dragonpoxes so they decided it would be best if Draco stayed at Hogwarts.

**** That's probably a better explanation if you don't want to depict Draco as too childish. However, I'd say there are at least two details in canon that suggest that Abraxas died in 1981 at the latest.

1. In CoS Lucius clearly is the patriarch of the house of Malfoy. If he was just the heir, it is unlikely that he would be the one selling Dark artefacts and getting enough name to be known as the adult Malfoy by Fred and George.

2. In HBP Dumbledore tells Harry that Voldemort gave the diary to Lucius shortly before his disappearance. There is no reason why Voldemort would have been closer to Lucius than to Abraxas, usually Abraxas is used as one of Tom Riddle's school friends (even though he is never told to have been one of the first Death Eaters or one altogether). If Lucius had not already been the patriarch of the house of Malfoy in 1981, it is strange to say the least that Voldemort would have given the diary to him specifically. But then again, maybe Voldemort gave the diary to the house of Malfoy, not its current patriarch, and Abraxas and Lucius had both been present. Voldemort obviously had a very long term plan, because he wanted to be immortal, and he expected to outlive Abraxas.

Not if Abraxas Malfoy is already to old. In HBP it is hinted that Abraxas was already very old when he caught Dragonpoxes. So there is the possibility that he already retired and gave every power to Lucius.

#+end_quote

There is not even a hint that Abraxas Malfoy was a Death Eater or even a friend of Tom Riddle.

In the contrary: Slughorn highly respected Abraxas - and he didn't like the Death Eaters. While I suspect that Abraxas also thought of Muggleborns as inferior (Lucius has to have that idea from somewhere and the Blacks thought the Malfoys as suitable marriage partners) there is more reason to believe that Abraxas wasn't a DE than there is that he was one.

We know that someone bribed Lucius Malfoy out of his troubles after Voldemorts first fall. Seeing that he would have been in Azkaban until his trial like every one else who was suspected a Death Eater the most likely person to do that is Abraxas Malfoy.

And then back to Slughorns age comment: If Abraxas died in 1981 and attended school with Tom Riddle he would only have been in his 50ies. That's hardly middle-aged for a wizard. Even if he only died in the 90ies, he would only have been in his sixties. So we can be pretty sure that Abraxas was older than Tom Riddle and never met him at school.

I always imagined that Abraxas was Slughorns age, seeing as they know each other and Slughorn never mentioned teaching him.

#+end_quote

The only thing we know about Abraxas's death is that having dragon pox was expected to be fatal at the age he died. But does one have to be very old to die of a pox type of disease? As far as I know, measles (ashpox in my native language) is very dangerous to adults. Maybe dragon pox is almost always fatal to wizards in their fifties, and that was the reason Abraxas was expected to die of it once catching it.

Also, British wizards seem to marry and have children at a young age. It makes sense, because continuing the family is really important in aristocratic circles where heritage is considered one of the most important things. Of Voldemort's school friends Lestrange, Avery, Rosier and Mulciber apparently had children at a young age, as did the fathers of Sirius and Bellatrix (based on a source outside of the books, I think). Why would Abraxas Malfoy be an exception to this? Lucius wasn't.

#+begin_quote
  Slughorn highly respected Abraxas
#+end_quote

Draco hoped dropping the name of Abraxas would've made an impression on Slughorn, but we don't know if Slughorn actually respected him.

#+begin_quote
  and he didn't like the Death Eaters.
#+end_quote

At least he didn't want to be associated with people who had recently been sentenced to Azkaban. If Abraxas had been a Death Eater but died before the end of the war and never had to answer for his possible crimes, I don't think a person like Slughorn would have had much trouble with him. Slughorn seems tolerant in the sense that he accepts anyone with talent or connections even if they are monsters.

#+begin_quote
  We know that someone bribed Lucius Malfoy out of his troubles after Voldemorts first fall.
#+end_quote

Actually, we don't know. Maybe it was enough that the patriarch of one of the most prestigious families vowed to have been under the Imperius Curse. It is possible Lucius didn't even do any serious crimes during the first war. Maybe he was just Voldemort's financial supporter and a recruiter of more followers.

These are not things you have to take into account. Abraxas is literally among the most minor characters in the Harry Potter books, and you're perfectly free to choose different possible explanations if your story demands so.

** I always assumed that it was something to do with Lucius' plan to oust Dumbledore. Something like 'as my family are purebloods, I am not afraid of the heir of Slytherin, and will prove it by leaving my son at school'. Or maybe he is hoping that Draco gets petrified (which nobody treats as a big deal) to give himself more ammunition.

I always got the impression that Lucius knew the diary opened the chamber, but probably didn't know exactly how or that it was a Horcrux, or even that it was a basilisk, so he may have made assumptions about it which don't make sense to us when we look back on it.

Or perhaps it is entirely mundane. They were getting a wing of the manor refurbished and Draco chose to stay at Hogwarts rather than live in a building site, or Lucius and Narcissa were out of the country for the wedding of one of Lucius' Mexican cousins.

** In my fic I gave the reasoning that Lucius doesn't want Draco (and an OC sister) to ask questions about the Chamber of Secrets. In canon, it's clear that Draco has already been pressing Lucius for information about it, and it makes sense that Lucius would know Draco has a big mouth, so he wouldn't want him to know too much. Lucius and Narcissa gave the excuse to Draco that since they had just had the manor raided by Arthur Weasley's department, they were having to spend a lot of time playing clean up around that.

That said, in canon it is confusing, because Draco had already signed up to stay at Hogwarts at the beginning of December (before the raid happened), and Ron, Hermione, and Harry specifically identify it as suspicious, so it's not like Draco discusses his reasoning for them to overhear.

I agree with you that Lucius never would endanger his son knowingly. But as Dobby and Draco obviously knew about the chamber we can be pretty sure that Lucius knew the diary would open the chamber. I think that Lucius was just sure that his son wouldn't be in danger because of his pureblood-status. Nobody knew the monster was a basilisk.

But to quote Hagrid, "the Malfoys think they're better than anyone else because they're what people call 'pure-blood.'"

Lucius does love his son, but he also worships his own blood purity and thinks himself better than anyone else--much like his own son.

The idea of something being a threat to his son, when that /something/ is meant to kill those vile mudbloods, likely never crossed Lucius's mind.

** Oooh that's difficult. I think it must relate to what Lucius believed the diary would do (since Voldemort certainly didn't tell him the truth). He can't believe that it will bring Voldemort back, otherwise he either would have used it much sooner, or he would have never deployed it at all. He clearly wanted to somehow damage the Weasley family by doing this, and that doesn't square with trying to bring back Voldemort.

I'm not a parent, but you can bet I'd drag my kid out if some monstrous beast was petrifying students. So, Lucius has to believe (for some reason) that Draco isn't possibly in any danger- either because of his pure blood, or perhaps because of Lucius's association with the Dark Lord. I'm leaning more towards the former than the latter.

This could be evidenced in the overly dramatic way Draco announces:

"You'll be next mudbloods" somehow knowing those are the enemies of Slytherin's heir.

If he knows this from Lucius, then it makes sense he believes Draco is safe. And this would only be further confirmed by the attacks- all Muggleborns. Each time there's an attack it would confirm Lucius's thought process.

Honestly, I'm more surprised Narcissa didn't brain him, floo Hogwarts and get Draco.

So, his father is telling him he's safe. And all the action is happening at school, he doesn't want to miss out on the fun. Also... didn't Abraxas die sometime this year? Of Dragon Pox? Could you spin it that they want to keep Draco away from all areas of infection since he's a child and more likely to be susceptible?

** Because Lucius has no idea what Voldemort's diary will really do, let alone how, and he wants his son to discreetly report it all to him.

It is not at all strange to believe that Lucius will assume proper purebloods will all be spared, and thus Draco should be safe.

Draco could be at school with the specific instructions to report any and every little event that incriminates either the Weasley's, Dumbledore, and to tell how Hogwarts Burns.

Extra bonus points if Lucius can finally get a proper argument to have Draco enroll in Durmstrang as Lucius wished while Narcissa insisted on Hogwarts.

Edit: Draco was already shown as not the brightest Lumos in the classroom. What's to say Lucius hopes his heir might be collateral and he can try for another one because their marriage contract stipulates just 1 kid, and Narcissa refuses to touch him because she has Draco?
