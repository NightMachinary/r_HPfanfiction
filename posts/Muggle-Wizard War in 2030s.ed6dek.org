With the way technology is improving in the muggle world, and the progressive views Wizards have towards Muggles after the 2nd War.

Is it possible that Wizards could be found out and a war would ensue?


** The muggle and magical governments work too closely together to allow for war between them. It'd have to be a non government group like Voldemort's Death Eaters that starts the war, and then there'd be enough magicals on the other side supporting the muggles that it becomes a magical vs magical with a bit of muggle support war.

*** Work closely how? You mean the Minister of Magic and The Prime Minister?

*** The Prime Minister is the only person who knows about Wizards in the government. No indication has been shown that other governmental heads know. Plus, what if the whole Muggle community finds out about Wizards and they is no way to hide it just like in Fantastic Beasts Movie? People fear what they don't understand.

That fear could lead to a War between them.

The Wizard secrecy could be broken anywhere. In America or France and the information would spread to the rest of the world leading to people finding out about Wizards in their communities!

** This could happen with the advances in CCTV cameras, especially in London where in our world at least there a hundreds and thousands of cameras spread out through the city. Unless Wizards knew of these and set up Apparition and Portkey points in locations out of sight of these cameras, no doubt a Magical could be caught disappearing, appearing or, god forbid, using their magic on a muggle if they are the wrong sort.

While the Prime Minister may try to cover this up, who's to say those who monitor the cameras won't decide to leak the video to the internet? And we all know how fast videos on the internet can spread. Sure, some may call it fake and edited, but others could take it seriously and begin planning against these dangerous freaks who use their weird powers to take advantage of innocent people.

Given enough time and resources, this group could grow into an organization with a personal army that will gather intelligence on the wizarding world, recruit dissatisfied muggle-borns and/or squibs as they exit the Wizarding World, set up code phrases to avoid being infiltrated by Metamorphmagi and Polyjuice, attempt to infiltrate the various Magical Sections around the world, keep personal diaries (digital and hardcopy) detailing what they are doing so they know when they've been memory wiped, etc etc.

With enough planning, resources, time and people, this group could easily instigate a war between Muggles and Wizards, first doing hit and run covert attacks on this Hidden Society, then attempting to rip down the veil of secrecy and expose them to the world, the bad most of all so that they can rally the rest of the world to follow suit against these wizards and witches.
