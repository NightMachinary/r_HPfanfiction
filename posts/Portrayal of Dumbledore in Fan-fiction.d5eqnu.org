** JKR, as I've said before, chose plot over characterization/development and it is common for the adults to be incompetent and/or dead in YA/children's fiction.

With that in mind...Dumbledore /is/ manipulative and he /is/ incompetent throughout the series. That sounds contradictory, I know, but he was those things at different times whenever plot called for it.

There's nothing to suggest he suspected Quirrell (and it's even worse if he did) and in the same book he flew a broom to the Ministry despite apparating (or portkeying) in the very first chapter. Couple this with the fact that Harry and Hermione come to the conclusion that he set it up so that Harry would meet Voldemort and you have to conclude he's manipulative or incompetent.

Hagrid told Harry and Ron to follow the spiders. Hagrid is also talkative. Did Dumbledore not speak with him? How is it that Dumbledore didn't have a general idea as to where the CoS was? Myrtle, too, is talkative. Incompetence?

He explains nothing in OOTP and admits he had at least an idea as to what was happening at Privet Drive between '81-'91. He allows Draco Malfoy to plot his murder, giving not a damn for the safety of his other students or professors. What /if/ Katie, Ron, or Slughorn had died? Incompetence? Manipulative?

There's also JKR's answer as to why Snape was allowed to be a cunt his students.

The issue with Dumbledore in fan fiction is that he is dumbed down and weakened. There is also the fact that most authors generally miss his moments of intelligence. I mean, he planned a war years/decades in advance and what little we see of his magical ability is subtly spectacular, but, also, "manipulative" and "incompetent" aren't unfounded adjectives.

One last thing, Amelia, if she's featured, Lucius, etc, can and should have their day. Dumbledore, even when written well, wasn't infallible. He was deliciously outwitted in GoF, Lucius had his moment in CoS, and aurors didn't shine bc YA fiction.

He planned nothing, not unless you consider tossing a bag full of coins in the air and hoping they all come up heads as a plan. I call that arrogance and megalomania, not intelligence; in literary terms, Author's Fiat.

**** Nah, he planned for Harry to live. Granted, that involved hoping he knew Voldemort as well as he did, but text tells us he did know him well enough to guess he would use Harry's blood.

***** He gambled that Voldemort would use the killing curse to kill Harry. Had he used any curse that damaged Harry's body, Harry would've woken up in a bleeding, broken body and promptly died again. And that's not exactly a plan, Harry had no reason to believe Snape, it was luck that Harry was there in the first place.

****** Everything was a gamble. Well planned gambles. And why wouldn't Voldemort use the Killing Curse? That's how he killed everyone.

Harry should have been able to tell the differen between real and fake memories, nevermind that Dumbledore told him Voldemort left a piece of himself inside Harry in second year.

Harry was going to the Shrieking Shack to kill Nagini. Also, plot convenience.

It's a real possibility. It already backfired on him against Harry before and Harry more or less put him in a state of limbo for nearly two decades. I could see him making Harry's death really slow rather than a quick Killing Curse.

******** He pretty much tried slow in the graveyard, but at that point in DH he'd shot off or at least tried to use the Killing Curse on 3 separate occasions. In that moment, he'd overcome his 2 biggest obstacles: the sacrifice and the cores. He had no reason to believe Harry would get back up /until/ it knocked him over, too.

** The biggest issue with Dumbledore bashing is when it's done in a bad, over the top, heavy handed fashion - and sadly, that's what most of it ends up being.

Like most fanfiction tropes, I hold that the quality of the writing is what matters. Dumbledore in canon is a well meaning, overall good person - and despite that, he's also able to be fairly callous for the greater good. But it's all balanced - he's not a monster, and he's not incompetent (though part, as [[/u/Ash_Lestrange]] explains, of it is the problem of how the genre is set up and IMO the later twists of the series) .

Is there rooms for fics where Dumbledore is outright evil? Even more callous and willing to sacrifice? To do what he thinks is the thing to do to defeat Voldemort? Yes. But a mustache twirling evil version of him is... boring. As is the fairly stock standard evil version that just abuses Harry for no reason, or works to keep him down, and so on.

Make him an interesting, more complex character! If one of the points of the work is that Dumbledore is evil, an enemy to Harry, or the like - make him an actually interesting person. It's like Ron/Weasley bashing - you can make them be in the background or bad people without going over the top with it.

My favorite Dumbledores in fanfiction are the ones which show him as a wise, powerful wizard - and often over his head based on the expanded versions of the fic. My least favorite are the idiotic, bumbling fools who deliberately put Harry to get abused by his relatives, and then work to keep him down and weak.

A darker, more manipulative Dumbledore could well be a treat to read about - but I feel like he'd need the proper twists to make it believable. Eg, a backstory shift where he and Grindelwald agreed more - perhaps they worked together, perhaps they disagreed - and Albus decided to work /within/ the system to gain his power. To couch himself as the greatest champion of the light, to bring in as much authority and power into his person as possible. That's not a twist that's too far from canon, really - it wouldn't take much to see his personal authority (leader of a powerful paramilitary group, head of the ICW, headmaster of *the* only important school in Britain, and basically the chief justice of the nation) as the result of some plan. That's a lot of power to have concentrated in one man - one unelected man - who further has the distinction of being recognized as /the/ best the Light has to offer.

But for that fantasy to be believable, you have to have him be a certain level of smart and capable.

** It's gotten to the point where finding a fic with Dumbledore portrayed either A. How he is in canon or B. In a favorable light despite his flaws are a delightful treat

** Dumbledore is manipulative, callous and, in his handling of Harry, monstrously evil. I cannot characterize child abuse as anything other than evil and that's exactly what Dumbledore did /and/ enabled. His entire war plan hinged upon Harry; the Order had no plans or contingencies, no way to protect/evacuate Muggleborns, nothing but "/Harry is the best hope we have, trust him/". The war was won in spite of Dumbledore's so-called plan, not because of it.

He arranged for Snape to provide Harry with information so late that Harry was left with no practical option but to walk to his own death. Do people not realize how utterly disgusting, vile and evil that is? Do people not realize that Dumbledore was a man, not a god, no matter how intelligent, and thus not the ultimate authority on anything; that Harry and others could've come up with another option? And even if they didn't, that Harry deserved to have the choice to walk away? Any good person would've asked for help long before manipulating a boy into committing suicide.

People try to defend him all the time and sorry to say, it always comes across as cult members defending their beloved leader. I wonder how low their standards of a "good person" are, and if "better than Voldemort" or "fighting against Voldemort" is sufficient for them.
