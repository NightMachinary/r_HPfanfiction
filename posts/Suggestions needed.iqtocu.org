I'm writing a fic where an oc of mine has an abusive sibling. That is verbally and psychically abusive any suggestions? My oc is a teen as is the older sister just one year older


** What are you wanting suggestions about? Generally, an abusive person will not acknowledge they are being abusive. They'll justify everything they do with extreme leaps of logic

**** I feel like saying that if you can't even name abusive behaviour, maybe you should pick a different character arc. Or just stick to what is the canon Dursley behaviour for the sibling but have it more impactful on the character.
