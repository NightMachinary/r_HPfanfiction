The long fic I'm working on requires my oc and another character to have a titular villain (outside of Voldy) that creates tension. At first I thought of Bellatrix, but I really like how she is taken care of in canon and I don't want to mess with her.... would Barty being sent back to Azkaban be reasonable?

​

I would like your thoughts


** Or better yet Crouch does not reveal himself through impulsive idiocy. Pin the blame on Bagman or something. Impersonating Moody is a brilliantly insane plan much like impersonating Voldemort himself : no one thinks anyone would be mad enough to do it. He could even get a free pass into the Order.

Fudge would do his best to silence Crouch once revealed. It is actually legal to kiss escaped convicts apparently. So Azkaban probably wouldn't work without more setup in the plot.

EDIT: Perhaps have Fudge discretely remove a year of Barty's memory. He was a oblivator in the first war.

*** I like this alot

I want real Moody to still be a thing, so what if Crouch nopes out after Harry comes back, the Ministry blames it on Bagman and Voldy has a right hand that isn't goo goo gaa gaa bating his eyelashes at him

**** Barty removes a year of Moody's memories and sets it up to look like an accident before exiting. Sure, everyone would know that Moody had been impersonated but they wouldn't know by whom and Barty would still be in play.

Seriously though the memory charm is OP. (What are your thoughts on the Edit in the parent comment?)

***** I like Barty doing that to Moody, it shows forethought and is perfect for the villain I'm trying to mold

To the edit: Which Crouch are we talking about? Can you elaborate a bit more

****** Barty Jr. obviously. Instead of the Dementor sucking out his soul Fudge erases every memory since his removal from Azkaban making it impossible to obtain a testimony from him.

*** Yeah, in one of my fics, Barty Jr. obliviates Moody and edits his memories so he thinks that he was teaching the whole year, then pins the blame on Barty Sr.

Why it should be? Fudge is a dictator, who doesn't care about mere law apparently. If this dialogue doesn't make you vomit, then you are missing the point:

#+begin_quote
  “The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I remind ed you on the night of the second of August,” said Dumbledore. “Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven, again, as I reminded you o n the night of the second of August. In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.”

  “Laws can be changed,” said Fudge savagely.

** Just have him sneak off towards the end of the task (after getting rid of the opposition, unless he sabotaged them in advance) to join Voldemort. After all, he doesn't need to stay and wouldn't he want to witness the success of all of his work, and Voldemort to have his most faithful non-imprisoned follower on hand to set up as his second in command.
