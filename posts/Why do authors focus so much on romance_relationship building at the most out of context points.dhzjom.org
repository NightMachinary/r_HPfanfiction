This isn't limited to just smut or slash or hetero, it seems like it's everywhere.\\
Having romance-building over the summer or in an otherwise unimportant moment? Sure.\\
During an event that's important to the plot? Not okay.\\
As I read some of these fics, the moments where people just randomly flirt /can/ work, if they are doing it intentionally to confuse another character, but I'd like to know if there is an audience for this strange technique, and if so, why?


** You mean like 2 main characters confessing their attraction by making out while looking for a horcrux in the middle of a do or die battle?

üòùüòùüòù

I think this depends on what type of relationship they already have and the means of romance building. Harry and Fleur flirting right after his name comes out of the goblet? Unacceptable. Right after they get out of the lake and everyone's fine? Have at it. Established acquaintanceship/friendship and she holds his hand to give or receive comfort before or after the 3rd task? Just fine.

Imo there are reasonable ways to build romance/friendship in all 3 situations it's really just a case of knowing how to do it.

*** There's nothing like the threat of mortal danger to bring people together! It's actually a real thing, when people are scared they seek comfort and the safety of each other, and when two people are attracted to one another, and they are close, and comforting each other... well you know where it goes.

Some people find danger attractive. They're mostly nutters, but yeah, they exist. They're scary, but they're out there. /Shivers/

Totally not in the /middle/ of battle, though, it's just unrealistic and suicidal.

It's also a hallmark of subpar storytelling. The author wants lots of romance and snogging in their fic, but can't find good spots to realistically insert it into the plot, so a lot of silliness ensues. As others have said, the romance /is/ the story they're trying to tell, even if it doesn't comply with canon characterization.

**** That's honestly the reason why, in my opinion, Harry/Hermione is the only possible outcome from the canon plot. For at least two if not three months, it was them against the world. The Order was soundly defeated, they had no one else to fall back on. And by the looks of it, they were losing as well. Their deaths seemed inevitable. For all intends and purposes, it was a "last two humans alive" scenario. They would have gotten together, even if only due to the desire to feel some kind of human emotions. A union born out of desperation.

After the war, there would have been no one who could relate, at least from the important characters. Ron had his family, same as Ginny. Neville and the DA had each other, not good odds but at least a few people. Muggleborn inmate 4284 might be able to relate based on his or her experience in Azkaban concentration camp, but a 19 years later where Harry is married to Fay Dunbar would be very jarring.

***** Just because shared experiences bring people closer together doesn't mean they will end up together. Harry and Hermionie already had a very close relationship before, if they have a sibling like relationship it doesn't have to evolve into a sexual one unless you're Freud.

I love my sister like a sister. I could live on the run with her for a couple of months without that turning into a romantic love.

And we know there were other muggleborns on the run, sure Harry and Hermione were Undesirable 1 & 2 and were trying to find horcruxes, but really for the most part they were just surviving.

****** I'm not saying that any two people will get together if left alone. But in that case, they were the last two people with basically no hope of survival. "We might be dead tomorrow" was not an unlikely scenario. And I'm not saying that they would fall in love, but that they would have sex out of the desire for any human contact. Maybe start innocent enough with sleeping together (platonic) and have that turn into more.

And after the war they can't make relationships with anyone else work because they weren't there. This wouldn't be a glamorous romance, it would be a sad one.

** Hey, if Elizabeth Swann and William Turner can get married by a Pirate Lord, on a ship, during a storm caused by a sea-goddess, while fighting the undead ghost ship of Davie Jones, I think some teens can make out on a Horcrux Hunt.

** Because for some of these fics on the heavier end of the romance scale, the romance is not a subplot like it was in canon. The romance /is/ the plot. The story isn't about defeating Voldemort or discovering the secrets Dumbledore has hidden over the last century. That's background information, but not important to the story. What /is/ important is the journey of X and Y characters getting together.

Consider the story /Romeo and Juliet/ - the setting is early-modern Italy, the city-state of Verona in the 1500's or so, where cities were constantly at war or making treaties with each other, the Catholic Church was nervous about the heretics who wanted to read Bibles in their native languages, not Latin, and there was a closing gap between the power of princes and nobility and the rising merchant class. None of that is explored in the story, which centers on two people who got the hots for each other, and their families who disagree.

Maybe characters in an HP setting should care that Voldemort is going to take over... but that's expecting realism, and authors who write heavy romance don't care about the realism.

**** It boils down to the authors who write those stories. They consider limited-scale character conflicts (Romeo and Juliet's feelings about each other and the division it would create among their families) to be more interesting than a broad-scale conflict (how a bloody feud between the two most powerful families in Verona would affect the city). The former is an angsty, dramatic romance. The latter is a political procedural.

If this kind of personal-conflict based story doesn't appeal to you, you're probably not the target audience.

**** I do, and in some cases, it is appropriate to build (After danger, before danger, breaks). I do acknowledge that I'm probably not the audience for this, but it might be interesting to focus on a relationship when writing a fic.

***** I think it's mostly lack of skill? Writing is imitating life and that's hard. You want to write about romance so you think that has to be the focus all the time, no matter the setting.

Meanwhile, you could definitely do a Romeo & Juliet that dealt with the political side while still having it be about romance. You can use the big "We have to stop Voldemort!" mission as a tool to build the trust and connection needed to make a relationship real while not needing characters to flirt when their fighting dementors.

** Because they are writing a romance. You might as well ask why a romcom featuring a cop does not focus on a serial killer or terrorist hunt.

The problem often is that the author is trying to stick to canon and the Voldemort threat instead of ditching it for a more appropriate background plot.

** I won't speak for authors, as they have their own reasoning in each case for why they did x or y. But I will offer a bit of defense for them: *Rowling did it first*.

- Hermione and Ron in the Room of Requirement.
- Harry obsessing about Ginny repeatedly during the BoH (and doesn't seem to care about most other people to anywhere near the same degree).
- Tonks and Remus' relationship as its shown in HBP and DH (it keeps getting dragged into the story almost certainly so she can force a reason for Harry to become godfather like Sirius).

She even has somewhat done this out of the main books - as an example later stating the whole Albus/Gellert relationship outside the books. I can kind of see a bit of logic to why that was done, Harry seeing that love can be as cruel as it is beautiful would have probably have conflicted with one of the overarching themes after all. Or hell, look at FB2: "We were closer than brothers." Didn't really need that in the situation or the vision in Mirror of Erised as it was shown.

Those are her choices, and so I guess I can respect a fanfiction authors choices as well, even if I disagree with them.

** What I've never understood is why so many fanfiction writers write stories about romances. There must be hundreds of thousands of stories with a plot like this: Harry meets a girl, the girl turns out to be very nice, they go on a date, they fall in love, they are happy together. Usually the girl is just a shallow stock character so that the writer doesn't need to bother to come up with a unique personality. If the story has something else apart from romance, it's usually just normal Harry Potter plot in a slightly different way.

Who is interested to read something like this? Who is interested to write their own version of this? When I see a story description where it's announced that it's a love story of Harry and Hermione/Daphne/whoever, I will not read it. I already know what it's about.

Also, why do the writers usually announce the outcome of the romance in the description? It's not as bad as a detective story where the murderer is announced at the beginning, but it's still very bad. How about a story where a lovesick Harry wants a girlfriend, but has a bunch of bad dates with various fangirls. Eventually Harry learns what's important to him in a relationship, and that helps him to create a good relationship with someone the readers wouldn't have guessed at the beginning. That would be interesting, but apparently romance writers want things to happen quickly and effortlessly.

*** Because, bluntly said, "How would things change if Harry was balls deep in Susan Bones or Katie Bell? " is a better divergence than "How would things change if Harry had immense political powers and everyone would just bend over for him?".

A romance on its own is a beautiful possibility to explore a lot about the characters if written well. And it gives you a lot of possible divergences which can be fascinating. For example, if Katie was Harry's girlfriend of two years, I bet that he would find a way to make Malfoy pay for it. Or let's say that Harry beats Cedric to the punch and gets together with Cho in GoF. A friendly shoulder to lean on would be very helpful after the Graveyard and Cho wouldn't be an emotional train wreck, so their relationship might work out much better. She might also get used to Hermione and be less insecure about their friendship if she had more time to get to know the dynamics.
