Any good fics where Harry starts getting memories of Salazar Slytherin back (circa 5th year)? Years ago this premise seemed like it was going around but I can't seem to find any of them anymore. Any recommendations?


** This would be awesome. linkffn (Basilisk born) Isn't exactly this, but Harry is Salazar Slytherin

An older student getting memories comes into play later, but spoilers. Seems to be getting semi-regular updates.

**** Do you ever read a fic that you like so much and is so good that you can't bear to read any others in that trope because they pale in comparison? That's what this fic is. I can't read other Harry is Salazar fanfics because this is so wonderfully detailed and real. The best thing is that he has to catch up on history. And not all “ancient” magic is all-powerful. I loved how baffled he was with expansion charms. He reacted exactly how I would expect a Slytherin 900 years out of time would react

** I don't have any recommendations that exactly fit your request, but I've been enjoying Legacy linkffn(13255912) (where Harry is Salazar and has always known that) and Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance linkffn(10991501) (where Salazar is reincarnated as Hermione). I also second the recommendation of Ouroboros linkao3(Ouroboros by NovusArs) which is really fantastically well done and updates once a month.

Edit: There's also linkao3(Of a Linear Circle) where Harry is not Salazar Slytherin, but something spoilery does happen before his 5th year that links them together.

** Not exactly the same, but in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10487644/1/Courage-and-Cunning][Courage and Cunning]], by preciousann, an immortal Salazar Slytherin goes to save the Potters that fateful Halloween night, fed up with his disgraceful heir. He sends the real Potters to another country (telling them not to return until he gives the all clear), then he polyjuices as baby Harry, and waits. But something goes wrong when Voldemort curses him. He gets stuck in the form of infant Harry and loses all of his memories for ten years, growing up with the Dursleys as in canon (while the real Potters are living across the globe, clueless). Only when he gets his Hogwarts letter do his memories return. For a variety of reasons, he remains "Harry" and goes to Hogwarts.

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...

  In your research, you've determined that there's not many possible answers to your problem. You've narrowed it down to four options.

  1. You've been possessed by a ghost.

  2. You've hit your head really hard, and you're starting to hallucinate.

  3. Someone's cursed you to slowly drive you insane.

  4. Your past life has decided it's not staying in the past anymore.

  You have a sneaking suspicion it's the last one. In a few of your new memories, you see the founding of Hogwarts, and with that, your connection to the castle---your thoughts are briefly interrupted by a mental pat from said castle---so there's only four people you could be. And though you still don't remember everything, you somehow doubt that the other Founders liked snakes. or,Harry Potter is Salazar Slytherin. Or rather, Salazar Slytherin is Harry Potter.

  There's something ironic about being reborn; Salazar Slytherin can't just take a break from being Harry Potter. The Wizarding World has changed, but not for the better. It's become everything he had preached for in the past and what he dreads most nowadays. Now he has to struggle against dark schemes against his new life with wit and experience being his biggest weapons, as usual.
