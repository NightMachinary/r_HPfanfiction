So, I am of the opinion that Wizarding culture is at it's core prejudice and will never change. Muggleborns will always be looked at as second class citizens.

So; anyone have any stories where Muggleborns say screw it all and create their own society, away from the old wizarding world, with their own schools, own stores, own meeting places?


** This would be a pretty funny screwup from Hermione.

Accidentally time travel to the past.

Know enough to leave the future alone.

Wizard society doesn't care about these people anyway so if I just gather them all up and make a town somewhere nobody cares about. I can help them and also leave the future alone!

Creates the best magical education system in the world. Tom Riddle decides to ditch Hogwarts to attend there instead.

In this theoretical fic, I would leave this idea out of it and find another reason why she hasn't directly done anything about him (yet?).

Grabbing up all the muggleborns and making your own school/town somewhere is extremely far from leaving the future alone. Particularly if the place is so successful that Tom Riddle would choose to transfer there from what's supposedly the greatest school on earth.

****** I was thinking more of a magical college for muggleborns who were already disenfranchised with the magical world. The college and town become a success.

The same people who attend that college have kids which generates a demand for grade school level education which results in the people who attended the college forming a school for the town which becomes equally successful.

** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has muggleborns saying f* it but instead of creating their own society that would be vulnerable to death eater attacks they decide to blow up the death eater recruitment ball.

Linkffn(For Love Of Magic) has Harry creating his own island because regulations on dark magic are too strict in Britain and it ends up as the most important magical nation in the world. Muggleborns don't have a major role though.

Linkffn(The Perils of Innocence) has muggleborns figuring out magic on their own.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

Honestly, It gets so bad that Harry starts to fuck plants and he even has to return to his Island because his son cannot fuck ALL the females of the island, so there goes Big Dick Racist Harry who is irresistible to ALL women and into genocide back to his Island to give the pooor females a last taste of his Harry dickness a last time.

To not spoil you, because of his upbringing, Harry has no empathy towards people he doesn't care about. Harry views everything with a completely scientific mind so that's why he doesn't like religion.

** One problem I always had with the whole "Blood Purity" thing is that, it doesn't last. The children of a Muggleborn are automaticaly Half Blood, and after the passage of enough generation and depending of the marriage, the descendant of a Muggleborn can become Half Blood.\\
So a good part of the Death Eater and Voldemort supporter are themselves descendant of Muggles (Umbridge being an excellente representation of that).

So my problem with the idea of the whole culture being prejudiced at its core is that, if the Muggleborns do create their own magical community, what says a muggleborn entering into it in 3 or 4 descendants would not face exactly the same prejudices that they did (or a similar one adapted to the new culture).
