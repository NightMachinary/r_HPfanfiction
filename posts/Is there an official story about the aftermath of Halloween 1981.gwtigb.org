Does anyone know if there is an official story about what happened in the aftermath of the attack on the Potters' home October 31st 1981? Was something mentioned in the Daily Prophet? Does the public know that Dumbledore was responsible for placing Harry with the Dursleys?


** Nothing I can recall in canon. Most fanon typically has Dumbledore say that Harry is safe and makes no mention of where he is. For one thing it would kind of defeat the purpose of hiding harry if you told who had him.

*** Obviously, that would be a bad tactic. I meant more in the lines of if people knew that it was Dumbledore and not the Ministry that was responsible for moving Harry, without necessarily revealing where they moved him?

**** Ah sorry. I think canon is again silent on that.

Fanon has ministry personnel aware as often he uses them to become harry's guardian. And Dumbledore tells them Harry is safe. But general magical populace doesn't know it's Dumbledore instead of ministry.

** Absolutely nothing.

Somehow the day after it happened, despite being under a fidelius protected location, everyone in magical Britain knew that Harry Potter had the killing curse cast at him and caused the Dark Lord Voldemort to be defeated at Potters cottage in Godric's Hollow.

Also during the next 9 years somehow everyone learned exactly what Harry Potter looked like, what his glasses looked like, and the shape of his super special scar.

*** In various fics I've seen the story of that night being known because after Hagrid drops Harry off at Privet Drive he goes out for a few drinks and since Hagrid can't keep a secret....the story of that night comes out.

Other fics have Dumbledore providing the details of that night to create the image of the BWL (it couldn't have been something Lily did as the purebloods wouldn't believe a muggleborn could stop the Dark Lord. Much more believable that a one year old baby did it.) Of course, all the storybooks about the BWL (with an accurate description of what he actually looks like) is another Dumbledore plot to make Harry a hero and the money from their sale goes to Dumbledore's vault.

But that is one of the bigger plot holes that canon doesn't explain. How does everyone find out what happened that night. And how do all the Harry potter books have an accurate description of him since he has been hidden away by Dumbledore.
