I'm feeling that type of way right now. Tropes and cliches are welcomed. 50k+ words. No slash. Sorry that the description is vague, but there's really no limitation - literally any fic that has a Harry seeking revenge for whatever (significant) reason.


** I think I read this one a while back where fleur unintentionally keeps letting her veela allure slip around harry. He gets really sexually frustrated and then goes on a journey of vengeance when she rejects him. Forgot the title.

** Harry gets very one track minded in linkffn(the art of self fashioning) and takes vengeance on Voldemort and any death eaters he can get his hands on (including Snape). Story has probably one chapter left and is really good.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.
