Hey.. I'm looking for a HHr fanfic. Don't remember much about it but what I do remember is as follows:

1) Ron and Hermione become the prefects but Ron sucks at it and even resorts to bullying the younger years. 2) Harry proactively helps around literally stepping in as prefect. 3) His help with the kids is so good they start calling him "Professor Potter." 4) Flitwick even allows him to speak and encourage the younger kids that he taught before their exams (don't specifically know if they are taking the OWLs).

Please can you guys help me find this one? It's on fanfiction.net I think..


** I'm pretty sure you're talking about Harry Potter and the Last Chance linkffn(11922615). The prefect storyline starts in fifth year.

** It's on the tip of my tongue. Cannot find it right now. I remember that the first years are terrified that they could become prefect one day.
