I'd be really interested in an Adult Harry who goes through school pretty normally. I imagine him to be a pretty accomplished wizard independent of the whole deal with Voldemort. After he's a (enter career here), I imagine someone like Malfoy who here's a lot about how they were almost nobles in Voldemort's new world order, goes and helps resurrect Voldemort. What does Harry do? Does he have a family at this point he's worried for? Does he join the order? Is Dumbledore even around?

I've searched pretty hard for something like this, and so far come up with nothing.


** Mm, it does sound like something that should be an obvious point-of-divergence from canon.

Dumbledore comments in the first book that:

#+begin_quote
  ...if [Voldemort] is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.
#+end_quote

First book, he's stopped from getting the Philosopher's Stone, second book, the diary is destroyed before the shade in it can come to life, and Dumbledore gets an insight into Voldemort's source of immortality.

If not for book 3, where Peter escaped AND went to Voldemort for lack of anywhere else to go, Voldemort might never have had the opportunity to rescue Barty Crouch Jr., which means the Triwizard Tournament scheme might not have been pulled off, which means yet more delays.

And since, by the start of book 6, Dumbledore in canon had learned about the horcruxes and had started tracking them down...if Harry hadn't spared Peter Pettigrew, then the 'never return to power' that Dumbledore predicted, might have come to pass.

Funny, that. In a poetic sort of way, Peter's cowardice and self-preservation instinct, Harry's mercy, and wizarding Britain's perverted idea of 'justice', all came together to revive Voldemort.

If Harry hadn't spared Peter, he wouldn't be able to revive Voldemort. If wizarding Britain had functional courts and didn't use Dementors to steal souls and drive people insane, Sirius Black may have been found innocent and Peter would probably have turned himself in (a perfectly ordinary prison isn't as bad as spending 12 years as a rat, right?).

If Peter wasn't cowardly in the first place...there's the rub, if Peter hadn't betrayed the Potters then Lily wouldn't have been able to use her sacrifice to destroy Voldemort, which means the war would have continued, and given how close Voldemort apparently was to winning...

Now there's an ethical dilemma, of sorts. Is it right to hate someone for dishonesty which puts others in life-threatening danger, if they're only trying to save their own life and their actions inadvertently save the lives of thousands (or tens of thousands) of other people?

...Eh, that's a topic for another time. In any case, for a fic where Harry reaches adulthood before the spectre of Voldemort returns (and you know, I suspect Dumbledore's original plan was for Harry to grow up and become a fully-trained dark-wizard-fighter before facing Voldemort), the most likely point of divergence would probably be Peter's capture or death.

Or, for earlier than that, Quirrell simply not encountering Voldemort, and Ginny not writing in the Diary, could be all it takes for Voldemort to disappear before Harry reaches adulthood.

*** We need a fic that has them capture Wormtail in Year 3 and Voldemort getting stuck in Albania for a very long time.

When Voldemort finally managed to get his body back, he found himself without his core supporters (Bellatrix and Co finished off by Azkaban), but a Magical Britain controlled by Lucius Malfoy.

Even worse, because of the Diary, Dumbledore was able to find ALL his Horcruxes. Only Harry's scar was tying him to the realm of the living.

Voldemort needed a new plan.

*** Interesting points. I never looked at Peter's betrayal with that perspective before. Lots to think about.

Note though - Ginny writing in the diary had little to do with the real Voldemort. The Chamber of Secrets was a standalone plot until HBP tied it back together with the Horcruxes. In fact, that was something the literary critics liked about it.

  This is a complete AU Harry Potter is a 21 year old wizard, who's on top of the world. He's rich, in love, and loved by all, but his life is turned upside down as a spiral of events leads to the ultimate battle between good and evil.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is IMO the best example. Voldemort got his body back much later than in Canon, and he built up a different but much bigger power base. As the story currently reaches 2024, his strategic situation is pretty good.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** Thanks for the recs, I have read both of those. They have interesting qualities, but are a little off from exactly what I'm looking for. Starfox, something more Harry-centric, as DLND is more a story about Ron and Hermione than anyone else. Inquisitor, something a little less militaristic, and more whimsical, closer to JKR than Tom Clancy.

** Technically, my story "The Dark Lord Never Died" qualifies - in that AU, Voldemort returns after Harry, Ron and Hermione have finished their education. Harry was raised by Sirius in France, with the help of Dumbledore, and together with the Weasleys and other British refugees.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
