Looking for sevmione fictions where they are married by the name of love (could be forced to marry initially but ended up in love) ,but now they keep fighting and hardly tolerate each other due to life problems ,their distance or and such. They could be struggling to still be married or already divorced but forced to face each other. And need not saying I'd like them to get back together eventuallyðŸ˜… ,prefer HEA. In other words something like You promised it'd be forever my ms-figg THANK YOU.
