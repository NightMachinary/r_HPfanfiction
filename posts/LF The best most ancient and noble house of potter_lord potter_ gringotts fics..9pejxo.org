Definitely my favorite guilty pleasure fics. Preferably in an adventure or general genre. I also love well written shopping sprees. No slash please.


** Lol I have the same guilty pleasure. I know it's ridiculous. Most of those stories are poorly written. Harry gets a blood test and he's lots of 8 families and heir to 9. He has 6 animagus forms and 8 secret abilities. I mean seriously? But also I can't help but read them.

** Oh yeah that's a great story. I've been thinking about re-reading it. You can try linkffn(Wind Shear) too. Not as good as Honour Thy Blood but still a good read.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** If you are up for a really unusual one try Hogwarts Dawn by Jeconais (i dont think its on FFN). It has all the tropes you want i think, but plays around with them in an unusual way. Some of his others also follow this trope but Dawn is the main one.

  Three years after the Battle of Hogwarts magical Britain is in a mess. This is the historical record of how Harry Potter became Lord-Baron Potter Black, amongst other titles. Multiple sources now present how Harry changed wizarding society forever with the help of trusted friends, a house elf and Gringotts. Non-canon compliant. Not a part of the Professor Muggle series.

  At the reading of Sirius Black's will several shocking revelations leave Harry Potter and Nymphadora Tonks reeling. How will things change for them? And what about that crazy, drunken contract between James Potter and Sirius? What will this mean for Harry and Tonks? AU after Order of the Phoenix. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.
