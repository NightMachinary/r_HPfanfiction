Whether the character stays for a brief period of time or indefinitely I'm open to any recommendations. Thanks.


** These two fics both have a young Tom Riddle traveling to the future:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11562871/1/Addendum-He-Is-Also-A-Liar][Addendum: He Is Also a Liar]] - Tom Riddle's accidental magic repeatedly sends him to Hermione's present. They become friends in the years before they each get their Hogwarts letter. linkffn(11562871)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13126915/1/Diablerie][Diablerie]] - In the summer before Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts Alastor Moody enacts a blood ritual with unexpected results: Tom Riddle is pulled to the present from a summer of devastation during the London Blitz. linkffn(13126915)

  Despite his impoverished circumstances, Tom Riddle always knew he was destined for great things. The ability to travel back and forth through time was a bit of a surprise, though. Also a surprise: the bushy-haired little girl he meets in the future who possesses powers to match his own. Eventual Tomione; starts pre-Hogwarts.

  Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, he doesn't want to die

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688609/1/A-Little-More-Time][A Little More Time]], Teddy, now an Unspeakable, thinks he's found a way to pull his parents from the Battle of Hogwarts into his time. Fantastically written and, best of all, complete. linkffn(3688609)

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6994142/1/To-the-Future][To the Future]], the 1995 Order suddenly find themselves transported to the Potters' family home in 2023. Unfortunately, it's incomplete, but it looks like it's being slowly updated. linkffn(6994142)

  DH Spoilers Was it possible to save two lives without altering history? Was it possible to given them a future twenty years after they had supposedly died? Teddy Lupin thought so...

  An Order meeting in 1995 takes an unexpected turn - literally. Now the Order of the Phoenix are in 2023, trying to explain themselves to the adult Trio, meeting their children and grandchildren, and searching for a way back. But time is running out before the future might be changed forever...
