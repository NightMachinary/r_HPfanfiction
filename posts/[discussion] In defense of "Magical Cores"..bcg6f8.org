I've been reading through the "Unpopular Opinion"/ "hated headcanons"/ "stupid fanon tropes" threads and one thing keeps popping up; the idea of so called "Magical Cores" or inborn power.

I submit for discussion that it is in fact possible to use the idea of "Magical Cores" without most, if any, of the unfortunate implications that goes along with it usually.

Magical Cores are just the Mana/PP pool a certain which or wizard has available for use.

Here, let's put it into numbers shall we?

Say the scale for a core can go from 0-100; most witches or wizards are somewhere between 50-75 on this scale. Not bad, but not extraordinary. And the more magic a person uses, their core will grow stronger. To a point. The more magic is used, the easier using it will become. But even the best wizard cannot up their core past about five points their adult score. The core is fully mature by the age of seventeen.

Yet, with any scale like this, there're always outliers; Dumbledore probably topped out somewhere near 85, Voldemort may have been an eighty, and Merlin was 100+.

30-45 is Squibdom, and 30 or below just plain muggles.

Or at least, that's how I view Magical Cores.


** My main problems with magical core is that in brings the idea of "inborn talent" and "mana pool".

I don't like mana pool because canon absolutely never even implicitly mention it. Magic is a mental exercice, like solving equations. A wizard can end up too tired to do any spells (even if he would then be 2 mn away to fall asleep standing up) but I hate the idea that a wizard could stop casting spell in the middle of the fight because he is empty.

As for inborn talent, it's mainly because I don't think it goes well in HP universe. Not only does it bring a system of "cast" (Your magical core is only worth 75, no matter how hard you train you will always be a trash, I am born with a magical core of 120 so I am superior) that I don't like, but it also doesn't fit with Harry Potter magical system.

For example, in Harry Potter, the most powerful spells (most damaging one) come from the Dark Art. But the Dark Art is "hard" to practice since it mainly focus on emotion. Even a trained monkey like Crabbe can make a lot of damages with spell like the killing curse just because he want to kill hard enough. On the other hand, Dumbledore doesn't use Dark Art, doesn't destroy a lot of things and yet he is more powerfull.

Another example is the spell Fiendfyre. 2 people use it in Harry Potter, Crabbe and Voldemort (at least in film, would have to make sure in books). One spell destroyed everything in the Room of requirement, including the caster, the other only tried to kill 2 people. Which spell did the most damages? Crabbe's. Which spell was the most difficult? Voldemort's.

This is why I don't even like the mention of magical core in Harry Potter (Well that and all the lazy writing of Harry being OP because Magical Core).

*** You could argue that Voldie had some latent/inherent inborn talent, to be able to do what he supposedly did before Hogwarts.

The idea of "mana pools" feels wrong to me, but I don't see anything wrong with some people being "stronger" than others. Someone naturally smarter will have an easier time developing their magical talent, no?

**** This is also my reasoning. But there is something fundamentaly different between "He is more talented and can learn magic more easily" and "he is stronger because he physically has more magic". I think Harry Potter magic is more of the first kind than the 2nd one.

It really depends on what you see mana pool as. If it is something finite that doesn't grow than it isn't implicitly mentioned. If you view it as some inborn power that varies per person and experiences growth, there are hints of it throughout the books.

** The problem is that like most talents, there should be a distribution curve of some kind. Being human, wizards would no doubt want to measure and compare this somehow, even if the measurement is somewhat questionable. It's mentioned that there are off-screen means used to detect which children have magic, and a tantalizing hint that there may be a subset of individuals who have magic, just not /enough/ to be invited to attend Hogwarts

  Great-uncle Algie came round for tea and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great-auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased. Gran was crying, she was so happy. *And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see.* Great-uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.'
#+end_quote

It's fascinating to me because the Kwikspell products were made for someone, even if Filch couldn't get them to work for him.

J K Rowling has poopoo'd this in interviews, saying that if you're a wizard you're a wizard, yet clearly even canon disagrees. She's clearly trying to give a feel good answer to obscure a harsh truth that we aren't all the same and there are children who are more talented and children who are less talented. There are clear gaps in ability between different characters, and it's not always down to intelligence. Crabbe, a complete idiot, is able to cast a powerful Fiendfyre curse.

However, it is never explicitly mentioned in canon, and to me a clear mark of good Harry Potter fanfiction is when an author is able to imply these distinctions of magical ability without explicitly bringing up "core size" or "power levels".

To me, magic is about as quantifiable as 'political power'. After all, nobody has ever said that [insert politician here] has a powerful political core, nor that they their success ever came from a pool of political energy. Such success is judged on subjective things like charisma, or perhaps objective truths such as reliability (i.e. how many of their policies from their manifesto did they successfully enact) or general election results.

In the HP series, there is no magical cores or power levels. Sure, you could state truths such as Snape being far more skilled than Harry across the board, but magical cores and magical pools (or mana) don't exist in canon. Snape is much more intelligent than Harry and thus much more skilled at magic by extension, and also worked far harder than Harry if his spell inventions and potion modifications show anything, but magical cores and mana don't exist. Human intelligence translates to magical talent, as demonstrated by every talented witch and wizard in the series, but that doesn't make certain wizards more "powerful". Dumbledore, Voldemort and Grindelwald are geniuses but that is no "magical core" that makes them special. Their supreme talent is an extension of their intellect and their wide knowledge of magic.

#+end_quote

Yes, magic can be detected, but that doesn't mean anything about magical cores and mana. Such a thing would be a basic filter: if a child is capable of magic, they are classed as magical, but if they are incapable of magic, they are classed non-magical. There wouldn't be some squibs who are 30% magical and other squibs who are 0% magical. Either a person is magical or they aren't.

The quote you provided is, unsurprisingly, from the very first book. Rowling put several things in book 1 (and to a lesser extent, book 2) that she either retconned in later books. In PS, Hagrid somehow "flew" to the Hut-on-the-Rock despite later book telling us he can't fly brooms or Thestrals due to his size. In PS, we hear second-hand about Draco's tale of avoiding muggle helicopters on a broom pre-Hogwarts; even if Draco was lying or exaggerating, it would still mean that Draco in the first book knew what a helicopter was, showing that pure-bloods were never as ignorant of muggle technology as Arthur Weasley would suggest.

Most notable is that up until Goblet of Fire, the Death Eaters were simply called "Voldemort's followers" as the term Death Eater didn't appear until GoF. Similarly, we didn't get the word Auror in the series until GoF, hence why they were never mentioned in the previous book since they were never mentioned as arresting Sirius.

Remember that we didn't learn what a Squib was until book two, which came after the following book after the quote from Neville. Rowling wouldn't have mentioned Squibs in PS, just as she never mentioned the Death Eaters or the Aurors. So when Neville says "they thought I might not be magic enough to come", the actual implication is that Neville is really saying that his family thought he was a Squib up until he bounced down the garden. Neville not mentioning the word Squib is because Rowling didn't mention it at all in the first book.

#+end_quote

I always assumed Kwikspell was made for adult wizards who failed their OWLs or needed brushing up on stuff they learnt up until fifth year. To me, Kwikspell is basically the equivalent of paying a tutor to teach you Maths up to a GCSE-level. For example, if all you have is a GCSE in Maths (or even failed it outright) and you haven't done any serious work with numbers in over a decade or more, you might have gotten rusty or downright forgot how to do fractions or algebra or graphs as efficiently as you could when you were actually studying the subject at school.

When it comes to the OWLs studied by Hogwarts students, many people forget that Exceeds Expectations is above average; the average grade would be Acceptable or maybe a Poor. The average wizard wouldn't do NEWTs at all, or perhaps only study 1-3 subjects; they wouldn't study 5 subjects like Harry and Ron, and certainly wouldn't study 7 subject like Hermione.

An average wizard who took their Potion OWL exam 30+ years ago with, at best an barely-scrapped Acceptable or more likely a Poor/Dreadful, probably isn't brewing Potions much (if at all). Such a wizard would pay Kwikspell to tutor them and while they won't turn out amazing or anything, they'd learn enough to function in society, like how passing your English and Maths GCSEs with a C-grade or higher is really all most people end up needing in society.

So Kwikspell wasn't made for Squibs; Filch was just in denial/delusion, like how Petunia (albeit a muggle) thought she could get accepted into Hogwarts if she wrote to Dumbledore. If anything, Kwikspell was intended for wizards like Stan Shunpike who presumably did poorly at school, or for the average wizard who failed their OWLs for important subjects like Charms/Potions/Transfiguration.

#+end_quote

But you're conflating the potency of Fiendfyre with their ability to cast it. Nowhere in the series was Fiendfyre ever said to be a difficult spell to cast nor particularly impressive to do. Its a dangerous curse that could potentially kill its own caster, and did so in the case of Crabbe, but Fiendfyre doesn't require anything beyond the average wizard to cast. Its just really, really dangerous to the extend that only a complete idiot would actually use it the way Crabbe did (i.e. using Fiendfyre within an enclosed space that only has one exit, putting the caster's life at risk too). Why else do you think none of the Death Eaters ever use the spell during the entirety of DH, not even Voldemort or the likes of Bellatrix and Dolohov? Its because all of the Death Eaters would still have enough common sense not to use an excessively-dangerous spell that would likely kill themselves when they can just spam the Killing Curse or other duelling spells instead with zero-risk to themselves.

To me, magical talent is as quantifiable as intelligence or athletic talent. There are aspects that can be measured, and there are easily observed differences between individuals, but it is so multifaceted and context dependent that reducing it to a number would be reductive. (And yet there are still numpties in real life who go around touting their IQ scores, etc.)

I certainly did not argue for the existence of a "magical core", but what I am saying is that there is a component of magical ability that is not tied to intelligence. If intelligence is all that is needed to be an excellent wizard, why then is it Harry teaching Hermione the Patronus charm and not the other way around? Hermione mastered many spells off-screen, yet this is one where she needs Harry's help with.

Nothing in humanity is ever binary. As we are learning now, even gender and sexual orientation aren't binary. They exist on a spectrum. Why then would magical ability be binary? My argument is that magical people exist on a spectrum, and that what canon shows as powerful witches and wizards, while having intelligence and other qualities necessary to foster their talents, also have this unmeasurable greater magical talent than other average wizards and witches.

Sure, if a child has magical talent they're classified as magical in the eyes of society. But there are examples throughout canon of people having special talents, such as parseltongue, occlumency, legilimency or metamorph abilities, that others lack. People having a knack for certain branches of magic, like Lockhart with memory charms and Ginny with hexes, that other lack. And they're not necessarily all presented as paragons of intellect. There are examples of children who can consciously harness their magic from a young age like Tom Riddle and Lily Evans while there are children who are late in displaying accidental magic like Neville Longbottom.

These individuals like Voldemort, Dumbledore and Lily Potter, they have some knack for magic that others lack, and I don't think it is solely years of study and long practice that is the key to their feats and powers. It is this ineffable quality that I would call magical talent. And just has there are individuals who have this talent to spare, there must surely be individuals who feel it's lack.

Because Harry is much better than Hermione at DADA (as well as basically anything else that cannot be solved by quoting the textbook, such as Quidditch). Remember that the only reason Harry even learnt the Patronus when he did was because Lupin taught it to him privately, and the only reason Lupin taught him it was because of Harry's experience with Dementors on the Hogwarts Express. If Harry never had to experience the Dementors, he never would have bothered asking Lupin to teach him the Patronus Charm and he wouldn't know what the Patronus Charm even was. Besides, canon Hermione was never a truly perfect genius and would have spent her time studying magic and history that she actually found useful. We see this with her brewing the Polyjuice Potion because the trio needed to find out what Malfoy knew about the Heir of Slytherin, or studying Magical Law and Magical Creatures to help with Buckbeck/SPEW.

Yes, Hermione is the best student in Harry's year at magic, but being the best in her year doesn't make her a perfect genius who knows everything. It is repeatedly stated and Hermione's OWLs (9 Outstanding + 1 Exceeds Expectations) are further proof of this. *The Patronus Charm is a very unusual spell precisely because it doesn't require prerequisite magical talent or intelligence to perform: just willpower and particularly happy memories. The Patronus Charm and the Unforgivable Curses (at least the Cruciatus Curse) are the rare exceptions to how magic works, not the typical rule of thumb.* The reason Hermione struggles with the Patronus Charm is that while she obviously had a happy childhood, none of those memories were particularly special or notable since her entire childhood would be happy. For someone like Harry, who lived a sad and oppressive life with the Dursleys, his happy memories would be more special to him than Hermione's would be to her due to how rare it was for Harry to be truly happy prior to learning he was a wizard.

We know that Hermione was capable of using the Patronus even in fifth year, so its not like she was incapable of it. She struggled to use it in front of Dementors all that well in DH, but that is because she can't handle pressure like Harry since he has much more actual experience. The fact that Harry taught her the Patronus is due to the Patronus being like almost every single spell in canon and because Harry is just straight-up better than her at DADA. It shouldn't be a surprise that Harry is better than Hermione at DADA since, in reality, DADA is the closest thing to actual combat that Hogwarts formally teaches and the two things that Harry outclases Hermione at, DADA and Quidditch, are the two most physical aspects of magic.

The thing about those talents is that none of them are truly genetic at their core. Parseltongue and Metamorphmagus, while inherited gifts, can be replicated to varying extents. Parseltongue is just hissing so with enough failed attempts and patience, anyone could open the Chamber of Secrets if they knew where it was located. Metamorphmagus are basically just auto-Transfiguring themselves without need for a wand or Potion, but we know magic can replicate this well enough (Polyjuice Potion and Human Transfiguration). Occlumency and Legilimency aren't even special talents since they are learnt abilities that could be learnt by anyone with the right mindset and practice (as proven by Draco in HBP).

Yes, people have a knack for certain branches of magic but in the examples you provided, that is due to practice. Lockhart was actually above average but was very lazy, so only spell he actually put effort practicing was the Memory Charms; his proficiency with other spells got rusty from lack of using them out of laziness. As for Ginny, she is an example of telling rather than showing. Yes, she hexed Zachariah Smith at least once, but Ginny never actually proved to be talented at hexing like how Harry was good at Quidditch/DADA or like how Hermione was good at everything else. The only thing Ginny actually showed herself to be good at is Quidditch, and she proved she's very good at it because she put in practice to become that good.

All it really shows is that hard work gets results. Hermione spends all her time in the library studying and revising; she gets 9 Outstandings and 1 Exceeds Expectations. Ginny spends her childhood practicing Quidditch; she's one of the best Quidditch players in the school. Lockhart's arrogance and laziness causes him to hyperfocus on taking shortcuts; he gets rusty with magic except for Memory Charms, the one thing he actually put hard work into practicing.

As for the accidental magic, that doesn't matter. I'm sure Harry did much more accidental magic than Hermione given the environment he was raised in, yet that doesn't change that Hermione was more intelligent. Magical talent is tied to intelligence, that's just how it is. A nature knack for controlling magic would be a sign of superior general intelligence in most cases, but Tom Riddle nor Lily came with greater mana or magical power than any other child. Any magical child, if they had full control of their underage magic, could do most if not all of those things. Some say that Harry accidentally Apparated in PS, or perhaps he accidentally flew similar to how Lily could float in the air.

Lily's accidental magic, unlike Tom Riddle however, was a matter of Rowling's insistence on making Lily a saintly Mary Sue character. Lily's use of controlled underage magic conflicts with Rowling's actual portrayal of Lily abilities as being at best comparable to Lupin and at her lowest, a tiny bit below him. She never figured out that the Marauders were Animagi when they were all students (its possible she never knew even as an adult), and its strongly implied that Hermione figured out Lupin was a Werewolf faster than Lily ever did. Rowling tells us Lily was a saintly beacon of perfection, but she shown us that Hermione was more intelligent than Lily. Its like she wanted Lily to be a perfect character yet never wrote her actually accomplishments in line with such a thing, as if she couldn't decide on that.

There is a reason that James and Sirius were considered the best in their year, not Lily, even though none of the Hogwarts Professors knew about the Marauder Map or that they were Animagi. There is a reason that Snape is the one who invented many spells and corrected potions, not Lily. There's also the debatable implication by Rowling during HBP that Harry's learning from Snape's annotated textbook was meant to parallel Lily being taught directly by Snape during their earlier years in Potions together. This is because Slughorn compares Harry's Potions talent to Lily despite the fact that Harry's notable Potions talent came entirely from Snape's textbook, then we learn the HBP is Snape, and finally in DH we learn that Snape loved Lily.

Do you have a source in canon that backs this up? We are shown that these curses require strong emotion, but it is never shown that they are unique in that regard. In fact Pottermore says this:

#+begin_quote
  The majority of witches and wizards are unable to produce Patronuses and to do so is generally considered a mark of superior magical ability.
#+end_quote

So it's definitely a sign of Harry's magical ability that he is able to cast this so powerfully as a 13 year old. Harry's unhappy childhood made it harder for him to cast it, not easier. Your reading of this seems incredibly wrongheaded.

They can be replicated, but with great difficulty. Difficulty those who possess the natural talent don't need to deal with. With Occlumency and Legilimency they can once again be learned with great effort, yet some wizards and witches find it comes to them naturally, like Voldemort. This is my whole point that there is no binary wizard/not wizard. Each wizard has talents that make them special, or a lack of talents that makes them mediocre. And it isn't tied at all to intelligence. Parseltongue is canonically tied to blood. The only reason Harry and later Ron could speak it was because they were holding onto pieces of Voldemort's /soul/.

That's where you're wrong, Horace Slughorn takes notice of her because of the power of one of her hexes. He's a clear connoisseur of wizarding talent having collected so many up-and-comers of various sorts throughout his career, and she's from a poor blood traitor family. It's clear his reason for inviting her was genuine, and that is canon proof that her hexes are powerful enough to set her apart from other students. Whether you agree with canon or handwave it away as Rowling making a bad choice is on you.

Dumbledore never figured out that Slytherin's monster was a baslisk. Does that indicate at all that Voldemort was stronger than him as a student? Lupin is a professor during PoA, someone that is a prominent figure in the school and whose absence is noticed by all students who take his classes. During their school days, Lupin as a student was just one amongst a crowd. There is no urgent reasons why Lily would need to figure it out as a fellow student and for you to take these two facts to show Lily being the lesser witch is incredible.

Rage about canon all you like, the fact remains that only two characters in canon are shown having controlled magic as children, and one of them was Voldemort and the other was Lily, the witch who came closer to killing him than anyone else save for Dumbledore and Harry.

You are not really showing anything from canon to support this, just your opinions and they are drifting into headcanon territory. Is DADA not a branch of magic? Harry could beat Hermione in a straight up duel throughout most of canon. Yet she is unquestionably smarter than him. You grant that physical talent is a factor, yet then go on to insist that all magical talent is purely mental. By your own admission this is not the case.

If Wizard A consistently beat Wizard B in a series of magical duels, them both having similar education and experience, wouldn't you consider Wizard A more talented? And if your answer to this is no, then you clearly have a different view of what magic is than I do. Magic isn't just exams they get graded on, it's what they use to live their lives.

In OOTP, Bellatrix basically said that intent is all that really matters with them.“Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?” she yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. “You need to mean *them*, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain - to enjoy it - righteous anger won't hurt me for long - I'll show you how it is done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson -”. The fact that Rowling opted to use the word 'them' rather than 'it' suggests that Bellatrix's statement applies, likely to varying extents, that it takes a dark intent to use the Unforgivables effectively.

Obviously, the Unforgivable Curses are magically unrelated to each other, but its likely all three became legally unforgivable purely for the fact that simply casting them proved premeditation or malice along with how easy they were to cast; even Crabbe and Goyle, who both failed their OWL exam for DADA as we learn in HBP, could cast the Killing Curse. It would be impossible, for instance, to cast the Killing Curse without prior intent to commit murder. As Bellatrix suggests, simply wanting to hurt someone with Crucio isn't enough since it would require the cast to take true pleasure in making their victim suffer. The Imperius Curse likely falls under a similar thing regarding the desire to brainwash/dominate the victim, given Harry's doubts during the Gringotts heist that his casting was good enough.

As for the Patronus,when I say it doesn't require intelligence to cast, I mean that being good at Charms doesn't help someone cast the Patronus Charm better. Hermione is significantly better than Harry at Charms, but her Patronus is nowhere near as good.

Furthermore, the Patronus Charm isn't even formally taught at Hogwarts at OWL-level, meaning the average wizard isn't going to learn it. If I had to guess, the Patronus Charm would be taught in 7th year DADA, but most wizards wouldn't study DADA at NEWT-level. They'd either get an Acceptable or they would fail outright. I think Fred and George say in HBP that the average wizard can't even do a good Shield Charm, and that would likely be taught in 4th or 5th year DADA.

Remember that for most wizards, the only thing a Patronus actually does is repel Dementors and Lethifolds. That Patronus Messaging feature was invented by Dumbledore and would only be known by members of the Order, not anyone else. Most wizards aren't going to encounter Dementors and Lethifolds, so they would likely never get taught it in Hogwarts, or they would deem the Patronus a useless spell compared to learning more useful magic (like the Undetectable Extension Charm or mastering something like Reparo or Accio).

Unless a wizard was in Azkaban or worked with Dementors, the odds of a regular person encountering one were slim to none so there'd be little reason for people to learn it. Why learn the Patronus Charm when a wizard can learn the infinitely more useful Undetectable Extension Charm, or they can hone their skill at Apparition or the spells/potions they have already learnt? Learning the Patronus Charm would be a waste of time for 99% of wizards since the Dementors in Britain, up until Voldemort's return, were all under Ministry control so the average wizard wouldn't need to fear the Dementors if they being kept under control.

  If Wizard A consistently beat Wizard B in a series of magical duels, them both having similar education and experience, wouldn't you consider Wizard A more talented? And if your answer to this is no, then you clearly have a different view of what magic is than I do. Magic isn't just exams they get graded on, it's what they use to live their lives.
#+end_quote

Duels are primarily about reaction time and reflexes/aiming. Even if Wizard B was more intelligent and more magically talented than Wizard A by a significant degree, if Wizard A has much better reflexes or physical reaction speed than Wizard B, then Wizard B's superior talent mean nothing if they can't hit Wizard A. *You are right that Wizard A would be more talented, but being magically talented and being skilled at duelling are two very different things.* Hermione is much more magically talented than Harry across the board, but in a duel, Harry reaction speed and hand-eye coordination is much better, so he'd be fast enough to accurately hit her first. Especially since most of the advanced magic that Hermione actually uses in canon is useless in a duel (e.g. the Protean Charm) but is extremely useful in everyday life (i.e. literally any scenario that isn't a duel), and that is what truly makes her more talented than Harry. We even get a hint of throughout the series with Draco, who is arguably Harry's equal in overall magical talent, yet despite this, Harry won every duel they ever had and is significantly better.

it also does this weird thing with power scaling where its a hard limit

it feels like dragon ball z, which as soon as it introduced power levels dropped them in the next arc

Magic as a Mana Pool isn't really a problem, a magical system with limitation is good. It could become a problem when a person could cast a certain spell endlessly. Most people here seems to think that magic is a mental excercise, but does it basically any different with mana pool? I mean you could only use magic as long as you're not mentally exhausted (mana pool isn't empty) and using magic is tiring because you're using your mind (mana) constantly.

I don't like it when people began to use magical core/mana pool to create a numerical scale. Something like 'Dumbledore is a high magus because he is a YY level on XX system' or 'Goyle is almost a squib because he's only YY level' just doesn't sit right to me. Magic in HP is soft, there shouldn't be any system that can be used to determine if a person is more magical than the other. Of course I hate when magical core is used to powerboost your MC.

I don't care if that's your headcanon tough, as long as you don't use it explicitly in a fic I wouldn't mind.

** I actually like Magical Cores. But more along the lines of inner strength. It's not something that could be measured. Wizards don't have X amount of energy and then they collapse. Instead it's a bit like sports. Wizards can exhaust themselves if they cast powerful magic or use a lot of charms in a short time. And with practice this "core" grows somewhat because you use it daily.

So in a wizards duel the cores aren't really what matters. These duels are fought between wizards who have used their magic daily for a long time. It's their skill and creative use of magic that leads to the win.

So, yeah I like magical cores, but as an abstract concept that leads to exhaustion after a while. Especially in the younger years.

** My problem with Magical Cores is that it flies in the face of everything that magic canonically is. There is no evidence of anyone being more innately powerful than anyone else, Dumbledore and Voldemort are considered to be as powerful as they are because of how much they know and intuitively understand about magic. I would argue that you could cast spells of various kinds all day and your arm would fall off before you "ran out of magic". I know that some people would point to Harry's struggles with learning the Patronus spell and him looking exhausted after each session he has, but that's clearly because of the mental and emotional strain of having to face down his Dementor Boggart each time.

On the /run out of magic/ topic we know that Harry was exhausted while training the Accio spell, not really a physical activity but perhaps mentally, and Dumbledore.. well, there were many other factors for him. The truth is that we must ignore canon simply because we are never show /shit/ in the books.

See my above comment regarding the Patronus spell. It is entirely possible to exhaust oneself doing a purely mental task (ask any University undergraduate), when you consider just how much of an energy hog the Human brain is. Add to that the ephemeral nature of magic, which I believe is connected intimately to the soul (which is why we generally only see ghosts of wizards and witches, not Muggles (the echo of Frank Bryce that came out of Voldemort's wand near the end of book 4 being an obvious exception, and one I ascribe to how the Killing Curse is represented via Priori Incantatum)), and when one considers that the soul is theoretically infinite, so is a wizard's or witch's capacity for spellcasting, which I argue is limited by knowledge retention primarily.

What I *do hate* is the ultra-powerful Harry (or Ginny, etc.). It usually leads to lazy writing, poor plot design, etc. The only two wizards in Britain who have right to be more powerful than others are Dumbledore and Tom Riddle.

I always get a dragonball z vibe from it personally. If it's used well it can be interesting but it's usually not imo. The idea is fine if it's executed properly but the reason people hate on it, like other tropes is because it's generally poorly executed. Also the idea of magical cores being a mana bar is irritating for me because I don't personally read video game fics and that's another vibe I get.

Magic in HP is OP to the core (excuse the pun), and there is no mention in canon as to how and why some wizards can be more powerful than others. Its obviously not memory, because Hermione would eventually dwarf Dumbledore and Voldie, and its not the mental discipline neither, as Snape is far from being on par with Dumbledore.

Magical cores are a neat solution to this, as your power level is an innate thing. The concept gets too much crap. And its not like someone with a weaker core will always lose to someone with a stronger one. Its just that raw power will be different and it gives a somewhat ok explanation as to why.

** My own thoughts sort of go along with the starter of the thread but i always viewed it as a mix of four things.

1. Natural inborn talents of magic, humans are a diverse lot so some of us have knacks for different things. A good example could be people who just get math, others don't. How nievelle just was good a herbology and Harry DADA.
2. Natural intelligence and use of intelligence factor's in a lot hence Hermione, Albus, Tom etc. all were suppose be the greatest of their generations in ways.
3. i always believed in a "Magic Muscle" so to speak. the more you use it, the easier it becomes to use and stronger. the better trained it is. Different people would have very different limits here based on factors here. the muscle becomes stronger and stronger, and like a real muscle some people have different limits, natural factors for using it. Combine the first two to use it better < IE, working out smarter rather then over training and not using your intelligence, or How some people are better at squats or dead lifts due to the body>
4. magic core. Yes, i do believe in a core per say.. its more just the amount of natural magic one can hold, while others can hold less or more which can be increased by age or rituals <as mentioned tom did stuff to himself in canon and fanon>. Its also filled by outside given a small amount of time.. This explains alot. think of it as a cup refilled by magic that just exists in the earth? universe. reasons below a muggle has no pool at all, just the difference here. a squib has one which allows their bodies the health benefits of it. they need a touch of magic to do Potions and protect them. Squibs magic core allows them to see the world but their magic muscle and core are so weak they can't do much of anything.

​

these 4 tie together.. a squib maybe Low in the bottom 2 so unable to use the first two fully as the talent and intelligence can only do so far. But look at characters like Albus, and tom. they are the rare people who would be great in all four.

Magic core (M or M') incomplete dominant gene. Everyone has it, but the strength is different. + MM - powerful + M'M & MM' average + M'M' - weak

Mage circuit (C or c) mage circuit is recessive. It's like a circulatory system to magic, so while everyone has magic not all has the potential to use magic. +CC true muggles + Cc & cC wizarding descent + cc Wizard/witch

I view magic like a cardiovascular system. Everyone can walk or run but not everyone can be a sprinter or a triathlon.

Circuit suppressor (S or s) suppressor is a dominant gene. +SS True muggle +Ss Muggle descent +ss wizard/ witch

Types of squibs

Core squib (hedge wizard) - has M'M' genes, not powerful enough to cast wand magic. Kinda like a person with weak heart.

** He was honestly appalled. There were a few students that were convinced that magical power was determined from birth thanks to some kind of magical core, an absurd notion if there was ever one.

"It has come to my attention that there are many misconceptions between the students about the nature of magic. I have decided to take it upon myself to clear as many of them as possible" Harry spoke softly, his voice smooth.

This was his sixth year NEWT class, what should have comprised only the most talented. Of course, because of the discontinuous teaching of Defense the grades had to be adjusted and therefore many students could barely produce a solid shield.

Harry walked between the desks, the enchantments in the classroom making sure he was heard regardless of his position "I won't start a philosophical debate with you today" he continued, to the relief of a few "I shall explain to you all what little we understand of the reality changing force that is magic thanks to observation, trial and error for thousands of years. Magic is, quite simply, the exception to every rule of nature; it is one of the primordial energies that composed the universe at his birth".

As he said this, Harry drew his wand, and thanks to a bit of fancy spell-work the walls, floor and ceiling of the classroom resembled the outer space "The universe is vast and unexplored by the likes of us humans. We should not be arrogant enough to believe it to be an open book: many are the mysteries that humanity cannot hope to comprehend"

With another practised flick, the scenery changed back to the classroom, leaving awed students. Before they could regain their senses, Harry flooded the room with pure unaltered magic, making everyone feel dazed by the sheer amount. It was a bit of a dirty trick, as he merely guided the natural magic of Hogwarts to condense in the room, but he was a bit of a showman. He let go of it, allowing it to return to its mysterious patterns.

"Then why, you may ask, are we able to wield this immense power as if it was natural? Unfortunately, the specifics of such are still unknown, but many speculations have a few humans that had lived near a particularly strong source of natural magic to have developed a 'sense' for it. It would have, with time, changed in what we know today as the ability to wield magic".

There were many nods, but a few looked confused.

"Professor, why are there a few wizards of such power then?" Asked Matilda Smith, a Hufflepuff. Her classmates made murmurs of agreement, thinking about Dumbledore and Voldemort, a few even of their Professor.

Harry's lips stretched wide, like a cat who ate a canary "Now that is the burning question, isn't it? Why do a few gifted manage to become so powerful. To understand this, we have to take a step back. Basically, magicals interact with the omnipresent magic, as it's a figment of the universe's reality, and use it for numerous purposes. Magical 'power' is in reality the ability to manipulate this primordial force. The more one understands it, the more one uses it, the more one's body is capable of sustaining the effort, the more one is 'powerful'".

The Professor gave his students a few moments to process it all, and was rewarded when everyone started to get it. Harry smiled and decided to simplify it even further, for the sake of the few hard-headed ones "In the end, it all comes down to how much you know about how the spell works, how much in tune with magic you are, how fit you are and how much practice you have. Think of your magical ability as a muscle. It is the brain which gives you the order to move, and the more you have exercised it, the more strength it will produce; if you know how to do the task at hand well, you'll be able to minimize the effort. It's as simple as that" he continued, staring in the distance and thinking about how much easier his life would have been if he had a proper magical education.

Harry shook his head and decided to wrap things up "It is true that a few are born either more in tune with magic, or more talented in a determined field, but it is the same with physical constitution. Muscles can be built, and so can magical skill, one has only to have the dedication for it".
