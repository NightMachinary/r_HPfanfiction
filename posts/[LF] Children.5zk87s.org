Are there any stories where Harry - or another characters - child travels back to the past to change something that shouldn't have happened, inadvertently being the reason the parents got together in the first place.

No MPreg, please, that's a place I really don't want to go to again. Adoption is fine. Genderbending is fine. That isn't.

Edit: Someone didn't understand, I meant - like - they went to school together, everyone knows that Anime story that probably is written somewhere...

  Astoria Greengrass wants to set up Harry Potter with her sister, Daphne. But her plans don't really go the way she wants them to. Not your usual Harry/Daphne/Astoria fic. Rated for some language and some adult content.
