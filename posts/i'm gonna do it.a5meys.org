i'm gonna write a fic, it's gonna be bad, but i'm still gonna do it. Anyone got any tips.


** Figure out how you want the story to end, so that you know where you're going with it. The ending may change as you write it out, but starting without a destination will leave you stuck once you progress past the set up of the original idea.

*** I agree with what wordhammer has said. Instead of making a new post, I will just piggyback from them and call it a day.

You should always plot the ending before you start to write as the ending is, in all sense, the end game. It should be set, but not set in stone. Be prepared to change it slightly, even rewrite it completely, but remain as close to the first draft as you can (within reason). I say this because some fanfiction tends to falloff towards the end. If you start it early, you have a less chance of that happening. All fanfics I have started I have written the end first.

Another thing I do is I treat characters like I would if I was roleplaying. Their story unveils throughout the story and nothing (except for things relating to the end) is planned. This may not work for everyone, but it helps me keep interactions pure and unexpected. In essence, interactions change them and morph them.

In one story, I had this spur of the moment idea to introduce someone who attacked a setting. The main character was wounded and, due to this, started to be a little more paranoid. It was fully unexpected because not even I expected it.

I have most likely confused you more, but you know, it just happens.

** Write a short fic first.

Other than that - just write something. The first step to being good at something is to suck at it.

** I would say write the story you want to tell most right now. Don't 'save' your favorite ideas for when your skill has improved, because chances are you'll have new thoughts by then. It's most helpful if you're truly passionate about what you're writing.

Good luck with it, and have fun!

*** Going hand-in-hand with this: Feel free to write your favorite scene of the story first. Many prolific authors have done the same.

Maybe you will then realize that you have no further interest in the fic beyond this one scene, but maybe that's better than writing half a fic first that is then abandoned.

** When I write, I have one thing that I want most to write, something that resonates with me. It might be a chapter, a scene, a moment or even a turn of phrase. One true thing, or feeling.

I find that once you have that . . . Lodestone, that grounding, to set the tone and sort of . . . Guide your fic, the rest is a bit easier.

Good luck.

**** That's a hilarious image, but that's definitely how it feels sometimes! Not like I'm creating something, but like I'm uncovering something that has always existed and I'm just trying to translate or describe what I find.

I've got another little needlepoint that I'm struggling with: Draco, opening a Weasley sweater. Black, with tiny white points all across in the shape of the constellation. He's very grateful. No one, in his whole life, has ever made something for him.

Why did he get it? How? Draco/Ginny, or something else? What's his relationship with Ron like? Harry? Lucius?

No idea, but I can't wait to find out! The wilderness mist be explored! Caw caw roar!

And then I wrote (am writing) that fic.

******* Hard to argue with that. Harry could help Neville with his broom flying, there wouldn't be much attraction for Hermione since it's relatively book-free, and Ron seems a bit biased against non-magical attractions.

** It's okay to suck. Just write.

Then rewrite.

write again.

In art, you make a noodly thumbnail sketch to get the composition right.

- Then you do a rough sketch.
- Maybe then you do another
- Maybe there are a few more as you figure out how you want things to fit together.
- Then you start drawing.
- then you adjust that drawing a few dozen times as your'e working: move that arm a bit, twist the hand a little, move the eye to the left.
- When you ink, you might go through all this over again.\\
- You might color the whole picture three times before it's done
- and even then: you could work on it more.
- Just, it's time to stop.

And this is what writing can be like too.

Sometimes the hardest part can be to GET THE FUCKING WORDS out. So just.. GET them out, even if they're awful. Do the verbal equivalent of drawing an oval and writing SANDWICH on it.

Write shit like this:

#+begin_quote
  She blushed heatedly at his rakish grin, the sapphire of his eyes gleaming in amusement at her embarrassment. After a moment, she found herself spitting out a kinda lame retort before he fires a real zinger back at her and she stomps away angrily, furious at his.. his ARROGANCE! That prat! How dare he say whatever it was he said! The door slammed so hard that the common room went silent for a moment, other than the crackle of the fire.
#+end_quote

It's okay to be uneven.

Come back and fix it later. Establish the important stuff: They're arguing, she's flustered, he gets the better of her, verbally, she stomps off to the common room. it's a sketch. Details later. If you have details now, that's great, but if all you can do is type INSERT INSULT HERE for now, that is OKAY.

Sketch. rework it as you go. Don't be afraid to throw parts of it out.

** - Figure out your beginning, middle and ending of the story.

- For your first fic It's best to go with somthing that is smaller in scope (i.e not a rewrite of all 7 of Harry's years)

- Some people write best by making detailed notes and outlining everything before writing it. Others just write and go with the flow. Figure out which method makes you more comfortable (obviously a small amount of outlining always helps)

- The characters should carry the plot forward, unless you're going for a murder-mystery or something like a horror story.

** okay so I'll admit it im a crackfic addict and I write hella crack sometimes so what I usually do is thus:\\
- come up with a really dumb premise or specific thing you want to happen\\
- figure out what the base change(s) would have to be for that to happen, throw in some adjectives on the other characters because you need them to be /something/\\
- write a few skits about it\\
- come up with a minor plot to connect the skits\\
- actually write the whole thing

** I highly recommend getting a beta. A beta is someone who will read through your fic and hopefully fix not only grammar and spelling mistakes but also give good, useful feedback on your idea in general, pacing, etc.

Fanfiction.net has a beta search function (you basically have to write a few messages to people and eventually someone will respond) or you can find one on here or at [[/r/fanfiction]] , a more general sub that is actually smaller than this community.

It makes an enormous difference to reading quality, and at least in my case also avoided awkward conversations with family or friends.
