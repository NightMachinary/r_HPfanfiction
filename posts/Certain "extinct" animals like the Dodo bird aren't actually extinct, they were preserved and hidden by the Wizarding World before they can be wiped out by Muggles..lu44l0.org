** Would be a hilarious 'justification' for a Magical Jurassic Park situation. :D

And it could fit weirdly well with a world of Pureblood Bigotry. I can totally picture a Muggleborn finding out about the park and being like:

"But the Dinosaurs lived ages before any Humans came along, and they were killed by a Meteor, not Humans!"

And then the Pureblood responding haughtily with:

"Actually, it was both. How do you think Muggles got to this planet in the first place? All the Magical Creatures down here, and you thought you were the locals? Pshah. You came down here, hunting all our dinosaurs, until we had to hide them! It was the first Statute of Animal Secrecy."

Wouldn't necessarily have to be true - could be some interesting bigot mythology - but the explanation for both does mesh weirdly well together. :D

*** It would be neat if the statute wasn't only 500 years old or some amount.

Also, the sly insinuation that muggles are aliens with the “you came down here” is gold lmao

**** Just because they signed a statute in 1690-whatever, doesn't mean they didn't sign any others. :)

And yep. I've seen a few 'Magicals are Aliens' fics, but never a 'Muggles are Aliens' fic. Even if it was just a Purebloods-justifying-their-Bigotry bullshit explanation, it'd be an interesting spin. :)

***** lol if it isn't relevant to Harry than it could've happened shtick. In love it.

It would fit right in with bigotry, it sounds a lot like ancient aliens building the pyramids conspiracy, which is rooted in racism.

****** Indeed. Oblivious, adorable little bugger. :)

And yep. It does sound very similar. Always great when people see an unanswered question like that and just make up their own answer to match their viewpoints. (Sarcasm).
