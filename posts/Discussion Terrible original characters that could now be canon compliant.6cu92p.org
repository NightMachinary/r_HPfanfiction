This is random, but the thought occurred to me while driving into work this morning and it made me laugh. After Rowling's info about Illvermorny has come out, a muggleborn American transfer student to Hogwarts could totally be the heir to Slytherin AND an ancestor to Morganna Le Fey.

To summarized if you don't follow the extra Rowling writings on Pottermore: Illvermorny (the American wizarding school) was founded by a British ex-pat in the 1600s named Isolt Sayre who was also an heir to Slytherin and an ancestor of Morgana Le Fey. She had two daughters; a witch who doesn't have any kids and a squib who gets married and (presumably) has children. So there would be (at least) hundreds of muggle descendents of Slytherin running around America.


** The much more important question: Does Rowling canonizing certain ideas make them any more or less terrible?

*** To me it's not necessarily the idea that's terrible, it's the execution. She just made something technically possible, which I don't think changes anything really.

A damn good author can sell just about anything to me. Give me a /why/, defend it. Any number of tropes can be written beautifully.

**** I agree 100%.

[I'll still expect most Veela!Draco/Harry fics to be terrible even if JKR writes an article on the Malfoy's Veela heritage, but that's a different topic]

***** Well I think certain idea will attract certain type of author with certain style.

A good author will never introduce an idea, a characterization or anything really without a goal in mind. Especially when it relates to a character. So, when getting to the point of a Veela Draco, a good author will ask himself "why" and "What". Why should my character be a veela, and what will this change bring to my story.

I feel like this kind of trop is most used by author who try to shoehorn a relationship without having the proper abilities to write it, either as canon-compliant to a point, or just so that it flows smoothly. They will slam Veela on top of Draco and use the veela as the justification of the relationship, instead of the plot device that could start it. Or so I think

**** To use the specific example OP provided: it's a take on the Chosen One trope we all know and love in fiction. Many non-fan fiction authors do it successfully, and all the time. The problem is when said character is a Mary Sue.

**** That's one thing I really hate about some fics. They are just telling the canon story with canon pairings and absolutely no changes whatsoever besides that one self-insert Oc that has zero impact on the plot but is still Harry's best friend or love interest with about as little depth as canon Ginny.

***** Nah, canon Ginny still has depth, it's just that because the story is viewed from Harry's perspective he kind of whitewashes it. Canon Ginny is rather jealous and has temper issues, compared to OC self-inserts where they're usually angelic from all sides of the argument.

** Do you mean Morrigan? HP differentiates between the two, they're different people, and the one Isolt is related to is Morrigan, not Le Fay.

Outside of that, very good point!

*** Doesn't the Morr√≠gan refer to the crow figure associated with fate/doom/death from Irish mythology? I'm always confused why it gets mixed up with Le Fay. If Le Fay ever gets a three-syllable first name, it's usually Morganna.

**** Pretty much. The only connection that I know of between the two in HP is that they're both bird animagi. I personally don't know how common it is to mix up the two names since I didn't learn about either figure in school (it was outside resources).
