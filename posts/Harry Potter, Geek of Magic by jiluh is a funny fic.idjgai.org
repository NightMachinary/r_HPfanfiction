I've read several of the "funny" fics that are often recommended but most seem to slide a bit of to the side of my humor. Enjoyable, for the most part, but not as humorous as some find it. The fics I have enjoyed for their humor always have an oblivious semi-antisocial Harry, and I have no idea why I like that so much.

Harry Potter, Geek of magic definitely has the anti-social harry part down pat. The bland candor to Harry in this fic is excellent. It gets right into the crux of his character and sticks to it very well.

Perhaps this isn't much of a review.

8.5/10

there we go

give it a read, especially if you've enjoyed fics like Harry the Hufflepuff by BajaB and other assorted stories that have faded from my cranial sieve.


** My favorite part is when it's revealed that "hissy snake language" translates in a parselmouth's head in the way their mind works and then they all just stare at Harry for a second.

** Good snippet from the story to help you get an idea

​

"I know how to play," said Professor Snape. He glared at Harry again, black eyes glittering. "Stop sticking out your lower lip like that. There's nothing you can do to convince me to play."

15 minutes later, after a raft of consecutive losses, Harry said, "Why do you keep winning?"

Snape said, "Because I only ever make the optimal play. There is no reason, foolish boy, why you should ever lose if you have the first move. I have not lost at chopsticks while possessing the first move since I was eight years old."

"Wow," said Harry.e

*** The bit after that is honestly even better:

“Stop playing with the boy Severus” “I wasn't playing with him, I was instructing him on gamesmanship and basic combatorials”

** Professor Dumbledore, we found the Chamber of Secrets and want to use it as a clubhouse, but Hermione says there might be dark magic. Can you check on that? Almost maybe put in a lift? The slide is fun, but a pain to get back up.

Dumbledore: Wat?

** This is one of my favorites. I love how it makes me laugh while also making me think deeply about magic. It's a combination you don't often see.

** Interesting, could do with some proofreading, but interesting

Edit: The humor picks up in chapter 2. Pretty funny
