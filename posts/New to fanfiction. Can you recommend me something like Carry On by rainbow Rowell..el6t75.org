Ive reread the carry on books more times than I can count and would love something to fill the void until book 3 comes out.

I loved the banter, and Baz brooding from those books. I'm overwhelmed by the amount of fanfic out there and don't know where to start.


** I mean, Carry On is virtually a classic Drarry fic. Try searching for existing threads about that to see if there's anything that interests you

** So I've not read Carry On or much of Rowell, but I know she's sort of known for slice of life, kind of fluffy stories, so I'll throw out some guesses and you can see if any of this sounds fun.

You might like Linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe) which is a time travel fic where Harry goes back in time to meet his parents.

Linkffn(Bound in Silver Threads by Snakequeen-in-Norway) is a next gen femslash fic that follows Lily Luna Potter with a strong supporting OC in Cassiopeia Malfoy (Scorpius's sister). There's plenty of banter, teen drama and romance.

If you want something with more of a mystery edge, Linkffn(The Aurors by FloreatCastellum) follows a young witch who just graduated Hogwarts and is partnered with senior Auror Harry Potter much to his chagrin. There's a bit of a romance arc as well, but I'll not say more about that.

Lastly, for something a little more fun, Linkffn(The many lives of Harry Potter by ShayneT) features a Harry who is reborn every time he dies, which leads to plenty of amusing paranoia and it actually does a good job of building a plot and sense of suspense. Its actually a real fic even though the description sounds a bit cracky.

Hope one of those works!

  Lily Luna Potter years 3-7. Why is she stuck with a Little Malfoy tag-along? What do the coming years hold for them and everyone else? How will they change and grow, what will happen as they do, & who will end up with whom? Eventual femslash. Multiple pairings. Lily/OC. Also stars Scorpius Malfoy's OC little sister. Not T until Chap 29, really not until Chap 32 & nothing too major.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

*** Carry On is not slice of life at all though. It has a more complex plot than most YA books and all the characters, including the side ones, actually go through character development. Not a fan of Rowell, but Carry On has more in common with Cassandra Claire type writing than Ao3 slice of life.
