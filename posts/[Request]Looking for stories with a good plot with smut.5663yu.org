Any pairing is fine for me. Also would prefer 40k words or more


** Turn by Sara's Girl is my all-time favorite fic. The smut is minimal compared to other fics, but the story is just amazing. It's a Harry/Draco fic that is losely modeled after the movie, The Family Man. Over 300k words.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

** linkffn(for love of magic)

Gets smuttier as it goes. I'm mostly in it for the plot, but the smut has grown on me over time. I like the characterization of Harry. He's a bit more intelligent, takes a high risk path to power and has to deal with the consequences, and is more self-interested. He's not exactly the self-sacrificing type.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** I especially like this because not everything goes right despite the obvious benefits he gets (Dark & Void vs. Light and his relationship with Tonks).

But in the end the pros outweigh the cons so it's not a horribly depressing drama.

  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

** Teaching Miss Granger by OracleObscured linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5837464/chapters/13453234]]) is by far the smuttiest story with a decent plot that I've read. (I'm actually about half way through right now) Just make sure to read the tags and authors note before you decide if you want to proceed. It is complete at 44 chapters and 470k+ words. Ardent Bonds by Musyc is also good linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/100613]]) but that one is just under 17k

** I love Our Magic Knows No Bounds! It's easily past 40k, its Hermione/Tom Riddle/Abraxas/OFC. It's a time travel story where Hermione and surprisingly Narcissa Malfoy are BAMFS and go back to of course change Tom, but it's a very realistic take on the age old trope. I like that they know he will always be dark, they just try to make it so he gets to somewhere he'll be satisfied without actually killing and enslaving everybody else. It takes a few chapters to get to the smut, but once it does it's like 4K words of smut and it is really well-written. And the plot is also amazing. The story has a very good balance between great smut and complex plot. HIGHLY recommend. Hopefully the bot works, this is my first time trying to use it. Fingers crossed.

  Narcissa Malfoy is done with crazy, and she is determined to fix the mess her life has become. She has brains, a plan, and more than one dark spell to help her. But before she can put her plan into motion, she discovers a shocking secret about Hermione Granger, one that the girl doesn't even realize about herself. Before Hermione knows it, Narcissa has cursed them both, sending them back in time to deal with the Dark Lord in the form of the child Tom Riddle. Of course, Tom is no ordinary child, and time doesn't take kindly to being rewritten, so this will be a bumpy ride full of awesome, magical women, pragmatic decisions, and, rest assured, dear readers, plenty of sex eventually!
