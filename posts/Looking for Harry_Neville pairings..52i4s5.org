It seems to be a rare pairing but I like the idea quite a bit and drarry is starting to get old... Any good suggestions?


** I haven't read a good one (only a couple lame one-shots). Someone on this sub was going to write one awhile back but I haven't heard anything in a few months about it. For some good slash that isn't Drarry, I would suggest branching out to wolfstar - some of it is really amazing. If you'd like any wolfstar recs, let me know.

And for some Harry slash with unusual pairings, here are a couple recs:

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/979182/chapters/1927380][Cartographer's Craft]] - a DH-AU where 16 yr old sirius comes back somehow out of the marauders map. It is my first (and maybe my only) sirius/harry fic and because there wasn't an age-gap between them, I really liked it. Also the search for the horcruxes was believable and interesting. This is a really nice fic and I highly recommend it.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1875756/chapters/4040178][Tempus]] - a kinda "Drarry" fic - I loved this fic and definitely wasn't expecting to based on the summary. Most basically, it's an EWE canon-compliant, tightly written, time travel fic with a (somewhat) believable Harry/OC romance (the Draco in this is our Draco's great grandfather). Also there's an awesome mystery, a bunch of action and other plotty awesomeness.

  Did you ever wonder where the Hogwarts disappearing corridors go--or when? When Harry Potter finds himself at Hogwarts in 1927 he never expected that the first person he would run into would be... Draco Malfoy?? 85,000 words. Written for the "hp_cliche" challenge in 2006, run by ReganV. Beta-read by Miraba. Harry is magically transported back to Hogwarts in 1926, and until they find a way to return him to 1997, he is enrolled as a student. The very first student he meets is a blond Slytherin named Draco Malfoy. A time without Voldemort gives Harry the chance to learn things about magic and himself, but that era is not without certain evils. Mixes mystery, romance, action/adventure, and first-time smut. Nominated for a Multi-faceted Award. Additional warnings: Corporal punishment, teacher/student, consensual BDSM as well as dubious consent, torture, alcohol consumption.

*** Yeah sure I'd be interested in any recommendations. At this point I think I've read all I can handle of drarry for a while, though it's usually one of my top favorite pairings.

It's mostly wolfstar with some Snarry and a couple rare pairings.

I know youre sick of Drarry, but what are your favorites? I'm always looking for some new stuff to read (I think I've read almost everything worth reading in that ship).

** My favorite Harry/Neville is a smut fic. There's a plot more or less, but there's only 2 chapters, so it's not very developed. I really liked it because every sexual encounter is told by Harry taking tea with Ron and Hermione. The interactions between them are great and this Harry has a really good characterisation.

  I've always adored Harry's relationship with Ron and Hermione, and always found their conversations to be the best way to move any story along. I wanted to write something that was all about Harry explaining things to his friends. Talking it out with them, the way he did during school whenever some big event happened where they weren't present. What better way to do that, than over tea.---“Explain to us how it turned out that the two of you...” Hermione pursed her lips like she wasn't sure, but carried on anyways, “How it was that you ended up...”“Taking it up the bum.” Ron finished for her, and Hermione hit him on the arm again, “What?!”Harry sighed and tucked the pillow under his head, turning on his side to face his friends where they sat on the edge of their seats.

  After the war, Harry had retreated into the manor at Grimmauld Place and lived the life of a recluse. Neville had seen neither hide nor hair of him in the last few months -- the last year, even. Suddenly, Harry is back in his life, with a very strange request.
