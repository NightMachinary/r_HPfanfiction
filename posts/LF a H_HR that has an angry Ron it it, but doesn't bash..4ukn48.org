So, yea... basically what it says in the title. I'd like to read a story in which Harry and Hermione find together that has an angry Ron in it who isn't bashed.

I imagine Ron would be genuinely pissed at them both if they'd get together, and I'd like to read something like that.

Why? I don't know.

Ideally this fic plays out during the Hogwarts years.

** To not having it bashing, Ron would have to realize that H/Hr would happen. Otherwise there's no point.

**** I didn't mean that he would get over it immediately. But a non-bashing Ron in an H/Hr fic must have him by showing, at least later on, that he can be an individual without having to rely on Hermione and Harry constantly, for example getting in a relationship with someone who complements him and realizes his worth. That's obviously difficult to do in a 1000 word one-shot.
