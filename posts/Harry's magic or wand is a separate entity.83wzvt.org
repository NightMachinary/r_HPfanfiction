So like, the personification/essence of either his wand or his magic is an actual character as well?

No slash pls.

** This is the only fic I've ever actually READ where Harry's magic is a person, but it pisses me off in SO many ways. Going to post it here so you can try. Who knows? Maybe you'll like it. The story is titled "Harry Potter and the Manifesting Magic" and it is written by TrekTech.

That being said, I've heard a lot of good things about "Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome" so I recommend you make that priority. I still haven't read it though.

  A blind Harry Potter, at only three months of age, manifests his magic in a unique way. One of a kind in this regard, he finds that, for him, things are different than other magical users. With many challenges, Harry goes through his Hogwarts years, learning everything he can.

  Harry must have been lonely while living at the Dursley's. What if he wished a friend and it worked? "Inquisitive, unconventional Harry. Lots of humour" like someone said. Writing gets better later on, said another. In the end H/Hr, some N/L.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

  The process of reincarnation isn't perfect, especially when it comes to the reincarnation of a soul that was very old and powerful during its previous life. Harry is a living example of this phenomenon, but it is not as great a blessing as you might expect. Death always takes its toll, and it's a heavy one.
