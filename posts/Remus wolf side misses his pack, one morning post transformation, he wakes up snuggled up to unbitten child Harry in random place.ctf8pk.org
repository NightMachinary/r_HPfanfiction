Saw earlier post with Remus waking up in a field in Iowa, and thought of this. How Wolf!Remus misses his pack and kidnaps little child Harry. (Wolfy knows not to bite ofcourse!) Obv Remus panics upon waking up with little Harry :D

Edit; should have been child!harry in title, seems to have bugged out


** Remus woke to in a panic, seeing the child of his closest friend lying in his arms. After inspecting Harry to make sure he hadn't bitten him, Harry woke up.

"It's so cool! I didn't realize you could turn into a doggy and play fetch!"

Remus was flabbergasted. Only animals and transformed animagi were immune to the unnatural aggression of a werewolf. Yet here was a young child playing fetch with one.

** It is not Remus, but the premise in the beginning is similar. linkffn(No Competition)

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
