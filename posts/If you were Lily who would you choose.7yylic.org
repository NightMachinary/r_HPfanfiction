** If it had to be one of them, james over snape. I wish we got to see how their relationship evolved, because we dont see a lot of james's good side. i can only assume that he grew up quite a bit, really quickly, when he got that head boy badge, for her to fall for him. He wasnt particularly nice in the scenes we do see him.

*** Well Snape had to look good somehow, didn't he? Apparently JKR thought the best method was to villainize James.

Personally, I think Snape's redemption arc would've been better if it didn't include Lily. It actually casts his character into an even worse light.

I don't think that was really the point of writing James like she did. There are a lot of thorough analyses that propose that it's part of a big theme of the books: Harry learning to stop adolizing positive figures in his life.

His father whom he idolizes in the first book, and the Marauders who looked so fun, are suddenly revealed to have been bullies no better than Malfoy and his goons. Dumbledore, our neighborhood Grandfatherly Wise Old Mentor, was pals with Wizardhitler as a child and may or may not have set Harry up to die. Molly and the Weasleys may be nice, but Molly becomes overbearing and overprotective in /Order of the Phoenix/ and distinctly less fun.

***** Oh I know all of the characters had their own faults, Harry included (his capacity to forgive anything, though admirable, is one of them). But Snape's entire redemption arc was just villainizing James and Snape obsessing over Lily. The scene on the train wasn't even necessary, other than to show that Snape was racist. We already knew from OotP that the Marauders were bullies.

** Well, neither, to be very honest. But definitely James (if someone was holding a gun to my head...).

But I really don't like what we've seen of him, I can only assume that he went through some drastic changes (Well, I'd hope so for my own sake in this unfortunate situation).

Remus wouldn't be too bad, I suppose.

Sirius is said to have been very handsome but I'd probably end up murdering a man like him... edit: he actually tried to murder Snape and didn't seem to have... well, evolved from then (yes, there were admittedly extenuating circumstances. We don't know who he'd be if he hadn't been in Azkaban).

Andromeda Tonks and Marlene McKinnon are rather awesome in my Headcannon. But we don't know a lot about that generation...

** My problem is that when trying to create a Snape that you could emphasize with, JK sacrificed James' character. It was fine that she showed that Snape was bullied by James in school, but we never see James grow up and redeem himself. They say he did, but JK never shows it. And that makes him look like a terrible person who's only redeeming quality was that he sacrificed himself in the end, and while that's good, it's not enough to cancel out his behavior in school.

If I really had to pick, then Canon, I'd choose neither, Fanon, I'd choose James.

** Not hard to choose between the popular, good looking, funny guy who managed to mature and the ugly, infamous guy who like the dark arts and is friend with Death Eaters.

Both were bully, so we can really blame James for something Snape did too.

On another note, it really bother me that James take often the blame for bullying Snape in fanfics, when it's obvious that the memory we saw isn't the entire history.

*** I mean, I see where you're coming from, really.

But Snape chose to become a member of some sort of Nazi, terrorist group... if that isn't bullying?

Sure, even people like ‘that', can be reformed and redeemed.

But it takes much more to redeem yourself when you were part of a violent pro-genocide association (instead of a ‘simple' school yard bully).

**** I guess it's a matter of what was baseline personality. I don't know whether I buy it, but a lot would interpret that James' schoolyard bullying, unprompted and petty, was an expression of his /baseline character/, whereas Snape becoming a Death Eater was out of desperation and pressure from the other Slytherins; so that while Snape's actions as such may be worse than James's, they paint his character in a better light.

***** I see what you mean.

There are some other factors as well, imo.

Snape came from a very disadvantaged background, had an abusive father, was a halfblood and had one friend (whom he lost).

James had two parents, his parents seemed to have been decent (took in Sirius etc) was rich / wealthy-ish (definitely not poor), was well-liked, a Quidditch star, seemed to have had the school behind him when he bullied Snape and also ‘got' the girl...

It doesn't make him particularly sympathetic. Whilst we see Snape suffer through the whole 7 books.

However, wasn't Snape ok with letting Voldemort kill James and Harry? (Or am I mixing something up? There are some instances where fanfics have repeated something so often that it kind of seems to become part of canon, tbh..)

I guess it depends. But based on what Lily would have known when she was a 7th year?

James may have been very flawed (but could have changed for the better) whereas Snape was the wizarding version of an actual Nazi.... in a violent and active organisation. (And didn't seem to have shown any signs of change.)

Matter of interpretation again. Maybe he was self-centered to the last and would have killed Harry himself if he knew Lily was safe, but... I doubt it. It seems more to me that Lily was the best he could /get/ out of Voldemort. He knew Voldemort was going after Harry no matter what, and even if he asked for just "James and Lily" Voldemort might start to ask just why he wanted the two of them alive; whereas from Voldemort's dialogue in that scene, it sounds like Snape got him to avoid killing Lily by spinning it that he essentially wanted to ravish her.

******* Nah, I know that.

I thought there was a conversation with Dumbledore...?

it is however imo very clear that Snape's redemption was (‘always') based on Lily.

Edit: Which may - depending on the interpretation - imply that Snape might have still been a good little Death Eater, slaughtering people etc if Voldemort didn't try to kill that one person...

***** Snape was always fascinated by the dark arts (whether that's inherently bad depends on Interpretation / opinion...), was in a "gang" of Slytherin that became death eaters and their prejudice seems to have been obvious.

"“We are, Sev, but I don't like some of the people you're hanging round with! I'm sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he's creepy! D'you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?” Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face. “That was nothing,” said Snape. “It was a laugh, that's all-” “It was Dark Magic, and if you think that's funny-”

that's bullying.

"“It's too late. I've made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends - you see, you don't even deny it! You don't even deny that's what you're all aiming to be! You can't wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?” He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking. “I can't pretend anymore. You've chosen your way, I've chosen mine.” (Deathly Hallows, Chapter 33, The Prince's Tale).

He may not have been one yet but he didn't even deny that he wanted to be...

Yes, Rowlings said that it was about belonging etc.

However, would you expect a Jewish person to choose someone that wanted to join a violent neonazi group?

or a black person? Would you expect them to "choose" someone that felt this way about the KKK? was in a school gang that didn't seem to hide their prejudice (too much)?
