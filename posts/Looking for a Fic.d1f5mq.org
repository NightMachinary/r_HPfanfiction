:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
i can't recall the title or author, but i remember a few details.

a young Harry (Pre-Hogwarts) runs away from the Durselys, something about him living in a zoo in secret, before he makes his way to africa where he becomes an apprentice to a witch doctor.

also something about discovering King Solomon's mine, and both Harry and the Witch Doctor are Nundu Animagus's.


** This just sounds hilarious.

  Humorous, post GOF tale. Harry goes to Africa and sets up a potions ingredient business. Wackiness ensues.
