Other than "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" and "Quidditch Through the Ages" of course.

I'm re-reading Sorcerer's Stone and going through that school supply list for Hogwarts has me fascinated!

Thank you in advance.


** I wrote a segment of a chapter of a transfiguration textbook here:

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1piVBUEGB6NUjcW0Dmn8U2tHGoJvrkHmF4QYQWs2S1tk/edit?usp=drive_web]]

There's a lot I'd change about it if I did it again now but it achieved my main aim of alluding to complexity without making it into a science analogue.

To be clear, since this is an excerpt from a second chapter you're not supposed to be able to fully understand it. It is supposed to be illustrative of what a textbook could look like rather than explanatory to someone from a Muggle perspective.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4si8qe/has_anyone_written_a_scientific_work_for_the/][This thread]] talked about science/magic textbooks. My response is the same to you:

#+begin_quote
  There is a bunch of blogs on specific topics, most of which no longer updated, but have a lot in archive:

  [[http://departmentsofmysteries.tumblr.com/][FIELD NOTES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES]] is little like a cross between [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/][SCP]] and Harry Potter. It isn't 'science' as such, but worth a look.

  [[http://wizardhistory.tumblr.com/][WIZARD HISTORY]] has some great 'explanations' of magic aimed at a muggle audience.

  [[http://livesandliesofwizards.tumblr.com/][Notes from the wizard world]] is more blog then text book in feel, but again, might be worth a look.

  [[http://thepostmodernpottercompendium.tumblr.com/][The Postmodern Potter Compendium]] may be a little too flowery in prose, but it might help too.

  [[http://themonsterblogofmonsters.tumblr.com/][The Monster Blog of Monsters]] is pretty self explanatory.

  Probably not what you are looking for, but there are also a number of wizard fashion tumblrs as well: [[http://amortentiafashion.tumblr.com/][Amortentia]] is the largest I think, but [[http://wizardfashion.tumblr.com/][Wizard Fashion]] still updates.

*** Nice! Thanks for the suggestions. I'll check out the wizard fashion blogs too. Everything surrounding the culture is fascinating to me.

** This is not really a fanfiction, but there's a site called Hogwarts is Here that lets you take Hogwarts classes and has textbooks and you can write essays, and generally roleplay as a Hogwarts student.

** Well, I was once considering writing a "Strategies in Cursebreaking Tombs" sort of thing, but

A) don't have the time

B) would probably piss more people off than would enjoy it
