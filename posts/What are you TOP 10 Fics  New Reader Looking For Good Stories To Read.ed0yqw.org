** The Sinister Man's /Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/ ( linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]) ) has masterful worldbuilding, characterization, and plotting.

Saphroneth's /Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay/ ( [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/]] , linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/Harry-Is-A-Dragon-And-That-s-Okay]]) ) feels like it could have been written by Roald Dahl by its tone, but that doesn't stop it from having intricate worldbuilding and interesting deviations from canon plot-wise.

*** Prince of Slytherin is fantastic. It has relatively regular updates, and a very active discord where you can get early access to new chapters. It is easily my favorite fic. The world-building and intricate plot make it a great fic

**** Today is your lucky day, here is a list of 10 more stories I like a lot

linkffn(13323518) *Ice Cream* is Harry and Daphne one-shot that is really sweet

linkffn(13451229) *Silence is Golden* is a really good one-shot that I just found and also very sweet.

linkffn(13274956) *Harry Potter, Squatter* is also a very good story a crossover with Percy Jackson. The story focuses on Harry growing up with the gods which makes it a super endearing story.

linkffn(12282305) *Uncle Harry* another story that revolves around Harry being great with kids that is very good.

linkffn(12459242) *Serpentine* is an interesting story of Harry creating a Basilisk and rasing it, involves a Harry interested in magical creatures which I always find fun.

linkffn(13275504) *Harry Potter and the Vanishing Princess* is an interesting Harry and Daphne story that focuses on a post-war world. A very fun and interesting story

linkffn(11547735) *Amicus Protectio Fortis* is an interesting story about the DA being started early and turning something bigger than a simple club. Sadly incomplete but highly worth the read.

linkffn(10071063) *The Assassin Wore White* is a story different from everything else I have recommended here, but it offers a different side to healers that is super interesting.

linkffn(12414949) *Black coffee, with sugar* is a good story about Harry and Daphne that is also well-written

linkffn(11260631) *A Different Sort of Bond* another well-written story that I believe is worth being recommended, again it is a Harry and Daphne story (which I seem to like a lot if you haven't guessed by now lol).

I hope this list has something you like on it and I guess if you ever want more recommendations just dm me or something.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

/She doesn't know the world, or herself, but she'll always know the boy who meets her in a washed-out King's Cross Station./

/Even when he starts coming to her in pieces./

This is an amazing story about a girl suffering from severe mental disabilities, how she copes with them, fails to cope with them, overcomes them, and sometimes how they even can be of benefit. I have a special place in my heart for protagonists who have disabilities of any sort, and this one is truly something special. Warning, check the tags and warnings carefully.

/Salazar Slytherin stumbles into the future a thousand years ahead of his time, just as Hogwarts is getting ready to host the Tri-Wizard tournament. His arrival causes havoc not only for himself but for the modern magical world. He's a bit of a mess, and a relic, and a problem, and everyone has an angle he needs to understand./

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/977214][The Accidental Animagus Universe]]*

When Harry escapes the Dursleys at the young age of five due to an extraordinary bout of accidental magic, he sets in motion a series of events he and his new adoptive family the Grangers could not begin to imagine. Features politics, the International Confederation of Wizards, Grand Warlocks aside from Albus Dumbledore, and Dark Lords and Ladies from all over the world, and a story that is all but unmatchable in terms of scope and epic possibility.

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16186133/chapters/37823456][Black Pride]]*

/The portrait of Cygnus Black I that hung in the Ministry reported that her firstborn had been sent to Azkaban without any trial whatsoever. It made Walburga furious. Not on His behalf, of course, but because of the utter disrespect shown to a scion of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. How dare they? If she let them get away with it, then next time those filthy blood traitors might think it was perfectly fine to treat that way a worthy member of the House of Black. After all, it had set a precedent. A bad precedent. It mustn't be allowed./

/Or, Walburga Black saves Sirius from Azkaban, and it changes everything./

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1036611][The Black Sheep Dog]]*

/Regulus Black survives his adventure in the cave and brings the locket to an unlikely ally: his estranged older brother. The ex-Death Eater strikes a bargain with Dumbledore, cooperation in exchange for his family's safety. Sirius Black is faced with his toughest mission yet: managing Walburga and Orion Black---who, to his surprise and dismay, decide they rather enjoy having both of their sons back, and very quickly scheme to make this temporary family reunion permanent./

/Or: the story of how one night completely changed the course of the war and Sirius's life./

Tom Riddle thought he was through with witches once he escaped Merope. Enter Hermione Granger, who brings him his newborn son and news of his ex-wife's death. While Hermione's only goal may be to make sure Tommy Riddle Jr. grows up loved and happy, the Riddles have a different thought in mind. After all, there's an entire world and economy out there that don't know the importantance of the Riddle name! This is unacceptable. When Tom is through with them, the wizarding world will never be the same.

/Petunia drips magic the way she drips anger. Sparingly. Subtly. Nothing overt or obnoxious. Nothing that attracts the stares of other children or the suspicion of adults. Just things that help her. Her dolls line back up after the football Lily was kicking about ruins their perfect symmetry. Her bed makes itself while she brushes her teeth meticulously. Tea that is slightly too hot or too cold settles to the perfect temperature. Magic maintains the realm of order she has built around herself./

/(A witch!Petunia and muggle!Lily AU, covering the Marauders' years at Hogwarts and the First Wizarding War)./

/Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he meets Harry's friends, discovers some fascinating wizarding adult beverages - and meets Cho Chang, who has her own reasons to find herself out of place and drinking heavily at the wedding of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley. In the months to come, this unlikely encounter will make him rethink his attitudes towards the magical world, drastically change the course of both of their lives, and change Dudley's relationship with his family forever./

Or, the fic that made me realize I ship Cho Chang with Dudley Dursley holy crap.

/Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."/

Lavender Brown accidentally interrupts a last gasp time-travel ritual, and finds herself flung back to 1947. She has to find somewhere to live, something to do, and some way to keep Tom Riddle from figuring out who the hell she is. Sure would be nice if he were less handsome. Oh, there's also some weird murder mystery going on that she keeps spouting prophecies on, she should probably figure that out to.

**** I never thought I'd love a fic centered on Petunia, and In the language of Flowers proved I have no idea what I would or wouldn't like. I'm so glad you enjoyed it as much as I did! I seriously recommend anything written by that author tbh, they have 2 other HP fics, and if they've written for other fandoms you like you should definitely check it out.

** Here's me list, but don't judge me for some. I only somewhat recently discovered fan fiction so I've kind of checked everything out.

Linkffn(The mind arts) - Harry is intelligent and can play the mind like a fiddle as he starts hogwarts.

Linkffn(in the mind of a scientist) - fuck did I love this trilogy, also wish it wasn't dropped. Super genius and eventual OP Harry.

Linkffn(Gods amongst men) - one of my favorites though I think it's no longer updated. OP Harry with eventual royalty.

Linkffn(De aged) - The doctor gets de-aged with captain jack, and both go to hogwarts.

Linkffn((Harry Potter and the game) - I know this and some others are mostly a copy of the Gamer web series but man did I enjoy this. I hope it's eventually continued.

Linkffn(Rise of wizards) - fairly unique, eventual OP Harry but through hard work as well.

Linkffn(Basilisk born) - time travel but done right in my opinion.

** Half of these are a copypasta from other comments I made:

Most of these are either Hinny, Peggy Sues or both.

1.  Hiatus/Abandoned: Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54]] is my favourite fic, period. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but Sovran takes the idea and makes a gripping and emotional retelling of Hogwarts. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. The bond's mechanics are developed early and have a complete set of pros and cons that don't derail the story into wish-fulfillment, it even addresses puberty in a way that is in-depth yet mature and reasonable. Seriously, I could and have gushed and gushed about this fic for hours, so I'll stop myself now.

2.  Ongoing: Before I read, Meaning of One, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian [[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry%5C_potter%5C_and%5C_the%5C_nightmares%5C_of%5C_futures%5C_past/index/][https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry\_potter\_and\_the\_nightmares\_of\_futures\_past/index/]] was my favourite fic. It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Essentially he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore.

3.  Ongoing: Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay by Saphroneth [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/reader/]] linkffn(13230340) was my introduction to HP fanfics, since I was reading Saphroneth's other works before then. And it's a good introduction. It's a crack story where Harry is a dragon. Not a dragon animagus an actual dragon. The idea is taken to its logical and hilarious extremes that somehow still make perfect sense. Original plotlines are derailed constantly, only for a new slice-of-life comedy to take its place that adheres to and closely examines canon and side-content to come to new and innovative conclusions. Starring: a Black-Backed Bookwyrm, a club of "Oddly Shaped Students," Astronaut!Ron, Neville whacking things with an iron pipe, Velociraptor!Hermione, the best interpretation of Dumbledore ever, and a very confused Draco.

4.  Finished: This goddamn cryfest by The Seeker. Saving Harry [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417]] takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you're not endlessly wallowing in sadness.

5.  Ongoing: Inspired by linkffn(10610076) Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is by Tsume Yuki, ravenclawblues' The Heir Of House Black linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922]]) is another Peggy Sue, however Harry is born as Turais Black, the elder brother to Sirius and Regulus. If you've read Galleons, it's a far more in depth version of that, going into the events of each year, that really emulates the style of canon with mysteries. The original characters are memorable and provide interesting parallels to canon. It's just an overall good quality fic.

6.  Ongoing: Now for something that isn't Hinny, but Drarry. The Time Twister series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/670418]] starting with Draco Malfoy and the Resurrection Stone linkao3(10021610) by YouAreMyHappilyEverAfter. It's a Draco Malfoy Peggy Sue from after the war where he regrets everything he did and goes back in time to be friends with Harry and help him out. Only it turns out to be a lot more friendly than he intended. What I love about the fic is just all the wholesome feels that come from it.

7.  Abandoned: I love the concept of Forced Maturity by pseudonym. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127442]] It's a post-Half-Blood Prince Harry Peggy Sue, but the twist is that Harry loses all his memories of the future. So he's got all of 16-year-old Harry's magical abilities, muscle memory, and emotional associations, with no explanation as to why he has any of them. There are a couple things I take issue with like the whole age line thing and the fact it's abandoned after the end of CoS. I mostly love it for the idea which has plenty more room for exploration, and the Hinny because I'm trash.

8.  Ongoing: Magical Metamorphosis by Eon_the_Dragon_Mage linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063298/chapters/24670002]]) is a Transgirl Harry or “Holly” fic that I think is the best of its kind. The fic actually goes in depth on the Trans experience, focusing on gender dysphoria, the reactions of the Hogwarts students and general public, and the struggle it takes to achieve a trans person's preferred body. Also the fic has the absolute miracle of creating a good and friendly relationship between Holly and Rita Skeeter. As in, they even go shopping together. It's surreal yet makes perfect sense.

9.  Ongoing: PadfootIsMyHomeDawg's Parsel linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6146470/chapters/14082718]]) is a story where instead of going to the Dursley's, Harry, dubbed Silas, leaves the doorstep in the morning of November First in a snake animagus form to live among other snakes. After he has been missing for 10 years, he's discovered by Fred and George in the Forbidden Forest. It's a Harmony fic, cute as heck, and a cool exaggeration of Harry being a fish out of water, having to learn magic and how to be human at the same time.

10. Finished: In Care Of by Fang's Fawn, linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/In-Care-Of]]) is a fic where Harry finds an injured bat in the Dursley's back garden and decides to nurse it back to health. What he doesn't know, is that the bat is actually Snape. A heartbreaking story about Severus learning about how spoilt Harry really is, and he's pissed at it all.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Weekly to biweekly updates on Friday/ Saturday.

** Everyone has probably read most of these, but here are my top favorites, in no particular order (except for #1):

1.) Resonance by GreenGecko - linkffn(1795399)

I'm going to keep recommending this until everyone reads it X)

Features a powerful Harry (eventually) with believable growth and original powers. Well written, just give it a few chapters for it to hit its stride. Comes with 2 sequels and shit gets unreal.

2.) The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter - linkffn(7613196)

Someone else recommended this and I've already fallen in love. Its 3 sequels are just as amazing as the first book. Features a complete redux of where each year feels completely unique and with different events / trials (but similar) from the original books. Highly highly recommend.

3.) Rose Petal Red by NonchalantXFish - linkao3(Rose Petal Red by NonchalantXFish)

One of the best Self-Insert fics I've read. I loved learning more about slytherin dynamics and the OCs that were created were memorable and unique -- just like the premise of the story. Ginny (the SI) is an actual seer, but changing things have severe consequences and she has to learn to find a balance to make sure everyone makes it out alive in the adventures that occur.

4.) The Train to Nowhere by MayMarlow - linkao3(The Train to Nowhere by MayMarlow)

Still a work in progress and very slow build, but I love seeing a society aftermath where Riddle won the war. Harry goes to Durmstrang, starts developing some odd powers, gains the notice of Riddle. They have an interesting dynamic and not only is it a well written fic, it's teeming with originality -- plot and powers-wise.

5.) The Arithmancer by WhiteSquirrel - linkffn(10070079)

I'm a sucker for technical writing that applies real-world fundamentals to magic. I love this story because the author uses higher level mathematics to explain spell and ritual creation in such an exciting way. (Plus a love a good Hermione)

6.) Significant Digits by adeebus - linkffn(11174940)

I know HPMOR gets a wide range of reactions, but it still holds a place in my heart for the sheer creativity of it. Imo this sequel takes all of its potential and transforms it into something amazing. Lots of fucking awesome plot twists and I think it definitely is a feasible and believable continuation. The level of writing is even better than HPMOR and if you just give it a chance, it'll surprise you.

7.) Hogwarts Battle School by Kwan Li - linkffn(8379655)

I love Enders Game and I love HP, so this story is my guilty pleasure. Hogwarts gets turned into a Battle School with simulations run daily in the Room of Requirement. They are trying to train the students and cultivate leaders for the eventual battle against voldemort whenever he returns. The story is a series of escalations that keep you on the edge of your seat.

8, 9, & 10 - probably the main Firefly crossover, main Marvel crossover, and toss in a good timetravel fic.

** The first intro into HPFiction was Harry Potter and the Summer of Change, which I thought was awesome. I loved the unspeakable aspect of the story, but the constant tropes were a little annoying with harry constantly voicing "I'm my own person now". But definitely my favorite aspect of the story was the world-building with the Potter family vault and the involvement of the Head Goblin of Gringotts with Harry. Then the Potter estate part was great as well. I would have loved to have found a sequel to this story where it would talk about the 2nd war at Hogwarts and the aftermath of the war for the wizarding world and how Harry progresses in both the political and unspeakable spheres within this story.

So if anyone has any more unspeakable Fics that they would recommend that would be awesome, but I'm definitely going to check out a bunch of these stories
