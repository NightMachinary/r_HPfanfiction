I've been trying to remember this fic where Sirius ended up with a muggle wife for months now. I think it was a 3 part, complete, and the wife had a connection to Harry. Its been years since I've read it.


** It could be also linkffn(9739418), which is not that excellent prequel to very excellent linkffn(9566537).

  What if Harry had waited ten more minutes and said goodbye to the waitress in HP/HBP? Prequel, "What We Had," is now up on my page!

**** Oh well, I have to admit I survived all the way to chapter 16, when Sirius kisses Maggie against (or at least without) her will, and she suddenly hopelessly falls in love with him. Yuck! Is there such thing as a kiss-rape?

And what's even worse, not ONE comment on that chapter was questioning it! Wow! Is it me?
