I am writing a fanfic where Voldemort is never killed by a reflected curse, but the Aurors, who are later famous for it, interrupt the ritual that the Dark Lord was doing then. Sirius, who was part of this group, finds the child at Lestrange Manor and, knowing he is an orphan (it was probably the child of Bellatrix and Rudolphus, or so Sirius thought), and gave it to James and Lily, who, using a blood adoption ritual, they accepted him into their family. Harrison Potter, when he turns ten, learns that they are not his real parents and despite the fact that he knows that the Potters love him. On his fourth year, he confronts them because he wanted to know them are his parents. While doing a blood test in Gringottt, he learns that his father is Tom Marvolo Riddle, who apparently died in 1955, and that his mother is the famous criminal Bellatrix Lestrange. Not knowing how to deal with it, he tries to find out more about his family.

First of all, I need to patch up the storyline and character of the characters. I know for sure that Harry will be a little different than in the Canon, and most of all I want to weave the effects of conception under the love eliskar by his father somewhere in it. I wish it had some effect on him too, but I'm not sure yet what.

- I don't know what his attitude towards Tom's son would be. Would he be cold or perhaps caring? Maybe he would like to take revenge on the Potters for taking his son from him. At this point, I definitely need some help.
- There is also a matter with his siblings. I mean, Elleanore and he are very close, but on the other hand, he also has Seth and Mark Potter. They are both twins and one of them is said to be very wary of Harry after news that their brother is not their brother at all. Can anyone help me think of reasons besides the most obvious ones?
- I also need a good idea of the Marauder's friendship as adults. It is clear that they are starting their own families and I am torn between taking them apart a little and leaving their relationship alone.
- Lastly, there's Harry and his feelings for his first family. Will he continue to be disgusted with their deeds as he was, or would he seek a second bottom? Would he like to meet his mother and father? Or would he like to hide at all costs?

I know this is my story to write and I should eventually make it all up. But I'm honestly new to writing any fics and mine are already written in the cupboard waiting for me to correct them.

So can anyone help?


** Honestly? Everything depends on where do you want to go with this story. How does Harry learn about not being the Potters' son? Why did James and Lily adopt Harry, if they could have their own kids? How did the Potters react to Harry's true parentage? Is Voldemort insane and evil because Tom Riddle was evil and a bit insane from the beginning or maybe when he regains his sanity, he would try to repent for his evil deeds? Honestly, you can go in so many different directions with that idea, that it's insane.

About the effects of love potion on Harry, it could make him less emotional? Like he can still feel the full range of emotions, yet they are muted.

About one of the siblings, it honestly depends again on where do you want to take this story and how old is that sibling. It also depends on the type of relationship Harry had with them, because if Harry already seemed unfeeling towards anyone, then maybe that sibling felt like Harry was planning on betraying the Potter family, or something similar.

On the topic of Marauders, make them have their own lives, yet still treating each other like brothers. So they will meet each other often and do some pranks. Of course said pranks would be more mature than how they acted in school, but let them have fun at each other or people around them.

On the topic of Harry, again it depends. Does he still wants to be a part of the Potter family? Does he meet up with Bellatrix to learn about his biological mother and maybe ask her about his biological father?

So to summarize it all, everything depends on where you want to take that story.

Also, please don't change Harry's name into Harrison. It just makes him sound more edgy. Moreover, Harry is perfectly fine and normal name and Harrison sounds more like a name for Harry's son, so if you really want to somehow utilize it, then give it to, well Harry's future son.
