:FlairText: Prompt
:END:
I'm an aspiring author who has gotten back to writing stories after 4 years when I was pretty young. Now, I want to start writing again. I'm looking for some prompts to get creative, so please drop a prompt. No romance though. I will look for prompts which are only about Harry Potter as the main character.


** In his will, Sirius Black transferred the guardianship over Harry to Nymphadora Tonks. Harry and the Order are unaware of this until his new "mother" picks him up from Privet Drive and takes him to /their/ flat somewhere in London.

It would be fun to watch the reactions of Harry, especially while Tonks is completely unaware of what being a mother is like, so they fumble their way to a state which works for both. And given that Tonks "lacks the ability to behave" some of her rules would be rather odd and unnecessary for Harry, like for example "only four cans of beer each day" or "don't bring anyone home while I'm working night-shifts".

*** That's a pretty good idea! I'm seriously considering writing this. Maybe it'd be a one or two-shot though. But I can see the potential to develop it way further. If a more experienced author wrote this, it would be a blast!

**** It's actually a different spin on a WIP of mine. I was thinking about Harry getting a girlfriend with a certain fanon expectation (Japanese OC in this case) and then completely ignore those because I am fed up with the whole "you can summarise a character with a trope and be right 10 times out of 10" thing you see so often when Harry is paired either with a pureblood or a girl/woman from a certain culture. And Tonks is there as his "mother" to oversee things.

****** WIP on my GDrive. One out of many oneshots I write when I don't feel like working on my main stories.

*** /Epilogue-/

​

/Ronald Bilius Weasley, Hermione Jean Granger, Albus too-many-names Dumbledore, and a host of unimportant side-characters gather for the grim funeral of a young Harry James Potter, who was condemned to death by people who believe in magical cores./

​

/"It's like we only knew him for days!" Wept young Granger, as she spoke the truth./

/"Yeah!" That was all young Weasley was able to muster, due to the immense amount of food in his mouth, as a substitute for drinking his sorrows away./

/"Harry, my boy, my boy, my boy, my boy... Forgive an old man for his fallacies," Ruminated old Dumbledore./

​

/Suddenly, a fiery red-haired witch who suspiciously looked like the deceased Potter's mother sprinted up to the podium, as she said between gasps of disbelief- "No, Harry! I haven't even come to school yet, no!"/

​

/An older version of the red-haired witch strode onto the scene- "Young lady! What have I told you about giving me and Arthur the bird and flooing away!" She dragged the witch away, muttering sternly./

​

/Everybody bowed, as a young man with a 'bright' future was put to rest. A young boy with geekish devotion took photos of the coffin and the snitch determinedly, proving some unknown point to himself./

​

/The sunset appeared at the perfect time, just as everybody had paid their respects to the young man, further motivating people into thinking that the deceased boy had proceeded into the next 'great adventure' while remaining in their hearts forever./

** Grown up Harry Potter is involved in an incident that causes accidental time travel to the Marauder era, maybe around the time his parents start 7th year. After unsuccessfully trying to find out what had happened and trying to get back where he came from, he realized that an alternative timeline has been created after he went back in time and everything that happened after he arrived would basically happen in an alternate universe to his own (canon).

He then proceeds to change the past, maybe joining Dumbledore and the order and hunting Horncruxes, trying to talk sense into Regulus and the Marauders. Dispite his uncanny similarity to James he could pass as some distant lost relative of his, even use his real name since he hadn't even been thought of yet in that time.
