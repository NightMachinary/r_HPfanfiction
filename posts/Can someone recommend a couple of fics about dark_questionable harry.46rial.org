Does not have to be full on evil (although that would be okay too), mainly looking for something where Harry is willing to do some morally questionable things to achieve his goal.

Reddit silver for anyone that recommends one with H/FD or H/HG pairing. Even more bonus points for being long/complete. Thanks in advance.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

** I like dark/grey Harry stories.

*Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106): it's really Harrymort, and he managed to corrupt both Hermione and Ginny. But the story itself is already a classic!

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005): H/Hr. Hermione is really the ruthless one here, but Harry nevertheless supports her 100%.

*Hail Odysseus*, linkffn(10645463): Slytherin Harry and Ginny fight against almost everyone, very unconventional ending.

*Emperor*, linkffn(5904185): Harry is pretty much a dark lord here as he is willing to sacrifice countless lives to achieve his ambition.

Time traveling Harry is often much darker than in canon, usually as a result of suffering a lot more:

In *Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650), the Azkaban execution scene was quite memorable.

In *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), he threw fiendfyre and imperious curse at will.

In *Returning to Start*, linkffn(10687059), he killed so many that it took several years for Hermione to love him again.

Then there is the *Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650). The author has done some thing very audacious, and the story has taken an extremely dark turn. It's still WIP, and I'm very curious in knowing How Harry will respond to this new development.

**** While there are valid complaints to be made about it (that summer, kind of rushed ending) they are overlooking two brilliant things.

1. Dumbledore. This Dumbledore is great, and you don't realize until the end because of Harry's paranoia.

B. I think this might be the most interesting Voldemort I've run across in the last few years.

** I'm going to include Descent into Darkness by Athey.

Sorry - I don't know how to do spoiler blocks so...

It's well written but... It has one really, really horrible scene where dark magic is used to torture and kill someone, and then a little later Voldemort's philosophy is explained as being the solution to /saving/ muggles.

The cognitive dissonance is unbelievable. Plus there's totally unnecessary slash.

But it's still worth reading.

  There is a reason why everyone wants a piece of Harry Potter; the twelve-year-old is considered a prodigy by the Wizarding World, after all. But Harry has chosen his side. The Headmaster and Minister of Magic can try as they might - Harry is a dark wizard. Now...if only he could get in touch with the elusive, recently resurrected Voldemort. Sequel to Enveloped in the Darkness.
