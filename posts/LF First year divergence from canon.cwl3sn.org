Saw a post on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] about how Bane was furious Firenze saved Harry's life and he should have let Voldemort kill him. Are there any fics where the centaurs don't interrupt and Voldemort destroys the Harry horcrux in first year? Would be interesting to see how the story pans out without Harry getting visions or having his 'get out of dying free card' still up his sleeve later on.


** It seems like all that would do is move up the showdown with Quirrell --- Harry blistering Quirrell's face and arm, Quirrell screaming while Voldemort's unable to really do anything.

*** Interesting thought, would an AK from a possessed quirrell count as 'dying at the hands of the other?'

**** Well, Quirrell didn't try to use the Killing Curse on him at the end of the book, so I'm not sure he would've used it on him in the middle.

***** If dobby/hagrid can happen in fanfic then quirrell getting trigger happy is entirely possible.

****** Yeah, but you're asking for canon divergence. Quirrellmort was smart enough to try to kill Harry in a stadium full of people, wandlessly and nonverbally. Voldemort would be smart enough to try to make it look like death by creature as he does not want to alert Dumbledore even more than he has.

** There's a lot of factors in the surviving the killing curse thing, but basically none of them exist in Philosophers Stone. The main factor though, is Voldemort having Harry's blood (containing Lily's sacrifice). If Voldemort killed Harry in Philosophers Stone then Harry would simply die, no second chance

** This one is new and being proofed on Caer Azkaban. Chapter 3 should be out soon.

What if Dudley wasn't an only child. What if a gift of Lily to her sister, along with the wards protecting Harry resulted lots of children in a household full of love instead of resentment. What if the wards were more powerful the more family that lived under them, What if the protection imparted by Lily to her son, also was imparted to those new magical children
