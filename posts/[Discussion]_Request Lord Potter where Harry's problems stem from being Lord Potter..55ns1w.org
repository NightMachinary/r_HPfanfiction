So I know Lord Potter usually entails a super!Harry, but I'm trying to write a Harry Potter/Skyrim fusion with Harry being a Lord or Jarl depending on where I decide to set the story.

What I'm looking for is other fics that have Harry as a Lord being more trouble than it's worth almost or Harry has to rebuild his holdings.\\
Also if you have any thoughts on what problems his hold could be facing aside from no funds and bandits everywhere or meshing the two worlds, I'd love the advice.

Thanks in advance.


** I've had a crackfic idea where Harry inherits a lot of weird obligations dating back centuries, in some cases. You could easily adapt that - as Lord X, he has to provide his liege with one White Mountain Goat each year. Sadly, they are said to be extinct. He is also responsible for the protection of a family/village/whatever who is invlved in a blood feud with its neighbours. Then there are the obligations to his direct liege, and to the liege Lord of his liege. Further, hospitality laws are very specific and very archaic in his holdings - he has to provide visitors of a certain rank with rather exotic goods and services, on demand.

*** I like the hospitality rules idea. Kinda hard to have fresh X or Y on hand at all times.

**** Or archaic Services - chariot-maker, for example - that were once useful, but haven't been used in centuries. And maybe they are not used anymore, but Harry still thinks he has to provide them because no one bothered to change the laws.

***** Speaking of archaic laws, check out this [[http://justsomething.co/the-22-most-ridiculous-us-laws-still-in-effect-today-2/][link]]

Nobody bothers to enforce them anymore, and if any idiot tries to apply them, the judges are likely to throw them out and the legislature will repeal them. Even if one judge is stupid enough to let it go to trial, it still faces appeals court, state supreme court, and The Supreme Court. In real world, we do have plenty of safeguards against stupid laws.

****** Those laws aren't that ridiculous, the rabbit one is probably to protect the wildlife and polygamy is a problem in Utah, but the most serious one is the one is the last. In the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest, dwells the strange and beautiful creature known as Bigfoot, perhaps. Sadly, logging and human settlement today threaten what might possibly be his habitat. Although if it's not, they don't. Bigfoot populations require vast amounts of land to remain elusive in. They typically dwell just behind rocks but are also sometimes playful, bounding into thick fogs and out-of-focus areas. Remember, it's up to us. Bigfoot is a crucial part of the ecosystem, if he exists. So let's all help keep Bigfoot possibly alive for future generations to enjoy unless he doesn't exist. Of course Washington would have a Bigfoot law.

** Since Vikings (and medieval Scandinavia) are /the/ inspiration for Nords, I'd suggest learning a bit more about their social structure for some ideas of what things might pop up in the plot. It's interesting to see the interlaced obligations at work in such a system, even if /Skyrim/ is a more "modernized" version of it, if that's the right word for it. Minus the thralls.

It's much easier to find out the duties of medieval lords, and just as insightful regarding the large amount of roles and work that went into managing land.

Not everything is going to translate to Tamriel's various cultures, but it can be tweaked or used as inspiration for existing canon.

I'd suggest starting with some of the links at the [[http://www.sca.org/links/misc.html][SCA]], in particular [[https://regia.org/research.php][Regia Anglorum]] which focuses on "Viking Britain." Similarly, give [[http://www.hurstwic.org/history/text/history.htm][Hurstwic]] a look.

Some other helpful resources:

- [[http://home.olemiss.edu/%7Etjray/medieval/feudal.htm][Feudal Terminology]] and [[http://home.olemiss.edu/%7Etjray/medieval/manorial.htm][Manorial Language]] - Focused on Britain, but helpful for giving you an idea of just how much stuff was involved in running an estate.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_household][Medieval Household]] - Wikipedia, I know, but actually well-written for a tl;dr version. Check the links in the "See Also" section as well.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages][Early Middle Ages]] - Seems to be the inspiration for the game's current era.

- [[http://www.medievalists.net/tag/early-middle-ages/][More Early Middle Ages Stuff]] - A mixture of reviews about books and movies interspersed with various topics at Medievalists. Pain to sort through, but informative.

- [[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Main_Page][UESP]] - *The* resource for all things /Elder Scrolls/, especially lore. Helpful for fleshing out the background.

One thing I'd like to add: Religion plays a big role in /Skyrim's/ plot, complete with its moments of awe or horror ... but you never wholly get the feeling that worship is this profound, pervading thing like it was for real-life early medieval peoples. With gods you can literally talk to, religion really needs to hold more weight in everyday activities for the setting.

It's the one thing that a lot of original fantasy fiction forgets, never mind fan fiction. Including it will instantly give another layer to the worldbuilding.

And who can resist leaving out Sheogorath anyway?

*** Thanks, I'll look into that.

I think that it would work better if the setting was in Skyrim and the characters came from the Potterverse. Make it more of a Skyrim fanfic though. Still have Voldemort and the Death Eaters to fit in somewhere Skyrim friendly, but Skyrim is know for dark mages.

I'm not actually sure of my ability to write Sheogorath, so I don't think he'll be making a big appearance. Do have plans for Nocturne though.

**** You could try and make him become a Lord of the dark mages and have to unite them. I can see that being an issue. He struggles with doing dark magic and whatnot, but when he inherited something, an old agreement was to unite a clan of mages that have now gone bad. You could even make it the Dark Brotherhood.
