  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** I like linkffn(3160980) Hindsight for a fairly quick read (for a do-over, they tend to run long). And seeing Snape call himself an idiot never gets old.

** Linkffn(Thirty-One Days)

Linkffn(Fade to Grey) and [[http://www.grangerenchanted.com/enchant/viewstory.php?sid=4912][alternate link]]

Linkffn(3135350)

Linkffn(7843043) is Severus going forward in time

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=22192][Consequences of Meddling with Time]] and [[http://www.grangerenchanted.com/enchant/viewstory.php?sid=3968][alternate link]]. Summary: Hermione Granger is given a Time-Turner and instructions to use it. Only, using a Time-Turner can be a little tricky if not used correctly: a mistake made in counting or a slip of the fingers can make the user jump irregularly, and thus she could accidentally alter her time line. And when such an accident happens, Severus Snape uses Hermione's Time-Turner in order to fix a horrific wrong. However, it's his younger self who becomes the one who must ensure that history is not altered.

  Hermione and Harry have the chance to change the world, though things aren't always what they seem. It is a time turner story but give it a chance. Also a HG SS ship. A bit a/u all things considered. Chapter 34 is up!

  In the midst of the Battle of Hogwarts Hermione is given the opportunity to help save Snape's life. Little did she know it would require visiting Hogwarts twenty years prior. She has thirty-one days to befriend the sullen Slytherin, and perhaps save his life. But, as always, things don't always go as planned. HG/SS, time-travel, EWE
