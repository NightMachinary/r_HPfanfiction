Hey HPfic!

To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Philosopher's Stone, [[https://www.trylore.com][Lore]] is hosting an HP fan fiction contest! Whoever writes the chat/dialogue fic with the most likes will win a $200 Amazon gift card. There will also be two runner-up prizes, of $50 each.

All you have to do to enter is [[https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1253260341][download the app]] and write a new Harry Potter story. Anything posted between now and Wednesday, July 12 is eligible. No strings attached -- we're doing this because we have thousands of readers on the app, but not nearly enough writers. :)

Let me know if you have any questions! Mods, I hope it's okay to post this here. It's definitely blatant self-promotion, but... we're giving away money for HP fan fic, so it feels relevant. :P

Thanks,

The Lore Team


** I would recommend PMing the mods to sticky this to the subreddit, if in fact this is valid.

*** That would be awesome, if they're willing! Happy to figure out a way to show them that this is legitimate.

*** Ah, yeah, sorry about that. We're currently working on an Android version. If we get it out soon, we'll definitely extend the deadline.

** What's the legality of this? Like is JKR's legal team on board?

** Are these supposed to be pure dialogue, no description?

*** More or less, yup! They can have some description asides, but dialogue is the focus -- along the lines of a play/Shakespeare.
