Like Harry Potter & Hermione Granger? and even other characters from other universes who would hate him if they met him (at least, if they had actual standards and morals), [[https://i.imgur.com/Hqat9rr.jpg][such as Sabrina Spellman]].


** In addition to the other reasons given, the enemies-to-lovers trope appeals to many people. Pairing together two characters with incredibly different moral outlooks or who are on two opposite sides is a shipping dynamic with a lot of versatility. Harry Potter fandom has several options for this type of ship, but Draco is notable for being in the same age group of the main characters and for having some potentially redemptive traits.

That combination makes him one of the obvious choices for people drawn to that type of story.

** I'm trying to figure out why this subreddit gets so many "why is /X/ shipped with /Y/?" posts.

It's fanfiction. People change things from canon or do AUs. So a fact from canon isn't necessarily relevant.

**** Ripple effect from a single change though.

Why is Draco like he is in canon? Well, his father. What if he has no father or his father dies or is injured and can't teach him those things, or he has an encounter that challenges his logic or how he's been raised? He canonically is smart and a favorite of Snape's so that is also a source of how he might have overcome his prejudice. Arguably the reason Draco is the way he is is because the story needs him to be, not because it's a logical progression of his character attributes in the world he's within.

Not really. Rowling portrays Draco as realizing the error of his ways and changing, but it happens mostly off-screen during the later books/before the epilogue. Moving that change up a few years---perhaps spurred on by changes in circumstances at Hogwarts, e.g. Harry being sorted into Slytherin---isn't radically changing the character. He's still recognizably Draco Malfoy.

** Enemies to lovers trope.

And that fanon Draco isn't actually the Draco from canon. It's pretty much OC Draco the fandom now uses.

That and "They only needs a good partner to show him/her the error of his/her ways" is also a spectacularly popular trope that is also Truth in Real Life. In that many many many many many people attempt this. Usually ends in failure a majority of the time.

In fanfiction however, you can write this attempt to be successful. Indulging in the fantasy of the trope, just like how other authors indulge in the trope of the harem where everyone is hung up on one guy/girl and showers them with praise.

It probably came about more with the movies, since Tom Felton isn't a bad-looking actor. But it basically happens when people downplay Draco's bad qualities because he's hot, rich, smart, connected, whatever.

*** Much apologies, but I'd say Snamiones and Dramiones thrive /in spite of/ the looks of their respective male actors.

Otherwise, it's because it sets up redemption arcs (who doesn't like a good redemption arc?) with a Romeo-and-Juliette-type flair, albeit lacking the tragic conclusion. Although there are those too.

And, frankly, love overcoming obstacles has been a wildly successful literary theme for...thousands of years?

******* And for me too. I mean, where most of these stories struggle is making Draco's transformation (from the bigoted, spoiled brat he is in canon to a flawed, but redeemed individual) realistic. They rush it. Or they ignore it fully, just assuming that Draco is better than he is, in which case, yeah, then it's probably an element of those cursed leather pants.

/Really good/ stories are rare, as sad as that is. But I think the general desire is to redeem the character, not write-in the actor as a sex god.

Although, well, once again...can't say the latter doesn't exactly exist in the fandom.

** Just because canon!Draco was mostly a repulsive little shit, that doesn't mean he can't have a moral epiphany and be a much more compelling and sympathetic character in people's fic. It wouldn't take that much, really.

What I want to know is when Harry/Voldemort became such a big thing. I turn around and leave the fandom for a short decade and the next thing I know this is a popular pairing. For Merlin's sake, why? Harry/Tom Riddle I get, especially if there's time-travel involved, and with the understanding that there's more than even odds it's going to be a tragedy. But Voldemort? Was he particularly handsome in the movies or something?

I'm not judging, really, but it seems pretty inexplicable. Do people just really enjoy the challenge, maybe? It would be one thing if it was all weird snake-themed noncon fetish kink, but I've come across a lot of fic that look like they're trying to be legitimate romances. I mean, I don't doubt that some people can do it and do it well, I'm just baffled that it's so /popular/.

*** I wouldn't call HP/LV a popular pairing. You will often see people requesting HP/TMR fics in this sub, but people who read HP/LV fics are rare in comparison.

For my part, I don't look for pairings. When I do like an HP/LV fic it's because I enjoy reading a well written villain or antihero who is intelligent and charismatic while completely disregarding society's morals (i.e. a fanon reinterpretation that is nothing like post-resurrection canon Voldemort). People who enjoy HP/LV might also enjoy stories about Moriarty, Lex Luther, Hannibal Lecter, Dexter, etc.

** In canon, Draco was a child who'd been raised by blood-supremacists. It is possible (although difficult) for people to reject their parents' values once they grow up. In the real world, there have been a few prominent people who started off as the white-supremacists their parents raised them to be, who reformed and are now adamantly opposed to their parents' beliefs. It's a nice story. What's not to like?
