Dear fellow authors, which fics are you currently working on? What's the title (maybe with a link), and what's it about? How far along are you? What else do you want to share about your story or your progress with it?

I apologize if there already is a weekly thread for this. I know there is a weekly fic showcase with the general fanfiction subreddit, but I haven't seen anything like it around here.


** I don't think there's any thread for this. It's a nice initiative :)

I'm currently writing more than one, but let me share the one I'm struggling with today. Born from discussion in this sub, it explores the idea of a Tom Riddle that idolizes Albus Dumbledore instead of hating him. It's fun to write, but sometimes hard to keep on track (or the semblance of a track).

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

***** And I'm obsessed with your interpretation of Lavender. She's practical, but also very in tune with her book self. I love the bit where she was introspective on her interaction with Hermione, and how Tom adores her for a skill he doesn't have. If it had been canon I could totally see it being the reason he took the prophecy as seriously as he did. Also I love how you incorporated Trelawney's alcholoism as an unfortunate side effect of being a seer

****** I really liked giving Lavender this perspective. She was more childish in the books, but she was also a sixteen-year-old dating for the first time, so it's natural. I'd like to think her last year at Hogwarts would make her mature significantly, while it doesn't have to change her interests necessarily. We don't know so much about her, and I added this practical side to the characterization. I'd like to explore it more, maybe in future stories :)

I also thought she and Tom had an interesting equilibrium. While Hermione-Tom relationships are harder to balance, in this one Lavender can be talented and useful while not posing a "threat" to Tom's intelligence and skills. They complement each other nicely.

It's called Flutter, and it's a Ginny POV story set during Prisoner of Azkaban, dealing with her trauma from Chamber of Secrets and just her general life. It's AU in a few small ways, and I have tentative plans to continue it into multiple books spanning across a the whole series, but we'll see if that happens or not.

Technically, I've been nearly done with the story for a while now, and haven't made any progress at all since July. Hopefully I'll have some time to buckle down and knock out the last chapter and a half that needs to be written, and then it's the work of only a few days to edit the last 3 chapters.

** I'm writing a fic set in 1979, beginning on the day of the Potter's wedding. It alternates POV equally between the four Marauders (including Peter!).

It's mostly a character study with a heavy dose of action. I'm trying to world build around the Order, its role, and whatever the fuck made Voldemort so scary no one can say his name...and also do a little justice to the friendship between James and Sirius, which so often gets shunted aside. I'm finding it very fun to flesh out Peter in his last "good" year.

It's looking well over 100K and I've never done anything except for one shots (/help me/). Not posting a word until it's finished, but I have a sizable chunk in first draft.

** My currant WIP is on chapter 94 and is 658,634 words. It's Neville/ OC and the OC is Draco's twin sister. Obviously the war/ family makes their relationship complicated, but there are other difficulties like Graces is just as spoiled and prejudiced as Draco. So there had to be a lot of growth in her character and her. It was also really tricky having a character with a personality like that and writing them in a way that you don't outright hate her. I had to slowly introduce that side of her and then it's a long road to have someone like that change their mind, thus the length. I started the fic back in 2013, so the first few chapters are kind of rocky, but I think my writing really has improved over the years. I'm happy with the fic, I wish I had more time to write, chapters get up dated pretty slowly these days. I have a one year old and my husband is in his intern year as a surgical resident, so I have very small windows where I am able to write.

** I am currently writing two HP stories. One, is my time-travel epic, "They Didn't Know We Were Seeds", I've been working on for years and probably will be another couple. The time-travelers are Severus, Lily, and two other characters who are essentially OCs since while they exist in the series, they have no major significance in it. Currently, TDKWWS is in the middle of Severus's fifth year. Linkffn(12386916)

My other story is a one set in an AU series I have created where Severus Snape has a significantly younger little sister and it creates major changes in his life and others. The current story I'm working on in the series is, "This Song, It Spells Disaster". It focuses on one of the daughters Severus has in this AU. It's set in Harry's sixth year and is about the daughter struggling with the fear that Severus could die because of the unbreakable vow he's taken and a burgeoning romance she has as well as other small problems.

**** Thanks :) I like time travel fanfiction, but after reading several they all felt the same. For example with Snape it always takes him back to the mudblood incident by the lake. And they always play out the same. And I think Harry and Hermione just know too much for an interesting story as I don't like overpowerd characters. So I chose Draco, who has a lot of regrets, is in a position where he can actually change stuff and doesn't know enough to make winning the war easy.

** Nice post!

I really have too many but three Harry Potter WIPs I update regularly and one I really hope to finish some day. All three are Hermione centric.

One is where she hits the timeturners at the battle of the Department of Mysteries and gets propelled into the past, 1930s.

The fic doesn't focus on the past though, it starts at the end of sixth year when young Hermione disappears and by then 70-year old Hermione steps in. Traumatized by multiple wars, cynical, and pretty bad-ass.

The one I have posted on ao3 and hope to complete is a HG/SS fic. Don't quite want to link because I know how this sub feels about that pairing, understandably so.

To make matters worse, it starts off as a fuck or die trope. Whoops. Pretty stuck on that one though.

** I'm working on the next chapter of HP/Witcher crossover that somehow spiraled from a short response to an [[/r/WritingPrompts]] thread that's like three years old into a fic nearing 100k words. Linkffn(The Lesser Kindness by Zeitgeist84)

I'm also currently working on a Master of Death Harry longshot fic called "The Ashen Crown" inspired by nearly everything from Elric and The Black Company to D&D and Dark Souls. It basically centres around the concept of there having been many "magical kingdoms" that existed and barred themselves off from the rest of the world upon the introduction of the Statue of Secrecy, essentially becoming all the fabled cities from folklore (El Dorado, Shangri La, etc.) we know of today. Because of a cataclysmic, world-ending event on the horizon, Harry finds himself exploring one of the magic kingdoms, said to be famous for light sorcery and supposedly finding the secret to true immortality. In dark fantasy fashion, he instead finds a rotting city of undead knights, a vampire burdened with an impossible task, and a legend long believed dead hoarding the secret to saving the world. It's expected to be something like 30,000 words and I'm not even a 1/4 of the way through it so it may be a while before the fic ever gets posted.

  It goes without saying that a witcher's life is one of thankless peril: brutal training, mutations, vagrancy, and all they get for it are insults and a few coins to tide them over to the next contract. Still, to be a witcher is to lead an fascinating life, and Harry tries to make the most of his. Heavy AU.

** I'm working on two fics right now.

!linkffn(Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting)

This is a very humour heavy fic in which the Sorting Hat puts a lot of students into different houses. Everyone ends up in different friend groups, Parvati tries to use her love of gossip to become an information broker, Draco winds up being the youngest seeker of the century (but on the Gryffindor team), Tracey keeps encouraging Harry and Hermione to break the rules, and Dumbledore just likes to mess with people. It's very humour heavy and has no character bashing.

!linkffn(Departure from the Diary)

My attempt at a fem!Riddle story. When Riddle confronts Harry in the Chamber of Secrets at the end of his second year, she discovers the horcrux in Harry's scar and decides to merge with it as a conduit to possess him. Lily's protection prevents the possession from taking, so she's stuck acting as another voice in Harry's head, and taking control when needed.

This fic is really meant to flesh out the character of Riddle, which imo is severely underdone. I'm trying to strike a delicate balance between giving her justifications for her actions without making her a good person.

Pairing will eventually be Harry/fem!Riddle, but this is a slow burn story.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events.

The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

** Working on a couple and have been for a while. The first one only needs a few more scenes; the other is maybe halfway through it's first draft.

1. Delphi goes to Hogwarts. A short story (>10k words, I think) in her fifth year, with Harry acting as a temporary History of Magic teacher.

2. Harry breaks out of Azkaban and gets his revenge. It will be Harry/Gabrielle; she seems like the type to write to Harry even if he's in prison. This one will take place over the span of several years and will be a bit longer than the first story.

** Right now, I'm bouncing between two with my cowriter. Both are Regulus (and Sirius) lives AU's. Ren has a little more romance, but it's the slowest of burns. Both probably qualify more as gen fic and character exploration.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14495823/chapters/33487077]]) The second installment of Renascentia, the Regulus lives AU set after GoF. My cowriter and I definitely didn't mean for it to get this huge but here we are. It's currently more of an HBP AU focusing on the adults, Sirius lives, exploration of what family and history means and a bit of a fix-it.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16375733/chapters/38325272]]) In kind of a spin off, we decided it would be interesting to look at the first Order, baby Death Eaters, the Black family dynamics and how everything shifts if we had a look in 1979. We ended up building a history and people who are mourned in Ren to such a degree we ended up wanting to write them i.e. the extended black family, the og ravenclaw rebellion and the mwppl when they were more or less whole.

** I haven't written any actual story, but I have an plot outline and a chapter outlines for first and last chapters. Im also really bad at finishing stories so I don't plan on publishing until its really done.

With that out of the way. A while ago i went looking for some Tomb Raider reboot Harry Potter crossover because the magic that exists in TR could easily fit HP magic. Queen Himiko basically has a horcrux and tries to use Sam to resurrect herself And was unhappy to find few options and even less that are not terrible. Steelbadger has a sadly unfinished crossover, I'd rather have him work on Shadow of Angmar anyways so whatever.\\
I had an idea of Harry is a magical explorer/historian, he hears about the Endurance crew's rescue from Yamatai, along with a better knowledge of Yamatai and Himiko because they were tied into the magical community. He figures Lara encountered magic in escaping Yamatai so he wants to question her and learn what happend on the island and possibly get her help to explore Yamatai himself. This leads to him getting caught up in the Trinity attempt at Lara's life and gets dragged into the events of Rise. story follows the Rise story in general events, only this time Harry is along to help but in the avalanche he loses his stuff including his wand, so he has minimal magic he can use. at the end Harry and Lara discover that the Divine Source is a proto-Philosopher's Stone and instead of it's elixer giving true life, it ties the life to the maker of the stone, I.E. Jacob

Its probably going to take some time to complete, but I think I can stick with it and it will be an acceptable story.

** I started Damsel in Defiance last spring. I wanted to try writing a story with the fanon “noble and ancient” families but with a female lead.

Background is that the Potters were a wealthy merchant family that founded the Potter Potions Company. They eventually married into an ancient and noble family, the now extinct Fleamonts. Henry Potter inherited the titles and has been marrying the Potter family into other noble families to better their claim to nobility (Blacks, Greengrasses, Longbottoms, etc). Fleamont Potter is still alive and so is his brother Charlus. They're joined by Charlus' son, Hadrian Potter, and their late sister's children, Miranda Bones and Myron McKinnon. It's tropey but that's because I'm purposely playing with them and hope that comes across.

Haven't been writing as much this summer just between being busy and being outside more. I have chapter 4 mostly done. I have a rough outline and know the major plot points and how it ends.

Currently, I'm in the planning stages of a sort of general re-write of the series, with more of a YA focus.

Right now, I'm planning out the first 'book', /Harry Potter and the Looking Glass/.

Yeah I know people hate politics in their HP fanfiction.

​

And next, the redo will just jump into third year where the story will be markedly different from Canon on all fronts. And because of that I might decide to do some larger or smaller changes here or there.

its not actually very far in yet, and Harry is in the middle of a fight vs Gringotts. No links.

The other is a SI as Dudley, but from Harry's perspective. Well, 3rd person following Harry around. Dudley who gets a Hogwarts Letter the same day as Harry, and also possessed/taken over by SI at the same time. Hardly even started, no links.

** I'm currently writing a fic I had in mind to write for years!

I always wondered what kind of dad Remus would be and what about Sirius? So I thought what if Remus and Sirius had children at the same time James did, just out of school pretty much. And what kind of childhood would Harry had if he had Remus and Sirius by his side?

I wanted to explore this, so I made this Parallel Universe, in which Remus had a daughter and Sirius a son a year before Harry was born. Harry's parents still die, but in this Universe Sirius had an alibi and never went to prison. Harry is still sent to live with the Dursleys because of the blood protection. But he has a better childhood, still not great, but a better one, thanks to Sirius and Remus and their children.

But something changes when the kids find a dark object in Grimmauld Place...

If you like the idea here's the link to the first chapter.

** I'm working on an original novel right now, but when the words for that get stuck somewhere in between brain and fingers, I switch over to some small fics that may or may not ever be finished.

The first one is "The Rose of Stygai", which is a HP/GoT crossover. Harry gets sent to Essos by Death to be its champion on this world. He end up in the body of Sera Flowers, the half-sister of Margaery, sired during the siege of Storm's End.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cV99MuIWA-EfQAqkjOUVDJ87ro-QUgkdkOto8gwPyeQ/edit?usp=sharing]]

The second one is "Furvus Rex", in which Harry finds out that he is in truth the son of Bellatrix and Voldemort, as well as designated heir to the House of Black, Leonidas Salazar Black. But its very much not a "the Order is evil" fic. In fact, almost nobody knows whats actually going on - not even Dumbledore - just a select few who had a hand in a little switcheroo.

** I'm currently writing a Master of Death fic in which Harry is 24 when he travels into the past (the summer at the beginning of the 5th book) He mostly merges with his younger soul and Death is a character i wrote in. The pairing is Death/Harry. I started uploading in may. I post the chapter as I write them and am currently I'm about 107 000 words along. Apart from the obvious facts I try to stay close to canon but Harry is maybe bit more crazy. He is also more powerful but I didn't want to overdo it so he has to learn new skills and his power will increase with time.

The Master of Death

Link:([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17672156]])

Quine

Summary:

The twenty-four-year old Auror Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it. As the Master of Death, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected. Now, not really sure what to do, he decides to see what time will bring. Perhaps a change in the Ministry won't be too bad. Voldemort might be insane, but that doesn't mean, that all his plans are stupid. Accompanied by Death, Harry chooses that this time, he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.

** I was struggling with some original fiction, so I decided to make it into a fanfic because it's easier to work out the kinks in the story when I have pre-established characters/setting/etc to work with. Essentially it's a post-DH, pre-epilogue fic where Harry and Fleur fall in love. The romance will be secondary. It's mostly about Harry navigating his relationships with the Weasleys and reconnecting with them and the nostalgia trip involved and whatnot. I have some secondary plot points I've been toying with too depending on how ambitious I want to get with it.

** I've got a few things kicking around.

One's in the very early <20,000 word draft stage. The premise is that Lily's sacrifice worked because it was analogous to Jesus's sacrifice, and that Lily is the daughter of big G God, making Harry the Grandson of God. Angels and demons and mythological gods are real and have a very real interaction with the wizarding world. Harry has mysterious, ill-defined powers stemming from being kind of Jesus, Hermione's a demon summoner like from "Hermione Granger, Demonologist" but less whimsical, and Ron actually knows about the wizarding world and functions as a voice of common sense. Right now the plot's similar to canon but it'll go completely off the rails after Year 4. I will make up for this using liberal amounts of subplots for years 1-3. It's also kind of a crackfic.

The next are just in the outlining phase. One is going to be a Harry Potter x Pokemon fic, set in the upcoming region Galar, with a similar theme and setting as linkffn(Pokemon: The Origin of Species), but adapted for the Harry Potter world. The question I'm exploring there will be how magical humans work in a world where Pokemon exist. Basically, since Pokemon legends tell us that humans and Pokemon used to be one, 'wizards' are people who are somewhat closer to Pokemondom and the absurd amount of power that Pokemon have.Right now, the Houses will be associated with Pokemon types, magic will be the 'same thing' as Pokemon moves, Voldemort has tried to pervert nature by turning parts of his soul into ghost Pokemon, which appear immortal, and the role of the wizards is to defend the normal mortal world against extreme threats, which is why wizarding Galar is a police state. Again, the plot is yet to materialize, because I'm waiting for the games to release so I can write a story that doesn't explicitly contradict the plot in a way that jars the reader.

Finally, there's an idea I have that's along the lines of Basilisk-Born or the Long Journey Home, except instead of just Harry being thrown back in time, it's the trio + Ginny. Since these types of fics lend themselves to absurd plot contrivances, I plan on making them literally every group of 4 historical figures in European/Near Eastern mythology. For example, they're going to be in ancient Egypt and have lost a lot of their memories, and Harry will be Osiris, Hermione Isis, Ginny Nepthys, and Ron Set. Then, they'll also literally be the founders, where Harry is Salazar, Hermione is Rowena, Ron is Godric, and Ginny is Helga, and the reason Salazar leaves is because Godric wins Helga's heart. Part of the drama will come from the fact that they're all drawn towards each other but being human have literally forgotten why over the course of millennia (until after the Hogwarts debacle Rowena creates the diadem to help them remember their pasts so Ron/Ginny never comes close to happening again) (Also Hermione, being a brilliant mind with millennia of experience, takes an apprentice named Dagworth and he names his kid Dagworth-Granger in her honor)

** I'm in the planning stage of the first real fanfic I've written, with a drafted first chapter. The basis is an AU set after OotP with a more proactive Harry. Pretty much everything the reader learns before the DoM battle is canon compliant in mine, with the exception that Hogsmeade is not the only wizarding village.

Harry will keep the DA going into 6th year and expand it, training them to actually fight as a united force for if they ever need to defend Hogwarts, and to fight the Death Eaters once they leave Hogwarts.

I have a lot of ideas for the war, which will include some Arthurian and Druidic legend (some magical backstory to Tintagel castle, Stonehenge and probably Avalon too). The horcruxes will be the same, but in different places, and at the start, Dumbledore has not been able to find any additional ones, nor has he identified the diary. I do know how I'm going to introduce them.

Speaking of Dumbledore, he's going to be a lot more active in training Harry as well, and since he doesn't know about Horcruxes, and isn't setting Harry up to sacrifice himself so he can actually survive like in canon, he'll be training him how to fight Voldemort. I also have a few memories from the first war planned out to aid in this.

The main characters are going to be the six kids from the DoM, with Ginny and Neville probably slightly less present than the other four. It will be Harry/Luna but only near the end. It will not be something where everyone survives the war.

As for a title, I'm not sure yet. I'll think of a good one at some point.

** I have a WIP, but I've been off of it for a while. After last semester ended my finances (and my head, for that matter) were a mess, and I've spent most of the summer running all over the place fixing stuff so I haven't had much opportunity to work on it. When the new semester starts up in a few days I will (quite paradoxically) have more time to write in so I'll probably get started again.

Anyways, this is basically me looking at Ebenbild's Basilisk-born and thinking 'I think I can do this differently, better, /and with decent grammar/.' Anyways, I have most of the backstory semi-put-together but I'm still finagling some details together. The worldbuilding for a story as large in scale as Basilisk-born takes *forever*.

I'm like two chapters in though, so there isn't much there. Got plenty of chapter outlines made though.

  It is not possible to erase a person from time entirely. Lord Voldemort does not know this when he tries to do so to Harry Potter. He just wants his soul shard out of Harry Potter's forehead.

** I've been saying I'm /this/ close to finishing this fic for, oh, months now, and at this point I can't wait to get it out of my queue so I can work on something else. (It's not the fic's fault; it's just that life has other plans that don't involve writing.) I'm not posting the story until it's finished, and I still don't have a good title for it. Right now it goes by The Lesser Evil, which is eh.

It's a fic about Snape's year as headmaster from McGonagall's POV, both in the moment and forty years later when she's reminiscing to a biographer about how her then-hatred of Severus has haunted her ever since. They had a dub-con sexual arrangement in which McGonagall believed she was trading sexual services for the headmaster's possible willingness to keep students from suffering too much; she later realizes it was also Snape's way of protecting her. She still has a hard time forgiving him, and she removes her memories of him in order to take the job as headmistress after his death. At the end of her life, she reclaims the memories and breaks her silence by sharing her thoughts with the biographer (who by that point is also her caretaker).

It's a very talky and melancholy story and I don't expect it to appeal to many readers, but I don't begrudge the time I've spent working on it. It's also my first attempt at writing heterosexual sex, so that's ... a thing.

** I've been working on a story for a year or so now but I haven't posted it yet. I want to have a chunk of it done before I post but that thought process just keeps pushing the posting out farther and farther.

Anyway, I'm working on an OC story that explores the life of a Hogwarts student And her family during the events of the book. She's not closely linked to the trio at any point in the story, but does develop relationships with other canon characters.

What I really wanted to do with this is explore the impact of the war from other angles. What did this mean for just regular students? How did they process being told Voldemort was back?

We see the extremes in canon as far as good and evil goes, but what about those that were caught in the crossfires? What were the decisions that lay in the murky grey between the two sides? What is the story of other lives that were shaped by Voldemort?

Anyway, that's a very abstract description. That's kind of how the story is- character exploration, considering implications and so on. Not super flashes and bangs, which makes me wonder how well it will be received. But you know what they say- the path to happiness is writing what you want to read! Or something like that.

** My current project is an attempt to make a reasonable interpretation of Slytherin!Harry, with a different personality and slightly tweaked world that makes everything different. It's a change-things-because-I-can type setup, starting off roughly following the books, but veering off into total AU territory before very long.

I'm also planning to explore the why and how of magic a bit more closely than canon did, putting my own spin on it. I've altered some canon spells already, done away with others, and added new ones to Harry's curriculum which felt natural to me. I've got the first four years planned, with rough concepts for later on if I get that far.

I'm honestly unsure if I'm a strong enough writer to pull off what I'm trying to do, but if I don't write it who will?

*** Cool, usually it's Harry who ends up in Slytherin, that would be an interesting twist

**** RIGHT! I wanted something different. Harry is always the one put /anywhere/ but Gryffindor and I went in a different direction, lol.

** I've been noodling around with a Charlie/Harry soul bond story where the bond and the horcrux soul fragment in Harry are tangled together. It starts in GOF, but for a few reasons builds with glacial slowness. Dumbledore has to mention the horcruxes much earlier on, canon ends up skidding off course because Charlie ends up at Hogwarts for most of Book 4, and Hermione and Bill are convinced there's a way to use the soul bond to purge the horcrux ... eventually.
