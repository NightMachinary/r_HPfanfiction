I'm looking for well written stories where for some reason or another harry has wound up with a service animal. Any animal will do I just love these tropes.


** Heh. 'Any animal will do', huh..?

First day of classes, he walks in and- "This is Freddy, my seeing-eye-Hippogryff. Don't make eye contact." -

"CAAAAWWW!"

Many Slytherins died that day. :D

#+begin_quote
  Sirius broke out of Azkaban a month before Harry's eleventh birthday. After finding Harry at the Dursely's he realized that Harry has social anxiety, so he became Harry's service dog. Keeping what he really is is harder than he thought it would be as Sirius accompanies Harry to Hogwarts. Especially when it becomes clear that Harry has a knack for getting into trouble.
