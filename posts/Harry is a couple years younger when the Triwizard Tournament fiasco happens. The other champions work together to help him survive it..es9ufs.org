:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Spoilers below.

 

 

Public opinion is much more sympathetic to Harry. Teachers look the other way or straight up tell him he can skip classes to prepare.

In the tent before the dragon task, the others ask about his plan and end up enhancing the equipment he brought with him with enchantments.

In the lake, the three others independently decide to wait for him to escort him and they end up all going together until they find the hostages.

The other champions actually met up and planned for maze, he was in last place so they waited together for him. They lied to him so that he wouldn't reject out of pride or shame something, saying that they decided to work together and he could follow for a while if he wanted.

Does anybody recognize the fic?


** linkffn(13260989) And The Unethical Binding Contract? [[https://redd.it/duaq5d][CryptidGrimnoir asked for it a couple of months ago as well.]]

As a side note, for such a unique premise (surprisingly few fics move the year the Triwizard is in), it's surprisingly hard to search for. 'First-year' and 'Triwizard' are both a bit too common...

  AU. What if the Triwizard Tournament took place in Harry's first year, not his fourth?

**** Yeah. Particularly the "In another universe, where things were different, if they were like that, it would go differently. But here, in this universe, where things are like this, where Harry is younger and not older and therefore everyone sees him differently because remember he's only 11 here not 14, it goes like this."

****** Yeah, it would have been fine and I think I would have actually liked it if they used it in moderation.

I'm pretty sure I've seen other fics do that kind of thing, but far less frequently, and I don't think I had any problems with it.

** This really makes me want to see a fi where a young, pre-hogwarts Harry (8 or 9 or something) is entered into the tournament with all the other champions from the books. The interactions between them would be great. Imagine an Olderbrother!Viktor Krum and Cedric Diggory. Or Harry being friends with Gabrielle, and Fluer doing a momma bird to protect him.

**** I think character and setting technicalities that come from canon don't apply.

It's like saying "Technically, Harry couldn't have been entered at 8 or 9 because when he was 8 or 9 there was no Triwizard Tournament held."

** On a side note, I've come across a fanon theory before that the Goblet was originally used to pick champions for gladiatorial combat and the like, so the ability to ignore consent was a deliberate feature.

*** I've seen that, but I forget which fic it was in. It works so well because it also has it that the Goblet didn't choose the most /capable/ candidates, but those that would make for the best spectacle. Sure, Fleur and Krum are both very competent, but picking them also meant including an international Quidditch star and having a part-Veela in a swimsuit.
