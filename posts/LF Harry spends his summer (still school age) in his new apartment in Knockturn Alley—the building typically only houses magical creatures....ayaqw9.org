The building's occupants (magical creatures) take Harry under there wings because of his age and how equal he treats them. A few (perhaps vampires and werewolves) occupants become extra protective of Harry.

Harry later makes a potion that assists vampires in the sunlight? (but I might be mixing this detail up with a separate story).

Moody and Lupin are sent by Dumbledore on a mad/scent hunt to find Harry and return him to his relatives.

The story will either be on FFN of Ao3.

Edit: Story was found. FFN 2857563 (Shake It, Bake It, Brew It by Blackkitten23) It's unfinished, but there was a chapter update in Jan'19. :)

  Between trauma after being attacked by Quirrell, harsh comments from Snape and being told he has to go back to the Durselys, Harry has had enough. This summer he starts kicking back and watches as Dumbledore's carefully laid plans for him crumble -- Yaoi Boy x Boy

*** Ooh, unfortunately, I am only fluent in English and American Sign Language. The story you mentioned appears to be in Russian(?) which is definitely beyond me. Thanks for looking though. :) Edit: Apologies I found two stories by the same name. One author's in Russian and the others in French. Then I saw an author by the name of Evandar on Ao3, but do not see a story by the title you referenced...?

  This will be a series of loosely connected one-shots that explore what would have happened to Harry Potter if he moved to Knockturn Alley in the summer after his 4th year. All of the stories will be centred around the people and places of Knockturn Alley.

*** Hmm interesting, but no it was not what I was looking for. Thanks for trying though. Fortunately, another commenter did find the story. Edit: I went back and read the story you suggested though and it was wonderful too. Added it to my list---thanks for the suggestion.
