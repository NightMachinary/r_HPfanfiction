** linkffn(13348041) - Pretty funny and almost what you requested, but there is another one from the same author that is pure gold:

linkffn(13388022) - Absolute comedy gold, with Albus explaining Horcruxes to a 2nd year Harry.

** Saving Harry by The Seeker ends itself with Dumbledore telling the prophecy early in first year.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=127417]]

The fic takes the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses how a Harry who went through all that would behave. Don't read the first few chapters in one sitting if you don't want to be completely sobbing. Hurt/Comfort at it's most intense. (Also, Hinny.)

** I don't have any specific recommendations for you regarding this particular idea, since it is pretty popular in the stories I read, but linkffn(13052802; 9863146; 13230340) are all stuff that I've read recently that do this to some extent.

Edit: apparently the bot is broken and has to be numbers.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
