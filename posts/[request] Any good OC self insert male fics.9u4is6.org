So many female OC fics, never seen any OC male ones around - let alone a "good one"

Thanks.

***** It was relatively good, it used some interesting elements and stood out from the the classic SI fixit fics. The character development was mediocre for anyone but the protagonist, who by himself is worth reading the fic for.

Honestly I was just happy to find a relatively decent SI fic with a male protagonist (which meant that the classic OC x Sirius, Remus, Snape, wouldn't come into play)

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.

** Here are a few I found when browsing my favorites. It's been a while since I've read some of them so don't remember if all of them are good or not, but I must have favorited them for a reason right? ;-)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][The Curse of Truth]]: An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11989066/1/Bookworms][Bookworms]]: Rowena Ravenclaw's champion, Daniel Lovage, is given a second chance to make the Wizarding World a better place. Taken from his world, he is given the task to keep the world from becoming as dark as it did. But even though it is a new world to him, doesn't mean that he doesn't have terrible secrets, even if he himself doesn't know what they are.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12604570/1/What-I-Would-Have-Done-Self-Insert][What I Would Have Done]]: A freak train accident in the mundane world leads to myself being woken up at the Leaky Cauldron on the day Harry Potter became the Boy-who-lived. This story will go through what I would have done differently knowing what I know from the books and from fanfiction.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4437308/1/Neville-Longbottom-and-the-Harry-Potter][Neville Longbottom and the Harry Potter]]: OC becomes Neville and starts Hogwarts, helping the story characters grow and try to alleviate the extension of the purebloods influence in Hogwarts through a Student Council. More emphasis on minor characters and battles, minimal extra OCs.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List][The Evil Overlord List]]: Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6237794/1/In-Between-Reality][In Between Reality]]: A lonely university student is pulled out of his world and finds himself in the story he'd always dreamt of being in. Stuck in a 9 year old Dudley's body his existence changes everything and he finds that dreams can become nightmares.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12207825/1/A-Whole-New-World][A Whole New World]]: SI-Self Insert story. Whatever it was, Buddha, God, or some crazy random happenstance, I've been reborn into the Harry Potter universe. Now I, a native Texan and proud American, am going to Hogwarts in the same year as Harry Potter and the other characters I'd read about before my rebirth. Maybe I can get out of this without getting involved in crazy, then again, maybe not.

#+begin_quote
  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power. Translated from Russian.)
