** my real problem with all of these except drarry is the fact that these are adults???? who all know harry as a child???? which means it would be so weird if they started shagging him, even with time travel. also bellatrix is in no way redeemable holy shit she was insane. at least draco was a literal child who was only going along with everything because it was what the important authority figures in his life were doing. he was manipulated into his 'destiny' as much as harry was his.

edit: to be clear i don't give a shit what you read lol, it's fiction. fuck it, have harry shag hedwig for all i care. but don't hate on other people's ships when they can just as easily poke holes in yours.

***** insanity gets you out of jail. It tends to mean you weren't mentally capable of making those choices.

My view on canon Bellatrix is she isn't insane, just eccentric and very sadistic. Conversely, I do love fics where she was made insane by other people, and there is an intervention before the damage is done, and she's able to be tugged towards using her...creativity...for good instead of evil

****** oh yeah i get your point! i shouldn't have used insanity in that way and i apologise; my intention wasn't to refer to people with mental health difficulties (as i believe referring to them as 'insane' in the first place creates a stigma and isn't helpful), i meant more that i personally believe that she was completely aware of what she was doing and she was 'insane' in more of the colloquial definition, wherein she simply enjoyed doing outrageously sadistic things, behaving erratically, and causing many people to suffer. if she were a genuine sufferer of mental illness, she would of course be redeemable.

i can totally understand you enjoying fics like that and i'm not trying to shit on them, whatever floats your boat, fanfic is very personal :) i was more just talking personally about my opinions on bellatrix. honestly, the broader point i was trying to make was that it's annoying that certain ships are more generally accepted, whereas others are looked down upon, despite fanfiction being personal preference.

** I think it's a numbers game, more than anything else. Here are some results from quick FF.net/AO3 searches for each of these pairings (with the stricter "pairing" box ticked on FF.net):

- Harrcissa: 28/99
- Harratrix: 39/80
- Snarry: 1.1k/12k
- Drarry: 5.6k/42k

On AO3, for every Harcissa/Harratrix fic, there are (literally) literally more than 100 Snarry/Drarry fics. This ratio is less impressive on FF.net, but still greater than 50.

** I dislike Drarry and Snarry because Draco and Snape are cunts and don't deserve Harry or any of the good characters for that matter (good as in their alignment)

I don't care about the other two because they simply fly way too low in terms of popularity for me to even give an opinion, but if I must then no: I don't like Bella or Narcissa being paired with any of the "good guys" either, but at that point you might as well ask me what I think about pairing any other villain with Harry. The answer is the same.

And I don't like slash lmao, but I don't wrinkle my nose at, say, wolfstar like I do with Snarry.

**** okay but you not wanting to read romance is not comparable to people whose preference is to not see or hear about lgbt people in such a capacity that they won't read fic in which there is a gay character. The way people downvote slash prompts/recs/requests points to that. When most people here will say "I want well-written fic doesn't matter what pairing idc" they will also say "no slash" ....when the pairing supposedly didn't matter to them in the first place

Some preferences are not as innocent as not just wanting to consume romance/disliking a certain trope/character...some are actually rooted in bigotry. To say that it's just a personal preference is dismissive/inaccurate

***** Even if people are bigots, you still can't force them to read what they don't like. I for one am fine with Dumbledore and Grindelwald or with Wolfstar, just as much as I am with Hinny or Romione, if romance is minimal. But as soon as Drarry or Snarry i am out because I don't care about the mental gymnastics that the author had to make in order to bring the two together. Same goes for Harry and Bellatrix or Narcissa.

****** That's not really the point though, is it? The question was why Narcissa/Harry and Bellatrix/Harry is more acceptable here and Snape/Harry and Draco/Harry get scorn. Pairings with similar dynamics/age gaps/immorality but with opposite genders. It implies that nothing about these kind of pairings is "bad" except for when they are slash, leaving the thing that is abhorrent: slash. Also I'm not going to force anyone to read anything, if that were even possible, I just dislike when bigots cloak their bigotry behind illogical reasons. If someone can create a thousand reasons for harry/bellatrix to be an okay pairing but say snape/harry is horrible and disgusting in the same breath than that is more than suspicious to me

Also for what it is worth, I don't read any of the pairings mentioned and primarily look for cedric/harry and luna/harry so that's that

Admittedly I've enjoyed a couple Harry/young Bella time travel stories after seeing them heavily recommended, however the vast majority are trash.

H/Narcissa does not work in any way except time travel and I've never seen such a story.

As for the other two, it's like Nonjon said: There is *no* excuse for Malfoy or Snape. Ever. /Ever/. *Ever*.

** I identify as an in the closet Drarry shipper. Except I guess I just came out. Shit.

Yeah, I like Drarry. I'll always be ashamed.

The biggest reason I hate the other three ships you mentioned is the pedophilia aspect, but also because:

1. Snape is Harry's teacher so that's weird. Also Snape was in love with Harry's mum so double weird. Also the biggest thing about Snape was that he ONLY loved Lily, so I don't really see him with anyone.

2. Bellatrix...well I hate Bellatrix. She killed Harry's godfather and is also a psycho murdering mad woman. So I don't think she's quite right for Harry lmao.

3. Narcissa is Draco's mum so this is the main problem I have. Call me crazy, but I think that It's weird to have a relationship with your classmate's married mother.

Okay, now my exception is if there is time travel. I mean, I still won't like it, but I can accept it easier. I have read some...questionable time travel fanfictions so I can't judge you too harshly for that. I just don't like the age gap.

** Narcissa is mostly a blank slate, but one of the few things we know for sure about her is that she loved her family and was willing to go against Voldemort for them. The blame for her presumed blood supremacy and anything else bad she did can easily be shifted to Lucius for one reason or another. So it's easy to justify forgiving her and making her a mostly good person.

Bellatrix is obviously awful in canon, but the standard justification is that Voldemort, her husband, and/or her family had her constantly potioned, Imperio'd, or otherwise magically controlled and compelled to do everything she did. And if that's the case, she can't be held responsible for anything she did, so it's easy to forgive and redeem her.

It's a lot harder to come up with any decent way to justify Snape and Draco's actions, and we see a lot more of their actions directly harming Harry (and some other kids) and generally being awful. It's hard to not see them as awful people, even when the story makes changes early enough in their lives for then to not turn out awful.

And no, the slash part has nothing to do with it. I am just as much against shipping Snape and Draco with Hermione as I am shipping the with Harry.

**** It might seem that way, but we see very little of Bellatrix, and from what we do see, she's clearly more than a bit crazy. So it's easy to say that there was something going wrong with her mind, so she might not be responsible for her actions.

With Snape and Malfoy, it's hard to come up with any excuse like that. There's nothing to suggest that they weren't always in full control of their faculties. Maybe you could argue that Lucius was willing to curse Draco if he stepped out of line, but that's not really the same, and still wouldn't justify all of his actions. I might give him a pass on his actions in HBP, because he had Voldemort threatening his family, but everything before that was clearly him being awful on his own.

And again, part of it is perception. If Bellatrix was around being a terrible person in the story as much as Snape was, she probably would be hated more.
