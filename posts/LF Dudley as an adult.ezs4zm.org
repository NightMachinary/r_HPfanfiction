I've been doing some thinking.

We know what kind of man Harry became. For all the (many) flaws /Cursed Child/ has, the way it tackles Harry as an adult with some serious trauma/issues still to unpack about family and how to be a good father to a kid he loves but fundamentally doesn't understand is really well done. That's one of the things I think they did right.

Can anyone suggest fics about the kind of man *Dudley* might have become?

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".
