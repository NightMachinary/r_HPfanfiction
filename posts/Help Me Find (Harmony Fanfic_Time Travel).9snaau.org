I read it long time ago. So, I remember only few things. I think it was a soulmate fic. Harmony goes back in time to their second year. When Harry was in chamber with Ginny. Harry tells Ginny that he failed to protect as a brother. Ginny doesn't like this. Later in Weasley house he apologize again and others Weasley heard the conversation. After that Ginny keep saying that she looks like Harry's mom and Harry looks like James so they should be together. All Weasleys gets disgusted listening to this (except Molly) and someone ends up slapping her. That's all I remember.

Thanks in advance :)


** I have done search after search to find this because I KNOW I recognize that scene and I want to read it again.

Are there any other details at all you can think of?

- Why did they came back in time?

- How did they come back in time?

- What their goal was?

- Were Dumbledore and Snape good or bad?

- Were there any OCs?

Anyone else recognize this?

** I recognize this, I remember it being recommended often for awhile and I hated that because I thought it was trash. I would try searching for time travel harmony fics and looking for threads a year or older.

  Reptilia28 Challenge. Harry learns the fallacy of forgiveness at a Maternal!Reaper's knee. He realises that maximum control is the only way to destroy the Voldemort ideology. ALL Death Eaters(inc Snape) are bad. Max Revenge, Min romance, CRACK/heavy tropey/OTT elements, so distrusted but not bashed Weasleys and Dumbledore. (Add pinches of salt to taste!)
