As in, after years of crap from Dursleys and Voldemort, Harry had "grown up". Without any parent figure that ever cared for him, he had forgotten to be a child.

*** I'd argue it's even earlier - the last time we see him desperately /hopeful/ of a family and new life is in PoA, before Pettigrew'd escape.

In GoF, he's still turning to Sirius for advice and counsel.

After The Graveyard™ his desire to turn to an adult for help has shifted, and he doesn't "need" a parent in the same way any more. Sure, he's an angsty 15 year old going through puberty and PTSD during OOTP which could've definitely benefitted from a secure family group to help him through, but he was no longer looking for one - his attitude during Fifth Year is very much "I'll do it myself". He no longer trusts authority figures and adults because in my estimation, he doesn't need them any more.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

**** Maybe, but not in Harry's case in my opinion. I say this, because he did try going to authority figures at first(Mcgonnagal during Philosophers Stone, and Lockheart during Chamber Of Secrets are what spring to mind), but they didn't help at all. Mix that in with his time at the Dursley's, and that he actually did succeed makes his case unique.

***** Maybe you've got a point there, plus by the time he stopped seeking help he was around thirteen, pretty much the rough dividing age between childhood and teenagedoom.

****** I always read this as eleven year old harry meets Hagrid and Ron, and then Hermione ‘aren't these teachers and Dumbledore wonderful?' Granger and thought, ‘I'm in this new place, and they don't seem like the Dursleys or my teachers at school---after all this is a whole different world' so he gives asking for help a go, but he's not accustomed to doing this kind of thing, and after a good few tries and the becoming quite disillusioned with ‘I'm not going to meet your eyes anymore my boy, and I'm going to isolate you from everyone who cares about you without bothering to explain why' Dumbledore and being attacked by the dementors who ere sent by his own government and then given a sham trial he thinks, you know what? Fuck them. Especially after McGonagall tells him to suck it up when he tries to report Umbridge's detentions. As dismiss who worked with youth in the past I honestly feel like he gave it more of a shot than I would have in the same circumstances.

I think you see a really interesting difference in the way hardy thinks about it to Ron's ‘hmm, this gateway between Kings Cross and platform 93/4 is closed so here's what we're going to do. We're going to steal dad's car and drive there by ourselves.' I feel like if Harry was alone he still would have done something a bit silly, but not quite as crazy as theft of an illegally charmed car and driving to Scotland lmao.

He did explain why, though. And Harry wasn't isolated, Dumbledore merely said not to put sensitive order business into owl letters that can easily be intercepted. They sent letters regardless, just not letters containing the movements of their illegal rebel group.

Harry was also subscribed to the Daily Prophet - so he knew what was going on with Voldemort. He was salty about his friends not telling him sensitive information that could get the entire order killed if discovered, /through an easily discoverable medium/.

The res of your comment is fine, but I'm so tired of this argument, have you actually read the books?

**** It could just be that the Weasleys were trying so hard to gain custody (since 2nd year maybe) that by the time they did, the little boy that needed their protection no longer existed, and is now sadly matured beyond his years. It doesn't hit them until at the moment, and from then on they all conspire to give him the best speedrun childhood in a single year. Que wacky fun hijinks.

P.s. the image of Percy being a smart, reserved, but fiercely protective surrogate brother to Harry, and then battling for him in the way he does best (through lots of genius paperwork and a masterful handle of public relations) is perfect.

** LOL. I once wrote some fic where Harry gets de-aged into a blond, 5-year-old child as an additional layer of protection, and then Sirius-in-disguise goes all out trying to be his parent. Little Harry has all of the memories and none of the teenaged stoicism, so he's all about hugs and actually asking for the things he wants.

But that was part of an unfinished novel-length story and I've never posted it anywhere, so...my bad.
