:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All I remember is Harry for some reason or another being sent back to his 11 (I think) year old body then deciding to have a bit of fun by flirting with every attractive witch not excluding married woman such as Narcissa Malfoy. I vaguely remember Harry constantly getting his butt kicked by various husbands while they try and stop their wife getting wooed by a kid who had an oddly high success rate. Even if you don't have the exact fic any similar recs would make my day. Thanks üòÅ

***** I read it ages ago so sorry but I can't remember it off the top of my head. It's also 2:47 in the morning for me so I can't search for it either cause I'm tired. I do know it's on FanFiction.Net and has over 40k words. Hope it helps but literally any gamer!Harry story is a blast to read so use this as an excuse to read them all just like I did a while ago. Good luck friend!
