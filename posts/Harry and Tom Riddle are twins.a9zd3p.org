I can't remember the name of a story in which instead of being taken to the Dursleys, Harry is taken through time, and brought to the orphanage where Tom Riddle lived. They grow up together, believing they are twins. Harry can rein in Tom's anger. There's a carewoman named Alice who's probably the daughter of a squib. A communist guy. Tom and Harry learn to steal. They discover they can speak to snakes, and get a pet snake. Grindlewald has a map that shows every magical person alive and he takes an interest in the twins. I don't remember anything else. It's super long which is why I gave it up. It was on fanfiction.net when I read it. Dont't know if it was anywhere else.

  Harry is taken the night Dumbledore is about to leave him with the Dursleys. With forces meddling in the timeline, Harry and Tom become the Riddle brothers. Follow the boys from the 1930s, WWII & Grindelwald, to canon years and a much changed future. Slash.
