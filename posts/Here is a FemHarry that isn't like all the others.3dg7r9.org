** Is this yours? I would like to read it since I've been on a bit of a fem!Harry kick, but I would recommend that you break up the super long paragraphs. As it is, that first paragraph is incredibly off putting and actually makes it physically difficult to read.

*** It seems to have been updated after the feedback in this thread and the largest paragraphs have been split, although they're still a bit lengthy. Just in case you're still interested.

**** I've tried. I can't really get over the underage sex worker apologist feel to it, though.

My favorite fem!Harry by far is linkao3(The Never-ending Road by laventadorn). I also like linkao3(Life As She Knows It by Meg_NeverMore) and linkao3(Gravity by SlytherinsQuill). They're all fem!Harry/Snape but none of them are underage.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Deathly Hallows. Future Snape/Harriet

  -A while back, I wondered what might have happened if, instead of being stuck with a child whom he viewed primarily as James Potter's, Snape had to protect a child he considered predominately to be Lily's. -I also wanted to augment and explore Harry's extraordinary capacity for love, an aspect of the series which intrigued me and which I'd have liked to seen more of.-I have rated this fic as "Mature" both to account for future chapters that have not yet been written, and because this pairing, particularly in the context of this fic, where Harriet and Snape know each other from her first year, is one that many people may find hard to accept. My rating is meant in respect of that distinction.-Cheat Sheet: If you want CoS, start with Ch 1. If you want PoA, start with Ch 15. If you want GoF, start with Ch 49. GoF is still ongoing. -Finally, sometimes I quote from canon, but I don't have it marked because that always really jars my reading experience. Considering that this is fanfic, I'm sure you're used to assuming that anything you recognize belongs to JK Rowling, who deserves all the credit. We wouldn't be here without her.

  Hollis Potter walked into what she thinks is the final battle of the war that's been raging for the last six years, only to find, when it's over and she's officially lost everything, that she's not where she's supposed to be. Or, rather, she's not when she's supposed to be. She wouldn't have made it as far as she did without being stubborn, however, so she pushed past the surprise and the grief and decides to change it, no matter the cost. --Cross-posted on FanFic: Hollis Potter, with grim determination, walks into a battle that will make or break England - and affect the World War raging around them. The outcome is surprising, even for her, and she is left with nothing to do but adapt. [Slightly Edited/Reworked]

  This DOES NOT reflect my actual attitude towards God. I believe in Him, and I know He loves us - I just don't think that Hollis would think so. As far as I know, Harry was never exposed to church or to God, and I think the lack of knowledge in addition to what he had been through would've made him less inclined to think well of Him.

  What if Harry Potter was born a girl and known as Rosalie Potter? How might it change the dynamics of life as the most famous teenager in the Wizarding World? At the end of Rosalie Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts, war has broken out in the Wizarding World as a result the attack on Hogwarts. Forced to spend the summer at Grimmauld Place for her own safety, Rosalie learns more about herself and the people around her than she ever thought possible. Relationships form, friendships change and she learns just how much the people in your life influence who you are and who you have the potential to become.

  A/N: Hi all! This is my first HP-verse fanfiction! This is a repost from other sites as I have posted elsewhere. It's a WIP currently that I am just returning to after an enforced break due to real life dramas, but I am back writing again now which is very exciting. I hope you all enjoy it. Just something for you to consider while reading, while I've read over this for spelling and grammar, etc myself, I currently don't have a beta reader, so I apologise if I've missed anything.In this story Harry was born a girl. He will stay a girl throughout, but most of what happened in all the books up the end of the sixth book stay true to the plot. I'm not going to give you a background to the plot because you should be able to pick most of it up from the story line.Please let me know what you think :)~Quill ********************************************************* Disclaimer: This story is based on characters and situations created and owned by JK Rowling, various publishers including but not limited to Bloomsbury Books, Scholastic Books and Raincoat Books, and Warner Bros., Inc.

** The only Fem!Harry I have read is /A Long Journey Home/ by Rakeesh (enjoyed it).

I am wondering about Fem!Harry/Snape stories. How do writers get around the squicky feeling that Snape (unintentionally or not) pairs with H to recreate what was lost with Lily?

Canon Snape is the prototypical "stuck-in-the-past" guy. So it seems a bit odd that when he does get in his first mutual relationship he overcomes the social hurdles of a 20+ age difference, a student/teacher history and pairing with the kid of his childhood friend and unrequited love? Each one of those factors is not impossible to overcome (it happens in real life for sure) but to overcome ALL of them? If it is a time-travel fic then at least the age issue is resolved. It seems like unless their was a strong incentive, why choose H over choosing someone more compatible or just continuing the single life? What draws him out? If Snape starts with canon characterization, the simple fact of Harry having different bits this time doesn't seem like enough to fundamentally change Snape.

*So, I am genuinely curious*, how do writers get around this issue? What plots devices and character developments are usually used? /Are they compelling enough?/ Or is the issue not addressed? Should it be?

Thanks!

*** As a Snarry fan, the fact of the matter is the best Snape/Harry does not really have canon characterization of Snape. Canon Snape is a creep. Fanon Snape is a tortured, deep hero. Canon Snape is obsessively fixated on a girl who he hadn't talked to since he was 16, and who died when he was about 20, and it has become so twisted inside him that he becomes something almost like Gollum, fixated on the precious.

Fanon Snape discovers that what he felt for Lily was a pale imitation of love, compared to the true parternship and respect and connection he feels for Harry (or fem!Harry as the case may be). Usually he comes to understand that Harry's life sucked and Harry has dealt with hardship, just like Snape, while Lily was beloved by her parents and lived a charmed life (until her untimely death). This understanding that Harry brings helps Snape realize that what he felt for Lily was a crush, an infatuation, not true love. Canon Snape could never get to that point, because he was too obsessed with his own pain to see anyone else's.

** I don't know what those other guys are complaining about at all. There is nothing wrong with a good sized paragraph and they shouldn't be grammar shaming. They're not obese, bloated, and wordy, they're beautiful, big structured, and heavily detailed. I can't belive they have never heard of health at every structure. All paragraphs are equal in usefulness no matter their size or shape. Just because someone who has a PhD in literature they automatically have all the answers and are always right and get to make up al the rules? It is a sad state of affairs when we let someone who so openly hates and oppressed larger entities rule over all. Why are concise paragraphs the only sign of good writers? You can't be a good writer if you make your paragraphs a little on the hefty side? Whale I'll tell you what, they don't get to tell you what makes a good writer, only you do. You're the only one that matters, and I say make your paragraphs as big as you want and let your sentences run wild and free and hell don't even bother with punctuation Take back your freedom to express you self any way you want! Fight the man, man! If they don't like it they can just go back to not offering you professional work exactly how they were before you wrote that paragraph. And if the readers don't like it too bad, you don't need their stinking praise and applause!

*** I giggled the entire time I was writing that. And seriously though, holy shit those are long paragraphs. I wrote before I even clicked on the link thinking you were probably a sentence or three much but my god man, I've read one shots smaller than those paragraphs. Damn good ones too.
