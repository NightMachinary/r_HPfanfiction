*** Probably a lot of the Marauder spirit. Prankster, girl-chaser, doesn't hate muggles or muggleborns. A lot of his devious sneakiness he used to pull pranks with the Marauders would be used in the politics of Slytherin house, having him gain the upper hands in House leadership and instilling a different attitude in the house. Even as a Gryffindor, Sirius had a bit of a "dark" side, sending Snape off to potentially be attacked by Remus during a full moon. As a Slytherin, perhaps he would have similar mean streaks but due to his inate nature to be good, he learns how to harness those "sneaky" and sinister traits into making the house less Death Eater-friendly.

I think he'd still have a friendship with the Marauders, although obviously not as close. I wonder if there's another roundabout way for him to become an Animagus. One idea is that he actually has an early rivalry with the Marauders and by sneaking around like Snape did he finds out early on (2nd or 3rd year) that Remus is a werewolf. Rather than be revolted, he has sympathy and befriends Remus, leading to him befriending James and Peter, and they still all decide to become Animagi to be with Remus during the full moon.

Also, don't discount Dumbledore's role in this. A Black who was sorted into Slytherin who is trustworthy and not aligned with Death Eaters, he'd practically be salivating at a chance to manipulate that situation for his side in the war (this isn't Dumbledore bashing, I recognize him for who he is- a ruthless opportunist with good intentions).

***** Oh sheesh that would be cool. It certainly does sound interesting, and along with this one, I have two other ideas in my head for what I would write if I did take on a project:

- The trio all being sorted into Slytherin. How that changes the story, they would definitely be "gray" characters, probably a much darker story than the original with some messed up bullying stuff going on for Hermione and Ron having a hard time adjusting to being placed in Slytherin.

- A crossover where I think Ron (either 7th year or shortly after the Second War) is transported into Westeros. Set shortly before the Red Wedding, and he appears somewhere in the Riverlands with his wand. His first run-ins would be with Lannisters, and it would go on from there... I have thought about doing something similar but with Ginny instead, but I really think with how the Riverlands is falling apart during that part of the story, it's chapter after chapter of her cursing people to prevent sexual assault for every single day til she's out of there. I could have her appear more up North, eventually making her way to Castle Black. (talking out loud now) Maybe she could even appear North of the wall and have a run in with the Night's Watch who assume her to be a wildling, eventually making her way south to the Wall.

**** I think that would actually make Peter not go bad at all, and become a decent, even more confident and able person, all because of the Sirius-shaped hole in Gryffindor, which would give him more of a chance to shine and be influenced by James.

I know how atrocious Peter is in canon, but I'm intrigued about a "good" Peter, for some reason. Would we really hate him if he was entirely different? There's no reason to fundamentally think someone couldn't have been different given different circumstances.

***** Wow really good point. I think he still has some of his weak traits, his meekness, , but James and Remus focus on him just enough that he changes his trajectory in life. Or does that make him more cautious about Sirius and unwilling to risk his good standing with James and Remus to befriend Sirius as easily? Maybe the change in the group dynamic really does enough to change their whole future. Although I always felt there was much more to his mother and his home life- she could've been one of those nightmare mothers who just constantly tore down her son.

** I would think the rise of the first war would be the most dangerous time for Sirius to be in Slytherin. He wouldn't have a connection with James et al, and therefore wouldn't have the protection of the Potters, and Dumbledore would have no reason to trust, and therefore provide protection for him.

Sirius would have to learn a ton of subtlety, or die by 3 year.

*** Ahmm, That wasn't what I suggested. You could say that Arcturus saw how much Sirius was against his family's ways and predicted that Sirius would probably go into Gryffindor just because it goes against the family. Seeing that, he could've persuaded and guided Sirius to accept the usual "Blacks go to Slytherin" stereotype and tried to make Sirius his tool. Something like that. I just had that idea, no clue how it could be applied, but I'm sure a lot people can create such scenarios.
