Recently read a good one with Harry paired with Daphne, Tracy, AND Hermione. Well.. more like close friends with a possible implied future romance. Point is, i really enjoyed how the author portrayed Daphne and Tracy and their families being close and them almost being like sisters.

So... recommend me your best Daphne/Tracy/Harry fics.

--------------

*Note** I am not looking for Harry/Daphne or Harry/Tracy... but ones where both Daphne and Tracy are involved in some significant way with regards to a pairing with Harry.

*Note** If there are MORE girls included.. such as Hermione into the mix like talked about above, thats fine. The criteria is simply that Harry/Daphne/Tracy must be involved and Daphne/Tracy must play a significant role.

--------------

ALSO... I am fine with any rating level (including Mature and Explicit). To be honest i prefer ones that are more mature and dont tap dance around things. Smut is acceptable but I would prefer the Plot be more important. And finally... No male slash involved (although I would expect that would be hard to do with Harry/Daphne/Tracy).


** Probably not the best but the only Harry/Tracey/Daphne fic I've read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4508835/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chance-Meeting][Harry Potter and the Chance Meeting]] by Clell65619.\\

*** Ive read a few that dont have her paired with harry or even that involved, but yea I somewhat agree. Than again, she is a MAJOR player in the original books so it makes sense she ends up in the mix a lot, regardless of if its a harem or not.

Than again, is Harry/Daphne/Tracy (and even Hermione thrown in) a harem? Not really, since the actual original definition of a Harem requires 6+ women (half a dozen), and is more traditionally between 12-24 (in real world situations... yes they still exist in todays world).

**** Yes she's a major character, I just have ...issues.

What definition? I dont claim to be be an expert in harems, but I do know that the word originated from 'harim' which was an area in a Islamic household where female members resided.(Iv read some Moghul fiction) This word was later twisted into harem due to many factors. Id honestly consider more than 1 female with a male as a harem.

***** The word originates from ḥarama (be prohibited). It later became shortened to ḥaram or ḥarīm in the 17th century. It actually isn't quite where "female members resided", although the translation does describe a prohibited place where women reside. A truer description would be a place within the Muslim household where wives, concubines, and servant women resided.

While there is no actual agreed upon set amount in any documentation as far as I know, these original ḥarama, were intended to be 12-24 women in size on the lower side, although for kings and other powerful individuals, they could be hundreds of women in size (or even thousands). Keep in mind its wives AND concubines AND female servants. So that does sorta make sense.

Now, if you look at a separate portion of history, early Japanese Manga and Anime used the 6 or more women definition, and more recently 4 or more women (Although sometimes its 3).

I said 6 because it was a compromise between the original definition and what is in Manga and Anime. I also dont think 2 or 3 women to a guy really should constitute a harem since that would mean anyone with an open relationship or similar would fall in that bracket. As would practicing Polygamists which again, is quite a different thing than the definition of a Harem.

For example... Here is a good comparison: [[http://the-difference-between.com/polygamy/harem]]

Notice that the Islamic form of Polygamy is a man with UP TO 4 WIVES (so not more than 4). As in, 4 wives is not a Harem.

****** Yes my knowledge comes from fictional series. But the area contained all the female members, not only the ones married/serving the king. For example, his sisters, daughters, mother/step mother etc. So the numbers are a bit misleading as you said.

I'd hardly consider Manga and Anime as proof of anything, but I guess I agree that in the technical sense Harem would have to have more than just 2.

Because upto a certain number, a man can be dedicated to each wife/member, till that point it could be considered as a relationship(in the romantic sense). Harem implies that the females are dedicated to the male and it is all about him, not the female participants.

FYI: My source of info is the series 'Empire of the Moghul'

******* I agree its a bit of a grey area because there is no "absolute" total (minimum or maximum) in the official and historical definition of a harem. In fact, most of the numbers with regards to the Islamic/Muslim definitions and descriptions (12-24 or others), come from interviews, historical commentary, and the like, and they are ALL over the map. And yes, Manga and Anime are not exactly proof of anything but then again, we are talking about Harem as defined in the sense of Harry Potter fan fiction ;)

Honestly I think the strongest proof of a harems size relates to the distinct definitions of Harem vs Polygamy. Clearly 2 very different ideals, definitions, and intents behind the words.

The only problem with this statement is that a man with 1 wife can not be dedicated and expect the wife to be dedicated to him and its all about him. That said, there is certainly a "transition" point where even the most dedicated man (to his wives), simply has too many to be able to dedicate enough time or provide enough support (not financially).

If I personally had to put a number on the transition from Polygamy or group relationship to Harem.... I would say 8 is the transition point. But that's a personal viewpoint.
