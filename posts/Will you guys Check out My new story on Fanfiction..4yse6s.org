It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12111094/1/Bound-By-Blood][Bound By Blood]] by JasmineTheDreamer. (Me) Here's the description:

Anastasia Lestrange is the daughter of a Death Eater, abandoned as a child and kidnapped to be of use of Lord Voldemort years later. In the wake of his defeat, she attends Hogwarts for the first time. There she finds friends she never expected, enemies she never knew existed and a battle to shed the wave of terror and destruction left behind by her mother.

I was reading the stuff about the bots...But I was really confused. So if I need to add one of them to these, it's only because I couldn't figure it out, haha!


** First person perspective of an OC. This alone is going to stop most people from reading. 1700 words in two chapters is also unacceptable to most.

*** Okay, I'll keep the OC point in the back of my mind for my next story. And I'm working on the next chapter now, and it will be much longer.

** Okay, a superficial response from what i see from username, story info, and experience:

It looks like a self insert romance where the abandoned daughter of a death eater is harry's one true love with too short of chapters.

**** 300 words is an average page, 1500 words is what I consider a minimum for a chapter---enough word space for plot and subplot to be advanced---with my own stories at a minimum of 10k a chapter.

*** No, she is not going to be Harry's "one true love". The romance will probably come later, but I actually don't have a match in mind for her yet. But I know it's not going to be Harry or Ron.

**** If you want a plot suggestion, have her parents not be revealed and have her with neville until the end then he learns and kinda snaps and kills her. The sequel would be him coming to terms w/murdering his gf because of who she is and how it makes him just as bad as the death eaters.

** Only skimmed it so far, but planning on reading the whole thing. Just a thing I noticed: you ended both chapters with a character's name as a reveal. It's effective in small doses, so be careful not to overuse the technique.

** I personally dislike stories that are written in a 'first person' perspective. It's nothing against your fic, of course, but that's just my preference. Moving on!

The short chapters need to be fixed in later chapters. The first chapter can be short as it can be a introductory chapter, but the second one should have been at least 2,000+ words. I don't want to criticize for word count, of all things, but aim for chapters that are 5,000+. It may seem like a huge amount of words, especially considering, but that's the average length of a novels chapter.

At one stage, some of my chapters were around 19,000+ (highest was 37,000) and some stated that it was hard to read long chapters, so I shortened them to about 7,000 each and people'll have been rather pleased since then.

I cannot really judge from much else but that until I've read more. So, I'll keep it bookmarked. :)
