** Not as such. Nonjon posted a few scenes in his yahoo group over the years. If you search through the posts you might find them.

*** Considering to my knowledge nobody has been added to the yahoo group since late 2013, and therefore the files are inaccessible to most of us, it doesn't help any of us at all. His last posts were in September 2013, January 2013, and September 2011. The last time he posted twice in a month was 2009. Good luck finding anything.

**** Well, it's a public group so you can just click join group and fill out the pop-up window and it adds you a couple seconds later. I just tried it and now the files page is accessible to me. Still not sure where I would find those scenes T0lias is talking about though.

***** Really? Last time I tried was 2010 or so and it wasn't the case then. Thanks for trying and proving me wrong.
