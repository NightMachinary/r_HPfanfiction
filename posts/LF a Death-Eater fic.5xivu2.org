Hey friends

I am searching for a fic where the protagonist joins the death eaters (willingly or unwillingly). Even better when Voldemort is actually winning the war.


** Linkffn(2056512) Invisible Circus is a Ron centric fic set after the war iirc where Ron is undercover with a Death Eater faction making ground.

  Ron knows what he's fighting for, even if no one else does. Now complete!

** Linkffn(5402147) Death of Today by Epic Solemnity

In this fic, Harry is a prodigy Ravenclaw named Izar and he's the son of Lily Evans and Regulus Black. Tom Riddle is an influential politician, but behind the scenes, he's Voldemort. The protagonist is recruited by Voldemort himself, and he willingly joins the Death Eaters, and they win the war at the end through political means. It's a great read, but it contains HP/LV slash, which might not be everyone's cup of tea.

*** I am really undecided about slash. I will still look into it since it sounds really interesting.\\
Thank you
