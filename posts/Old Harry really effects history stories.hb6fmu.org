It's a hard concept for me to put into words but really I'm looking for stories that give the same feel as Basilisk-born and The Shadow of Angmar where Harry winds up before the past we know from canon and his choices change that past for the better, powerful but not super Harry is a bonus but long lived Harry is even better. Please no slash for the main pairing I don't mind it on the side like Remus/Sirius but the Harry I have always pictured doesn't really fit slash and it makes it harder for me to get into the story that way.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
