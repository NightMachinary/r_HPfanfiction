Looking for fics which have Harry with a backbone, is not stupid, and can stand up for himself.


** Have yet to see this premise not become Heavy Handed Harry. One day someone will shock me.

*** I think linkffn(Forging the Sword) does a pretty good job with having a Harry who is willing to stand up for himself without making him super!Harry or overly heavy handed

  ::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. (Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.)

** There are quite a few. You would like the Dark Lord Potter form as they've written and curated hundreds of novel-length /great/ fics which are exactly what you're looking for.

Some of my favorite DLP contributions are linkffn(Sword of the Hero) trilogy and the linkffn(Denarian Renegade) trilogy.

** How do you envision a hypothetical backbone-having Harry behaving differently from his canon counterpart? What would he say/do that's different?
