I was recently reading a female harry potter/George Weasley fanfiction (Looking beyond by shini-amaryllis on ffnet if anyone is interested) and it made me realise that I don't see George and Fred as 2 different persons.

Sure I know them as the funny twins who play pranks on people and always have good jokes. I can also say that they are my favourite Weasleys. But the fact and I only know them and Fred and George and not Fred AND George annoys me. It's like if Canon and most of Fanon make them the same person. I have 0 idea about each one's personality. I know a lot of twins in real life, and most of the time even if they have close personalities, there always will be some differences, a more extrovert twin for example, them liking different things or acting differently in certain situations.

I don't know if it's just me ? Did I miss something in Canon ? Or is it just the type of fanfictions I read that portray them like this ? Is it deliberate to show how close and alike they are ? I know it's not really a big deal, but it started annoying me the moment I realised most of the time I didn't remember who did what, said what, and dated whom because I kept confusing them. And then I just stopped bothering.


** Fred is the instigator in most of their antics and is effectively the driver, so to speak. He's a risk-taker and has a fierce temper. He's the one who wants to ask Harry if he remembers what Voldemort looks like. He's literally driving the Ford Anglia to rescue Harry. He's the one who gets the idea to blackmail Bagman. Contrasting George who is able to be restrained by /just/ Harry, it takes all three Chasers to keep him from breaking Malfoy's jaw when he insults his mother.

George is far kinder. He is the first to notice Harry is struggling with his trunk and calls on Fred to help them hoist it onto the Express. He's the one who offers to write Ginny (Fred offers to send a Hogwarts toilet seat). He's the one who wonders how the family is going to afford to pay for all the Lockhart books. He's more argumentative with Wood during the Rogue Bludger incident and is actively angry that Wood is risking Harry's safety. He's the one who's actively anxious about blackmailing Bagman. George is the one who helps a small first-year to her feet after they test a product on her.

When Arthur is injured at the Ministry, Fred is more venomous in his argument with Sirius. He calls him out for not "risking his neck." By contrast, when Molly finally is able to come back to Grimmauld Place, George is the only Weasley child other than Ginny who runs to hug her.

In short? George is a momma's boy.

** There are some differences, but they are slight and you have to look for them. I'm writing a fic though, so I scoured for every single detail about them:

It's also headcannoned that Fred is better with numbers and George is better with letters but that is just a headcannon.

** There aren't huge differences, but they do differ subtly in canon. Fred seems to be more outspoken, mischievous, and maybe even a little more sadistic than George.

** In canon, they're fairly similar/interchangeable. People have noticed some slight differences between them - but on the whole they're not major characters, and you'd have to look /real/ close to make any difference.

In most fanfiction, that's similar - they're just not major enough characters to bother about differentiating for many authors. If you are interested in that, I think the genre to go for is the Hermione/Fred (or Hermione/George if that exists?) ship, because that one will by necessity have to distinguish between them a bit more

** In canon they are not major characters, and fulfill their duty to the story well as a duo, and do not need further characterization as they are not major parts of the story (and frankly canon meanders enough already, not hating i enjoy the tangents, but it does lol). Those finer details are unnecessary.

However if you start writing a fanfic where they are more major characters, that doesn't work as well and you have to expand on their differences, dynamics, and quirks. A lot of fanfic writers do not do so unfortunately so we are given loads of the dreaded "Twin Speak" which unlike the brief and few instances in canon goes on and on and on.

I loved it and it completely changed my mindset lol. After YEARS I can finally tell them apart.
