Hi, I'm looking for Harry/OMC Magical (Creature/Being/Whatever) fics that feature a monogamous relationship, and NO A/B/O. Also, please not fics where the OMC is a warewolf or a kitsune! I hope you can help me find something. Thanks!


** Honestly, you might wanna take Veela off the list, too. Severely limiting the options, true, but also ensures that canon is gonna be more or less destroyed.

Honestly, the only one I know of offhand that comes close is “5 Uses of Dragon Cum” on Ao3. Harry essentially enslaved himself to a Male Dragon in heat, instead of the Nesting Mother in canon. Weird, true. But honestly, I have yet to read one anywhere near as screwed up as Candy on AFF. I haven't seen any where depravity isn't involved, unfortunately, so I second this question, and will likely read suggestions myself.

Also, for others, I'm assuming catgirl Hermione is not an option.

** Maybe try crossovers? Like Lord of the Rings for elves or Twilight and Anita Blake for Vampires, you might have better luck.

Most of Harry/Creature stories either have A/B/O or have some sort of slight Dom/Sub tones. Also are you looking for Creature Harry as well?

Here's the only one I can think of that fits your requirements. Other than crossovers I can recommend. Lol it was hard to find stories, there were a few that I know I've read before but I can't remember any of their titles.

Harry/Sanguini - its unfinished Crimson Tangerine by enchanted nightingale

*** I have nothing against Dom/Sub tones. I have a problem with "heats" and animal behaviour. Can you recommend any better crossovers? For example, with LotR, usually Harry is portrayed as super feminin, which I don't really enjoy. If you know any good creature Harry fics that fit the criteria, feel free to link them!
