Game of thrones or World of Warcraft or buffy the vampire slayer would be fun.. I feel like I've burned through most of the good ones for GoT but I have an itch that needs to be scratched and I need more. I've mostly searched fanfiction.net but help me out. For WoW I haven't really looked but I'm curious on any decent fics. Budfy I've seen some and they are okay but throw me some. I'm furloughed and quarantined and really bored.


** Well you could try Harry Potter and the Gaining of Faith by chadmaako. It's about 193K words.

linkao3(5409173)

Another story you could try is Protecting Harry by Fairywm. It's a WIP and is currently over 110K words.

#+begin_quote
  She is a slayer. Born to fight the demons, vampires and the forces of darkness. Now, because of bad luck and bad mistakes, she's running. He is The Boy Who Lived. Destined to destroy the Dark Lord. Now, because of a loveless home and a manipulative old wizard, he's more alone and frustrated than ever. Together, these two lost souls discover that they are far more powerful than they ever were apart. Brute strength meets magical finesse in a story of young love and...okay, I'm sorry, I just can't. It's Faith Lehane and Harry Potter, people. They don't do mushy. A slayer being dropped head first into Wizarding Britain? Shit's about to get real up in here and nothing and no one is going to be the same. Gloves are off and with Faith's help, Harry ain't buyin' what the dark lord is selling.

  The spirit of Hogwarts feels Harry needs protection. Dumbledore isn't doing a good enough job, so she calls on the only man she feels can get it right. Prophecies fear him, demons flee from him and Slayers love him. Enter Xander Harris. A fanfic of Potter's Protector, by mjimeyg. Now with Spike added. On Hiatus.

** For wow, Wizard runemaster by plums comes to mind.

I don't play MMO'S and only relatively recently became a pc gamer, so my knowledge of the lore for that series is rather limited, leading me to avoid that particular fandom for the most part.

** Also, for Buffy crossovers, try a series by Greywizard, starting with Breaking Away For a New Start. Its Xander centered. And is also apparently a cross with the Anita Blake series, since one of the main characters is apparently a minor figure from that series (never read anita Blake, and based off of what I've heard of the later books in the series, never intend to). A guy named Bernard Spotted Horse.

** My top recommendation for an HP/BtVS cross would be linkffn(Harry Potter and the Key of Dagon by Don Sample), which is the first of a series of stories. I've only read the first one so far, but I thought it was excellent.

I also liked:

linkffn(The Muggle Way by imjustaguy). Muggles aren't quite as clueless about magic as wizards believe.

linkffn(Judge, Jury by oldscout1011). Buffy runs across the Leaky Cauldron and runs afoul of Death Eaters. Has a sequel.

linkffn(The Gringotts Account by lancer47). The reformed Watchers Council is having trouble tracking down one of their accounts.

I liked a number of others, but not as much as these. Most of the stories I'm aware of are unfinished, too.
