** linkffn(The Arithmancer) features Hermione as specifically a maths genius, revolutionising arithmancy and inventing lots of new spells. The first book is quite good, second is a bit Mary-Sue but still does some interesting world building. Third one is much shorter and ends with the Statute of Secrecy becoming unsustainable and being taken down.

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

** Okay I know I'm super late, but here are my fave picks! There's a lot.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24897403]]) is also a time travel fix it, Ron-centric.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341]]) is just fucking good. It's where Hermione gets consequences for attacking Ron in HBP. I can't say any more cause it's just good.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12365883]]) is also quite good...Dark! Trio with OP characters and time travel to Lord Voldemort's time.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18561046]]) is also really good, follows Slytherin Ron. Oneshot

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16199003]]) is another Ron time travel fic. It's so good though. Like astounding.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16288199]]) is a time traveling Percy Weasley fic where he fucks himself up and tries to protect everyone.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23425024]]) is a hilarious Draco/Ron rom com.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1992918]]) is a oneshot where Ron comes back from summer after something terrible has happened to him.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4327485/1/]]) Ron and Hermione centric- set after DH

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]) Sadly will never be completed. Time traveling Ron!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12157282/1/]]) Percy centric but has a lot of Ron! What happens when the Weasley parents die and Percy has to take over?

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2594688/1/]]) Solstice Muse is an amazing author. Highly recommended for everything Ron!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13356023/1/]]) SI merged with Ron. It's actually incredible.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1806117/1/]]) Ron-centric. Ghost Ron where he dies and has to deal with those ramifications.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/]]) Oldie but a goodie! One shot but very well written.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13139083/1/]]) This one is simply incredible. The tale is spun so well. The anticipation. It's amazing. Follows Ron on his last case as an Auror, finding out Harry's family's darkest secret...

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1216035/1/]]) Chess game and Ron and Snape centric. Not a slash! Just good ol Death Eaters and a chess championship.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6905950/1/]]) Incredible Ron time travel fic where the tropes are thoroughly explored and discussed in a very realistic way.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/]]) The Red Knight. It's very well known, very well done. An all around great read.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4100736/1/]]) Incredible. Ron dealing with insecurities and family while taking care of an ailing Muriel.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5288841/1/]]) Ron centric, also dealing with Ron's insecurities!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3880365/1/]]) When Ron's exposure to the Horcrux exposes more than just his thoughts, they need to save him.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2954815/1/]]) and linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2929256/1/]]) Extreme Ron whump. What happens when Ron decides to take Harry's detention with Umbridge in his place?

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2333917/1/]]) Ron and Harry have more in common than they'd thought.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10199030/1/]]) Ron gets in over his head and is faced with terrible consequences.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12120803/1/]]) Ron, Harry and Hermione relationship. Oneshot

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12632772/1/]]) Ron has been missing for years. He may or may not have betrayed Harry. And why is Harry hearing his best friends voice all of a sudden in his head?

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11019962/1/]]) A oneshot exploration of Ron and Molly's relationship.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7523798/1/]]) Stay Standing. The original Ron whump fic that if you don't know you need to.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/]]) I'm sure you have this recommended already, but a very jaded Ron and Harry go back in time!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11491514/1/]]) Another time travelling Ron fic.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12742123/1/]]) Ron love to get away from all the bashing! An exploration of his many achievements.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7467796/1/]]) The other original Ron Slytherin fic. Choices.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12632781/1/]]) Powerful Ron with a power he doesnt know how to use. Incredibly well written. Incomplete but the author will be updating.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12868266/1/]]) An exploration of Ron and his family.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12870741/1/]]) Ron-centric and major whump. The Boogeyman is real and Ron knows this all too well...

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11595257/1/]]) How Ron and Snape become bros!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10024932/1/]]) What happens when Ron leaves on the Horcrux Hunt? To what lengths will he go to make it right?

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11598532/1/There-and-Back-Again]]). PeggySue Ron that died in the Hogwarts Battle coming back to first year. 

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13601689/1/Maroon-Eagle]]) New fic. Ravenclaw!Ron. (Obviously) Ron-centric.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866134/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Weasley-Seer]]) Ron's Divination predictions come true somehow. Becomes crackish in later chapters.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3637489/1/Six-Foot-Of-Ginger-Idiot]]). Ron's 6th year journal. Semi-canon compliant.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). 4th year, PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry, for that matter).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]). AU 6th year fic where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.
