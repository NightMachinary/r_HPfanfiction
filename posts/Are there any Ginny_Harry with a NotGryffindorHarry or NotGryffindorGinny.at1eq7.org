In all the time I've spent reading HP fanfiction, outside of the Changeling, I haven't actually run across any H/G pairing that didn't have both Harry and Ginny as Gryffs. So maybe you kind folks can help me find some! :)

Either Harry or Ginny can be in Gryffindor, but not both. Fics with neither of them in Gryffindor are fine too.

Extra bonus points if it's Slytherin!Harry paired with Gryff!Ginny and Ron naturally dislikes Harry just because he's in slytherin.

Thanks!

** Here's this incomplete time-travel to another world story where Harry's parents are alive. Canon Harry runs into a slytherin Ginny here and the relationship dynamic is super interesting here with Harry keen to connect with her though the fic cuts off before it gets very far. Linkffn(2681873)

Oh and yeah, the changeling is awesome.

*** The changeling is awesome! Thanks for the rec! A second chance has got some interesting ideas and there was no bashing, which is a plus. Shame it got abandoned, though.

**** Yeah, it's definitely one I wish was longer, it's like the first fic which made me really like Harry/Ginny and alternate world stories are often fun.

  The war in his world is over: Harry Potter, tired of fighting, uses a spell that will take him to a new world, where his parents, and friends are alive, but where he died as a baby. Is this new start too good to be true?

** Linkffn(Hail Odysseus) comes to mind. Both Harry and Ginny are Slytherins in the fic, although Harry doesn't go to Hogwarts until his seventh year.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.
