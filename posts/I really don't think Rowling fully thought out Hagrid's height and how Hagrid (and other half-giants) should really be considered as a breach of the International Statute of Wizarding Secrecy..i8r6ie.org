So, Hagrid is described as being tall as two men in the books. That means he's, at the very least, around eleven feet tall because the average man in 1991 won't be under 5'5. Now, Hagrid height in the Wiki is 11'6 and I remember quite distinctly Harry and Hagrid taking the train to and from Diagon Alley, but can anyone tell me how a man nearly twelve feet tall was able to enter a train or become the next day's headline of many newspapers for that matter? I'm asking this because Harry didn't perform any magic outside Diagon Alley and so, normally, no one from the Ministry could have possibly been there to modify everyone's memory of seeing someone as tall as a troll (btw, who wants to see a Hagrid vs Troll fight) walking through London and no way Hagrid could have performed a Space-Expansion Charm on the train's carriage without being tracked due to Harry's Trace and being arrested for performing magic in front of Muggles.

Now, I understand people in the big city may ask less question and be less judgmental than my little suburban plebe self, but I doubt even the drags of London will simply raise an eyebrow at someone taller than a goddamn elephant. So am I thinking this through too much or did Rowling really did not think about this? Also, are there any fics that talk about this?

  Trying to make her money system make sense makes me cry...
#+end_quote

I think it was /supposed/ to be making fun of the old British money system that used 12 pennys in a shilling and 20 shillings in a pound.

But that system had a certain logic as a pound had 240 Pence. So it can divided into an integer number of pence if divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, or 120, all without having to use fractions of a penny. If you took into account the half-penny coin was also a thing, you could also divide a pound by 32, 96 and 160, and still be able to use an integer number of coins. From that mathematical point of view, 240 is a far better number to use than 100 used in decimal money systems

But Rowling uses 29 Knuts in a Sickle and 17 Sickles in a Galleon. But by using 17 and 29 in her system, both prime numbers, she does the opposite. They can't be divided by anything. You can divide a Galleon into 29 piles of 17 Knuts, or 17 piles of 29 Knuts, but /that's it/. For /any/ other division, you're forced to use fractions of a Knut. I suspect she must have talked to somebody who knew maths, because you need a certain amount of knowledge to make it deliberately this bad.

** Put bluntly, its literally a case of they're children's books and we"re looking too much into it. The earlier books suffer a lot from this, including more fantastical elements that we're probably not meant to take as seriously. Hagrids exaggerated size is the same way the Dursleys abuse of Harry seems to have no lasting psychological effect, Snapes bullying is outright cartoonish and Dumbledore seems to be a literal god incarnate. You could always argue these elements are present because they're from an eleven year old Harrys POV - which would make sense, as the later books transition more into young adult novels there's a lot less of that kind of thing, but to me it just makes the universe feel quite inconsistent.

** It's said in one of the books (the third, I think, in regards to the Knight Bus) that muggles don't really /see/ magic unless it's thrown in their face.

I often use this to give issues like this a little leeway. Like magic obscures certain lapses in nature to make muggles either ignore it, remember it incorrectly, rationalize it away or muddle with their reasoning of it.

Perhaps a unicorn gets loose from a reserve, or something, and comes across a group of muggles. "Oooh, what a pretty horse!"

I imagine Hagrid, being part magical creature, might have some kind of similar effect on muggles. "Wow, he's pretty tall, I wonder if he plays basketball!"

*** Do note that it was from Harry's POV. And Harry, tbf, is a bit of an idiot at times - so it probably wasn't 'as tall as two men' but 'as tall as two Harrys', plus not meant as an exact measurement either.\\
So, the /current/ average for 11 yo being 143.5 cm, so two Harrys would be 2.8m. So Hagrid would be a head taller than tallest man on Earth by such measurement. Which doesn't sound /that/ bad for hiding in between muggles.

***** Not to be pedantic but I live in london and no one makes eye contact with anyone else when you're on the train. If a big man came on no one would do anything. And what could they do exactly? No one is gonna ask him why he's so big, or call the police exactly, are they? One man who looks perfectly human aside from his stature is not going to make people think "giants are real!" Drugged up men with no shoes have run up and down the train carriage shouting conspiracy theories and the only thing that happens is people leave the carriage and jump back in the next one. Hagrid would be the object of much gossip in his wake but he's in no danger and I think people are more likely to assume he has a medical issue or is an animatronic than they would figure out anything about the magical world by seeing an obscenely big man.

The most that would happen is someone takes a picture of him and the picture goes viral. People still wont be able to discover the magical world just from seeing this big man. He would probably end up as a meme.

***** Well he may be a little below that because Harry is undersized. As well, I don't think we actually need to take that sentence as wholly literal. He's very big, but if he's between 8-9 feet and the equivalent width, while he would make a scene wherever he goes, he wouldn't be a walking anti-statue of secrecy. Worst case is somebodies realizes that he shouldn't be possible, and decides he's a medical marvel. Maybe people try and find him, but that isn't enough for people to suspect magic.

Also, I didn't say it was a defect. Anyone can technically train their eyes to work the same way if they start trying when they are young, but my point is simply that their is lots of crazy stuff out there. The stuff about bones was unbelievable enough that you needed a source. Hagrid being really big isn't any wilder than unbreakable bones. People are gonna assume there is a scientific explanation unless Hagrid shows the any proof otherwise. An unknowing growth disorder or something. Why would they jump to magic?

** The wiki sources some limited edition books based on the films and the process of making the films. I wouldn't trust it. The wiki's less reliable than a Malfoy. Lexicon has nothing has Hagrid's height.

My impression from the books was that Hagrid is tall, but not so tall that it's outrageous.

Edit: Looked at the book scene where he's described. The twice as tall as two men seems a bit hyperbolic. Either way, though, since the people of London don't seem to react much, either people wouldn't care much or muggles in the HP universe are used to the abnormal.
