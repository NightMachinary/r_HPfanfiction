Do you think Voldemort would have given up being a Dark Lord had Dippet or Dumbledore hired him when he approached them for the DADA job?

What are your thoughts?


** Doubt it, Voldemort didn't want the position bc he was passionate about being a teacher. He wanted to search for more hogwarts artifacts, maybe open the chamber again and spread his influence and thoughts to his students.

He would have probably stayed a few years, get a few death eater pals to follow his orders while he stayed at his post and eventually resign and continue on his dark lord ways.

** I think at the time Voldemort applied for the position, he was already way ahead in his quest for supremacy. Dumbledore even says that he knows Voldemort's "friends" were waiting for him in Hogsmeade.

If Voldemort would turn around at some point it would have to be during his time at Hogwarts as a student, or even sooner. Basically, someone would have to show him some compassion and take an active interest in him.

Though, to be fair, depending on how you interpret some parts of his character, maybe actively working together with wizards and witches of lighter souls would have changed something.

I can imagine it being an interesting read if Voldemort would be turned light by, for example, McGonagall. At this point he already created (I think) 3 horcrux and killed a whole bunch of people. Finding love, against all odds, would throw an interesting wench into that hate-machine.

*** There's a few very good Tomione/Vomione fics if you're interested in that. Lady Miya is my favorite, but there's also uchiha.s, Nerys, and others easily findable, the community is pretty small. You'll find most on Ao3. In Shared Flame by Lady Miya, Voldemort escapes the final battle and has a change of plans and he's becomes a teacher in a magical university. I really, really love that fic. Lady Miya doesn't do time travel but others do, Hermione usually goes to the past for a reason or another and ends up in school with Tom.

** No, if a rejection like this leads you into becoming a psychopathic Dark Lord then you clearly weren't very stable in the first place. If it hadn't been the DADA position it would have been something else later..

**** I tend to think he applied and got rejected before that, possibly several times. The last time, he came to plead his case in person, but he knew it wouldn't work. So he cursed the position and hid his horcrux and went on his way.

But if he'd been accepted as at least an assistant professor, well, he'd still have a Dark following, but I think he'd have been less violent and more political in his methods. A presence in Hogwarts isn't the same as control of Hogwarts, but it still gives you access to the next generation of most everyone who matters. And it soaks up a lot of the time you'd spend on raids.

***** Well what is it then? We see that not one teacher during the seven years we see during the series retains the job for more than a year. At least one more before Quirrel, because it was his first year back from sabbatical. This has likely been going on for a long time or else how would the rumor that the position is cursed even start and also because it seemed like Dumbledore was scraping the bottom of the barrel with his choice of teachers. It's incredibly unlikely that for more than a decade not one teacher stayed on for more then a year and it was all just /bad luck/.

** No, I seriously doubt it. Riddle is a sociopath, if you look at his behavior in his youth. He has no empathy for others, and all emotions are fake.

This is why he was able to charm /everyone/ - he learned which reactions give the best result, and simply applied that. While 'normal' people react instinctively in most cases, Riddle has simply academically learned what reactions are good and appropriate, and does that.

*** Right. Because Voldemort was the only student in Hogwarts living in London at that time. Don't try to use this to bash Dumbledore. Voldemort was clearly a sociopath by the time they met.

And Dumbledore wasn't even in charge back when Riddle was at school. He had no authority over Riddle's living arrangements. That would've be up to Dippet. Even then, he couldn't move him anyway. "Oh London is being attacked. Well, better move this student and ONLY this student from London."

***** He was unable to feel love because he never had anyone to love him. That Merope died as a result of the whole love potion shenanigan does not mean Tom's inability to love is because of love potions; not to mention the fact that it would have all been completely different had Merope actually had the strength of character to survive being rejected.

******* One, “canon”.

Two, I'm not sure what your reply is supposed to actually be about here considering that in your previous reply you'd blamed it on love potions and wrote some other weird things and it feels to me like in this reply you are trying to disagree with me when what you wrote really doesn't seem to work for that.

Three, what caused Tom's spell to rebound was the fact that he made a deal with Lily and then broke it. Her love for Harry is what made her offer the deal, but the onus is on Tom and not on love.

******** you said it was his lack of a loving parent, or anyone else. i was just saying it's suppose to be a part of magic that screwing with love has repercussions. the reason tom can't love is because of the potion, the reason he became something as awful as he did is because of how his life went.

********* I don't think you quite understand how it all went, in this case. The only “magic” there was in the whole love potions thing was the fake infatuation Tom Riddle Senior felt towards Merope. Him rejecting her was no magic but rather him coming to his senses once the magic was gone and making a decision. Her dying was likewise not anything caused by magic but instead simply her taking the rejection really badly and not having the strength of character to cling onto life and survive. And Tom's inability to love is not because of love potions but because his mother died and his father did not know about him, leaving him amongst people but very much alone and without anyone who would truly love him.

People don't need love potions to grow up twisted when they have nobody and are never taught that love is a thing via being loved. To blame this on love potions in this example means insisting that Merope could only love Tom if she herself took a love potion, which is an idea so absurd that it doesn't even really warrant a response. There is a lot wrong with his conception because of the fact that love potions were used, yes---it counts as Merope raping Tom Riddle Senior and generally keeping him as her slave with use of mind-altering drugs which is very very wrong---but love potions are simply one of the elements of this whole incident and they had no effect on Tom whatsoever.

And again, there's no “magic that screwing with love has repercussions”. Both of the cases when something happened seemingly of love (Lily's sacrifice and Harry's sacrifice) that we see in canon are situations where it's taking back the deal after it already went through that caused the effect we saw and the only thing love did in both cases is make the ones sacrificing themselves take the deal. Love was important in the series, sure, but it wasn't “magic” in any shape or form and to treat it as such greatly diminishes the weight of the decisions Harry and Lily made.

********** that's all reasonable enough but jk wrote it the other way. it's just one of those points which she spelled out to get a point across, and you have to accept it. too much love potion during conception messes your baby up. like when she tells you sirius and remus are nice good guys even though they act like dicks, and historically fail potter all his life; except before the time they die and off course they love him... if you don't accept they're good people it kind of ruins whole parts of the books. not sure why this needs an argument; voldemort is allergic to love.

*********** Except that Madame Rowling said that had Merope lived Tom would not have been the kind of person he was, so regardless of whether or not love potions can mess with a kid's mind it's how they are raised that matters. And again, as I already wrote, you don't need love potions to get a kid that is all kinds of messed up; heck, I personally know someone who did grow all kinds of messed up simply because his parents weren't showing them love, and there were no love potions involved whasoever.

And the rest of your reply feels like a random nonsense tacked onto it for no good reason, so I will refrain from replying to that part.
