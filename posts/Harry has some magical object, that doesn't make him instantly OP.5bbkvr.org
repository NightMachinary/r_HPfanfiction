Like having some cool, diamond staff that has a special ability but doesn't make him an eleven year old badass.

Hopefully over 70k+?


** Like a knife that can jimmy any lock? A mirror that can communicate with it's pair undetectably? A map that can see through high powered transfiguritive magic? A cloak that allows it's wearer to avoid situational death or those who wish to kill you? I think I would settle for a fic that showed the tactical use of the magical items he already had at one point, or theoretically could collect.

** I never got the appeal of a staff :D can anyone explain it to me? You literally introduce a character into an exclusive world of magic with wands and then you want to make it even more exclusive by adding a staff which is only used by the protagonist and 1-2 other?

*** Wands are for sissies. Staffs are manly.

Honestly, when Harry gets a staff I almost always think of the author making a play on "now mine is way bigger than yours".

**** Staffs are for the elderly because they double as a walking stick.

Although, I don't remember, did the Durmstrang Delegate use staffs in their introductory dance in the movie? (Or did I read that somewhere else?)

*** Wouldn't mind a story where wands are for everyday, and staffs are for really powerful/heavy duty work. Like Bill might use one at work, but he wouldn't carry it - carrying it in public is like carrying an assault rifle, or driving a bulldozer, or holding a power drill. Like, maybe you have to have a license to own one, or at least registered. It's not practical for normal charms and transfigerations, and will lose to a wand in a duel probably, but is useful in a fight against magic resistant slower non wand holders, like giants, trolls, etc.

*** Because most people picture some OP wizard dude with a staff, rather than a magic fairy wand.

**** u/SilverSlothmaster:

  rather than a magic fairy wand.
#+end_quote

The wands are wizard-made, and none have fairy cores. Also, the Elder wand would defeat any staff.

The Harry Potter universe is not the Tolkien universe, no matter how much I like those crossovers.

***** Fairy wand was a joke.

EDIT: Wands are generally regarded in a fairy tale light, with magic fairy's using it to make some miracle happen.

Staves, however, are regarded as something very powerful people use, like Merlin.

****** Well according to [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/wand-woods][Pottermore]], Merlin was rumoured to have had an Oak wand, not a stave.

** The only way I would ever include a staff is for ancient cultures where the intricacies of wands weren't developed or a case of staffs being less of a focus and more of an amplifier. Sure you could blow the shit out of your enemy with a staff but good fucking luck not boiling yourself with a heating charm.
