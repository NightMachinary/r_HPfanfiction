I vaguely remember reading a cliche harry/fleur multi story years ago and cant find at archive of our own or hpfanficarchive. It was short if I remember correctly.

Fleur was a head alpha witch or something like that. Harry and Fleur bonded. She called him magus or magnus or warlock.

Susan, Hannah, Hermione and others were flirting with harry. Cho might also be involved. story was most likely abandoned. If anyone could jog my memory I would be super grateful

thanks
