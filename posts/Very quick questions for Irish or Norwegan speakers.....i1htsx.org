If I call my Irish Ministry of Magic the /Aire Gnóthaí Draíocht/, and their version of Aurors are called the /Garda Draíochta/, have I got it right?

Also, is /Viseministeren av Magisk/ correct Norwegian?

*** In canon it is, with the only separation being for the National Quidditch teams (like with Scotland and Wales). But it fanfiction so there is no reason why an author could not separate the 2 countries, it doesn't seem that common but I remember several fics that do so.

**** The thing is, does it make sense historically for wizarding Ireland to separate from the United Kingdom? Wizards are much more equalitarian than Muggles when it comes to other wizards and if wizarding Ireland separated than why wizarding Scotland did not in the 18th century during one of the Scottish Rebellions? Having an independent wizarding Ireland just doesn't make sense historically and even Rowling realised that.

***** Once again, it is fanfiction. You regularly see fics where the MC not only live in an Aristocratic society, but is also somehow the heir/lord of several "Houses", which not only give this team an immense political power, able to vote laws /by himself/ (even though no country could survive with such a broken system), but also "force" him to form a harem (he can hold 10 house but each of his child must only get one, and he can't make several with the same one because . . . reasons).\\
There are also fics where the Goblins form a vastly superior society compared to magical brittain (but they are still under their dominion because . . . reason?), and despite centuries of mutual hate, they will bend over to fulfill each of his wishes because he recognised one of them.\\
And I won't talk about all these fics where Harry or Hermione start a relation with some Death Eater, or Voldemort himself, because the power of the boner is stronger than genocide.

Compared to that, and irrelevant of my personal preferences, I can totally get behind a story where Ireland is separated from Magical Britain, as long as the universe stays consistent.

*** The plot of my story, needs an independent Irish ministry.

Besides, there is wiggle room in caanon to allow for it. Quidditch teams compete in a "British and Irish League" which could be jointly run by te two governments.. At least one Irish kid goes to Hogwarts, but I don't think that proves anything one way or the other.

** My Danish is good enough to see that isn't working out. You wanted the Deputy Minister for Magic, yeah?

English and the Scandinavian languages have the same (Germanic) root, it's almost the same: Viseministeren for Magi.

Also, do note that is a special grammatical case. The -en suffix denotes a definite article. So this is how he would be referenced in e.g. "The Deputy Minister is doing X", "Who is that? The Deputy Minister" etc. But for the base form, drop the -en, e.g. it's simply "Viseminister Magnussen" etc.

**** It wouldn't be called anything else.

It's just that -- for the common gender (fælleskøn) nouns, to be precise. If I vaguely remember, the difference comes with adjectives, because /den flotte bil/, which is correct danish, renders to /den flotte bilen/ (or however you wrongly spell it ;) ) in Norwegian and Swedish.

Also, I dunno if you meant to say "wise" Minister above, but from where I am standing, viseminister == *vice*, i.e. deputy Minister. Whether he is also /wise/ is a different question XD

** In Norwegian I feel like 'Magiminister' would be better, and is in fact the way it's done in the Norwegian translated books. 'viseminister' would be wrong, as Cornelius fudge isn't 'wise minister of magic'.

In Norwegian, we combine words as much as possible. If you have two words, in this context 'minister' and 'magi' (magic) we put them together and arrange them do they make sense, thus we get 'magiminister'.

If you have any more questions about Norwegian, just ask :)

Edit: if you actually want to have a deputy-minister of magic it doesn't really have a word, since we only have one wise minister (it's like having multiple wise presidents in USA) I guess it would be 'visemagiminister". Idk, any way I make it, it feels wrong.

**** Don't get confused by "wise", there.

Anyway, my goto-tool is googling words. "Viseminister for ..." gets me, as expected, the clunky-but-offical title for various random foreign people whose countries have such posts. The Russian deputy Minister for economic development, the Japanese deputy minister for fishing and some other things, etc.

Given that magi is only one word, I'm also on board with visemagiminister (though it feels less formal -- my hunch is you might put the other one onto an official letterhead). But otherwise, I defer to the native.

** Norwegian here. If you are looking for the correct term for a person under the minister of magic, he or she would either be a "Statssekretær" or a "departementsråd". The former is a political appointed title, and the latter is an employed civil servant. The correct term for minister of magic is, as all ready mentioned above, "Magiminister".

****** It's common courtesy to specify such a change. After all, it's /Harry Potter/ fanfiction. Fanfiction is about divergences and changes from the same baseline.

Otherwise, how would discussion of a topic occur? Take your original response:

#+begin_quote
  It's an AU, why /wouldn't/ they speak Gaelic Irish?
#+end_quote

It would be just as easy for me to go:

"It's an AU, why /wouldn't/ they speak English?"

And then defend it with, "Did the OP specify an AU where Ireland's population was changed? No, to that as well.

That's the thing with fanfiction (and fiction in general), it can be whateverthefuck the author wants it to be."

This renders discussion trivial. No one would dream of stopping an author from writing what they want it to be, but when you're discussing it, you need to specify your changes so that discussion can occur.

Though I suspect you're one of the people on this sub who hold that AUs and the nature of fanfiction can be used to handwave away any discussion responses you don't like.

*** Many thanks for replying after all this time.

I'm writing a fic set in a County Fermanagh border town, a few weeks after the Battle-of-Hogwarts. A very recently (and very reluctantly) recruited English Auror is sent over to deal with a rogue German Vampire - a simple, routine job for the newbie while the "proper" Aurors a busy hunting fugitive Death Eaters and Snatchers.

This turns intro a murder case when dead bodies start showing up. The local Northern Irish Wizards can't stand the London Ministry and there'll be jurisdictional complications with Irish Aurors. And if you think I'm ripping off the various "The Bridge/The Tunnel" TV series, then you'll be right as I am.

And while I need there to be an Irish MoM for plot reasons, it honestly makes more sense to me that there is one, and that Magical government jurisdictions are (mostly) the same as Muggle ones.
