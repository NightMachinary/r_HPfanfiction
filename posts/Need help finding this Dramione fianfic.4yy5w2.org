Guys help Didn't get to finish this fic I need the FIC name and author

What I remember: Voldemort won, Harry is dead. All non death eaters/ supporters are captured and enslaved

Hermione is found, and auctioned for a high price. Draco buys her (because according to Lucius, any self-respecting pure blood wizard coming of age owns a side witch)

Draco has sex with Hermione only once in the beginning (sexual tension and build up, amiright?) so that he can manipulate that one memory into several false memories in her mind in case something happens to him and/or she gets a new "owner"

At one point he buys Dean Thomas as a slave/present for Hermione Doesn't end well for Dean

Blaise owns/adores Ginny

Lucius has his way with Hermione only once, but it's suggested several times with Ginny

Essentially, life sucks for Hermione but Draco isn't evil spawn
