With that out of the way, I'd love to read some fics where Dumbledore really /is/ like that. Not the bashing kind though, where he steals Harry's fabled inheritance and doses him with love potions. I'm looking for a well written, shadow dark lord that holds the country in an iron grip without anyone even realizing it.

A fic where /The Greater Good/ isn't some random term thrown around to justify bashing, but the actual philosophy and all the horror it entails And bonus points if he somehow still is associated with Grindelwald.


** If Dumbledore was actually utilitarian he would have killed Harry shortly after realizing he was a Horcrux. What most people seem to miss is that his manipulation was meant to give Harry a chance to survive. The only people that he feels comfortable sharing the Horcrux knowledge with are people that wouldn't kill Harry for the "Greater Good".

That whole "saving people thing" was only fostered because Harry was shown how irresponsible the adults were. Not to mention all of the secrets.

If the adults (on his side) listened and actually explained things, the story would be vastly different.

****** Harry does "literally everything" because hes the protagonist of a children's adventure book series. Imagine if rather than going after the stone; he just went to the teachers, and they actually listened like normal people would. Or in book 2, rather than fighting the basilisk with lockhart as his only backup; he just went to flitwick, and let him handle it.

Harry potter is full of irresponsible adults who seemingly want to put Harry in dangerous situations; this is because Harry is the hero, and as such must become embroiled in the dangerous plot of whatever book it currently is.

What alot of fanfiction writers forget to realise, is that much of the plot occurs due to the theme, if you change the theme you must then change the plot; otherwise keeping the original plot just makes various characters into caricatures.

After what happened in book1? Between that, The Dursleys, and his "fame", he would be able to handle it.

And Dumbledore didn't suspect Horcruxes until the end of book2. And I'm probably mangling canon here, but didn't suspect scarcrux until year4.

With all the garbage that has happened to Harry until year4, Dumbledore should have understood that Harry wasn't going to have a childhood and that treating him like a mushroom (shoveled shit and kept in the dark) would only lead to getting smacked in the face a la the end of book5 where his plan blew up.

​

Even then, telling Harry EVERYTHING is a bad idea. Giving him a general outline and actually listening to him would have changed A LOT.

** "To all Gryffindors... Cheers. Cheers, my friends. It has been an honour. Cheers!"

Dumbledore fixes his eyes on the Slytherin table, completely ignoring Ravenclaw and the other one

"Now Slytherin... I know we have had our differences, but your ambition and hard work is truly something to behold. Admirable!"

the Slytherins are cautious. Dumbledore usually follows up a praise with some humiliation and injustice

"Indeed, I have a special treat for you all because of these traits. It's so good, that you'll love it despite its Muggle origin. It is a large apparatus which all of you can fit in which will confer all of you a deeply unique experience that shall benefit us all. A chamber of sorts. I have had that room over there fitted with the apparatus. Move along, children, shuffle into it now. You too, Snape*

the Slytherins flood into the room, some cautious and some excited

Dumbledore slams the door shut and enchants it to be locked and airtight. He turns to the other houses

"And that special treat? That "unique experience" the Slytherins shall all experience and you all won't?*

"..."

"...Why, it's... DEATH! FUCK SLYTHERIN! THE FINAL SOLUTION TO THE SLYTHERIN MENACE BEGINS NOW! PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, TURN ON THE GAS! YES, YES, WELL DONE, SLYTHERIN! WELL DO E SLYTHERIN FOR DYING SO WELL! SIX MILLION POINTS TO A HOUSE THAT SHALL CEASE TO EXIST IN 5 MINUTES!"

as Dumbledore's mouth foams during his blood-crazed tirade, the hall erupts into applause and a massive, inter-house orgy ensues. The Slytherins begin dying in the gas chamber. As Malfoy chokes on his own blood, Harry proves himself to be a sexual dominant member of the orgy

Dumbledore looks on with pride

*Years later Harry Potter tells recounts these events to his son, Albus, at bedtime, with Ginny smiling warmly at the memory.

"And that's how Dumbledore exterminated the Slytherin scum. HEIL GODRIC! Dumbledore truly was the greatest headmaster of them all, and a good friend"

** Yeah, it really frustrates me too. I mean, Dumbledore could have destroyed Harry by labelling him as a dark wizard more powerful than Voldemort but didn't. As for the potter inheritance, I think he that he wouldn't need money for at least 6 to 7 lifetimes, what with him holding such high positions and all.

Really, I have stopped reading fanfics, because most of them are just made around this theme. I mean, nobody wants to accept that he could be any good.

I think this one nearly meets you standards. Although it is incomplete, it is a more serious story, unlike fanfics where Harry is a lucky fairy who can destroy anything with a swoosh of a wand- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13320880/1/Phoenix-Insurgent]]

**** All very true - but that misses a crucial point. Dumbledore wasn't in the military, nor was he a military leader.

Churchill had the moral and political authority to sacrifice Coventry because he was elected by his people to pursue a war in which they all knew they'd have to make sacrifices. He didn't have to go to Coventry to get their consent again.

A military officer has similar authority to send people into battles where some will surely die.

But not Dumbledore. We don't have any evidence that he has the consent of any of those he makes decisions for. I see no evidence for any sort of legitimate authority to place Harry with the Dursleys, for endangering the school with the Stone, and so forth. Being a professor gives him no such authority. Being headmaster gives him no such authority. His political positions might be fair candidates, but we have no evidence that they suffice.

Yet, at the same time, it's likely that his decisions were correct. And this is what makes him a complex and interesting character. He is almost certainly making the right decisions for the right reasons, but lacks the legal, moral, or political authority to be doing so. He's basically imposing his decisions on others through sheer force of will, personal reputation, and magical power.

And thus different people will read the same actions in very different ways. If you're more an “ends” sort of person, you'll focus on that and approve because his goals were good and, moreover, succeeded. If you're more an “means” sort of person, you will at the very least be incredibly bothered by the way he's doing things, regardless of his motives or goals.

Writing a fanfic that focuses on one more than the other isn't inherently wrong; on the contrary, focusing more on certain aspects of his character, actions, and personality can do a lot to help us see those complexities more clearly. A book about how people in Coventry suffered wouldn't be enough to understand all of WWII, or even all of the British experience of WWII, but it would provide valuable insight into how the “right” decisions can come with a terrible cost to others.

***** You also have to figure in that he probably suspected that Death Eaters escaped justice and probably influential in Fudge's ministry.

My biggest concern is Sirius and if the Potter family told Dumbledore that he was the secret keeper. If Dumbledore didn't know about the change then why didn't he know and why didn't he seemingly question Sirius innocence? Surely he would have questioned why Sirius let Hagrid runaway on his motorcycle with Harry. Surely Sirius had more magical knowledge then Hagrid and if he was a death eater he would have done something to him and Harry. I'm also curious on why he had Harry's bank key. While he most likely didn't trust the Dursely family with the money it gets to question how he got it in the first place.

From the Sacred 28 family with 7 kids breaking the SoS in the middle of London in book 1, all the way to setting up Harry to die in book 7, if you look at it from a certain angle, it's very easy to make up a conspiracy theory.

Even if he didn't want to, Dumbledore knew that Harry needed to be sacrificed, all that mattered was the correct time. Sirius wouldn't have accepted this, the Magical Britain as well as the magical World wouldn't have accepted it. Sirius would try to save Harry, but we know that due to the prophecy Harry wasn't safe from Voldemort until either of them died. Harry might have died at a time when his sacrifice would have no value and Voldemort ruled the world.

In those fics (and canon to an extent) Dumbledore doesn't actually force people to do anything. He just concocts situations where he sets them up to react a certain way, either by selectively giving them information or putting them in a position where one choice is clearly "correct."

Dumbledore was manipulative and made mistakes - but in the end he meant well and saved not only Harrys live but with the sacrafice he lead Harry to every Person who fought in the battle of Hogwarts. Both sides of their personalities make them human.

** This presumes that Dumbledore was always like that. He could have started out god, got absolute power(in a sense) which slowly corrupted him. He fought against Voldy and won, in a sense. after "taking care" of harry by shipping him off he thought about ending the hold of the bigoted people but got nowhere due to political stuff. in the decade that harry was away he slowly became more cynical and hardhearted especially as the loss of so many he lead to their deaths in the war becomes clear. by the time harry comes back dumbledore had become the fanon version, not due to evil lolz, but due to a long process one which cannot really be captured properly especially as it is very easy and believable that the characters will interpret all actions made with canon intentions with fanon ones.

** I agree to some extent. Dumbledore isn't really about being an almighty ruler. He doesn't really care for that. However, I still really don't like him. While I do think a lot of dumbledore-bashing fanficts are just utterly ridiculous as they twist dumbledore's character around, that is because they don't quite understand dumbledore. Dumbledore I still dont like. I doubt I ever will. He was extremely biased, had some old fashioned prejudice nobody likes to talk about, twisted the rules in his favor for Harry even if it was entirely unfair to the rest of the Hogwarts student body, and really was just an extremely manipulative, and somewhat cruel old man. I don't think he would have killed Tom Riddle from the start. 1st. He didn't actually really begin to suspect Tom until after he was interviewed. Although he was wary of him during his school years. Furthermore, Tom, in some ways, was a lot like Harry. Neither had parents, neither had good adult role models, and neither really had anyone to help them but themselves and both were dirt poor. The difference is Tom was cold, calculating, and knew how to turn any situation to his advantage, while Harry didn't and often times tried to make the best out of a bleak environment. This is why Tom was in Slytherin, but Harry was not. 2nd. He would have gotten soooo much backlash. Tom had not done anythingf bad. Everyone loved him, everyone admired him. In the wizarding world that is. And Tom very quickly rose through the Slytherin ranks despite coming from a muggle background (though i am sure he saod he was abandoned there and the others suspected he was a bastard son or something). The point is, if Dumbledore would have done anything other than mildly inconvenienced Tom, he would have gotten a lot of crap about it. So anyone who has any degree of sense wouldn't try anything to him. Not to mention, he wouldn't be able to do anything whilst Tom was in school, as he would have likely lost is teaching position, and all credibility "greater good" or otherwise. Dumbledore is extremely cunning, very manipulative, and biased, but he would never do something that wouldn't help him. He helped harry because he needed harry, and maybe along the way he grew to care for him. But the fact remains that he helped harry because harry had some use. Because harry had to die eventually but the only way he could do so was for harry to idolize him. I doubt harry would have been willing to kill himself off should he hate dumbledore. He probably wouldnt bother listening to a thing Dumbledore said. Harry was not told until the very end and realizing that the only way to win the war was to die as the war was going on, which is why he willingly did so. Because it was the only option left. Because they had killed all but two horcruxes, one being him, and he knew ron and hermione would do whatever they could to stop the war even if he died. I think people make Dumbledore's character too shallow. He is awful, yes, and he has no buisness running a school, but he isn't awful in a way many would notice. He is careful. He is manipulative. It is the same with Severus. So while perhaps the fandom may make dumbledore too obviously evil, i think Dumbledore is the kind of person that is that subtle person in the background, pushing everything the way he wanted it to be and nobody being the wiser.

** Ever thought of the fact that Dumbledore's mentality is old school. No not his approach to the world, he is too cunning for that, but instead his moral view. I mean during his age of dark wizard, The dark wizard - Grindelwald - himself honoured or at least appreciated something that was good. During Harry's time, most people are just dishonourable bastards who are trying to gain favours and upstand each other. Even if Dumbledore realised this, it might just be that he was expecting people to do better unconsciously, expecting people to honour and do good.
