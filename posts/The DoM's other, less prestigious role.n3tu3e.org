Apart from doing cutting edge research and uncovering the mysterier of magic, the Department of Mysteries has another vital role in the Ministry: They're the ones responsible for developing and maintaining all the complicated magical equipment the Ministry relies on.

Basically they're the Ministry's tech support.

So the average DoM employee spends a lot of time going around, debugging a Trace logging quill, fixing the paper airplane messaging system and dealing with Ministry employees doing stupid shit with expensive enchanted hardware.


** Shades of Laundry Files. But isn't that Magical Maintenance's job? Maybe they work closely together. I like it though. I always saw the DOM as R&D rather than MI5 as many FF writers have portrayed them as.

*** Department of Magical Maintenance maintains the standard enchantments, protections etc around the Ministry because all of that is public knowledge; the protections are established and maintained using spells taught to Hogwarts students, the various spells needed to interact with the security system are common knowledge amongst public servants (in case of emergency, swing your wand in a whipping pattern and say X for example) and everything is generally pretty open.

But the various systems that use either expensive proprietary spells, forbidden knowledge, classified information or all three at the same time? Those systems can't be maintained by Joe Wizzard, the guy who flunked his NEWTs and spends his salary on cheap ale.

For that stuff, you need people smart enough not to mess with dangerous or unknown magics but still brave or stupid enough to willingly poke at a loose bloodline curse in order to get the semaphore system working again. And while such people /do/ exist elsewhere in the Ministry (looking at you Arthur Weasley), they are either already otherwise committed... Or don't come cheap.

Besides, it's the perfect excuse for the Unspeakables to spy on their fellow Ministry Employees.

***** Well what can I say? They're just the right kind of shady and such jobs are the kind of opportunity for doing it. It's entirely plausible for an author to say 'and yeah, they bugged the coffee machine while they were at it' and get away with it.

******* Yeah. I was thinking more DARPA than CERN. Doing research and development and science as well as supporting it, but with a view towards creating things that can be used by the Ministry to advance its own goals.

******** Interesting take. Maybe half the department is DARPA, half CERN. Competing factions make for good stories...

I still want to see a fic where Arithmancy is based on the Laundry Files.
