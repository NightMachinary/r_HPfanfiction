Hello! I currently have some free time, and I was just wondering what kind of recomendations this community can give to me.

I'm not looking for comedies or parodies (although I'm also not not looking for them), but I don't like reading anything too dark or gritty. That's not to say everything needs to be raibows and puppies- take the main seires as a happy medium, if it's too far oneither spectrum from it, it's probably not for me.

Romance is fine, as long as it's not the main focus of the story. I'm not looking for smut, but if there's a single smutty scene in the entire story (Ibelieve "backwards with purpose" had that) it's not gonna put me off of the whole thing. I do have a big problem with incest, so if you can not recomend me anyhting where ROn gets together with Ginny, that's be great. (and I'm also not a big fan of pairing Harry with Hermione, but I can look past it if the story is good!)

I've mostly enjoyed stories that stick to the canon world, but change one small (or possibly larger) detail and explore it's consequences on the long run, but that's not exclusevely what I'm looking for (might give preference to one of those though)

Thanks for taking the time to read this in any case! Have a good day!


** I like [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/wholestory.php?no=30822&format=choose][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] a lot. Some people don't like it because its setting is high tech instead of magic. But the characterization, writing, and plot are excellent. I would go as far as to say its plot is significantly better than canon.

If you absolutely want to stick to canon setting, I recommend:

*Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince*, linkffn(5677867), a well written year 6 story from Ginny's POV.

*Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126), a postwar story depicting Harry's family life.

** You should check out linkffn(weasley girl) for one small change to canon leading to some pretty major and pretty cool changes overall.

For humor, I highly recommend linkffn(seventh horcrux by emerald ashes). That's hands down the funniest story I've ever read.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

** Linkffn(Harry potter and the summer of change) this fic is awesome. Romance is a big part but it's not the only thing. I love this story. Re read it 2-3 times. I don't want to give anything away but it is Harry/Tonks done quite well.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] is not quite a total comedy, but it does have cleverly funny moments. However, it's basically a Peggy Sue/AU fic that explores a lot of ramifications of canon that aren't considered in a lot of fics.
