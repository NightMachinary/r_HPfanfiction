******* We had an "abandoned scare" a while back. The author deleted all his stories because he became bored with them. I think enough people protested for him to put /The Life He Leads/ back on ffn but saying he will not continue it anymore (he did not put /The Conversations/ back, though. Was I the only one reading and enjoying that :'( ?). But then, some months later, he came back with a chapter...

​

So it should be abandoned but then, maybe he'll come back to it one day?...

******** From what I remember he had a hissy fit over negative reviews and just deleted everything.

Primarily, he kept changing the main pairing at a whim and annoyed a lot of people who came into the story expecting a certain pairing and would then be told that it was now different. Plus, some of the dialogue and relationship drama was 'meh' at best and cringy at worst. TLDR: it's still worth a read for the magic system, but don't read it for the romance.

********* I used to hate abandoned fics and wouldn't read anything less than 100k in words if it was still in progress. It's weird though I've been reading up fanfiction since 2002 and some of my favorite stories are abandoned. I think it's because I never seem to be satisfied by most endings and with an abandoned story I get to imagine what might have been.

After saying that though, Id be living if I said I wouldn't love to see Prince of the Dark Kingdom finished.

** In, the art of self-fashioning, Neville is the BWL but Harry still ends up at the Dursleys. Since Neville is the BWL, people don't pay attention to Harry. Harry then discovers that his parents didn't die but we're left insane like Neville's parents in canon and upon meeting them immediately resolves to use transfiguration to heal his parents. He pushes the boundaries of that branch and does some pretty awesome stuff with it that I've never seen in any other work. Fascinating read.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

** Mobile so idk how linkffn bot works but “What We're Looking For” has Harry arrive at Hogwarts in 6th year after being trained by the Order for ages.

It's a compelling story.

*** Are you sure you didn't mean *What We're /Fighting/ For* by James Spookie? linkffn(9766604)

I'm not sure it really fits the request though. Harry is still a prophesied hero and "the boy who lived". He just hasn't been attending Hogwarts.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason.
