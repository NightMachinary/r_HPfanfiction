I read it a little while ago, does anyone remember it? It was set in a post-apocalyptic setting with a very twisted harry. It was a lot like James Herbert's 48 but in HP setting. I'd love to read it again if anyone knows where I could find it. Thank you :)

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.
