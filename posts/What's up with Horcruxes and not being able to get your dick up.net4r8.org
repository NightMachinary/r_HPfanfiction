** The thing with Delphini is more that LV is a full sized homunculus, not a human, when she's conceived. Which combined with his behavior post re-embodiment makes it seem far-fetched.

A position made even worse by the lack of evidence for it happening in the books, and that Draco (among others) wasn't aware of it even though he'd have had to see the pregnant Bella repeatedly.
