:END:
Hello everyone,

I'm in need of some help!

I'm searching a fan fiction, Harry Potter fanbase. Harry and Hermione are imprisoned in Azkaban, I don't remember why, but they love each other, it's a harmony fanfic, where she is very weak and the Weasleys (Ron and Ginny are very much hated at least in the first chapter), so Harry decides to use the power of the Master of the Deathly Hallows to go back in time (?) and change everything. At least is what I remember.

Please help me find this fanfic.
