Despite the best efforts of those in charge, Voldemort's war left the magical world completely devastated, to a point where recovery of certain staples of life became impossible.

The chief of which was Hogwarts.

Despite all efforts, the ancient castle maintained so much damage that it was finally written off as a lost cause. The last and greatest of losses to the Dark Lord, filled with the ghosts of the men, women and children who had fell in the final battle.

Those who could afford it sent their children abroad, but that left the vast majority with nowhere to send their children when they turned eleven. Particularly a problem for muggleborns.

Fast forward, the first of Harry's children are approaching "Hogwarts Age" and a lot has changed in those years. Having left the Auror corps after the last of the Death Eaters were captured and tried, he pursues a "passion project job" in the Muggle world and uses that (and the remains of the Potter family money) to support his family. Eagerly awaiting information regarding the new home tutoring package for parents to teach their own kids magic (like the days before Hogwarts), hoping to teach what he can and hire an MMT for any magic he and his wife can't teach well.

However, that isn't what he received in the post.

Due to a clerical mistake, Harry was signed onto a list to operate as a Ministry Magic Tutor (an MMT) instead of the list of 'potential' tutors to follow up with later. The press had already got a hold of the information and proudly displayed it to the country; Harry now expected to teach students (muggleborn, poor etc.) as no alternatives had yet been implemented.

Now, not wanting to leave those children hanging (and bring more stress on himself and family for backing out) he has to juggle his homelife with his new job as a tutor WHILST homeschooling his eldest.
