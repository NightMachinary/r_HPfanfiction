What I loved and want more of:

-discovering / exploring the wonders of magic

-magical archeology / exploring new places / discovering ancient magical secrets

-hope for the future feeling / working on improving the world around you


** My story has lots of international travel/worldbuilding, but very little hopefulness. Not sure if you like gritty/action-heavy....

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

** I've written "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis". It involves magical archaeology - the search for Atlantis - ancient magics, globe trotting, dealing with various magical creatures, and fighting dark wizards.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".
