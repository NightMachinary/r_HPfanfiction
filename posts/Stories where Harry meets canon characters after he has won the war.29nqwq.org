Hey guys, decided to come to you for help again since you've never let me down before. So as the title says I am looking for stories where either Harry has been hidden away and trained until he won (can't think of any stories like this off the top of my head)

Or stories where the other characters were not in Britain until the end of the war like [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7325/1][Teachers Pet]].

Thanks in advance for any help.


** How about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2559745/1/Learning-to-Breathe][Learning to Breathe by onoM]]? "Harry Potter is 16 years old. He already defeated Voldemort, with the help of his Godfather Sirius Black. Now he is in for the biggest challenge of his life: attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

** Allow me to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7768541/1/A-Cannon-s-Harpy][A Cannon's Harpy]]. It's a H/G story where Harry doesn't meet any of the Weasley's until after Voldy is dead and Ginny has left Hogwarts.
