  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

Is there something else are you looking for here? It's not as if this will make too many AU changes, unless you have Harry die in the graveyard.

Although... Harry is already immune to death by then. So he loses his Horcrux early? Huh, may be it will cause AU changes after all. Still, seems like an extremely roundabout way of doing it when you can just have Voldemort hit harry with a killing curse anyways.

*** "Immune to death" what do you mean by that? He could certainly still die, even with the Horcrux still present. He just hadn't yet.

**** By immune to death, I mean exactly that. It is clearly spelled out in the text:

#+begin_quote
  “He took my blood,” said Harry.

  “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! *He tethered you to life while he lives!”*

  “I live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way around! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?”
#+end_quote

Thanks to their shared blood protection, Voldemort serves as an effective Horcrux to Harry. As long as he lives, Harry cannot die.
