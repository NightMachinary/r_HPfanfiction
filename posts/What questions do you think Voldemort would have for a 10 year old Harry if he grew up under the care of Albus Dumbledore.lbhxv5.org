I wasn't really sure what flare to put on this, but anyway. . . help?

In a story I am writing, a 10 year old Harry gets captured by Voldemort. Up until this point, Harry has lived at Hogwarts with Albus and Minerva. Voldemort knows Harry is a horcrux, and does not wish to kill him. I'd like to have some scenes in which Voldemort interrogates Harry, but what sort of questions would he ask? I can't seem to think of anything, and would love some help. Thanks in advance.


** People portray Voldemort in wildly differing ways. This sounds like a more intelligent version, since he isn't planning to kill Harry, so I'm picturing him trying to steer Harry toward revealing anything about Dumbledore that could potentially be a weakness. He would want Harry to think he was attempting to gain his trust, so he would ask Harry questions about himself. What his hobbies are, his friends, what books he likes best. Harry would refuse to answer at first, but he would give the boy an incentive. Something along the lines of promising to spare Minerva maybe. Harry answering questions about himself would slowly give him information about Dumbledore that Harry would never knowingly reveal.

Depending on Harry's intelligence and temperament, he could refuse to play along, reluctantly answer his questions honesty, or try and ruin Voldemort's plan with his answers.

Or that's one way to go about it. But you or someone else might have a better idea what to do. Hope this helps and good luck writing!

** What state is Voldemort in? Like is he a wraith, is he stuck in the back of Quirrel's head, is he a baby homunculus, a full on Voldemort, etc? Additionally, what resources does he have available? Is he alone with virtually no support, or living with the Malfoys with lots of money and a direct line into the day to day workings of the ministry?

If alone, he would probably have some questions about the setting in general, especially if he's been out of the game for 10 years and is only just now coherent. If he's living with the Malfoys (or some other rich death eater/ministry official) then he should already have pretty complete information about the state of the world. He could ask Harry to confirm something he heard but doesn't believe from his allies, but he probably wouldn't. By 1991, Canon!Voldemort doesn't seem to be a very curious person. He has a very rigid world view and has difficulty incorporating new information into it, so it's unlikely it'd even occur to him to seek Harry's perspective on something.

The only thing I can think he would wonder about is the things he was shown to wonder about in canon: How Harry survived, and what the full prophecy says. If Harry genuinely doesn't know those things, I doubt canon!Voldemort would say much to him beyond "crucio".

*** He's back to his full body, and has the Death Eaters by his side. No one knows he is back, though Dumbledore suspects. He's already heard the prophecy, but only recently.

** You could have him ask questions designed to turn Harry against Dumbledore, or to plant seeds of doubt.: 1) Things about what he knows about Dumbledore's past w/ Grindelwald. (The death of his sister, and his plans for world domination). 2) Voldemort knows that Sirius was innocent. So he could use that knowledge to make Dumbledore look bad. Does he know of his godfather? Does he know he never had a trial? Did Dumbledore cast the fidelius? And if so did he know who the secret keeper really was? 3) he could ask questions about Harry's parseltongue. Draw attention to it just being a magical gift and not evil. Did Dumbledore try to make Harry feel evil about his ability? Did others? (Use that to try to make Harry feel kinship w/ Voldemort). 4) could ask if Harry had been told about the prophecy. (Make it seem like he is being groomed and lied to by Dumbledore to be a martyr). 5) was his scar ever treated by a healer? Did Dumbledore know/suspect about their connection. All the evil manipulative Dumbledore tropes could be used. (Could be a real manipulative Dumbledore, or just painted that way by Voldemort in an attempt to turn Harry).

** "Why did Dumbledore raise you at Hogwarts rather than placing you with your mother's blood, where I would not have been able to reach you? Has he gone senile? Kinda seems like he's sacrificed your life to give you a happier childhood."

*** Tbf if I were Dumbledore, I'd have more faith in protecting Harry in Hogwarts rather than believing in muggles and blood protection magic.

***** Since Harry is 10 year old, all that hasn't happened yet.

Pretty sure Dumbledore would be more confident protecting Harry in his own turf rather than sticking him with a couple of helpless muggles. Blood wards are good and everything, but Hogwarts should have more protections anyway.

** Well, it depends on what information Voldemort wants to get out of him. How he frames the questions will depend on a lot of things - what state Voldemort is in, whether he is trying to befriend or scare Harry, what prior knowledge he expects Harry to have - but your starting place has to be what information Voldemort is seeking.

If I were Voldemort in that situation, I would want to know:

- Does Dumbledore know about the horcruxes

- Has Dumbledore gathered any more of the horcruxes to him - or worse, destroyed any?

- Does Dumbledore know that Voldemort is alive? What does he mean to do about that?

- What is Dumbledore planning?

- Tangent topic: what is up with Snape? Is he still loyal to Voldemort, can Voldemort count on him?

- Also minor tangent, what's this Voldemort's heard about Sirius Black being imprisoned for being a Death Eater? WTF?

Some of these may not fit your fic depending on what you've changed. These are not the questions Voldemort should ask directly, they're just the information he's seeking. You can frame your questions around them. Eg: “Has Dumbledore ever cast an enchantment on you? Tell me about that.”
