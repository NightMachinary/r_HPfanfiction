Hey all, I was just wondering if anyone knew of some well written strong Harry fictions? Preferably with some well written romance as well (non-M/M please - not my cup of tea).

Open to many different and whacky AU, plots and tropes if I'm honest. Don't mind ongoing as long as it hasn't been abandoned - hiatus is okay, the hope of completion keeps me invested! Would love it to be long - I really enjoy immersing into authors worlds and living through the story as it progresses!

Thank you for your time!

  Complete! Challenges fill Harry's 6th year: growing powers, Snape as defense teacher, new Potions teacher, a new crush on him, Voldemort, Ginny, Goblins? Lots of humor, drama, action and romance! H:G,R:Hr. Award winner!

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

***** Thank you for your suggestion! I will keep this on my read list, I've never been one for short reads as I often find myself yearning for more - but I'll take the plunge!

*** I found this one yesterday and have been junk reading it... damn it hits heavy. I really like these types of stories... but whilst I'm reading them really gets me in a mood, one that I can't help but feel sad about. It's been an excellent read so far and I still have 10 chapters to go! Thank you for the suggestion, if I wasn't reading it already it would definitely be on my list!

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. It has been rated accordingly. On hiatus. Note in ch. 34
