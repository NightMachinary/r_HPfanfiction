As the title implies, I'm looking for fics that deal with politics in wizarding society much more in depth than we see in canon, perhaps with a similar feel to the Netflix show House of Cards! Definitely NOT looking for "Oh Harry has inherited a bazillion titles and now runs England politically and financially". Give me smoky back-door dealings, back-stabbing party politics, and most of all a main character that is ambitious, ruthless, and ready to do almost anything to gain power! *(Harry DOES NOT have to be the main character! I just notice its usually him inheriting hundreds of titles in fics! In fact, I bet Tom Riddle or even Hermione Granger would be better at the whole ruthless politician thing.)*

** Ok this one is a bit of a crack fic but in the short story The Widower Maker by Draco664, Harry takes following the law (that the darker pureblood faction passed when the light side was celebrating Voldemort's defeat) to the extreme destroying several pureblood families along the way. Forced to explain himself he goes into detail proving that all of the actions he took were the only ones he could take so he didn't violate the law. The story is a little over 7K.

** Have not seen one with Harry as the main character, but have seen one with Ron as the main character - and he's not your usual Ron because the story diverges from cannon when he's 8 (start of story), so he has completely different experiences.
