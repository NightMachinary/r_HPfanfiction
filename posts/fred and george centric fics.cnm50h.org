  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. She was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived. (Fem!Harry) Mostly canon-compliant, diverging in book eight

** Problem with the twins in fanfics is that they're usually used mainly for comedy reliefe... and stories acrtually starring them tend to be one of two:

1: A female OC (probably a self-insert) befriends the twins and gets together with one or both of them.\\
2: Fred is dead, and George angsts about it.

Gets kind of old after a while. Oh, and there are a handful of "Weasley twins meet the Marauders" stories, but none of them seem to be any good....

There are a couple more interesting ones though.

I liked Why Can't It Be A Joke? where Fred and George accidentally travel back in time and alter the timeline so that the wizarding world becomes a total dystopia, and they have to find out how to fix it.... unfortunately the fic seems to be good and dead, but I liked the build-up of what it did have. linkffn(6957439)

  Fred and George end up back in time, break up the fight that would've killed Ariana Dumbledore, then watch Albus and Grindelwald leave without realizing just how much they've changed until they return to a twisted future. More detailed summary inside.
