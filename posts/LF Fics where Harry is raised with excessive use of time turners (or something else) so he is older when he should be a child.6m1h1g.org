I'm /not/ looking for fics where Harry is simply born earlier, I'm looking for fics where Harry is older than he should be. I have a plot bunny but I'm too lazy to write something. So, I'm looking for fics with similar premises to read.

 

Perhaps halloween 1981 happened differently, Voldemort didn't die and Ministry or Department of Mysteries or someone else knowing the prophecy wanted Voldemort dead so they decided to train Harry quickly to be a weapon against him. Or perhaps it did happened and Dumbledore (who thought that instead of love, power-he-knows-not was something else) was afraid that Voldemort might come back in a few years and instead of pure luck, he wanted a trained Harry to finish the job. Or perhaps someone else with different purposes -maybe even nefarious purposes- raised Harry. Maybe they raised him to be a weapon, maybe they just wanted him to be able to protect himself or maybe they wanted to use him for other reasons.

 

Whatever the reason, I'm looking for fics where someone used time turners when he was a child (or some other time magic) to raise Harry. So in the end, he is older when everybody expects him to be much younger; preferably a child.

 

Cheers.

  His plans to insert himself within the guts of the Ministry of Magic have been highly successful, his apprentices are proving to be both talented and intuitive, and his efforts to consolidate his position within the mundane world are proceeding nicely. But as he knows all to well, all plans disintegrate on contact with reality...and what is English Heritage anyway?

  (Dumbledore Bashing! Lunar Harmony!) Based on, but not an answer to DZ2's "What's Yours is Mine" challenge. The Shadow-Walkers, magical thieves of extraordinary power, have long been thought extinct. But Harry, Hermione and Luna not only have those powers, but intend to use them to take everyone from Dumbledore to Voldemort to the cleaners...and make a little profit along the way.
