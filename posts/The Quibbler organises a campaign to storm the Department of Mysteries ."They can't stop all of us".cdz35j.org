** /"In other news, thirteen people were arrested while attempting to enter a restricted area in the Ministry of Magic. The DMLE refused to comment on the event as it is an ongoing investigation, but an anonymous source in St Mungo's claimed that all detainees were suffering from food poisoning after eating Dirigible Plum soup. This was Stephen Bones for WWN News."/

** Considering who'd read The Quibbler, its campaign would just be people showing up to the DoM to redecorate it and make it more quirky.

** ...and as it turns out, yes, they can.

Though personally I like to think that Odd Lovegood (luna's dad) and his wife were Unspeakables, and the Quibbler is a coded paper they and their compatriots used to communicate openly. Everyone else just thought they were a bunch of crazies.

The Rotfang conspiracy, for instance, is a reference to the Code Blue folder were you can find the initiation files for dentists everywhere, into the Unspeakables. Most notably one Hermione Granger.

In this case that campaign would be to tell Unspeakables everywhere that the DoM was about to be raided, and to lock down sensitive experiments to prevent the unraveling of space-time or the end of the world, due to the actions of a few idiots.

** Of course this campaign starts within a week of government agents being linked to a child trafficking pedophile called Epstein the Wizard...

...which at the very least highlights that, if such an event were genuine, there's truly a better government facility to storm.

I mean, the Ministry of Magic and the Wizengamot aren't even providing the immigration facilities on the border with drinking water, let alone sanitation, laundry facilities or beds. It's just disappointing, really.
