Alright I will just get to the point if this. A few weeks ago u came upon a interesting fanfic (which name I can't remember) I didn't finish but wanted to come back to only to have completely forgotten its name. Here's a list of what I do remembered

-A adult harry is transport to that Dimensions 1995

-had a female Child Who Lived ( Iris something Potter)

-Sirius had a kid ( Alexandra Black)

-Most of the order was still I live

-Draco is a ghost helping Harry in the new Dimension

-has the power of Phoenix Fire (Dumebeldoes Apperation thingy)

Warning for your soul, and anyone who finds this: This story isn't complete and while it isn't what I'd called /abandonded/, Kat will only write when the muse is struck and that apparently doesn't happen too frequently. She recently posted a new story after a year-long (I think) absence (which is also great, and you should check it out).

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  It all went wrong. Harry was locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond, unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him when Harry is sent back in time with one mission, to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.
