I recently made a fic called "For my Family Anything" where the events of the cannon never happened and Harry was born as Harry Charles Potter, twin of James Potter. This story is how he protects his family (twin brother, father, and mother) from Grindelwald and his protege. In this AU he was born as Harry Charles Potter and never Harry James Potter. If you guys could read my first chapter and give me tips. Thank you!


** James was born in 1960, Grindelwald fell in 45.

**** Due to the supposed link to Hitler and Dumbledore's intervention, writing that level of large scale AU would be very difficult.

***** What I am going to do is make it so Grindlewald was defeated but he was never killed. We all know Dumbledore doesn't kill, but then I will make it so he escapes his prison. Grindelwald is a person who seems smart enough to escape any prison.
