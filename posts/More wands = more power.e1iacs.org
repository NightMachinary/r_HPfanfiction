I read something ages ago on ffnet where Harry used a bunch of wands at the same time, and the result was superpowered spells. What are your views on this concept. I thought about a few ideas: 1. Every extra wand allows another spell to be cast at the same time. 2. Every extra wand increases the base amount of expende power by a set amount. 3. Every extra wand increases the power exponentially. 4. Every extra wand repeats the same spell cast initially. There are lots of ways multi wands could be worked into fics. Maybe extra wands just act like a staff (stave?). I would love to gear your thoughts.


** 3 seems to be canon:

  As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took the chance: He leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco's grip, pointed all of them at Greyback, and yelled, “Stupefy!” The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground.

Those fics about Harry wielding a custom super-wand with multiple cores? Canonically accurate.

*** I think the stacking might be linear or even sublinear rather than exponential though. At least I would expect it to be.

Personally, I wouldn't expect multiple wand cores to /get along/ in the same wand with the same wood (maybe Ollivander could pull it off), and I wouldn't expect the same sort of consistency or control you get from a normal wand.

** My favourite idea of how wands work is from linkffn(7388739).

Basically the reason why no one can use two wands is a mystery that no one has been able to solve for years, and it ends up being the key to defeating voldemort

  As his sixth year begins, Harry is forced to take up his destiny earlier that anticipated. With Voldemort slowly taking over, everyone looks to Harry to lead them, all while Juggling school, friends, the seach for the Horcruxes, and teenage love. In the process, Harry slowly learns about not only himself, but the true worth of the soul! Harry/Susan

****** Giglamesh's main Noble Phantasm (An ability a hero was known for in life that defines them as a hero like King Arthurs Excalibur) is called the Gate of Babylon, it has access to all the treasures in the world including food, weapons and so on. In combat Gilgamesh opens the gate as interdementional portals behind him and launches Weapons at his enemies like missiles, against normal people or low rank heroic spirits he uses cheaply made shitty weapons, against higher rank heroes or gods he uses higher quality weapons.

Against Hercules in the clip i linked he basically had to use God killing weapons because Hercules is a tough SOB to kill

**** I wouldn't be surprised if this is a common tool for dragon handlers - strap five wands together and two dragon handlers can Stupefy an adult Hungarian Horntail... maybe. The problem is that every spell cast with the 'pepperbox' wand would cast five of them. This is terrible for transfiguration and anything requiring finesse. Excellent for crowd control.

*** I'm not quite sure anyone is justified saying that about the mechanics of Harry Potter, since it's intentionally left ambiguous.

Based on how it's described, a fidelius charm with an unbreakable vow is logical. Muggle items don't work for magical wounds and bullets would most likely be stopped by a shield charm.

I personally don't think the ability to use multiple wands/cores like a CPU in a story makes for a good story. But the matter is that it's an idea that has some canon basis.

*** I think that was more the wielding of two wands in either hand, based on how it was described, as a "split down the middle". In canon, harry at one point uses three wands with one hand to shoot three spells at once.

Granted, it was an emotional moment, and he had mastery over all three, and perhaps they even had identical cores, but it nonetheless happened.

As for why not everyone does it, I'd say probably because it looks really stupid. A single wand is elegant, sleek and efficient, three wands duct taped together look ridiculous. Not to mention that it didn't fire a single massive spell, but three smaller ones.
