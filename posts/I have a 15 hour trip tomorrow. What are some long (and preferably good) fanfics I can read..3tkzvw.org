I'm looking for recommendations from any fandom and while I'd prefer that the story isn't a Mary Sue, I can tolerate them so long as the story itself is well written.

Here's a list of some of the ones I've read so far in case anyone wants to know what I'd recommend to someone else:

The Alexandria Quick Series

- Young girl discovers magic and stuff. Great story, but not the type I'm that interested in (nothing got exploded by chapter 3), so I can't give you the best summary of it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Wastelands of Time]] (Harry Potter)

- Harry goes insane from too much time looping. Reading this story will make you feel like you're smoking something.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning]] (Harry Potter)

- I know this one has a story and it's really well-written, I just don't understand it. Harry comes from a psychopathic future where he's an unspeakable hitman and gets thrown back into his younger self. Lots of violence.

That Harry raised by Sirius series that starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7657235/1/Path-of-the-King][Path of the King]] (Fate/Stay Night)

- Shirou becomes a super hero. Or something like that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10784770/1/Harry-Potter-Geth][Harry Potter: Geth]] (Harry Potter/Mass Effect Crossover)

- Hermione fucks up and sends Harry flying through time. He crashes into a planet and ends up being made into a Geth.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6154638/1/The-Hill-of-Swords][Hill of Swords]] (Familiar of Zero/Fate/Stay Night Crossover)

- Shirou gets summoned by Louise as a familiar. Fun story. Lots and lots of swords.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9340220/1/Crosswinds-of-Fate][Crosswinds of Fate]] (Harry Potter/Fate/Stay Night Crossover)

- Rin and her harem visit the Potterverse to study what makes the wizard's magic different than the magi's. This one's really well-written, doesn't have any overpowered stomping going on, and my summary doesn't do it justice.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9891823/1/Wail-of-the-Banshee][Wail of the Banshee]] (Worm/Warframe Crossover)

- Fuck that bug triggering bullshit! This one gives Taylor a motherfucking warframe! Oh, and there's some stuff about the Corpus invading Brockton Bay for tinkers. I love this story.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-cloudy-path-worm-supreme-commander.3604/][A Cloudy Path]] (Worm/Supreme Commander Crossover)

- Taylor gets tinker powers that make stuff from the video game Supreme Commander. The second best tinker Taylor.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/seed-a-worm-au.340626/][Seed]] (Worm AU)

- Taylor gets Blasto's powers and decides to clean the fuck out of the Bay. The best Tinker Taylor.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/][Dire Worm]] (Worm/The Best OC to ever OC)

- A Doctor Doom expy shows up in Brockton Bay and blows shit up. Probably my second favorite story from the Wormverse.

Edit: And in case anyone (nobody probably) was wondering what my favorite fic is, it's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/to-be-a-queen-worm-fate-stay-night.339838/][To Be a Queen]]. It's a Worm/Fate crossover where instead of getting Bug powers and the remarkable talent of escalation, Taylor comes out of that locker with the Gates of Babylon and a need to put down the mongrels that /dare/ to set foot in /her/ city.


** Ooooh, you mentioned Worm fics. So, warning to people, I will later be recommending Worm fics, and the reasoning behind those may include spoilers to the main Worm story. If you've read it, congratulations on finding one of the best pieces of fiction on the internet, if you haven't, go check it out now!

But because this is HPfanfiction, I'll start by recommending linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black). It's half a million words, and while it's very different from the books, I find it rather interesting, There's intrigue, strategy, and while Harry is still the protagonist, a lot of the cast are OCs.

Now, onto Worm Fanfiction.

If you haven't already read it, drop the entire trip until you're finished with Cenotaph and its sequels. Its so good that many people (myself included) were of the belief that several aspects of it was from canon, until it was pointed out in some thread that it actually wasn't. Notes, the author, is hands-down one of the best people at writing Taylor. I cannot recommend this enough.

Another very good fic that you should have read already, but I'll mention it just in case, is Copacetic by Materia-Blade. It features Taylor after Gold Morning, trying to find peace. Yeah, that's not going to happen. Here, the cape life chose her.

Alchemical Solutions by Gromweld is a truly massive quest over on SV (some of it is on SB too, but I'm unsure if it's still being updated there). To give an idea of how large it is, a chapter was recently uploaded to the story only thread, and it was /26k words long./ In addition to that, it's very well-written, and features some truly hilarious things that occurs naturally when quests are run on SV. It's a crossover with Exalted, but it can easily be enjoyed without knowledge of it. I didn't know anything about it when I started reading it, and I fell in love with it quickly.

Amelia by TanaNari is certainly long, and while I liked it, it can drag on at times. From what I've heard, a lot of people dislike it, partly because there's a lot of power creeping, but I like the character interaction and believable munchkining.

One of my favourite fics of all time is Weaver Nine. The premise is that Taylor and Jack Slash switched places - Taylor and Harbinger were the ones to murder King, while Jack is now Jacob Hebert. It might just have the greatest battle ever written in worm fanfiction.

Butcher's Bill is rather short compared to the other fics here (just 30k words), but it has a fairly interesting premise - namely that Butcher XIV is allergic to bees, which results in Taylor becoming the new Butcher, causing her to change her game plans utterly. There's another Butcher!Taylor story called Carnage by TheMAnWithaPlan, but I believe that its dead and buried. Both are good, and they don't really overlap.

Here be Dragons by Ryuugi is another of those fics I think that every Worm fan should have read, but again, I'll mention if on the off-chance that you haven't. Features Taylor with Lung's power and... well, let's just that things escalate, as they just tend to do around Taylor. It's only medium length, but it... ends, technically, but it is a very open ending that unfortunately hasn't received a sequel yet. It's also one of the fics that makes me hesitant to say that Weaver Nine has the best fight hands-down.

Another good Ryuugi fic is Zenith, which is, unfortunately, unfinished. It's a crossover with Exalted, but you don't need to know about it to enjoy it, as with Alchemical Solutions. Taylor becomes an "Exalted" - I'm still not sure what it means exactly, but she gets a very good powerset - after the Golden Morning and uses her new powers to influence the world in a better way. It's pretty awesome.

From what I can tell, a lot of people don't like Ack's stuff, and while I haven't checked out the stuff he posts on QQ, I read most of what he posts on SB. While most of it doesn't qualify for long, his story Recoil has about 250k words, and still unfinished. He's got some other stuff, with my personal favorites at the moment being Hostage Situation, Wyvern, Alea Iacta Est, and Another Way.

Maharal by joethirteen has Golem from a few months after Golden Morning sent back to the 1990s, with him eventually becoming part of the Chicago Wards. Plenty of awesomeness, but the character interactions are also very good.

There's probably things I missed, but that should last you for hours, if not days. :)

Also, I've got a question of my own. How much would you lose out on when reading To Be a Queen if you haven't read FSN? If it outranks Dire Worm, which is one of my all-time favorite fics, it's gotta be good.

*** I don't think that you'd lose out on that much if you haven't watched Fate/Stay Night. Personally I'd recommend that you watch Fate/Zero instead because it's got great action sequences and better characters than Fate/Stay Night. But regardless, neither of them are all that necessary.

All you really need to know for the fic is Gilgamesh's powers and personality. Over his time as a real person he collected tons and tons of treasures, from swords to armor to a potion that turns you into a kid. His power is to summon anything in his vaults whenever he wants. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bWJ6FKPakM][Here's]] him fighting berserker in Fate/Zero. It should clarify things if I messed up my explanation.

Edit: Admittedly my views of the fic may be a bit rose tinted since I think Gilgamesh is the greatest character to ever character, but it should still a fun read.

** Well this list got larger than I expected. C'est La Vie and HP & BWL are my personal favorite fics. Rent-A-Hero and Fallen God are my favorite that are frequently updated.

linkffn(Out of the Dark and into the Green) Harry lives with an old man in a forest, no slash. Goes to Hogwarts years late.

linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero) Harry gets pulled into an alternate dimension to help with their Voldemort problem. He is not happy about it. Divination Harry is a lot of fun.

linkffn(A Fallen God) Loki ends up a disembodied spirit and latches on to Harry since he already had a parasite. Humor later on is great, story moves quickly.

linkffn(Just Another Orphan) Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Harry is just another orphan. Slytherin Harry.

linkffn(What You Leave Behind) Following the fall of Voldemort the ministry finds out about the actions of the vigilante group The Order of the Phoenix and Albus Dumbledore is exiled.

linkffn(Travel Secrets: First) Harry, in his late 20's, finds out something that makes him so angry he goes back in time just to spite people. Good guys aren't necessarily.

linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel) Harry is drunk and doesn't know whats going on.

linkffn(A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story) Alternate dimension time travel. Harry springs Sirius from prison and they pretend Harry is his son. Slytherin Harry.

linkffn(My Friend Tom) There's a voice in Harry's head, and it has a name.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi) Unchallenged as a first year Harry looks for a mentor, all the professors refuse, except Quirrel. Harry transfers to Durmstrang.

linkffn(In Bad Faith) A fanfiction dies and wakes up as... Draco's sister. I can't make this sound appealing no matter how hard I try. Just read it.

linkffn(C'est La Vie) Suffering from the memories and effects of war Harry medicates with alcohol, and seclusion. Fate offers Harry a chance at a new life and he wakes up at a 14 year old transfer student to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, James and Lily are alive, and Harry Potter is a git.

linkffn(Growing Up Black) Recognized by a squib businessman of house Black, Harry is taken from Private drive and raised as Sirius' son.

linkffn(Broken Chains) Following Sirius through the veil Harry finds himself long long ago, in a galaxy far far away. Then he comes back. Sith Harry.

linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) The Dursleys abandon Harry near the woods. He lives in the trees and does magic. That means he's an elf.

linkffn(Control) For 13 minutes Harry lets go and does what he wants to. Then he gets arrested. Dark Harry.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

** Hm, these may not be your cup of tea, but here are some good ones I recently read, all found on FFN

*Vitam Paramus* - TheEndless7 (200k+)

- Harry/Gabrielle. Very slow paced, but really in depth characterization. Doesn't really have much to do with magic , but it is one of my favorite reads on a friday with white wine and blankets.

*Team 8* - S'Tarkan (200k+)

- Naruto AU where he is on... Team 8 (with Hinata!! squeals) Sometimes explanation of certain character decisions is a bit cop-outy but not actually too bothering, and I say this as a reader with very strict requirements in regards to writing. I'm in the middle of this one.

*Game of Champions* - L. Lamora (120k)

- Unique pokemon storytelling. Haven't read any other pokemon fics that I've liked really.

*Ice and Fire* - AlSmash (350k+)

- Code Geass AU. Read this a long time ago but I remembered liking it a lot, but maybe I was influenced by shipping and youth. If this doesn't work out for you I think some of the ones with a high favorite count are good though.

*Coffee Girl* - Peacewish (42k)

- Yugioh, Seto/Serenity. Cute, cliched, and probably very flawed, but it was also written in 2004 and I love it because it was one of the first fics I've read. If you like fluff :)

I didn't like Wastelands or AQ, but I loved Worm, so who knows. No Mary Sues in the first 3 for sure. Also check the Gen Rec thread, though personally I found a lot of the fics there to not really be that great. I might update with some more fics to help you out, 15 hours is a lot.

This is an excellent story, and I second the recommendation if you've ever played Pokemon or watched the anime.

If you're open to other Pokemon fic recs, linkffn(Pedestal by Digital Skitty) takes a short while to get started but it's really good - and complete as well. There's a few weird spots where the author has randomly inserted crap (I think these were meant to be April Fools chapters at the time) but other than that it's one of the best-written and most entertaining stories I've read, and unlike most Pokemon stories it's not about becoming teh sooper hax0rs l33t trainer who wins every fight.

** *Roundabout Destiny*, linkffn(8311387): Hermione travelled back in time and was reborn as Hermione Potter, fixed up several well known "bad guys", and made things a lot better.

*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382): it's one of my favorite HP fanfics. Harry and his three girls make an intelligent and powerful (but not overpowered) team.

*Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), a Harry/Bellatrix story. I was very skeptical at start, but thought to give it a try based on 9000+ favorites. Now it has become one of my favorite HP fanfics. The story is creative, credible, funny, and contains tons of intrigues.

*Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650): Another one of my favorite. It's a very emotional story with excellent writing.

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*: linkffn(10595005), pairs Harry/Hermione as ruthless politicians/revolutionaries. Bloodthirsty and vindictive readers will like it.

Decent quality, sort of sue-ish, really fucking long (million words). What I'm more interested in is the fact that you described Crosswinds of Fate as "Rin and her Harem". You and I have similar tastes, my friend.

** I really hope you've read the entire Alexandra Quick series so far. It does get better after the first book, and the fourth book is my favourite fic in all of the HP fandom.

Other than that, I strongly suggest, based on what fics you /have/ read, linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool). It's not ultra-long, only about 77k words, but it's hilarious and clever and beautifully written and makes all sorts of allusions to other works that only magnify its glory. linkffn(Shadow Walks) is also pretty good, and again, it's not overly long (around 84k words) but it's Harmony /without the bashing and character derailment./ A fic that I nearly always rec that's on the longer side is linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty) - it's about 150k words, the pairing is an unusually well-written Bellatrix/Hermione, and it's gut-wrenching (in the good way).

If you don't mind Avatar: The Last Airbender fics, there is one that's astoundingly good that I should probably rec. linkffn(Retroactive by loopy777) is a FANTASTIC fic that is really interesting to read, and 190k words long.

As I don't feel I have any ability to summarize it without spoiling it I'll just say this, it was good enough that people write fanfiction about this story, there are two repositories for Omakes about it that are each over 300k words and at the very least two different smutfics about it, although the story itself lacks anything in the terms of smut within. linkffn(9586702)
