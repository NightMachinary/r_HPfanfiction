Now, what we learned about it in PoA is totally fine, you entrust a secret to a secret keeper, he's the only one who can share it with others. It has to be given willingly. (At least I think that's a part of it) The issue comes in Deathly Hallows, when Hermione says something like “after Dumbledore's death, everyone who he told is now the secret keeper.” That doesn't make any sense. The whole thing in Prisoner of Azkaban was that Sirius would rather die than betray his friends. Except him dying if he's the secret keeper would weaken the secret and make it a lot more easier for Voldemort to get it out of somebody else who Sirius told. I might be missing something, but it doesn't make much sense to me.


** That's interesting, I never really thought about it, but the best way to break a Fidelius isn't to torture the secret keeper for the information, it's to just kill them and then go after the much wider pool of less badass people that had access to the place. They would presumably break much more easily than the person specifically chosen for this.

Which means nobody should have believed for a second that Sirius was the Potter's secret keeper: what kind of idiot would make someone actively fighting in the war and at risk of dying at any moment their secret keeper. It would make much more sense for it to be some nobody hidden very far away, or at least someone that stayed out of the way---and it was!

**** That's true, but the other side would have that same revelation: if you were Voldemort looking into the identity of the Potter secret keeper, would you believe Sirius was it? Or would you go look for an associate of the Potters that went into hiding or isn't around anymore?

Maybe I'm just putting too much strategic thinking where there shouldn't be, on any sides: James isn't Moody, he is just a young man right out of school, who of course would pick his best friend---and he does. Voldemort might correctly deduces that or learn of it through spies, and Sirius notices that problem and secretly picks someone else. Then the story itself punishes him for being prudent by making the new secret keeper just happen to be a traitor, because the story needs its inciting incident to happen /somehow/. Plus sweet sweet Drama.

James would tell his friends immediately. If it was me, I would have done the charm and started a food garden. Then I would have stocked up on toiletries because they don't spoil. Then I would have gotten materials to sew, and knit incase of any torn clothing. And of course, things for entertainment. This way the secret isn't leaving the house. I wonder if a baby can be the secret keeper?

The fact that killing the secret keeper turns everyone who has been told the secret into secret keepers means that the Fidelius charm has weaknesses/vulnerabilities. But that, to me, is /good/ worldbuilding. The Fidelius Charm /should/ have weaknesses, and there are probably more ways around it that we don't know about.

It only failed the first time because they gave the secret to a fucking Death Eater. Yeah, he wasn't known as one, but your argument flies out the window when you remember he only failed to protect Harry and Fam because they gave it to a traitor instead of a steadfast non-traitor.

****** Dumbledore knew Sirius for a whole long while. Lily and James tell him they trust that he'll keep the secret, and he thinks "yeah, that's a good choice." then Sirius betrays them. Dumbledore knew Sirius. He knew he'd never betray his friends, but somehow he did.

Two possibilities therefore exist:

One, Voldemort got to Sirius. Either he turned in secret, which is unlikely given his everything, or he was somehow turned so completely that the secret was forfeit, which is even worse.

Two, the Fidelius is unsafe, and Voldemort found a way to pierce it. Unlikely, since Sirius confessed on the scene to killing them.

What this means is that the Fidelius is generally unsafe. Somehow, its enchanent can be overcome, and Voldemort knows how. Dumbledore cannot beat Voldemort, that much is certain, and he is unsure if his occlumency is strong enough to keep him out of his mind. What this means is that the likeliest possibility is that Voldemort, given the chance, might do the same thing to him which he did to Sirius, and corrupt his mind completely, or somehow tear the secret from his mind like he might've done to Sirius.

Only when it was revealed that the Fidelius isn't as fragile as he thought, when Sirius is cleared in his eyes, does he risk it again. Before that, all he knew was that somehow, Voldemort found a way to break the charm or the secret keeper.

******** Thanks.

Your situation doesn't make sense for two reasons, though:

First, even if Sirius gave the secret to one of Voldemort's spies, that spy would be unable to tell, because Sirius is still the secret keeper. So Voldemort could not have gone himself.

Second, the secret has to be given away through free will. You cannot be tortured into giving it up, coercion doesn't work. In these situations, even the secret keeper becomes unable to reveal it. You have to give it away intentionally, with full knowledge that you are doing it and to whom.

The blood protection is the objectively superior choice. If the Dursleys weren't such despicable animals, Harry would have lived a completely ordinary life - no inflated ego from being worshipped, no danger from Voldemort or his followers, a muggle education in place of (probably) homeschooling, and no harassment from papparazzi or reporters like Skeeter.

He likely knew they Durlsey's wouldn't be great, but thought maybe they would come around but not tell him about magic. Then when they didn't, he would tell himself that Harry was safer there still.

I don't excuse his actions, but he most likely had extremely outdated views on childrearing, given that he was born in 1881.

** Obviously it exists as the plot device that JKR needed. However what got me is Why in the world wouldn't you want the Secret Keeper to be one of the people that the Fidelius Charm is protecting? Eg. Make Lily the secret keeper.

The biggest vulnerability of the charm is that it requires you to trust another person who isn't being protected by the charm. Which means mechanics of the charm always risks you being betrayed because you have to rely on someone else.

*** There's a potential explanation for this. It could be that you can't be Secret Keeper of the Secret you own. So the Secret here would be that the Potters are hiding at their home. The Potters are the subject of the Secret and the location is their own property.

Then there's Shell Cottage, but that could maybe be explained away with the home being owned by Aunt Muriel rather than Bill and Fleur, so Bill is able to be the Secret Keeper. Or maybe Bill excluded himself so he would still be findable in the location but nobody else could be? Or the Fidelius Charm was improved in the years.

**** The theory of Bill being able to be Secret Keeper because he didn't own the house holds some merit, but your second theory doesn't seem to. If someone is looking to get to Harry through a Weasley, Bill is the person in the house people will be looking for, so excluding him from the protection isn't helpful. If someone is trying to take out Fleur, all they have to do is find Bill and destroy the house at dinnertime or something similar. Also, the charm protects the secret of the house, not the people. Grimaud Place was hidden even when no one but Kreacher was in it during Sirius' time in Azkaban, and each person that went through the house didn't have to be added to the protection, merely told the secret.

There was no Fidelius on Grimmauld while Sirius was in Azkaban.

All the other stuff was just based on Flitwick's words that Voldemort could place his nose against the Potters window and still not see them. Dunno if it the rest of the text supports such an idea, but there's a little bit that suggests it's the /idea/ that is hidden, not the location itself.

And I guess I don't remember everything canon perfectly (too many headcanons), but the location is definitely hidden, not just the idea. It's not like people could see/find Grimmauld Place just because they weren't looking for the headquarters of the Order of the Pheonix. Clearly JKR wasn't as meticulous about this bit if lore as she was about certain other thing, but it really does seem to hide the whole place, not just the idea of what or where said place is.

** The willing component also seems to go down in importance as it goes along in the series - in Deathly Hallows, when Hermione explains how she thinks they all became Secret Keepers after Dumbledore died, she also says that she took Yaxley in - but she didn't do that willingly, he grabbed on to her when she disapparated. In the same way, a piece of paper with the secret on it can seemingly be used as a blanket reveal - even if the secret keeper didn't mean to reveal it to person X.

So I think 'willingly' has to be reduced down to 'not coerced with mind-spells' - like the imperius or legilimancy seem to be off limits, but anything else can be twisted around to be 'willing'.

To me, a more logical situation with the death of the secret keeper is the degradation of the spell - but that's just how I understand/view it.

In any case, it's pretty clear that JKR set down the rules she needed for PoA, then let the Fidelius hang around in the background, and revised it for what she wanted to happen in the last few books. So the weird disconnect comes from those changes, because it was revised later.

** Well, you kind of need to know someone else who knows the secret, right?

Like, suppose Sirius is the Secret Keeper but he never actually tells anyone else the Secret except, say, a random muggle he met on holiday in Iceland. Now, killing Sirius doesn't get Voldemort anywhere unless Sirius reveals that Mrs Figg knows the location.

In other words, we might imagine an AU fic where Voldemort breaks down Sirius' door but Sirius commits suicide immediately and the Potters therefore don't get killed. But since no-one knows who the Secret Keeper is the Potters are kind of /too/ well protected.

Of course, this wouldn't happen in practice because that would be very lonely and therefore would tempt the Potters to leave safety. It would also be completely impractical for the purposes of the Order since they need people to be able to get to their HQ. But it does explain Sirius' reasoning and the logic still holds true even if Sirius told more people and some of them were guessable. Voldemort is still faced with the problem that he's got to (a) find someone who /really does/ know the Secret and (b) get it out of them before they, too, die and cause him to start over.

So, yes, this is another flaw in the strength of the Fidelius Charm's protection, but it isn't as big a flaw as it might seem at face value. After all, the big problem with Number 12 was that one of the Secret Keepers was (thought to be) a Death Eater, right? Not that there were heaps of Secret Keepers /per se/.

** It also doesn't make any sense regarding the house in Godric's Hollow becoming a monument. (Is that canon? So many fics...) How does the wizarding world know where the house is if Peter's in hiding and not telling anyone the secret?

*** Depending on the secret, the fidelius may no longer be active. If the secret was that The Potters live at 47 Godric's Hollow (number randomly chosen), once they die and Harry is taken to the Dursley's, the fidelius is no longer in affect, as the Potters are no longer residing at that location.

**** I think there was a line in Deathly Hallows something like “The Fidelius died with James and Lily” so for some reason it was linked to them being alive even though Peter was the Secret Keeper

***** So it depends on the wording of the secret being kept? 'James and Lily Potter live at...' stops being relevant once James and Lily are dead, so the fidelius fails.

Wouldn't that make 'The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix is at #12...' fail once the Order stops using Grimmauld after Dumbledore's death?

*** Wasn't the house abandoned, and only Harry could see it because he was in the Fidelius (from when he was a baby), and he had to tell Ron and Hermione the house was there when they visited in DH? Or is that from fanon too?

Anyway, the actual monument was a statue, in Godric's Hollow but in public. And people scribbled notes for Harry....somewhere. The cemetery??? I don't remember.

**** I think you are talking about fanon.

In the book, home was made monument which both harry and hermione ( ron was not with them ) were able to see. There was a notice board describing the importance of the house and people had scribbled messages for harry on it.

And their statue was also present near cemetery.

** There's a fanfic that comes up with "another" vulnerability of the Fidelius charm that I thought was interesting.

He finds out about it after looking at some cryptic paperwork from the Obliviators. Due to this he figures out a flaw in the Fidelius charm. As it's name suggests it's a variation of a time travel story. It's recently been completed ~95K words and is called Dapne's Letter from the Future by TomHRichardson

*** And you're just gonna make us read a whole fic to find out what it is? I can't stand Harmony, and just a half hour here has made me see that many people hate bashing. Please just tell me the weakness.

**** Sure. Though the story is a Harry/Daphne/Hermione. Spoiler alert for those who want to read the story. And remember it's a weakness that the fic author decided to create.

It seems in this story the Obliviators were sent out over the years roughly 5 times after a plane crash involving magic. Harry realizes that the code they use refers to the Fidelius charm as the magic contributing/causing the crash. He then decides to run a couple of tests with Bill Weasleys help setting the charm. It seems by trial and error Harry sees that the charm is actually the shape of a cylinder around the item/building being protected.

He also finds out that the charm weakens/disappears the further away from the ground you go. So at ground level he finds the edge of the fidelius charm and then climbs up in altitude keeping touch with the charm's boundary. When he can no longer feel the boundary (roughly 1200 feet) he moves "forward" and he can now see what the charm had been protecting.

So he now has a way of finding Fidelius protected deatheater facilities so he can attack them.

****** Well when you consider that it seems that typically no one flies higher than 300-400 feet it's a silly flaw that was unlikely to be discovered unintentionally.

If you read the story Harry figures out a way to improve the charm to eliminate this flaw so he could modify his properties.

Included in this letter is a Muggle envelope addressed to Harry Potter from his much-older self.Daphne's letter reveals that elderly Daphne and elderly Harry, after each had outlived a spouse, got married. Marrying Harry Potter, elderly Daphne assures young Daphne, was the best thing to ever happen to elderly Daphne in her long life.Elderly Daphne also tells her teenaged self---Sirius Black's just-read will emancipates almost-sixteen-year-old Harry Potter and grants him the Lordship of the House of Black. In turn, emancipating the Potter Heir turns him into Lord Potter. Harry Potter gaining two Lordships means he'll need two wives. Young Daphne, why wait till you need a cane before you become betrothed to the best man in Wizarding Britain?This is an alt-universe GreenPot Harmony (H/Hr and HP/DG) story that bashes Albus Dumbledore and Ron Weasley.
