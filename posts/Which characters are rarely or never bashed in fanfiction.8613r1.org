Remember that Harry is an unreliable narrator so the whole "Arthur doesn't know what a rubber duck is" and generally being clumsy around muggle stuff could simply be explained away as him trying to put Harry at ease after getting away from the Dursleys.

It's been a while since I've read canon though, so maybe I'm missing something glaring. But my interpretation of Arthur was never that he was an idiot, a lovable father figure that puts more stock in honesty than careerism, but never an idiot.

** Define 'bash'.

Pretty much everybody has an evil version out there. I don't usually consider that bashing.

If you limit it to 'author portraying character in a certain way to expose percieved flaws in the original character', then you do get some that get away easy.

Most teachers besides the three main ones get a pass. Flitwick comes to mind. Also, most students that have limited screen time (Susan, Katie).

Luna does seem mostly immine, but I think that is mostly because a negative portrayal of 'not quite with reality' would be some kind of mental illness and usually authors just prefer to cut the character out entirely than deal with that.

**** The point with Luna is that you can't really bash her since she's the odd but kind girl with some good insights. If you remove her good qualities and overdo her bad ones, you still have just an odd, maybe rude girl. Whereas is you do the same mental gymnastics for Ron or Hermione, you get mercenary friends with petty motivations working either for Dark Lord Dumbledore or Moldyshorts. Luna doesn't really have that potential.

***** I wouldn't touch those with a ten-foot pole. But apparently Harry/Ginny stories are either Ron/Hermione or Hermione bashing, same with Daphne, Fleur and Tonks pairings. The authors have no idea what to do with Harry's friends, so they either get paired together (in H/G ships mostly) or Neville becomes substitute Ron for the Neville/Hermione or both bashed.

** Outside of some extremely silly attempts, not sure I've seen Lily-bashing. The closest is I think I read a fic where the implication was that she & James were idiots for giving Sirius and then Peter the Secret instead of Dumbledore. Which is ridiculous since they'd have less reason to trust their school headmaster (powerful wizard or not) over actual close friends they've had for a decade.

I've seen the occasional Hermione bashing, but it never really comes off believably since she was a lonely kid and it's hard for me to empathize with bashing a character like that. Like with Ron (while overdone and often done to the extreme) I can get why you'd bash him. Even Dumbledore I can get, to a limited extent (Greedy Dumbledore is a stupid idea though). But many characters being bashed is just boring.

I'd be OK with more Weasley twin bashing.
