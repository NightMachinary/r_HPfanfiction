So I think most of us read the books (it's okay if you didn't we're not here to judge) so we all know how JKR described the Dursleys. It's true, we can all agree that they are horrible people who shouldn't have been entrusted with the welfare of a child, that being said I don't think it's right to use Vernon and Dudley's weight to make fun of them. A lot of people struggle with eating disorders and have to go through strict diets. No one wants to de called "whale" , or described as "Wider than tall". It's one of the things I like the least about the books, and I hope fanfiction writers could avoid writing about it because sorry but it's just disrespectful. Fatshaming is not okay and never will be.


** Look, I do not like the idea of being fat/overweight is somehow tied with moral failure. That's just not right.

However, in regards to the Dursleys, I think we might look at things in a slightly different light, than when referring to Neville, for example.

The books, and most fanfiction is written from Harry's point of view. His uncle and cousin are abusive assholes who made Harry's life miserable. I'd say it's completely understandable that he might refer to them both in a way that shows their physique in a negative light.

He refers to Petunia by saying she has a horse's neck, too. These are people he disdains, and his views of them reflects that. Harry's a human being, and we all do things like that.

** Pretty much all the bad characters are described as ugly, not uncommon in children's literature.

*** Actually let me correct you, a lot of people are genetically predisposed to be overweight, in some cases its not something that you can easily change. The you aren't born fat part is wrong too, while babies are normally chubby and tend to lose the fat while groing up, if the mother is overweight/suffers from diabetes the newborn baby can weigh more than normal. Moving to your other point, the overweight = impulse control issues part just makes no sense to me, feel free to judge people over their weight that will just make you sound disrespectful, I can easily prove you wrong by pointing out that Mrs.Weasley is overweight and never abused her kids.

**** Actually let me correct /you/. Weight is controllable. It might be more difficult for some, but for about 99% of the population it's just a simple eating less than you consume.

***** I didn't claim it's not, I said it is easier to control in certain persons than in others. Which is literally not the point of my post. I was merely pointing out how we should judge persons by their actions and not their weight which is pretty much irrelevant.

** u/killer_quill:
#+begin_quote
  described as "Wider than tall"
#+end_quote

That's a fairly common and pretty whimsical way of describing a person who is, shall we say, /rounded/.

At the end of the day people are going to remark upon physical appearance. If even describing said appearance is construed as insulting then that's on you. I don't throw a shitfit whenever someone disparages a character experiencing hair loss, there's bigger things to worry about in life.

** Aside from moral and ethical concerns (which I very much agree with the OP on), it strikes me as lazy writing. Fat=bad is so ridiculously easy a route to take, that when I see it used frequently I don't expect much in terms of sophistication and insight from a story.

EDIT: of course, JKR does this as OP notes. And it's not just the Dursleys. Crabbe/Goyle, Slughorn, young 'chubby' Neville, the H-named Smith lady from whom Riddle takes Hufflepuff's cup...Heavier characters in canon are either bad or weak somehow.

It's like making clumsiness the beautiful heroine's great "flaw" (meant to humanize her and show she isn't perfect). How very deep and insightful (extreme sarcasm here).

***** So what? Sure, Death Eater apologism is a worryingly prevalent scourge, and I'd consider it a worse problem than fat-shaming, but not writing Death Eater apologism and not writing fat-shaming content are in no way mutually exclusive. There's no need to frame this like a zero-sum game.

** I definitely agree that fat shaming and the lazy trope of carrying extra weight suggesting moral failings is one of the problematic elements of the books, and indeed, indicative of the views of JKR too. As we've come to realise, she holds views that many in the HP fandom circles would disagree with.

And just as there is so much wonderful fanfic that supports LGBT people and issues, I hope that we can also find room to support the acceptance of all body types.

*** No we won't, because it's a non issue as well as most of the other types of virtue signalling you seem to be oh so big about. Stop making life more compilcated than it is. Not everything is a personal insult however much you'd like it to be that way.

**** Wanting to not be perpetually cast as a morally bankrupt human being because I like cake is virtue signalling? Someone who is gay, lesbian, bi, trans or ace wanting to see positive Characters who share those traits with them is virtue signalling? How about people with disabilities that might also like to see fictional role models to whom they can relate?

There's precious few of any of these in published literature, though thankfully it is becoming more common. Many people were first able to explore these issues through fic, which I'd like to see retain that supportive ethos that has helped so many. Not have people try to shut others out, or make judgements on their morality.
