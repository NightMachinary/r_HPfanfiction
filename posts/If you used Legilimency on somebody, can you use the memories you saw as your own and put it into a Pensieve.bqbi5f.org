Let's say Dumbledore managed to look into Voldemort's mind, and he saw something he wanted to show to Harry, can he use the Pensieve to do it? It's technically your memory of somebody else's memory, but I'm not sure if that's how the Pensieve works.


** So, legilimency is when you read the mind of another magically. If you can later remember that, you have a memory of seeing something. provided you aren't bound by contract or something like the fidelius, which would stop you from sharing the memory - and perhaps even then through loopholes - you can extract the memory the same way as any other memory. then you can put that in a penseive.

So, in short, yes. Unless the rules of magic in a universe somehow prevent that, that works.

***** They see the memory but in a very different way from how the event was initially experienced. We have no way of knowing how things would change if the process was repeated on itself; it honestly seems likely that the person viewing a memory of a memory would be able to see the initial viewer moving around in the memory, much like it was portrayed in the movies (in which case the camera would be the person viewing the nested memories).

**** Well, how is it not? One may argue that it is memory reading, but reading memories is still mind reading. Harry's occlumency lessons, somewhat tainted by snape as they were, do indicate that clearing mind = no thoughts make it harder to read minds, meaning memory trawling works by grasping a thought and going through the memories connected to that, then memories connected to those, and so on. Modern psychology - and really even medieval psychology on this particular matter - states that memories are connected to each other, and you remember stuff by searching for relevant memories and those linked to them. There always is the possibility that some natural laws irl don't apply to the HP world, but this seems probable to me.

***** It's not because it's explicitly stated in canon to be not (see my other comment with quotes). When viewing memories in Harry Potter, we consistently find that the observer views things from a different perspective than the person who first experienced the memory, suggesting that the process is different from simply playing back their memory like a recording. This also aligns with what we know about memory in real life; our memories are incredibly malleable, and really we only remember certain key elements, reconstructing the rest with varying degrees of accuracy.

****** I personally think legilimency is kinda stupid because minds dont work that way - it should be impossinle for one person's menory structures to be deciphered by the mind of the other person. And if the spell does that as well, then it would be simpler to cast it with more magic behind it, maybe chain multiple spells together to read the memories than a single spell which can only follow one train of memories. This would be easy ro handle on the legilimencer's side if they are master occlumens, and voldy's considered the best master at legilimency in all of britain, and is also a master occlumens, making it easily possible. Voldy's also (probably) made his flight spell, and I think he is good enough at magic to make spells anyways, and if he's the best master of a spell, he probably can change the spell to remove any possible reason it can't be multi - cast, and that was NEVER seen in the series, even when voldy tried legilimens-ing harry

So, to sum that textwall up, voldy's either impossibly stupid at the art he's the master of, or legilimency is a broken spell

  "He can read minds?" said Harry quickly, his worst fears confirmed.

  "You have no subtlety, Potter," said Snape, his dark eyes glittering. "You do not understand fine distinctions...Only Muggles talk of 'mind reading.' The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure."

*** Oh, and master occlumens can create and plant false memories in canon iirc, so they can modify the memories of them seeing others' memories to only include the other menory.

On the other hand, if the penseive works by actually sending the person back in time or divining the past, then possibly not, given the experience of legilimency is like having two bodies - yours 'IRL' and the legilimensed person. So, if dumbledore removes the input from his real eyes and ears and stuff, depending on the way magic works in your world, it can go either way

** Personally I don't think so. Pensieves are pretty weird, they don't show actual memories. Pensieves show what really happened at some point in time around the person who extracts the "memory", not just what the person remembers. Real memories just aren't as accurate as the stuff we see in Pensieves. Either when you extract the "memory" or when the pensieve uses it, the actual memory is just used as a reference for what you want to show, and the real events around that memory are reconstructed through weird magic. So when you try to extract a memory that you stole from someone using legilimency you would instead just get the memory of stealing it, or maybe no memory at all.

Or maybe not, Canon never really explains any of this and it's quite confusing. Maybe wizards have some kind of magical memory that lets them perfectly remember anything that ever happened to them, even the details they couldn't have noticed, but the only way to access that memory is with a pensieve or with legilimency.

If you're writing a fic, just invent a way how it works and stick to it. If you decide that watching legilimency memories in a pensieve works, make sure that it works consistently and not only when the plot demands it.

** I am of the opinion that *pensieves* work as a player to reproduce recorded memories, regardless of the source.

​

Okay, in short, if we go back to the source for reference, Dumbledore used other people's memories to see what happened in some of the trials against the Death Eaters, and some of Riddle's early life, I think. But they don't see them from the perspective of the person who provided the memory. Instead, they stand in a spatial recreation that the person who provided the memory made on a subconscious level, just as he or she remembers it.

​

Now, if someone obtains such memory through legilimency, by reproducing it in a pensieve they would see the environment as the person from whom the memory was extracted remembers it, and not as the one who extracted it would remember it. The person extracting the memory maybe wasn't even there at all, so it would make sense that the pensieve used their perspective to create the reference for the environment.

​

Now, we have to keep in mind that using l*egilimency* is not like diving into a pensieve and watching scenes unfold around you. If someone used legilimency on a second person, he would not watch the person's memories as if he were standing in a different position from the other person. The caster would see exactly the same as the other person saw when that memory was created. It would be as if it were the caster himself who were remembering that memory. For me, when someone performs legilimency, they are creating a copy of a memory they want to extract, and store it in their minds. Later, it can be extracted and used in a pensieve so others can watch it too. Think of it like making a DVD rip to make a torrent later.

​

So, to use your example, if Dumbledore looked into Voldemort's mind, he would see the memory from Voldemort's perspective, but he would store it in his own mind, as if the memory was originally his. Then he could take that memory so others could see it. Once in the pensieve, though, the observers would be free from Voldemort's perspective. They could stand or move around as they choose in the recreated space provided by Voldemort. It would be as if Voldemort himself had provided the memory. Dumbledore just acted as a delivery man.

​

Let's create a different hypothetical situation. When Harry dreams about Nagini attacking Arthur, he has the dream from the snake's perspective. If he stored the memory of that dream into a pensieve and let others watch it, they would see the memory from "outside". Even Harry himself could be able to review the memory from an outside perspective. They could stand in the spacial recreation that the snake made in her mind when she was "recording" that memory, and watch the attack from outside the snake's perspective. They wouldn't be forced to watch it from the snake's eyes, as was Harry when he had the dream. They dream acted like a legilimency connection, allowing him to "extract" the memory, just as if were someone else extracting a regular memory. When they play it in a pensieve, they could see it from their own perspective and move around freely inside the memory.

​

It's a simple concept in my head, but my english is not the best of the world, so forgive me if I made things confusing and repetitive.

** Probably not.

Pensieve memory viewing is not done from the same perspective as the person the memory comes from- its outside the body and you can walk around and look at stuff. So you would have no idea that W1 was leglimizing W2, and would have no way to see what W1 was seeing.

*** Ok, if I get this right, you're thinking of viewing the moment when someone extracts the memories from somebody else, not the memory itself. It's a bit of a situation like with the Erised mirror, Quirrel couldn't get the stone because he was thinking what he was going to do with it, instead of just acquiring the stone itself.

​

What OP asked is if you could used an extracted memory in a pensieve, not watch the moment when that memory was extracted. If the latter were the case, I would agree with you. We would stand next to two people, and we would see one of them pointing their wand to the other and then they would just stand there barely moving while their mind was being read. But we wouldn't see the extracted memory in question.

​

I already tried to explain my perspective of it a little in another comment in this same thread, so I won't repeat myself here and make this comment longer than it should be, but I recommend you read that comment to see if it all makes a little more sense to you.

** Stealing Witches did something similar to this. The muggleborns were looking over a memory of a memory of a memory of something that happened thousands of years ago. Every generation or so someone would watch and translate the recording to keep it up to date.
