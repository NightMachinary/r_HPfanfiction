:END:
A seer type fic, where harry had to write down predictions for divination class. Turns out the gods gave him a gift, whatever he writes will come true. I remember someone stole his book to try to use it, but the book was not special. In the end he uses his gift to take away his gift from humanity

Help please!


** I believe this is the one you're looking for?

  Trelawney gives an assignment at the beginning of fifth year. This leads to the revelation of a power that Harry didn't know he had. A power that no one expected. Least of all the Dark Lord. A power he knew not. Harry decides to change everything with his new book. Being able to shape the future to how you want took a lot of vision. No one could have predicted this. A/N: SLASH*

*** Was going to suggest the same story myself. Fairly sure it's the only one like that so that should be the one they are looking for.

**** Because of the plot or the voldemort/harry pairing? I haven't read it myself, just curious to know why. If its the pairing, completely understandable.
