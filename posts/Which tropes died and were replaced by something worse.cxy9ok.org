The "soul bond" market seems to have died an ignoble death when that made up a serious percentage of works around the 2010-2011 mark as I recall, yet seems to have made way for all this weird A/B/O stuff that in the best cases appears to be just "soul-bond" under a different name and at worse an excuse to justify blood purity "racism" (typically dominant Draco/ submissive Hermione pairings).


** I don't know how in the world the setup for a dead TV series has invaded every fandom. The Alpa/Beta/Omega dynamic (a trope itself at this point somehow) is tired af. I would say that the "Snape Fixes Thing and Redeems Himself" was a thing for a few years. Then "Ron Weasley is Bad and Irredeemable" followed closely by "Dumbledore is Evil, Ya'll".

The worst trope, though, is "Draco Malfoy is a Good Boy in a Bad Situation (Feel Bad For Him, He's Perfect)" imho.

All of these tropes suck. Fics (on average) have trouble with subtlety sometimes so it feels like we just get them shoved down our throat instead of being slowly convinced of their premise lol.

Even Pottermore had an article on that he's attempting redemption at the end (in his maybe too small way) and an article by JK on the site says he questioned his beliefs in the end and developed a conscious.

The only way to ship Malfoy with anyone other than the dementors would be an early divergence where he starts to question the pureblood ideology early on (end of 1st year), but that would make him unrecognisable compared to his canon self (but would be his fanon self from half of the fics I've read with him in).

***** Do you believe in life in prison or the death sentence for teenagers that commit crimes in real life also? I wonder how much this is the crux of the difference for people that believe he could be still redeemable at the end of the books. My worldview and scientific understanding is that a 16 year old is not an adult. All neuroscience backs this up. The prefrontal cortex isn't fully developed which is literally the part of the brain that is responsible for good decision making.

I don't personally see Voldemort or Lucius Malfoy or Umbridge as redeemable characters (nor is the suggestion the are written into the books). But Draco Malfoy is actually just a kid (even by Wizarding standards) when he commits those crimes. There's a reason we charge children and teenagers differently. And yes, there's a trend lately to start charging teenagers earlier and earlier as adults, but the medical, scientific and psychological communities are adamantly against that for a reason.

But if you believe that a) prison is for punishment and not rehabilitation and b) teenagers should be charged as adults I could see how any fic with Draco would bother you, But since we don't agree on the above premises we are arguing different things.

The trope that's he's perfect and just misunderstood was what people were agreeing with above. And I'd argue the idea he's “perfectly” evil is just as problematic a reading of his character as that he's “perfectly” good. It's black and white thinking.

Prison for attempted murder, sure as hell. And the death sentence refers to his war crimes, which is not something the average teenagers gets around to. I mean, even by the mildest sentencing, he gets life in prison since the unforgivables were his own idea.

Except that this is exactly what he has been asking for in the first five books. He called for racial purges at 12 for heaven's sake. If he was some random guy pressed into Voldemort's service that'd be one thing. But Malfoy has been his number 1 fan since book 2 at least.

And it would only take a few hours to get him and his family out of the country or under a fidelius charm. But Draco does not do that. Instead, he carries out another assassination attempt, and then another. He has no issues with killing as long as he does not have to look his victim in the eye. Also, it is never clear if his dismay comes from what is asked of him or from his fear of consequences due to his failure.

Similarly, he might've been a big Voldemort fan at first, but I'm willing to bet that didn't last much longer than his first meeting with the man (using the term 'man' loosely here).

Not saying that he shouldn't go to prison or at least be punished in some other way (bc frankly Azkaban itself is a fucking crime against humanity holy shit Magical Britain), but there are definitely valid arguments for leniency.

Of course, he has a shit ton of money and if his father could buy himself out of it with an imperius-defence, he might be able to as well.

#+begin_quote
  he's irredeemable because of past decisions
#+end_quote

I think this may be a sticking point as well. Personally, I feel Draco (through most of the series, up until the Trio were captured at Malfoy Manor and he didn't immediately rat Harry out) was irredeemable because he had /no desire to be redeemed/. He showed no remorse for his failed attempts to kill Dumbledore that nearly killed innocent bystanders, no remorse for his cruelty in previous years (some of which were schoolboy taunts and pettiness, some of which were outright assaults and blatant bigotry). His breakdown in Myrtle's bathroom /might/ charitably be contributed to not wanting to follow Voldemort's order, but it's equally as likely (and more probably) because he kept failing and he was feeling the pressure coming down on him.

At no point does he ask for help, at no point does he indicate regret. His failure to AK Dumbledore when he had him at wandpoint (another assault) can be contributed to conscience, but also to cowardice or a weak stomach. He didn't hesitate to (attempt) murder through proxy, but can't do it himself, looking someone in the eyes.

Life in prison? Debatable. But Draco absolutely deserves punishment, and fics that have him attending an 8th year with the main characters - and /especially holy fuck/ those that have him Head Boy and sharing a suite with, say, Head Girl Hermione - are utter bullshit.

Draco's been a Karma Houdini all series long, constantly foiled but never neutralized. At the end of things, he deserves his comeuppance.

************* Yeah, I agree with the majority of this and can definitely see your point on the rest. Personally, I'm more okay with 8th year fics than the ones where he goes straight into Auror training, but honestly with most fanfiction I can suspend disbelief long enough to get into the story.

My sticking point, personally, is more when he goes to the 8th year (or Auror training or spends several years in Azkaban and then gets out or whatever he's doing) is when he's /still/ not showing remorse.

I feel like the remorse and change needs to be written into the fanfic or otherwise I really can't get on board with seeing him as a redeemable character. Like I'm okay with all the change/remorse/etc happening after the end of the 7th book (ignoring the epilogue, obviously) even if sometimes it's a stretch, but show that he's redeemable. And to be completely honest, I'm writing a fanfic where I think I'm probably doing it too sloppily, but it's my first and I'm still learning how to pace/setup/etc.

At the end of the day though, most fanfiction is doing something like this - making some change that some people (and sometimes a lot of people) aren't going to agree with, and I think that's okay too. It's just part of the genre, and sometimes what makes the genre fun - imagining 200 different versions of one character. As long as it's not crazy OOC where I can't even follow along with how the character became that way, I can still get on board and enjoy the fic.

I think part of the problem is that their has been no new tropes to dethrone the old current ones so they have over stayed their welcome. I think part of it is because the books have been finished for 10 years so their arn't as many new authors with fresh ideas an perspectives takeing a stab at writeing.

I also don't think the fantastic beasts movies are very good for the state of Harry Potter fanfiction.Its been filling in cracks that didn't need to be filled in.

Controversial assertion, but: Slash is fundamental to fanfiction.

I'm writing this on my cellphone (in a hammock, whilst camping - fortunately not in the Forest of Dean) so I can't make a thesis out of it. Also, I'm not a slash reader, and don't particularly care about it. /However/. I think looking at the history of fanfiction, all the way back to its origins in the 70s (the term "slash" came from Kirck-slash-Spock fics in the Star Trek fandom, published in fanzines - also the origin of "Mary Sue") bears out my premise. The strength of a 'fic community is derived by the number and vehemence of its slash supporters, they're the pioneers and the foundations.

****** I'm going to have to disagree with that. While it's certainly true that fanfiction in the West started with slash (don't ask me about doujins in Japan, since I'm not quite sure), and that slash supporters through their passion helped spread it, slash is no longer integral to a fandom's strength. The only thing necessary for a community to be strong is the passion and continued interest in the work. Slash writers certainly have the passion and interest, probably because they can't find such stuff in mainstream media, but fairly strong fandoms can spring up with a strong aversion to slash (at least the M/M kind).

One of my plot bunnies: what about arranged/involuntary marriages? Is there a possibility of somehow to make this forced Harmony relationship to actually work? Could a couple from this position “we cannot do anything else than to be together” actually make a working marriage? We, Westerners, are completely all for the idea of the Romantic love, but I think still the reality of majority of marriages in the world are arranged marriages, isn't it? Is it really pure evil? Of course, I cannot write it, somebody from the non-Western world who actually knows what they are talking about could, but I would love to see this discussed. Soul bond situation like “Error of Soul” could be a good opportunity. Unfortunately, we have never got that.

Very much agree for that fic. There were plenty of interesting ideas thrown in. I'd actually be pretty interested in a sequel that expands upon the political consequences of Voldemort being killed by a squib with a hunting rifle... but less of the kink, /please/. And the rape scenes were /completely/ unnecessary.

Speaking of, another trope I absolutely detest is the whole "magical people are way more promiscuous than muggles because magic makes them horny... somehow". I've never encoutered a fic where it wasn't just a blatant excuse to cram consequence-free smut into the fic.

And yes “magic making people horny” is a horrible trope (and Hermione loosing virginity to Viktor Krum in fourteen, etc.).

He is not just a bully in a bad situation, the fact that even at 12 he was excited about the monster in the chamber of secrets killing other students, his easy use of racist slur and his tendency to violence and ass-kissing, plus his pure joy in humiliating others, not only his enemies but just random people who never did a thing to hurt him, make him a model character of psychopathy manifested in youth. Contrary to Snape, who redeemed himself completely while taking a huge risk, embracing others' hatred towards him and risking splitting his soul in doing the right thing, Draco can't even finish what he himself was eager to start. In the end of the day, he is careless about the life of others, but would not have bloodied his own hands (I doubt that Draco would have saved Harry from the burning necessity room). Psychopaths don't change, it's a tendency that shows itself in all sides of personality throughout a lifetime. All scenarios in which Draco turns out to be just a scared little man just don't work, not in fanfic and not in Cursed Child.
