looking for a spec. fic thats 3rd person and i could only find one ... does nobody in the ho community likes reading/writing in 3rd person narrative? its an ultimate preference for me since i get to see what other characters are thinking @ the same time but i also dont mind 1st person


** In general, 3rd person limited should be used unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise.

3rd person omniscient if you're going for like, a legendary feel, with intentional distance between the reader and the characters.

1st person if you want more focus on one character and want extra closeness between reader and character. This is also generally the best to use if you're using an unreliable narrator.

I don't really understand why people do 2nd person but it doesn't actually seem to differ much for 1st person in practice in my experience. Iirc one of the JBern stories uses it? My go to example is Fifth Season by NK Jemison where one of the PoVs was 2nd person and I felt closer to that character than the other PoVs. So maybe that one's like 1st person on steroids? But maybe don't use it for an unreliable narrator, I feel like it implies some trust. This is generally considered Advanced Technique so you shouldn't expect to see it in amateur writing like fanfiction.

*** Pretty much this, OP. The different methods have different purposes, so it's most often best to use them for those purposes. Some people'll do what method they prefer, others'll pick a method for fun/experimentation, and others'll just do them because they're new to writing and think they should.

I think third person limited is also strongly preferred here because it's what the series itself was written in. Personally, I think it's the worst perspective to write a Harry-focused fic in, because the little twit has no sense of curiosity or investigation unless someone is twenty minutes from death (I still marvel at the fact it took him four years to find out what a Death Eater was. Four bloody years!) and that perspective in a limited third person just creates massive holes due to his sheer obliviousness. It's a miracle we got names for any secondary characters in the series, it really is.

But yes. To halt that rant before it gets going, Chlorinecrown is right. Perspective has purpose, so you should use it for that purpose.

** 3rd person limited is standard (The POV the books are written in).
