Looking for fics that don't completely whitewash the Marauders... I'm very interested in them (particularly Sirius, so if you have any Sirius fics, feel free to rec them to me), but the fandom either vilifies or whitewashes them, and it's super fucking annoying. Can be AU or Canon Complaint, but please, fourth year and up. Also, nothing that characterises Sirius as an outgoing, dumb jock- this is a huge pet peeve of mine- a) none of them were dumb, and b) Sirius' school characterisation is literally the opposite of this...

EDIT: I'm completely fine with WolfStar


** You rang? I could list good Marauder fic all day.

Edit: Sorry, didn't see until it was too late that you didn't want stories that start at first year, so a few of my recs don't work. I'll leave them in in case someone else is interested.

Glass of Water by Lyin gets recommended here a lot. It takes place in the aftermath of Sirius' prank, and that aftermath is taken so seriously by all concerned that I don't think I could call it whitewashing.

linkffn(5753105)

The Outcast by Gilipin touches on how painful some of the internal dynamics of the quartet are, even though they're all well-intentioned.

linkffn(3706927)

In Marauder Lover's White Flags, there's emphasis on Sirius' past bad behavior being a problem as James/Lily grow together.

linkffn(9233100)

MarieKavanaugh does a lot of Black family fic (I think all of the authors I've mentioned so far have multiple stories) that doesn't shy away from portraying Sirius as a stubborn, difficult kid. I'll just link An Education here because that's one I really like.

linkffn(13405449)

And the Wolves All Cry by monroeslittle is after the Marauders leave Hogwarts, in a very dark AU where Voldemort's first reign lasts longer. I think the characterizations are particularly good, and Remus' self-pity thing gets called out hard although he's still loved.

linkffn(8809533)

The work of the Divine Comedian is also popular here for a reason. There's a lot of sympathy for Sirius, but no hiding the fact that he can be a lot to take. I'll link The things that lurk in the dark because there's Sirius-criticism right in the summary.

linkffn(12655315)

Stoplight Delight's unfinished epic Against the Moon is a classic for a reason. There's periodic emphasis on Remus thinking James/Sirius have gone too far (which they always have) but not stopping them, plus a hard line drawn about the different ways Sirius and Regulus behave toward house-elves.

linkffn(7305052)

You might find Star of the North's Story of Four Friends too pro-Marauder, but I've never seen James' realization that he's been a brat and needs to do better done more beautifully.

linkffn(1769213)

And I'm tossing in Hyphen's classic comedy The Speculum Curse because the entire premise is that the curse flips the Marauders' personalities inside out and makes them hard to deal with.

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

  Who'd have thought that the man who tore them apart was the one who brought them together? Head Girl Lily Evans is determined to keep her distance from the Marauders but that's easier said than done when James is Head Boy and in love with her. It also doesn't help that she becomes rather attached to Sirius during an eventful Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson...

** linkao3(1110486) - The Lost Generation

My favorite canon complaint Marauder's fic. I know it starts in the first year but I think the fanfic moves at a good pace and each chapter follows a different character so it doesn't get too boring. There are minor changes to canon but the changes make sense and everything works out in the end. Right now, the latest chapter is a little bit after the start of their 7th year and it's great to see the characters develop and plot points come together.

​

linkao3(11344203) - The Dog You Feed

This follows Sirus after his incident of telling Snape about Remus's wolf whereabouts. It provides some backstory of Sirus and shows more about his complex thoughts on his decisions. Hence the title.

​

linkao3(6510730) - Remus Lupin and the Prisoner of Azkaban

If you want adult Remus's thoughts during the Prisoner of Azkaban, this is it. There's also a lot of Marauder flashbacks that Remus looks back to when talking to Harry, which provides the Marauders with some character.

** Here are some fics that I feel have good Sirius characterization.

linkao3(22220911) is before the door of hell lamps burned, and is the first in the brilliant difficulty series. It's not set in the Marauders' era, but is an AU where Pettigrew is captured in PoA. Lots of good Sirius and Harry interactions, lots of Black family drama, and reminiscing of the first war.

linkao3(13095258) Pot, Kettle, Black is a good character study fic of Sirius. Pretty dark, but very good. Check out the rest of the author's work too.

linkao3(5986366) face death in the hope is a time travel fic that switches POV between Harry and Regulus, but it has really good characterization of James, Lily, and Sirius.

linkao3(11914698) renascienta is set during the 90's and is a Regulus lives AU. Excellent portrayal of the Black family, and great characterization of Sirius and Regulus.

  In 1978, Sirius Black almost becomes an Auror. Turns out even he can't fake his way through the mental health assessment.So what. He has better things to do: Remus Lupin is one. The war is another. He spends weeks at a time undercover for the Order while Polyjuiced to the gills. It's probably his new favourite thing.Little does Sirius know that running from himself will send him on a collision course with his ephemeral brother, but life is funny that way.

  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

** linkao3(10057010) All the young dudes

I just finished this fic, it's wolfstar but that's slowburn and not that graphic. Really well-written, it's Remus' POV. I know you said fourth year up but this goes through from 1st year up. Having read a lot of Marauders fics this one really stuck out to me as granting all the main characters complex behaviour and growth throughout

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!

** My two favorite Marauder era fanfics are:

Love and Other Tragedies by fancyeyes

linkffn(7026042)

Youth by olivieblake

linkffn(12906238)

It is so hard to find a really great fanfic, but both of these are really well written and I still think about them now even though I read them years ago. Enjoy!

** linkffn(Incandescent) Raven realizes she probably has a human father in addition to Trigon. Mum went out for partying and sex; ran with the Marauders for a night. Unfortunately, everyone who's available to talk was blackout drunk before midnight.

Unfortunately abandoned.

** Casting Moonshadows by Moonsign is one of my all time favorites. It mainly focuses on Remus and his background, but starts from first year and shows how they all became friends, marauders, and animagi. Is a wolfstar fic FYI in case that's not your thing.

** May I suggest an entire series? It's called the Unbroken Universe, by Robin4. It's a Marauders focused series, with Sirius as the main protagonist. Although it's a post-Hogwarts series.

It starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken][Promises Unbroken]], then follows with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1567001/1/Promises-Remembered][Promises Remembered]], and finishes with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2204188/1/Promises-Defended][Promises Defended]]. It has a prequel, called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4881348/1/Promises-Honored][Promises Honored]]. The author recommends reading them in chronological order, but I found myself enjoying the prequel more after I read the 3 main titles. It's up to you. Word of warning, these are all long and sometimes heavy. So if you're not really into it, it could bore you and feel like a chore to finish.

The series is an AU that begins when Sirius becomes James and Lily Potter's Secret Keeper, instead of Pettigrew, inadvertently changing everything. It focuses in the relationship of the 4 Marauders during the war. It's a bit dark, but I found it enjoyable. Although I read it a very long time ago, when I was just beginning to read fanfiction, so I don't know how well it holds by today's standards. Do check it out. Who knows, you'll probably like it.
