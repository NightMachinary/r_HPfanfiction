Right from the very beginning, the Malfoys are painted in a bad light. First, it's Hagrid that paints a bad light on the family the day he was taking Harry around for his school shopping in first year, and then it's Ron, after Malfoy has exited the compartment.

We also learn that Malfoy, the senior, had gotten off a lifetime imprisonment in Azkaban by telling the Wizengamot that he was under the /Imperius Curse/. While I myself don't believe that for a number of logical reasons, what if he /was/ forced into being a Death Eater by his father? Or maybe his wife? Or even his sister-in-law, Bella Lestrange?

It's quite obvious later on in the series that Malfoy loves his son, and obviously cares for him. He wouldn't have allowed Voldemort into his place of abode had it not been for the fact that his family would've been at risk had he not.

Then, we come to the part where Cissa pleads with Severus Snape to protect her son and to complete the mission the Dark Lord had assigned to him if he didn't.

And then, during the hunt, Draco Malfoy himself tries to help Harry and gang by lying to his aunt Bella.

And finally, there's the part where Cissa lies to the Dark Lord about the status of Potter's life because she was worried about her only son.

The Malfoys, to me, seem like a family that were paying for the sins of their ancestors, more than anything else.

I would like to believe that had Malfoy the senior had a choice, he wouldn't have done the things he's done. Let us also not forget that the Dark Lord counted upon Lucius because of his deep pockets.

What are you thoughts on the Malfoys? Do you think they were just a family repaying their ancestors dues, or if they were actually as vile and evil as the youngest Weasley heir makes them out to be?


** I don't believe Lucius was Imperiused into joining the Death Eaters. His and Draco's attitudes towards Hermione and the Weasleys make it clear that they certainly hold pureblood ideals. Lucius joined because he believed in Voldemort's doctrine.

Believing that doesn't stop him loving his wife and son. You can be a prize #1 wanker and still love your family, which I fully believe Lucius and Narcissa do.

When it came to the second war, things went bad for them. Lucius still believed, but after the events at the DoM, he was no longer one of the favourites. If it had only been him that it affected, I think he'd have handled it better, but his failure made Voldemort turn his attention on Draco and I think that made his loyalty waver somewhat. Of course, by that point he was in too deep so he had to go along with it all anyway.

I also think that even though he believed, he perhaps felt a little differently about the DE's anyway because times had changed. In the first war, he was younger and he didn't have a family to worry about. Running around killing and fighting people seems like a great idea when you're twenty-something; it's not such a fun idea when you're forty-odd with a wife and child and a stable life.

As for Draco himself, he was a sheltered brat, in his own way. He grew up being told how Voldemort was this wonderful leader that wanted to purify the wizarding world and bring it to glory--then he turns sixteen and realises that actually Voldemort's a psychopath who'll happily kill him and his family on little more than a whim. It was a reality kick that he absolutely was not prepared for.

Narcissa obviously shares pureblood ideals (she'd have been disowned as a Black if she didn't) but not enough to actively join the Death Eaters (I don't believe she was ever marked, like Bella) and whatever her opinions, her family is /the most important/ thing to her, especially Draco. I do believe she'd give up anything for him.

So while I don't believe they were paying for their ancestors' dues, I don't think they're Evil Incarnate^{TM.} They're nasty people when it comes to opinions re: blood, and Lucius especially has done, and would gladly do, unforgivable things, but they're capable of love and caring about those they think deserve it. As real people, I would hate them. As characters, I love them.

*** Did all death eaters had the mark? Because at the end on the fourth book we're only told of about 30 that show up when the mark burns (plus the ones that were supposed to be there like Snape, karkaroff and the azkaban lot), but they always make it seem like there's a much larger number. So could Narcissa be a death eater by name, but not imprtant enough to be branded or something?

I figured being chosen for this task, even if meant as punishment/emotional/psychological torture would probably count as being found important. And honestly, if it weren't for the fact that Draco is an utter weenie, he did exceedingly well for how much the deck was stacked against him.

** they love each other and care, at least, about the other's physical well-being. lucius and narcissa are unrepentant bigots, and fully supported voldemort and his attempted takeover until they were no longer in his good graces. draco was attracted to the ~glamour of it, but doesn't have a stomach for real Evil, and eventually changed his bigoted views as an adult (per pottermore and CC)

How on earth did you come to this conclusion?

Lucius was Voldemort's right hand man. He was the one who was charged with leading the group of Death Eaters that were tasked to retrieve the prophecy, even above Bellatrix Lestrange. Voldemort trusted his capabilities so much that he gave him his horcrux to protect.

It was only after a series of fuck ups (losing the diary, failing the prophecy mission) that Lucius fell out of favour. The Dark Lord then punished him by giving his son an impossible mission, with the threat of death hanging over him. He was then stripped of his wand and his dignity, and was generally treated as a joke and a has-been by Voldemort and his Death Eaters.

It is important to note that even at this point Lucius aspired for his family to gain their previous standing with the Dark Lord. He was excited when Harry was captured and told Draco that if they have indeed captured Harry, then all would be forgiven.

He loved his family, of course, and in the end he did prioritise Draco's life over Death Eater duties. This does not make him much of a better person, but it does humanise him to quite some extent.

** Even awful people love their families. I very much dislike when fics try to make the Malfoys good, it never ever feels genuine. The best of this is Out of the Night by Raining Ink, but even that fic would be better served by keeping the Malfoys in character and using a different family.

He did have a choice. Even when he thought Voldemort was dead he was a skumbag racist asshole. Who definitely tried to kill Ginny Weasley just because Arthur was pushing muggleborn legislation.

** Narcissa and Lucius value self-preservation and family more than their bigoted ideals. They managed to raise a son that wasn't completely hopeless. According to Cursed Child, Draco is capable of forming cordial relationships with former enemies, may have grown past his bigoted views, and raised a child who doesn't hold the views of his grandparents.

Lucius and Narcissa believed in the cause, they only wavered in their support of /Voldemort/ because they were out of favor and in danger.

I don't agree with the following statements:

** Lucius: Lucius Malfoy is kind of terrifying, until Voldemort takes his wand away. He's ruthless, skilled, wealthy and has powerful political connections. Literally his only redeeming point is how much he cares for his family. Interestingly enough, in the books he is not described as having long hair, or else his hair care would be another good point.

Narcissa: Not much of an opinion of her, really. Maybe a bit haughty. Good point in her favor is how much she cares for her family.

Draco: Wants to be what Lucius is, but is too much of a weenie to actually be that. Only redeeming point is how much he cares for his parents.

Basically, they all suck, though I admire how much they care about family.

** In general, all of them are opportunists. They latch onto and surround themselves with people who they think are advantageous for their cause. They all harbor some intense bigotry and hate in themselves which fuels their cruelty (or at least that of Lucius and Draco, we don't know much about Narcissa). Lucius is more talented than Draco, deadlier and crueler. Draco wants to be like his father, but lacks the skill, cold-blood and ruthlessness.

They are cruel, downright evil people, who only redeem themselves a little bit the moment they feel their family is in danger.

The only family member that may have the benefit of the doubt is Narcissa, as we see her so seldom in the fics (and when we see her, she is haughty, but mostly just looking out for her son).

As someone already pointed out: Its absolutely ridiculous that they weren't punished severely. At least Lucius should've taken a one-way ticket back to Azkaban.

I don't see any evidence to support the idea that Lucius, Narcissa, or Draco were anything other than /enthusiastic/ supporters of TMR and unrepentant bigots.

The only reason they turned on Voldemort at the end was because of Tom's threat to all of those inside Hogwarts, which included Draco.

#+begin_quote
  Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and find her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no longer cared whether Voldemort won.

I don't think the few spots of the Malfoys not actively attempting to hinder Harry's progress can even come close to making up for their past behaviour and I was flabbergasted to hear Jo say that they weren't imprisoned after the war for aiding an insane terrorist.

** Lucius was an opportunist, and at first he seemed like the debonair type of political villain that had to be nailed to a wall with insurmountable evidence. After a while, he changed, but still seemed like he was only acting because he'd gotten in too deep. It's like someone who joined the Mafia because it was something they could do to become powerful and follow in the footsteps of their forefathers, and then finding out that the Don wants you to pull a binding of Isaac on your only son.

Narcissa was simply doing what she could with what she had. While she had a lot, she never took the mark; and seemingly was the only person other than Dumbledore or Snape to ever be able to /lie to Voldemort to his face./ She must have practiced that a lot with the way Druella would have been. A lot of what is present in people's ideological makeups is passed down from the previous generation. And while Narcissa would have never encouraged muggle hunting or anything else brutal, she definitely didn't want to cede any of what she felt was rightfully hers to some mudblood who had caught the Spark of Magic.

Draco was a spoiled rich boy who was raised on stories that his father told him of his old adventures being a bad-ass Death Eater and how he was better than everyone due to his heritage and wealth. He found out what Lucius knew during the end of the last war only by interacting with Voldemort himself. That tyrants brutalize anyone, even their own ranks if they can.

I think that the Malfoys on the whole were simply people trying to protect what they felt was an invasion of their way of life by a competing culture. Voldemort just presented himself in a way in the first war that would make that sort of defense possible.

*Remember, while most people use WWII as a reference for what happened in the First Wizarding War/Wizarding British Civil War I; I use The Troubles as a more accurate descriptor with the Death Eaters being more like the Ulster Guard/Provo organization along with the Order of the Phoenix. Both were denied by the ministry and both were considered acting outside of the law.*

So, when Voldemort comes back to life, he's not as smart as he was, /and he's taking up residence in Lucius' house, terrorizing his wife, threatening his son and in general being a tyrant--this is what transformed him from a debonair villain who could possibly win, to a plucky villain who's easily defeated in Book 5./ That and JKR writing a YA series instead of a political thriller.

They were people, who had differing morals and probably justifications for having them. Caught up in trying to stand stalwart against what they considered a dilution of wizarding culture and an attack on pureblood homes and families by the Ministry. Whether or not anything could realistically be done to prevent Muggleborns from influencing wizarding culture is another thing entirely. There was /one/ person who whispered to these people, who while rich, were desperate for something, anything to defend them. He promised them *Everything.* Power, Status and a path to victory; all they had to do was follow him in every way and never break loyalty.

And that's generally what makes villains. The truly insidious take advantage of those who are on the edges--regardless of where those edges fall on the spectrum of wealth, health or power--and they use them to achieve their own ends of terror. Barty Crouch Jr. was a neglected child, even though his parents were rich purebloods--and since his father resented him, he clung to the first person who acted like he cared. Voldemort

Bellatrix was said by both of her living relatives to be crazy from the start, almost as if it were the Black Family curse, and if you look at the things that were done in Victorian London to those who were mad and consider the parallels in the wizarding world, Druella would have probably locked her in a wing of the house or the attic and let the house elves take care of her. Who would have been the first person to "take her in" and let her have freedom and not expect her to simply be a child-bearer? *Voldemort.*

It's less of them being evil than of JKR using her metrics of good and evil to paint characters in an otherwise very shades-of-grey world. She thinks nothing of using memory wipes or mind control and compulsions, but killing is the most evil thing ever. Wizards wouldn't have had that view, since to them--some anyways--Death wasn't just /final./ It didn't end everything you were, and the duty to protect all life wasn't something shoved in everyone's faces there.

** Ugh, there are way too many Malfoy apologists in this thread.

The Malfoys were unrepentant bigots who willingly followed a mass murdering megalomaniac because they thought they were superior. The only reason they turned against Voldemort at the end of DH is because they had lost their cushy and privileged life. Voldemort had stopped favouring Lucius because of his failure during book 5, which got Lucius 'demoted'. I have no trouble believing that if Lucius was still favoured by Voldemort there he would have stayed rather than away at the end of DH.

Also are people forgetting book 2 where he slipped a cursed diary into an 11 year olds cauldron in order to discredit her father, discredit the headmaster and kill muggleborns. This also shows that he didn't care as much about family as people in this thread are saying because Draco could have easily been killed by the basilisk if he had been in the wrong place at the wrong time. He willingly put his child in harms way for his gains, not caring for his owns sons potential death.

Draco was not as evil as Lucius but he was still a horrible person, the amount of things he did during the books that showed the makings of a monster are numerous. Things that come to mind: happiness at muggleborns potentially being killed, happiness at an animal(Buckbeak) being executed because of his own actions, hapiness at the possibility that Harry would be killed during the TWT, assisting Umbridge with her Inquisitorial squad and everything in book 6. There are more that I could write but it would take me forever, but you get the point that Draco is a horrible person.

Narcissa was Lucius' accomplice she was by his side as he committed evil. If she truly felt any other way about blood purity and Lucius' actions she would have taken Draco and ran away. She may have cared about Draco but that was her only redeeming quality, it doesn't excuse everything else.

So yes the Malfoys are actually as vile and evil as Ron makes them out to be.

Why? They are snobbish bigots who think they own the magical world and aren't above using acts of terror (from kidnapping to murder, torture (maybe even rape) etc.) to bring around their ideal version of it (not to mention that they bribe and threaten politicians and government employees)...even Draco who doesn't actually have the stomach for killing condones those acts!

If I had to preside over their trials both Draco and Lucius wouldn't see the light of day again (they'd be locked up - well: Draco would be locked up and Lucius would be dead (to add insult to injury I'd order it done with a muggle firearm!)) and Narcissa would serve prison time (harboring a criminal is a punishable offense!) and pay hefty fines (leaving her with enough to live off of, but not enough to bribe anybody etc.)
