:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi,

I am looking for a fanfic where Harry is either abandoned or left dursleys and stays with Tom at Leaky Cauldron, and eventually gets close to an family from US whose kids are muggleborn and were invited to Hogwarts.

It also involves a semi-sentient guardian-ship book on Harry, which somehow protects him from being adopted by fudge/Malfoy. Tom and the mother become co-guardians of Harry.

I read the fic years ago and didn't save then. I remember it in fanfiction.net site.

I would like to re-read the story again & hope to find it.


** This sounds like Realizations by Wishweaver.

Good news for you is that, after years of abandonment, it has been updated and is being expanded. linkao3(25925863)

  AU Summer before Fifth Year story. If you recognize it, I don't own it. Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What does he do since he's not supposed to contact his friends until he gets the all clear?
