  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

** Maybe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2301238/1/Fizz][Fizz]] linkffn(2301238)? It's set during 6th year with Ron and Hermione helping Harry, albeit with a potions addiction rather than rape aftermath.

  Harry has issues. Fortunately, he also has friends. A Sixth Year story. Major spoilers for OOTP, GOF. This story is now COMPLETE. Enjoy.

*** Can you describe the fic a little in relation to OP's request? Just by looking at the tags and blurb, it's not clear how it is similar to "An Hour of Wolves".

  With Draco Malfoy as his assigned partner for the next six weeks of Auror training, Harry had been prepared for things to go poorly. But getting themselves accidentally bonded to each other in the first twenty minutes of their very first assignment seemed going above and beyond, even for them.
