:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find a fic, I believe it was on AO3, about a girl who defeats the King of Slytherin. I believe she was an orphan or muggleborn. She would read to the Slytherins and introduced them to muggle books. It focused on the court and her being the King, but having a male King as the public King.
