:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Oh man, it's been many years but the ending of this fic always impacted me.

From what I can remember, Tonks is a caretaker looking after a severely traumatized Ginny in some kind of post-war setting in which Harry has already passed away. Turns out that she had a child who was born after Harry's death, whom also passed for reasons I don't recall. The last chapter describes Tonks having a vivid dream in which she witnesses Harry meeting his child and Ginny reunited with him.

Everyone once in a while I will do some searching on the interwebs but could never find this fic. Perhaps someone here is familiar with it?

Thanks!!!
