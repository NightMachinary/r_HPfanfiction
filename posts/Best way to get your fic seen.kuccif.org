So, I've been a huge HP Fanfic reader for many years. I got really busy in med school/residency and didn't read a lot of fics for about 10 years, but I came back to Fanfic during the pandemic to help me cope.

I'm an ER doc so life is hard right now and very draining, but I also just lost a baby at nearly 6 months pregnant a few months ago. It was a truly devastating loss.

The only thing that has helped me crawl out of the deepest holes I've ever been in were to go back to Harry Potter. It was the only escape I had and inside these fics I found a safe space to just let go of my own reality and enjoy the incredible worlds these authors create. I honestly feel like these fics have saved my life.

After years of reading, I finally decided to start writing my first fic. The feedback so far is good, but I don't know how to get it seen by more people.

I write mostly Snape & Harry mentor fics (no slash)- kind of the Severitus/Sevitus genre if that's your thing.

Right now I publish it on FFN- and in just one week (it's 9 chapters now) I've gotten 50 favorites and 200 followers. But I feel like there's something I'm missing. There are much worse fics who have HUGE followings. I don't know what the secret is to cultivating readers on FFN. Especially within the HP genre, there are just SO many. How can people find you!

Anyone have advice about how to do this? I guess the internet has changed a lot since I was doing things in like 2008- but with Yahoo groups gone, where do people hang out to share fics?? Is Tumblr really important? I don't see much on Twitter or Reddit. Do I need DIscord?

I'd love some help/ideas (please don't flame me and tell me I'm stupid, I really just need someone to break it down for me).

THANKS!

*** I wasn't sure how that worked- I don't see a lot of self-advertising and I didn't want to piss anyone off, lol. But here's a link. It's definitely its own niche (Snape+Harry mentor fic), so I know it's not for everyone, but there are some great fics in the genre and it seems to have a pretty big readership (Potions and Snitches is one of the biggest C3 groups on FFN).

** My first bit of advice is totally subjective, so take it with a grain of salt: FFnet is dying. The folks in charge have clearly been putting all of their effort into Fiction Press. They are unresponsive to every issue. I've been trying to keep tabs on people's attempted interactions with their twitter account because they've been ignoring reports of my fic getting repeatedly plagiarized on their site, and they are ignoring absolutely everyone. People are leaving. It might not be "in droves" levels yet, but I've been through enough fandom exoduses to know what I'm seeing. Unless that changes (either by new staff or by a sale of the site to another company), FFnet is on its way out.

I would try Ao3. Again, this is subjective, but their layout is cleaner, it's easier to find fics you're looking for using their tags, and it's not overloaded with ads. Once users figure out that they can filter certain tags out and even hide tags completely while searching, I've rarely heard of someone going back to FFnet or WP or the like.

If you do wind up on Ao3, use tags wisely. Tag it with truly relevant characters/pairings/additional tags, and avoid tagging it with something that only appears for five seconds. Don't use tags as author's notes. (Use author's notes for author's notes, haha.) Many many many readers heavily rely on tags to search for fics that hit their buttons, so it's important to use them well.

Finally, for the bit of advice that I DON'T think is subjective: the summary is key. It needs to be more of a blurb than a paragraph because attention spans these days are thin. It needs to be intriguing, unique, and it needs to be grammatically correct.

I have a Tumblr and have used it to communicate about my fic, but I'm pretty sure the majority of attention comes from Ao3 itself.

I'm sorry to hear about all you've gone through lately. Fic writing is definitely cathartic.

*** This is wonderful advice, thanks so much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful response. I'm definitely getting the idea that I should cross post this, so I will do that now. I had no idea FFN was dying.

I enjoy reading on AO3 but felt a little intimidated by the platform since I see a lot more erotic fiction there (which is great, it's just not something I know how to write). The tags are intimidating but I think I can figure it out, the guidelines you give are great.

I appreciate your reply! THANK YOU !

**** Oh, yes, there are increasing problems with FFN. I've had issues logging in while using TOR (because sometimes I want IP privacy). Also, they've apparently been having issues with DDOS attacks lately, which they chose to solve with Cloudflare, which is causing problems with FanFicFare (which I and many others use to download stories all the time). One of the commenters on that message board pointed out that there are others with major concerns over FFN's precarious position: [[https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=4080268&postcount=5156]]

On your fic, I would offer this constructive criticism: you've got a lot of telling instead of showing. For example, chapter two starts with Snape as the POV character. Instead of telling us it's almost midnight and he's not asleep, show us what he's doing. Is he grading? Is he working on a potion? What's keeping him up? Instead of telling us he's annoyed, show his reaction to the messenger (is it a school house elf?) Does he scowl? Flatten his mouth? Snap at the messenger? Burn the parchment?

Generally, it helps to cut out all of the "He knew..." and "He realized..." and just say what the character knows. We're in his head, so it's more immediate that way. The telling covers more story-chronology in a shorter space, but showing gives it more power.

YMMV, of course, but just a suggestion, meant in gentle kindness.

** If you have a romantic angle, find the shipping community for that ship and post there. Make sure it's tagged.

When I just search on ffn or ao3, I tend to search by my favorite ship.

If you don't, advertise here as a gen fic, we're generally pretty hungry for those tbh. The main [[/r/harrypotter]] sub has "fanfic fridays", find that thread and post there next Friday, a lot of people see those threads. [[/r/fanfiction]] has regular "advertise here" threads, too.

My most common sources of new fics are either here or on my favorite ship's discord.

** Unfortunately, there's no real 'secret to success'. There's a million fics across a million different places (slight hyperbole, but it is the internet) and as far as I can see, there's no real pattern between 'em. Harry Crow, despite the hatred demonstrated in forum posts, is incredibly widely viewed/read, for example. The internet is weird, and even the big youtubers struggle to stay relevant quite often. And I know this isn't all that helpful, but really try to remember that safe space and that enjoyment of incredible worlds in stories - the only difference is, you're the one providing those things now. Chasing the stats is difficult and even those big youtubers who get paid baffling sums for their work struggle, so doing it for free can be tough. But you asked how people get more readers and I'll try give an answer because otherwise this post is just not relevant to what you're asking and that ain't dope, yo.

Well, you're asking about getting more people reading your work, so the first thing to look at is how they do so. There's generally three stages of 'access' for readers - the place you write/edit, the place you post, the place you advertise.

Talk about what you're writing and how you're changing it while you do it, in short. There's a bunch of different places to do it - discussion posts here are great if you wanna thrash out plot or settings ideas, and a lot of writers swear by various discords (some they set up themselves to cover their work, letting readers join as they encounter their works wherever its been posted, others are actual pre-existing writing-support discords - I don't know any you could access personally, but if you do a little searching, you'll probably find something you can work with) and social media communities and forums (eg. The Dark Lord Potter forum) where they can post their WIPs and get feedback and update as they go from both readers and fellow writers.

There's no specific 'best place to post' - each site has it's strengths and weaknesses and you'll get different things from each one. I'm told that generally, the pattern is more comments and reviews on Ao3 and more viewers on FFNet, with a few variants in other spots as well (eg. Self-promo posts here, tumblr/livejournal blogs, specialist fandom/pairing sites like SIYE, general fic sites like SpaceBattles or Questionable Questing, etc).

Generally, good posting habits also help. Good titles and good summaries can draw people in, tagging properly (enough to filter in/out, but not enough to turn people off - eg. tag the main pairings and character types, but not those people who were mentioned that one time in chapter 3), and posting to a regular schedule that you let people know about. What the schedule is doesn't really matter though - If you can only post every second saturday, so be it, but always do your best to post then. That regularity is probably one of the most recurring tips I've seen/heard whenever people talk about getting wider interest and attention from the public.

Side Note: Ao3 is time-delayed, so you either have to enter the sign-up queue and wait, or get an invitation from an existing user (I can send you a link, if you'd like).

And then, where you advertise. Sometimes that's you doing it, other times that's your readers themselves sharing. Keeping an eye out here and on other fandom subs is pretty good - request threads come up all the time, and if one is relevant to your fic, you can totally post a link! If you wanna go direct, there's self-promotion posts (if you do this, please make the title something about your fic - it'll get you more 'clicks', definitely) as well.

Finally, sometimes, it just takes time. A lot of the fics that we recommend regularly or that come up a lot have been around for A WHILE and they've built up the awareness over that decade or whatever they've been around. So, y'know. Make friends, write comments and reviews on other people's stuff, connect. It's a nice place to just discuss fics and be part of a community. And if you connect with others and help them out, they might connect back and help you. Hell, maybe you'll befriend a fellow writer and co-author something together, or they'll become your Beta and help you improve your writing, or convert you to another pairing/trope writing idea entirely.

** I don't know but is seeking large numbers realy the point? I realise that sounds dumb but the truth of fanfiction is it doesn't realy lead anywhere, so big numbers don't realy give much.

But i do realise that getting alot of feedback is nice so here is what i think.

1. If you are on ffn try getting your word count above one of the search catagories like 70 000. I usaly search by 100 000 words.
2. shiping or tropes. every one has their favorit, pick one and do some self advertising on their forums pretty sure som one else said you can advertise on this sub so try that.
3. Be concistent(the classic youtube advice LuL). my brain can only hold so many stories at once so i don't tend to follow things that don't update regularly and im willing to bet many others agree. No one wants an abandoned fic.

That's atleast what i think, i specialy agree with chlorinecrownt on the romance part. Most readers go for romance.

*** Thanks for the advice! I'm at around 40,000 words now and trying to update 2x/week. I know what you mean, as a reader I hate when a fic I love gets abandoned or it goes so long I've forgotten it by the time an update rolls around.

To answer your question- it's not so much that I need a million views, I just want to have readers engage. At the end of the day you write because you enjoy it, but it is incredibly motivating to know that people want to read what you're writing and are enjoying it.

Good point about the romance- I guess that's something I have to consider. I like the more mentor/guardian type fics, which I think has its own base, but I'll have to consider if there's a way to bring romance in some other way. Thanks for taking the time to write this out!

** The best thing I did to up my reader count was join discord servers for my ships where self promotion was encouraged.

Sorry I don't have a Severitus server to recommend, but I'm a sev multishipper so dm me if you want invites for SSHG, SSHP, SSRL, or SSSB.

Edit: Other things I've done include (1) post at AO3 -- there are cult readers who follow certain tags and Severitus is probably one of them, and (2) participate in challenge/fest events -- those are promoted by the organizers for extra readership.

** biggest things for me is crossposting to both ao3 and ffnet, because lots of people only really use one, and then the other is using tagging on ao3, and to update chapter by chapter instead of all at once.

at the end of the day how many people read it after that seem to be whether it's a popular trope or pairing or not

I used to promo on my tumble but it didn't really make any difference to readers I don't think

Those numbers are actually really pretty good, pretty sure they're better than my fics get.

At the end of the day the connection you can have to your readers is special, but I try to look out for like, two reviews or comments that let me know that someone really gets what I'm trying to do, or saw that one detail that others didn't seem to notice, and that makes me really happy. I really do write for me but it's so nice when the world is hard and awful and life is getting you down to have people liking something you've put out there. But getting lost in the stats just isn't good for anyone's mental health <3 fan fic is supposed to be fun after all!

**** awesome! Good luck! I do find that I get more comments on AO3, and you can also maximise that by writing in your authors notes headcanons and stuff that will get them to interact with you. Like you can ask questions about what they liked, some writers will even ask questions about stuff not in the story

I always have a note on my stories that I don't want concrit, because I just am not here for that; but if they say what they liked, for me it's more helpful (and more likely to make me want to write more) so I find that defining how you would like readers to interact with you can be helpful---esp because a lot of readers don't always really know what to say, but if you're like ‘did you like this thing?' They will be like ‘actually yes'

and I'll reiterate that on AO3 your tags are really important. Go around and look at the tags on fics that are similar to yours, so you know you're using the correct tags that will bring the right reader to you. If you just bung whatever on there it won't be useful to you or your readers

** Success in fanfiction tends to be pretty random, and there's only so much you can do. There's no big secret to it, and a lot of mega successful fics were just at the right place, right time. A BNF might have recommended it somewhere and sent all their followers to it, but that's really just luck on the author's part. Bear in mind that a lot of the fics with thousands of favorites and comments have been around for years. Yours has been around for a week.

There are a few things you can do to increase visibility, though, even if it won't magically shoot your fic into stardom.

I'd suggest crossposting on AO3 to reach a wider audience, and make sure to tag properly so that your target audience will find it (happy to provide more detail in that area if you want).

Also, the timing of your updates can make a big difference. If you post chapters too frequently (like more than once or twice a week) it limits your opportunity to build an audience. If you post regularly, say, once a week, you're posting frequently enough that you won't be forgotten and people won't lose interest, but you're giving people enough time to find your story and keep up with updates. Even if you write really quickly, wait it out a bit and let your fic marinate (for lack of a better word).

Can I have the link to your fic? Severitus/Sevitus is one of my favorite HP genre and I've written one myself. Would love to check your fic out.

*** Thanks so much for this great advice- I'm definitely going to cross post I think. The timing of updates was something I was wondering about. Right now I wanted to post a big chunk so that I can get this story moving forward, but I agree with what you mean. DO you think the day/time you post matters?

This was fantastic advice. Definitely would love to read yours as well!

Also, I'd love to hear your thoughts on tagging- people on AO3 tag A LOT and I find it a bit intimidating, lol. Thanks for this great advice!

**** Regarding the time, I assume people have more time to read in the evenings, but it's a bit difficult because you're likely to have readers from multiple time zones. Even if you're just looking at the USA, there are different time zones within the country. I myself live in a time zone where most English-speaking readers don't, so I just post at the time of day that works for me.

Regarding the day, I'd say weekends are your best bet, because that's when people tend to have more time to read. Honestly, I don't know how much of a difference it makes though. It does look like you've been posting very frequently, so I'd recommend slowing it down just a little bit, and post chapters one at a time, no more than once/twice a week.

About AO3 tags: the first thing is parings/relationships. Since you said you're writing a Snape & Harry mentorship fic, you'll want to include the Harry Potter & Severus Snape tag (not to be confused with the Harry Potter/Severus Snape tag, which is slash). If there are any other significant relationships, platonic or otherwise, you'll want to include those as well. Separately from relationships, you should tag all the significant characters in your fic as well.

Then comes the additional tags, which is the hardest part to do. You want to give your readers a general idea of what your story is about, but you don't want to overtag, because that tends to put a lot of readers off, and it's just unnecessary. Based on what I know about your fic, some good tags would be Mentor Severus Snape, Apprenticeship, Hogwarts Second Year, and anything else that characterizes your story. Additionally, you'll want to include content warnings if your fic includes anything that might put readers off (abuse, graphic violence, etc).

I personally tend to err on the side of tagging too little, which could get in the way of visibility, because many people search for fics by tag, so the more tags you have, the more likely people are to find your fic, but if you have a wall of tags, people often tend to ignore it.

It may help to look at fics on AO3 that share similar themes to your story so you can get ideas for tags.

If your interested, my Harry & Snape fic is called [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=3048][To Trust]] (I wrote it a long time ago) and I'm currently working on a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28613241/chapters/70129140][rewrite]] on AO3.
