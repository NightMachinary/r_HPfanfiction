I'm craving stories where Hedwig is a major part of Harry's life and the narrative reflects that. In most fics I've read, if she's even remembered, she is only mentioned occasionally as a throwaway line or filler. Usually for that appalling bacon running gag, which would kill a real owl.

I'd like to see fics that put major focus on Harry's loyal owl. Preferably not too long. One shots are excellent in this case. No Hedwig is an animagus fics though. It was creepy enough that Wormtail was pretending to be a little boy's pet, Hedwig being female wouldn't make it any less creepy.

Speaking of which, based on Rowling's description of Hedwig, it's actually likely that Harry's loyal owl is male. I'd like to see a fic where Harry does research on snowy owls because of Hedwig and discovers that she's actually a he. Maybe with a running gag that everyone assumes Hedwig is female, "An owl that beautiful is /clearly/ a lady!" Only to have Hedwig get offended until Harry corrects them.

Anyway, now that my semi-drunken rambling is over, thanks in advance for any fics.

All three are humorous one-shots so don't take them too seriously. The fics are still very entertaining though.

  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

** No, Hedwig is female. They only used male snowy owls for the movies because they are much whiter than females who have brown or black spots on their feathers.

** While she tends to be a minor character, Hedwig has several (mini) story arcs in Harry And The Shipgirls, including a backstory that shows that she's more than /just/ an owl.

In the third thread, Hedwig (finally!) becomes Harry's familiar, gaining a telepathic bond with him, the ability to speak (and boy, does she snark), the ability to expand so that she stands six foot tall (with wingspan increasing appropriately), the ability to channel Harry's magic in a similar method to a wand and a human form in which she is constantly awed by the ability to look round without having to turn her head (and annoyed that bacon tastes /so/ much better as a human, it ruins the taste for her owl-form). She is also learning a fighting style based around kicks as she doesn't like to risk damaging her wings/arms.
