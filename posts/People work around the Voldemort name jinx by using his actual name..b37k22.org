Never understood why they settled back into the whole You-Know-Who shtick or why Dumbledore apparently never bothered to tell people Voldemorts name was Tom Riddle. Dumbness the one to start the whole "fear of the name" bullshit but wouldn't tell people his boring ass name. Like Tom's not going to jinx that name because he can't acknowledge it in the first place.


** There's plan B, too...

  "Okay, so you know how You-Know-Who's taken over the Ministry? In the last war, he managed to put a Taboo on his name. Speak of the devil and he shall appear, although he usually sent Death Eaters instead. Killed a lot of people before we figured it out. So, old Mad-Eye got this shack set up..."\\
  Remus Lupin took an enchanted key and used it to open up the old shed; inside were...hundreds, if not thousands, of those wind-up chattering teeth toys, all chattering away; from the din, it sounded like they were enchanted to chant 'Voldemort' repeatedly.\\
  "We've got a few enlarged suitcases, sheds, etc, filled with these things, to make 'noise' for anyone trying to set a Taboo on He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's...name. And a few other names, too, so they'll think they're setting it up wrong. If this goes right, they'll be getting so many hits a second they won't know who's really saying his name and who isn't."

** Voldemort would be more pissed by people using his real name, so he'd quickly decide to put a taboo on that.

Be a shit time to be named Tom.

** My rule:

Call him the Dark Lord if I want my characters to be serious.

Call him Tommy Boy if I want them to be derogatory toward him.

Silly nicknames such as “Moldshorts”, “Voldewhore” can come up in dialogues by certain characters. For example in canon, the Twins made fun of him publicly by creating a laxative called “U-No-Poo”.

I will never, ever call him that ridiculous “You Know Who” in my AU stories.

*** Nicknames such as Molyshorts and Tommy boy become really old really quickly. It's fine in one shots or crack fics, but I quit reading any story that persists in using such terms. Its overused, tired, old, not funny, ruins immersion and causes you to no longer take characters serious.

*** But the Dark Lord is generally used by people who sort of sympathise with his goals/aims. I think Harry challenges Snape once about this. The ones that are against Voldemort always call him You-Know-Who or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named (other than Harry, Albus, Sirius, and Lupin).

**** I guess "the Dark Lord" can work once or twice in conversation if the speaker who is not a sympathiser is obviously using it derisevely or prefaces it something like "the self-proclaimed Dark Lord".

***** Voldemort is never addressed with derision, ever. Not a single character does it in canon, and it's rather obvious why. You don't address someone you're absolutely terrified of with derision.

****** In canon, yes. I was mostly thinking about why a non-sympathiser could call Voldemort "the Dark Lord". And not everyone is absolutely terrified of him. I guess Grindelwald could adress him like that with derision, for example, or Flamel. But not the majority of the characters, that I agree.

** If his real name became a common knowledge, he would definitely jinx it, if only to punish those who dare speak it.

It would be interesting to see how people would work around the Taboo on that, in a fic where his real name is widely known. Mr. Puzzle? The Mystery Lord? +Immortal Love Rodd?+
