I love fics set in Hogwarts with teens just being teens, where Voldemort and Harry's role in the war is present but not the primary focus of the fic. Learning magic and dating (not shipping) feature heavily.

Two examples:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging][The Merging]] by Shaydrall

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3920129/1/Sixth-Year-The-Steps-Toward-The-End][Sixth Year: Steps Towards the End]] by scaryisntit

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]] by Lane Anasazi is shaping up to be this kind of fic. I spoke with the author recently and her plans for the fic are pretty exciting.

What other fics would you add to this list?


** I immediately thought of The Merging and Steps Towards the End when I saw the topic. Both do the "magical boarding school" thing pretty well. A few others that capture at least some of that:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][Harry the Hufflepuff]] does the comedic version of this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie][C'est La Vie]] has elements of this, with the added wrinkle of time travel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4201201/11/Rustlings-in-the-Dark][Rustlings in the Dark]] has elements of this, with the added wrinkle of a murder mystery.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6896279/1/We-ll-All-Fall-After-The-Yule-Ball][We'll All Fall After the Yule Ball]] is kind of a long one-shot version of this, with an emphasis on the "dating" part and not so much with the "learning magic" part. As I recall it gets a bit odd towards the end.

[[http://shoebox.lomara.org//][The Shoebox Project]] is a Marauders-era version of this.

** I suspect youve already read it but The Santi's The Boy Who Lived did a good job of this for Drumstang.

** I feel like I'm constantly recommending [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1316097/Pinky-Brown][Pinky Brown]], but a lot of her fics are very focused on day-to-day interactions with the trio. There are a few fics with Ginny in them that kind of do the whole teens being teens thing, though that's not for everyone. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4054307/1/Stupid-Bloody-Ink-Bottle][Stupid Bloody Ink Bottle]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4133294/1/The-Monster-in-Her-Chest][The Monster in Her Chest]] are pretty good.
