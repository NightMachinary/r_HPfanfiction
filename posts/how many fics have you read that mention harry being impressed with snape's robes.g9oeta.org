I mean seriously- "Harry looked after him shaking his head. He really had to get Snape teaching him how that worked. It simply looked amazing."

** There's fics where the billowing robes is a cosmetic charm, like the eye twinkling of Dumbledore, teeth flashing of Lockhart.

** I can recall no other details, but I recall seeing one fic where Harry got the chance to ask Snape questions, and he asked how the effect was done.

"Good tailoring".

(incidentally, if you want a robe that billows as you walk, you can do a lot worse than counsel's robes, especially the Queen's Counsel version as the silk is lighter and doesn't require as much air movement to get it billowing.)

** So, so many. Maybe that's my genre. If I reread any and see this, I'll give you the name. My favourite so far and one that definitely comes to mind when other characters observe Harry's walking looking slightly Snape-reminiscent is the rewritten and still being updated Colours series.
