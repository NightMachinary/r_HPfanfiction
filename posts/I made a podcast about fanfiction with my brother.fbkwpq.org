Hello!For my final project before graduation, I decided to make a podcast with my brother. The podcast topic is fanfiction, and we have planned to release at least 5 episodes.

We released the introduction episode today, and the first official episode will be posted in one week. After that, episodes will continue every two weeks.

We discuss everything we like and dislike: tropes, characters, pairings, concepts - you name it!

Thank you for your time,

Anna
