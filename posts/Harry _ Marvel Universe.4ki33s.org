Any good story where Harry grows up on Asgard? Looking for well written, believable story.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

**** It gets a bit smutty every once in a while, but the relationship is a small part of the story as a whole.
