:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a fic where Harry obtains the memories / has the part of Ignatius Peverell inside him and goes on to use that knowledge to fight against Voldemort. He is paired with Katie Bell after he finds her on the Hogwarts Express crying because her mother was killed by Death Eaters. I was wondering if anyone knows what fic it is?

Edit: I mixed some things up. Its actually a young Tom riddle in his head that has turned "good" so to speak because of the horcruxes long exposure to harrys emotions and thoughts. The fic is called Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge by kmfrank. Tough I still wouldn't mind a good harry / Katie fic cuz its almost impossible to find anything worth reading that isn't smut (smut is great and all but I don't want to read it all the time u know)

*** I can't link it as it's smutty, but Quidditch Tales on fanfiction.net is pretty okay, in a 'Civilization Harry' sense. I do think it focuses a bit much on the smut, though, but it has some interesting ideas.

  'Civilization Harry'

That's not a phrase I'm familiar with, any chance you'd be willing to explain what that is?

***** Harry basically focuses on building infrastructure in some way. It can be simple like a big hidden manor or more complicated like lots of land or in a few cases his own country.
