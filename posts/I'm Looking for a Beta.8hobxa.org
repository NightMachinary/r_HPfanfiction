I have a small ficlet I want to do. I have a wonderful Beta for my longer work, however I don't wish to overwhelm him, especially when his real life has been so crazy busy lately. So I was hoping someone would like to beta for me

It's a narrative from 5-7th year of Snape looking out for Harry and keeping his promise. Snape is not going to be fluffy or like Harry, or anything near that, he won't "grow to care for the boy" as Dumbledore had suggested in Year 6. I'm thinking 7 chapters at most, maybe less. Probably less.


** Shayalonnie maintains a list of available beta readers for HP stories. You might have luck there.
