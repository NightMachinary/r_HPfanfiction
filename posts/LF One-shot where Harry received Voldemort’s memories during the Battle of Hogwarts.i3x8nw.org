I remember that in this Harry was writing to get his thoughts in order before his trial for killing Ginny and the minister (don't remember if it was Kingsley or Scrimgour) and in the paper he admits that during the fight Voldemort tried to take over Harry's mind but Harry resisted gaining a foothold by thinking about how good was the day, then he ran with it until he got to fire an AK at Voldemort.
