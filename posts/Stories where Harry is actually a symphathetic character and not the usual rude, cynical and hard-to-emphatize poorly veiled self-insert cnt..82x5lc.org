** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) He is often a bit sassy and sarcastic at times so I am not sure how well this fic fits your request, but one of his main strengths here is that he truly is a good person at heart. He develops friendships and achieves things often not through being the most powerful or most edgy independent asshole, but because he cares for others, his determination and williness to put others first. He just has a very empatheric nature and is a likable person in general.

There is a quote in this fic by Voldemort that touches on that a bit that describes him well:

#+begin_quote
  "Help you? Help you what? Turn him into another one of you?"

  "Of course not. There can only be one of me, but I see so much potential for him. He can fulfill the roles I can't... do as easily. I am a conqueror, he is a defender. I lead by the lash, he leads by example. He might yet become my equal, but we shall never be the same."

** While I wouldn't say that the Harry characterisations I write have him as the paragon of good manners (we are talking about a teenager after all), I try to stay as far as humanly possible from any kind of edgy or rude protagonists because they are neither fun to read nor to write. There might be degredatory remarks about Death Eaters and their atrocities, but other than that my stories are free from the common "Indy!Harry" tropes that make him a dick.

I feel like there are a lot of teenagers with revenge fantasies in the fandom and thus there are so many of the fics you described.

**** The problem is, that it would be quite logical for Harry to be rude to almost anyone in Rowling's books. All adults are incompetent, with the exception of Sirius they abandon him at the Dursleys with some platitudes and most of the students had been a dick to Harry at some point of the book. Forgive and forget yes, but the shit the school pulls in years 2,4 and 5 would place pretty much everyone on his shit-list. Believing you are the new magical Hitler, while the last one murdered your parents, is a little worse than the usual stuff teenagers do.

I try to work around this using the blank sheets like Katie Bell and her friend Leanne, Lisa Turpin, Fay Dunbar, Hestia & Flora Carrow, the Tonks family and Penelope Clearwater, but short of writing Harry as Jesus' second coming, a lot of the first and second row characters are difficult to fit into a nice Harry story without giving him some form of amnesia.

** This. I've noticed that a lot of the fics that I like that have Harry as the protagonist, I like them because his personality just doesn't come through very often. And then it does come through for a moment and I suddenly like the fic a lot less.

That said, the Harry in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is pretty good. He sticks with his friends, vacillates between supporting their worldviews and giving reasonable criticism, builds in-jokes with them, and occasionally snarks in a good-natured way.

** I think he's pretty good in the "Weasley Girl" stories, though he's sharing the spotlight with the fem!Ron.

Mind you, he's pretty snarky in those stories, so "polite" might not always cover it... but he's not the pretentious and pompous little snot you see in too many fanfics, much less an edgy and anti-social cynic. Above all, he is a decent, generous and forgiving person, who would (and does!) jump headfirst into danger in order to save even someone he doesn't like.

He's the main character and protagonist the first story, "Weasley Girl," but in the second one he's the deuteragonist (i.e. the second most important character).

- He is charismatic, friendly, and polite, to the point where the very intelligent and moralistic Elicia Eisenheim fell for him hopelessly.
- On the other hand, he is a total dark lord who will stop at nothing from achieving his vision, including genocide and torture.
- He is also very bloodthirsty, often craving for leading his army from the front and crushing his enemies in battles. HIs battlefield presence often gives them decisive advantages, but also causes many complications. His soldiers love him regardless.
- He has two hostile factions under his rule, a moderate one headed by his moralistic wife and a dark one by his trusted advisor Hughes. He generally plays the two factions against each other to his benefits.
- The only person who saw through his veneer of niceties was Ginny Weasley. She tried hard to stop his progress, but her faction was too weak, too incompetent overall to matter.

Now if you really want a truly forgiving Harry, I'm going to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341). Unlike in its prequel "Broken Chains", where he was truly an obnoxious jerk, Harry is very forgiving in this story, as he takes several betrayals by those closest to him in stride. I actually feel quite sorry for this Harry.

I totally agree. By recommending "Emperor", I want to show an example that dark lords could be very charming and appear very nice in public.

The Harry in "Emperor" is not a sympathetic character, but nevertheless someone worth rooting for because the alternative is even worse. Ginny is not sympathetic either, as she is just as brutal as him. James and Sirius, although not bad people, are just too willing to carry out Harry's orders. Neville is the real good guy with lots of conscience, and he does not shy away from resisting Harry's worst decisions.

  Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy, even among wizards. The most noteworthy thing about him, however, was his talent for getting himself into trouble, which surpassed even that of his godfather. Sequel to "Innocent" and "Initiate".

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  It was still called the "Noble and Most Ancient House of Black", though it had been years since any of the Blacks that approved of that name had lived there. Sirius Black would be a disappointment to his parents, but Harry Potter - the home's other resident - was a credit to his. Both were proud of that. Sequel to "Innocent", "Initiate" and "Identity".
