It's like this: Most of these stores have a Harry who grew up with the Dursleys, the abuse that was going on there made him see the world from a more negate spectrum. At some point, Harry finds out that his freakishness isn't a curse, but a tool he can use to his own advantage. He ends up learning some crude wandless magic and shows great potential etc. the usual stuff.\\
Then comes the part where Harry learns that he isn't a freak, but a wizard. He learns of his family, his brother/sister, and that they dumped him at the Dursleys because nobody had the time to care about 'the other twin' or the 'useless twin'. He doesn't like his family very much, no, he almost hates them for the betrayal and all that.\\
Harry is pissed, he goes to Hogwarts and decided to go his own path. Harry ends up in Slithering. Harry makes friends with the usual guys (Nott, Greengrass, Zambini, Davis) and may or may not befriend with Malfoy.

To make it short, the usual stuff. Harry had a crappy childhood, his family doesn't care much about what happens to him - or just pretend that they care, Harry becomes a Slytherin -> his family is outraged and starts giving him the cold shoulder.

So what bothers me about all these stories I have read so far is that Harry never actually 'walk his own path.' He always ends up fixing his twin problems, doesn't get any credit for anything, and is fine with it. Idk, it always feels like he plays a support role in the story. He doesn't get any benefits from going against Voldy and still does it for really weak reasons.\\
I would love to read a story where Harry is ignoring all the drama around his twin. At least to a degree where not every second of his life is influenced by what his twin/James/ or Lily does. Most stories try to make it appear like Harry is independent and his own guy, but you are not independent and your own guy if you let the problems of another influence your decisions/life. He always ends up mixed in the problems Dumbledore/ his Twin/ or 'family' aka James or Lily create during their conflict with Master Voldy and his dark boys.


** And in the end, it comes out that he really was the boy who lived all along! I don't think I've ever read a story that has him really be just the unimportant brother and using that to fuck off out of england with his friends to do a crossover/have an adventure/study magic/have fun elsewhere.

Most wbl fics turn into a bashfest real quick, and stick to the stations of canon like the plague. Like, why the hells would Harry, the sly slytherin care or know about some random gryffindor in a bathroom? Why would he go and fight a basilisk alone, and not bring disposable meatshield friends cultivated for that very purpose? Why go at all, and not just say "yeah damn tough luck lass" and then return to doing whatever?

In that vein, the resurrection ritual always pisses me off. Especially when godlike harry is "knocked out" just so it can happen like in canon

*** Yeah, exactly! Why are the authors forcing the Slytherin Harry through all the cannon events in the first place? It's a damn 'Wrong-boy-who-lived' story and I really expect something new and creative, but we mostly get the same boring soup - tasteless.

** Alexandra Potter in linkffn(11517506) doesn't have a sibling, and the setup is very different from everything I have ever read on this topic, and yet it is very original. Unfortunately, somewhere around the second third year she is changing into super!Harry and there are mythical!superVillians ruling over the world, and then it lost most interest for me.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

** Does [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1024956][Invisible]] count? He is partially influenced by his family at the beginning. You also know nearly from the beginning that he is the true boy who lived. But at some point he has enough and carves his own path.
