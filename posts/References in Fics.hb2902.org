Does anyone else get weirdly excited when your hometown/region of origin is referenced or is a setting in fics? Or is that just me?


** That has never happened to me, which is why I love to make references in my own fics

** I've never seen my city referenced, but one OC had my name (it's a pretty uncommon one) and that was part of what made me love the fic.

** I believe that there was one fic that referred to the town of Les Gets, France. That's near me, but I wasn't too surprised to see it as it's quite a well known ski resort. If anyone could find that fic, that would be nice. I believe it was a post-war Romione fic, but I could be mistaken.

** I love it! Especially when the author's include little factoids about the real life place. Makes me happy when someone else finds my living areas interesting enough to write about.

** Yes, me too. I've seen my region mentioned twice and it made me smile.

** Yeah, but it is very rare. Even with the high-tourist city like my native Prague, I know about only two stories which notice that there are other cities in the continental Europe than Paris (there is also [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=130160][Hiding in Plain Sight by GinevrasChampion]] which is partially in Turin):

- linkao3(Animagus at War by White_Squirrel) ... although I don't appreciate our down-town being overrun by werewolves.
- linkffn(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities) ... just small scene where Percy & Audrey vent off their tension from the stress of the Second Voldemort War by running away for weekend to Prague.

Both stories are very highly recommended (not only because of the Prague scenes).

** I once had to actually laugh loudly because a muggle character who learned about the muggle world asked if the wizards had anything to do with Bielefeld.

Because that place doesn't exist.
