Pretty much title.

I remember a scene in Philosopher's Stone that has Harry threatened with expulsion if he doesn't join the quidditch team. But, even ignoring the blatant blackmail of a prepubescent boy, /can/ Harry be expelled?

No matter how you play Dumbledore, caring old man or master manipulator, he can't afford to remove Harry from the school. Whether it's to protect him from Voldemort or to groom him into a sacrificial lamb Harry /has/ to remain at Hogwarts, doesn't he?

This has led to me thinking about what would happen if Harry /didn't/ take the offer to play quidditch. Because, as I said, I genuinely don't know if he /could/ be expelled. If nothing else the scandal ("Boy Who Lives Expelled From Hogwarts" - Rita Skeeta) would be disastrous.

You remember incorrectly. Hooch threatens to have anybody who flies without suprvision expelled, Harry does so, gets caught, thinks he's going to get expelled, thinks he's going to be beaten with a cane, then is shocked to find out he's being put on the Quidditch team.

*** Thanks for the correction. But the general question I think still stands. Even if not that time, Harry tends to get into his fair share of trouble. Could Harry, the one foretold to kill Voldemort, be expelled at all?

As I said, there's good reasons to keep Harry at Hogwarts.

** One problem I have with the expulsion policy is that they snap the student's wand, no matter the offense. I get it if the student committed a crime that would land them in Azkaban if they were of age, but that's insane for someone who, say, flew when Madam Hooch said not to.

The point of this post is that I always find it a bit funny when you have these "chosen ones" threatened with expulsion or the like. Because they kinda need Harry around because of the prophecy.

** I think yes?

Dumbledore could very well have a plan for such an event. He was obviously prepared to defend Harry in OOTP when Harry cast the Patronus in Little Whinging, but Dumbledore's plan was always to keep Harry at Hogwarts where he could be close and well monitored and where Dumbledore knew the rules of the game.

Harry outside of Hogwarts and outside of the Dursleys turns him into a wildcard. Harry has a penchant for mischief, not necessarily his own fault, but he attracts attention, sometimes powerful attention, which escalates pretty magnificently at times. I think Dumbledore would plan to isolate and educate Harry some other way if he were expelled (private tutors, a Fidelius-hidden location, etc). Harry would probably gripe and grumble as he usually does, but it would be necessary in Dumbledore's eyes, and not a /terrible/ alternative to Hogwarts. Hogwarts is just the best middle-ground between having a normal magical childhood and training to defeat a Dark Lord. Outside of Hogwarts, and everything has to skew toward the latter far quicker.

*** Yeah, you may be right.

Another angle, and this one really delves into fanfic territory, what if Harry just... left? You say that Dumbledore would offer private tutors and somewhere safe, but what if Harry turned it down and just left the wizarding world entirely?

As both you and I point out: Dumbledore /needs/ Harry to be at least partially trained to fight Voldemort. But what do you do with a Harry that refuses to be a part of that? A Harry that, after being expelled (a process that, if memory serves, involves the snapping of your wand), decided that he didn't want to be a wizard.

I question Harry being expelled, because that's really the only place Dumbledore really has unilateral control over Harry, whatever the reasoning.

** Fudge expelling him or something really dark that canon Harry isn't capable of.

Harry killing Draco (that's what brought this up?) in HBP would, at worst, result in Scrimgeour using him, but Draco probably had the Dark Mark, so even that's up in the air.

*** Actually, what brought this up was me misremembering the broom flying scene in PS.

Fudge is a good choice for it, someone far enough removed to not take my "Harry needs to fight Voldemort" reasoning into account.

** Didn't Dumbledore threaten expulsion for Harry and Ron after the flying car incident at the start of CoS?

Though I would suspect it would have to be an empty threat, at least with Harry. (Though who would dare to try and expel Molly Weasley's son?!)

If nothing else this would make Order meetings /really/ awkward.

But, as I've been reminded, expulsion means your wand is snapped. If Harry has no wand how can he defeat Voldemort in accordance with the prophecy? So yeah, I'm inclined to call that an empty threat.

***** Another good reason. If Harry gets expelled not only does he lose his wand, a useful tool in general, he also loses the brother wand to Voldemort.

More and more this thread seems to be turning up reasons that Dumbledore would, at least, be very hesitant to expel Harry.

Can the Elder Wand conjure gold? Phoenix feathers are highly magical and have other misc effects. Transfiguring/Conjuring one that would pass inspection seems too good to be true.
