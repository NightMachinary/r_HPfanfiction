Ideally long form stories that are finished, updating, or that just won't leave me cripplingly depressed where they were abandoned. The way that Pureblood Pretense and related books really explore the the Lower Alleys has me hungry for more. Explorations of the wizarding world in other cultures is also totally something I'm interested in, or even just the legal systems related to being in magical society.


** My Story "Patron" might fit your request. It's an AU with extensive world building. Alternate Magical Britain, France, Bulgaria, Turkey, the Balkans, Jamaica and Scandinavia play a role, with different magical customs and views. Even in Britain, there are different cultures, not just one Mainstream one.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** It's slowly updating, but still going. One of my two favorite fics of all times: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome by Ihateseatbelts), a massive AU with a wizarding world that feels as if it evolved differently from the muggle world we know.

There's also my other favorite fic linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone) which has a much smaller, tighter focused extensive world building (as in, I'm fairly certain that the world building goes deep, but the story focuses more on a small scale with, near the end, larger stakes).

#+begin_quote
  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

Now, that's hard, most of fics with good worldbuilding die young.

But there is this.

linkffn(10918531;10918531;11407944;11686212;12125300)

Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse, and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of either. Matou Shinji, the protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him a failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets a letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focuses on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements of both settings with author's original ideas. Features Mahoutokoro, Durmstrang, and original magical school. Ongoing, with currently irregular updates.

And sort of those:

[[http://tinyurl.com/jkc2qeu][Alexandra Potter]] - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in heavily magical Hogwarts. It focuses on school life and author's variation on magic system. Only the first year is complete, but it stands on its own and theoretically there is a new version planned. With theoretically being the key word here.

Original Description:

#+begin_quote
  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - This fic is still starting up, but has strong (though slow) worldbuilding. It's about non-BWL Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindelwald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. On temporary (I hope) hiatus.

Also, +1 to Untitled Tome.

#+begin_quote
  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.

*** So imo, worldbuilding is good when it feels natural, which it does in the two stories mentioned in the thread title. But bad when it feels like its just there for the sake of doing world building. Then it just adds unnecessary elements that seem out of place and weird. I find it distracting and annoying in that case. A Maurader's Plan seemed to fit in the latter category to me. Though I didn't read all of it. I don't actually remember that much about the story so I might be somewhat confusing it with other ones, but I remember it seeming to start as a post GOF AU with a fairly small change initially that would snowball, but instead of just having that change, it was like bam now there is this new element of wizarding society that you would have expected to be relevant in Harry's first four years but apparently never came up, and then this new element, and then this one. It just requires too much suspension of disbelief for me, would have been better if it stuck with a more canon like world with just the Sirius doing something different change. Starting with a world that seems like canon, and just randomly introducing new elements doesn't work for me.

Most politics or family magic world building stories fall into the latter category for me as well.
