No slash. No bashing.

Bonus points if it is a Dumbledore-mentors-Harry story.

Note: I've already read linkffn(5201703; 5971274; 5843349; 4152930; 7309863)


** So, linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond) has my favorite Dumbledore of all time. [[/spoiler][Essentially, Dumbledore's method of coping with PTSD from the whole Grindlewald conflict and 'first' war with Voldemort is acting kinda crazy. Harry keeps finding wisdom in everything/most things Dumbledore does, while Ginny thinks he is just straight up coocoo for cocoa puffs. Hilarity ensures.]]

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

*** Not usually a fan of romance fics, but I'll give it a go. It sounds pretty similar to linkffn(8490518) which I have enjoyed previously.

#+begin_quote
  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

**** Read it, and while I thought the harry / Ginny bits were good, the dumbledore bits were GREAT. A lot more of a whimsical, sweet-eating (alas! Earwax!) dumbledore, and less of the not-a-conjuror-of-cheap-tricks, solemn wizard mentor that many fics have going on.

**** Its definitely worth at least reading through 10 chapters. It probably has the most developed Dumbledore in any fic I've read. He has the whole wise powerful old wizard thing going on but still has occasional humorous moments.
