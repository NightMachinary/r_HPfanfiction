Okay so I don't really know how to explain it but I'm looking for fanfics kind of 'reading the books' but it's fanfiction instead of the books and for them it's real um yeah does anyone understand orrr


** Can't say I've seen this kind of story in Harry Potter fandom. I've read a lot of Percy Jackson characters or Naruto characters 'reading the books' stories but none in Harry Potter section.

** probably you'd phrase it as "HP characters reading fanfiction" or "HP characters reading fanfiction like 'reading the books' trope"

That said, I've never seen any. I think I've seen some in the Percy Jackson fandom like Sciny said but none in HP.
