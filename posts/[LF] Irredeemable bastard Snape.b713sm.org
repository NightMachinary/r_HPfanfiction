Prisoner of Azkaban states that many death eaters knew of Pettigrew's betrayal of the Potters. Snape, who is very heavily implied to know Peter is still alive by virtue of the map, tries to get Sirius kissed. Is there any fanfiction where he gets called out on this? I'd like a fic where Snape knew Sirius was innocent. Where the implications of this are far. Maybe Dumbledore loses his air of infallibility. Maybe Snape gets scrutinized more as well as being charged with past crimes. I'd like to avoid pairings.


** Yes please I'd like this too! Canon Snape is an irredeemable asshole already! If he ACTUALLY cared about Lily, about honoring her memory, the things SHE valued, then he would have tried to treat Harry way better, and be better himself. Does he think she's looking down on him and SMILING at how he's treating her son? The son she died for, because HE made her have to in the first place? He should be begging Harry for forgiveness every day! That's why I don't believe he actually LOVED Lily at all, it was just a creepy obsession. He doesn't AT ALL act like someone who actually cared.

**** I think it was a thing by book 4 since it has Dumbledore vouching for him despite Karkaroff claiming that Snape was a deeply loyal Death Eater.

Which is perhaps the easier way to shit on Snape. The Public gets no evidence of Snape's turn, no "his knowledge helped to save families X,Y and Z". Add his treatment of the Slytherins (half of which have Death Eaters or suspected Death Eaters as families), and you can easily shit on Snape and Dumbledore for that plot. And since Dumbledore is unlikely to reveal the obsession over Lily (not that this would appease the public), you can easily use that to make some changes to the Hogwarts staff.

This might or might not be an element in the chapter I am currently writing.

***** I like that sort of plot. Snape does something unforgivable, like sabotaging a student's work (I mean in a Universe where Harry is broken), then has to defend allegations from his career as well as his past as a terrorist.

*** Rowling did gain some respect from me for saying he wasn't a hero. Movie Snape, I like. Even Rowling likes movie Snape better. But Snape in the books is simply an awful person.

***** Movie Snape doesn't sneer like Book Snape and comes across as more critical than condescending. Plus Rickman's physical performance has Snape genuinely seeming to protect Harry at times in the films.

****** Alan Rickman was brilliant. I always loved the scene where he covers the kids with his body from Lupin.

** Did Snape actually know about Pettigrew and his betrayal of the Potters?

I would have thought the DEs were protective of identity, particularly that of a double agent

*** Snape */did/* know that Pettigrew was a Death Eater.

Sirius says that the *Death Eaters in Azkaban knew about Pettigrew* as they would mutter and scream about his part in Voldemort's downfall.

Now consider the fact that when Voldemort is resurrected and the DEs arrive in the graveyard, they silently and seamlessly form a single and specific circle. They know their exact positions, and leave places empty for those who are *imprisoned*, dead or have betrayed them. They know each other as Voldemort openly names them. When Pettigrew receives the silver hand, he joins *his place in the circle.* The same circle in which Snape stood (Voldemort references him too). These were Voldemort's inner circle, his marked Death Eaters.

Snape was a Death Eater since the time the prophecy was given and before the Potters went into hiding. There was no way he couldn't have known. /His testimony could've at least gotten Sirius a trial./

  I heard things in Azkaban, Peter. ... They all think you're dead, or you'd have to answer to them. ... I've heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds like they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went to the Potters' on your information ... and Voldemort met his downfall there. And not all Voldemort's supportÂ­ers ended up in Azkaban, did they?

  Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears.
