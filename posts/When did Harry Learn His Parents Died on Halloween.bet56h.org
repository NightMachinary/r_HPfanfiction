This has been bothering me for a while. We know that Voldemort attack the Potters on Halloween'81, but when did the book actually shows Harry that his live changed on Halloween?

I thought it was on PoS when Dumbledore delivers Harry to Privet Drive, I didn't found any date mentioned there. Maybe it's on PoA? One scene I know for sure is on the graveyard scene in DH, but is it really that late in the series? Or did JKR mention it in an interview somewhere?


** Hagrid told Harry when they first met that Voldemort killed his parents on Halloween. He was explaining to Harry how Voldemort killed off various wizarding families, and said "Maybe he thought he could persuade 'em... maybe he just wanted 'em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago."

*** Yep, you're right:

#+begin_quote
  "All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old." - Hagrid, SS, Chapter 4
#+end_quote

However, I suppose you could argue about whether an overwhelmed eleven-year-old would remember that kind of detail, especially since the books never show Harry thinking about his parents on Halloween.

**** I ascribe that to Rowling wanting Harry to have the tragic backstory, but without the emotional trauma that usually comes with it. If Harry was a real person, he would want literally nothing to do with Halloween celebrations after learning that his parents were murdered on that particular day, a decade past.

***** And some fics do indeed show Harry retreating on "Dark Lord Killed My Parents" day.

** Hagrid tells Harry that it was on Halloween when he tells him the truth about his parents when he gives him his Hogwarts letter.

** In Deathly Hallows he sees his parents dates of birth and dates of death on thier headstone, and later in the same book, after Harry and Hermione escape Godric's Hollow, Voldemort has a flashback to Halloween 1981 and Harry sees it from his perspective. I can't remember any other point in the books where Harry learns when his parents died, but it's possible he learns off screen so to speak, before DH.

** It never happens in-story, but it's very reasonable to assume that Petunia or Vernon mentioned it offhandedly at the same time they told him that his parents died in a car crash.

** I thought it was in CoS somewhere? Something to do with Nick's deathday party, maybe?

... actually, that might be a fanfic I'm thinking of.

It's not inconceivable that it happened off-screen, so to speak, either.

** Said clearly in book only in DH with the headstones. Probably way before off screen.

1) Possibility Petunia told him when his parents died (thought book say she never wanted to talk about them and she is petty enough to withold important informations like that).\\
2) Once he learnt he was a wizard, and a celebrity, even without doing an Hermione and read every book of the subject, there is a good chance he at least skimmed through one and got the date of the attack\\
3) Told off screen, the end of the war in common knowledge and pretty big chance someone mentionned it in passing "It's Halloween next week, and also the 10th anniversary of the end of the war so it's pretty neat . . ."
