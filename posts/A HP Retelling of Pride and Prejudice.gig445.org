I think I found a way to make the stupid Lord Potter and Molly Weasley trying to steal Harry;s money tropes work (somewhat.)

The tropes already suggest a bad regency era fanfic so why not go all the way and make it a P&P retelling?

Harry is Darcy obviously and Ginny can be Elizabeth Bennett. Feel free to genderbend the other Weasley siblings.

I started writing this a joke but now I want to read it.
