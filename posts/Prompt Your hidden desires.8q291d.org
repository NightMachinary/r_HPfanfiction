Hello! Today, I'm here with one simple request. Create short prompts for me to reply to.

A little background here: I used to join a lot of storywriting competitions at school, but it petered out because schools of where I'm from don't put too much stock in storycrafting in writing exams. Therefore, I fell out of practice. Now, I really want to write my own fanfic, and if you search for me on ffn, you'll see the start of a fanfic, which is unbetad and was hastily written over the course of 4 hours, from 11 to 2 am when I was supposed to be studying for a test. So if you please, I can kill two birds with one stone. I get to practice writing, and you get to see your seed grow into a sapling. It might not look good, but there will be a sapling.

If you would kindly help a guy out, there are two things I would like to mention. 1: No smut. I am a kissless, sexless virgin, and writing smut for me would be very, very [[/r/badwomensanatomy][r/badwomensanatomy]]. 2: I do crack very well. I love making people laugh, so do your worst!

I won't judge you for wanting weird things. Go wild, my pretties.

Edit: okay so i know i havent replied at all so im sorry i have exams and the muse has decided to take an unscheduled break i swear ill get back to you all


** Hmmm...

- While walking through the Forbidden Forest, during the events of Prisoner of Azkaban, Hagrid stumbles across a large, black dog. Hagrid decides to keep him for another pet.

- A One-on-One-on-One Duel between Ginny, Luna, and Hermione

- Harry actually does swallow the Snitch during his first Quidditch match

- Upon hearing that Albus Dumbledore has returned to Hogwarts, Lucius Malfoy goes to confront him, and arrives while the Weasleys are still present.

*** I'll be replying to this in bits, hope you don't mind.

No.4: I wrote one of these before! For you, even. Lemme find it.

Edit: here

Dobby Apparated the Weasleys and Malfoy into the kitchens.

"Looking heres! Sirs be cage fighting with butter knives!"

As the elves swarmed around them, piddly little plastic sporks appeared in Lucius' and Arthur's hands.

"Fight! Fight! Fight!" screamed the elves.

"Yes, fight! This is the best thing that's happened down here in years!" cried Helga Hufflepuff's portrait, who by some deus ex machina had arrived in her frame at that very moment.

Arthur, being more experienced with Muggle items, quickly beat Malfoy into submission with the spork, and was carried out of the kitchens on the shoulders of the Hogwarts elves.

"Wait. Where are the children?"

/cut to the Quidditch pitch/

"Lockhart! Get us down this instant!"

"Nonsense, children! You'll be safe up there in those hoops, safe from your angry parents! Well, my job here is done. Toodle-oo."

He then proceeded to run straight into the Forbidden Forest, where he began a 6-year affair with Ronan which ended in an amicable divorce.

**** Oh yeah, you did reply to one of these before! Had I looked more closely at your username, I'd have thought of a new prompt.

Still, it makes me laugh.

** I've always fantasized about being a kid again, specifically 3-5 years of age. Could you do something where Harry was deaged, or just never aged past that, and has to go to Hogwarts or something? He keeps his older self's memories.

** Hmm...have a look at [[https://1d4chan.org/images/1/12/Sir_Bearington.jpg]]

In short; someone playing a tabletop RPG made an intelligent bear character, raised his disguise and bluff skill to the max, and had a butler to interpret for him. Everyone they encountered (well, almost everyone) thought the bear was human.

Now, keeping that in mind, and possibly also Chicken Boo from Animaniacs...can you write a short story where Harry is a magical creature (or even a crossover creature; I like chocobos) of some sort, and everyone around him is oblivious or trying their best to not notice?

** Harry time travels to kill Voldemort but dimension travels instead meeting Yandere Female!Riddle.

A New HP/FSN where Harry actually fights as master on a Holy Grail War without Ron, Hermione and the duality between DEs and Order. Something similar to London nights on FFN and especially Harry Potter and the Not-Fatal-At-All Cultural Exchange Program on spacebattles.

**** FSN is Fate/Stay Night, a Japanese franchise which started with a popular Visual Novel. It works well as a crossover with fantasy series since the plot is about summoning legendary heroes regardless of their timeline or dimension.

** Tsundere F!Tom please.

- Tom's diary horcrux successfully possesses Ginny Weasley, but at a cost. Tom is now a girl and somehow she cannot get rid of her undying love for Harry Potter.
- Note: Not a love story, just pure crack in which Tom attempts to pathetically murder Harry, but always fails because stuff (feelings) happens.

** I got one more!

The events of canon, but they're frequently stymied...by rain.

Harry's first flight class? Boom, rain.

Quidditch matches? Rain!

Smuggling a dragon? Broom flight cancelled due to downpour.

Detention in the Forbidden Forest? Get a raincoat.

Herbology classes, follow the spiders, Buckbeak's execution, the Triwizard Tasks, Astronomy classes, Thestral flight, Hogsmeade weekends, the Battle of Hogwarts...all of them get very cold and wet.
