Disregarding the creepy overtones of stuff like marriage laws in fanon, within the canon itself, do people really care much if people truly are interested in them? It's one thing for Merope to give TR a love potion - that was decades ago, and has the consequence of a child "incapable of love", et cetera.

But Fred and George seem to sell love potions, and brewing Amortentia is a NEWT class without an apparent worry over the potion going awry as with the Felix Felicis. The love potion from Romilda seems almost comedic to me, which is kind of perplexing in a series so focused on "good things are right and bad things are wrong".

What are your thoughts on this? Do they just not care, or think love potions are fine to use?

It was just, "You just witnessed a friend die and got tortured in the process? Eh, back to the Dursleys with you. By the way, you're going a month without any real contact. LOL."

Y'know, if it wasn't for the fact that Harry was so pure or whatever, I reckon the whole 'Dark Lord will mark him as his *equal*' thing would have played a bigger part in the story.

Hogwarts provides free education. There should be no money. It /should/ be a perfect instance of a meritocratic society. In reality, it would almost certainly be biased based on blood purity, but money shouldn't come into it.

No money. Free education. Easy healthcare (regrowing bones and limbs with magic/potions should be incredibly cheap, especially if you can just duplicate the ingredients).

The society might not be perfect, but it would certainly be post-scarcity. You can literally duplicate anything with a wave of a wand.

  Hogwarts doesn't provide free education.
#+end_quote

I don't remember there being anything implying that there was a cost to go to Hogwarts. And Dumbledore doesn't mention a cost of tuition when he's telling Tom Riddle, Jr. about Hogwarts:

#+begin_quote
  There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes.
#+end_quote

It could be said that Hogwarts takes the cost from the assistance before it's submitted (similar to financial assistance for uni in the UK), but a) we're talking about the only school in the country, b) it's a secondary school which is almost always free, and c) it should be mentioned when the assistance is given, so a student who suddenly comes into money and therefore isn't covered by financial assistance isn't shocked by not being able to join Hogwarts the second year.

Also, if there were tuition costs, the Weasleys would almost certainly have gone broke after the trip to Diagon Alley in CoS, as I doubt they had enough to cover all the books (second-hand), new robes for Ginny, a wand for Ginny, and an unknown amount of tuition for 5 students.

Also, it is never implied that there is a tuition fee, and English secondary schools (as Hogwarts was most likely based off) don't have tuition fees.

#+begin_quote
  Food doesn't appear to be an issue in the HP series, but it's clear that other things are, like clothing and wands.
#+end_quote

+See, this is interesting, because I would assume it would be the other way around. Food can't be duplicated (first of the Principle Exeptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration)+

I just realised that you can use the Gemino spell on food:

#+begin_quote
  You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you've already got some...
#+end_quote

The Wikia page links "increase the quantity" to the Gemino spell page, so it seems that is covered.

Let us assume that you can't duplicate magical items, such as wands or invisibility cloaks, and retain the magic, since the Trio duplicate the Locket without any duplication of Voldemort's soul. Does that immediately discredit duplicating the materials? Are the magical properties of, say, wand woods, or potions ingredients, inherent to the material, or is it 'added'? There's nothing implying anything other than that the materials are inherent. An isolated oak tree would likely still provide wood that could be used in wand-making, although certain bits of wood would obviously be more suited to making wands from.

#+begin_quote
  resources are not infinite in the HP universe, only some non-magical resources are.
#+end_quote

If we assume that magical properties don't transfer (for the sake of the argument), that still doesn't apply to non-magical resources like metal. Metalic money would be worthless. Hermione modified and duplicated Galleons. It makes sense that a wizard like Mundungus Fletcher would be fine with duplicating Galleons and buying stuff with it. And since it's implied to be perfect duplicates...

How do you know? In real life my education was paid for by a mix of contributions from other family members, a bursary from the school, help from the government, and help from private charity. None of those things are mentioned in canon, but they're also not ruled out. If they do exist in canon then they wouldn't be mentioned anyway because it's a story book for children concentrating on the activities of children, not a treatise on the economics of education.

Because Rowling has in no way used the book series for children to comment on social issues, like poverty, child abuse, bullying, prejudice, bigotry...? It's not as if the main antagonists are literally wizarding versions of Nazis, and it's not as if one of the main families suffers obviously from poverty. /s

+Siriusly+ Seriously, though, Rowling is writing a book series for children, but at the same time, she isn't shying away from +Sirius+ serious issues. (Yes it's a /terrible/ pun. No, I'm not going to stop making it. He's my favourite character!)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Is it? I can't see how, but then I suppose there's nothing to compare it to. The only link I can see is that it's a boarding school, but I think that's more for world-building and to get Harry away from the Dursleys' and into an obviously magical world, rather than a specific implication of tuition fees. Also, I suppose, it has rich upper class snobs there.

(Side note: I probably shouldn't be too harsh on private school kids; I did a year at a private school for A-levels)

But do you really expect me to believe that the Weasleys' put seven children through private school on a single government salary? That's insane! They'd homeschool from Fred and George onwards, if not before!

Being a charity case isn't something that I talked about with people at school, and I have no idea which of my school friends and acquaintances were charity cases, but statistically it's 100,000 times more likely that I win the lottery this weekend than that none of them were. So no, I doubt that the Weasleys would have talked about it, given that I didn't and none of the other charity cases I went to school with did. I don't remember whether Harry did muse about it in canon, but even if he did it would be reasonable for him to assume that they were getting help from elsewhere.

You must have missed the bits where I talked about getting financial support from other family members, the government, the school, and other charities. None of that is ruled out in canon, and all of it exists in the real world. In particular real-world schools tend to have specific programmes to help fund the education of the children of impecunious ex-pupils.

I don't understand this argument at all. In what way is this rape? Making someone forget something that has absolutely no bearing on the rest of their lives anyway, but has the potential to see a society destroyed, is quite justifiable to me.

edit: I should also clarify. I strongly object to the use of the word rape for things that are not rape, without making it clear that you don't mean it symbolically. It isn't true that any non-consensual act is is rape. If I get beat up in the street that is certainly not consensual, but it's not rape, it's battery. The only exception for this I can get behind is legilimancy because it's somewhat analogous to rape, but obviation is nothing at all like rape in any way.

********* No one calls obliviations /actual/ rape. That's what the "mind-" qualifier is for. It's not rape of your person, it's rape of your mind. Obviously there's not a direct comparison between physical forcible sex and the mind, so you have to take those elements of physical rape which make it bad, and apply them to an act of crime against the mind. Obliviation fits those, so we call it "mind-rape."

At this point it's as much of a fanon slang term as "rape" is used in video games. If my team dominates another team so utterly that they say that we "raped them," no one is actually implying that I came to their house and physically raped them. Saying "Uhm, ackchyually, it's not rape," doesn't do anything. No shit, it's not actually rape. It's all the elements that make rape bad, except applied to the mind.

You arguing that obliviation isn't "actually rape" makes you sound like you're arguing that obliviation "isn't actually that bad."

Yes, and you can use a penis to rape someone, but penises aren't evil. Good, I'm glad we at least understand that tools are not capable of immoral/illegal acts on their own accord. Nice of you to miss the entire argument there. We're not talking about "is the tool which is obliviation equivalent to the act of rape?" We're comparing the /act/ of obliviation with the /act/ of rape. You doing this is like me saying,

#+begin_quote
  Well, sure penises can be used to rape. But penises can also make babies, so that means rape isn't bad.
#+end_quote

That sort of insane logic can't even really be disputed, so all I can do is just hope you see how your statement does nothing except deflect from the discussion at hand into a discussion of how little sense you're making.

Edit: also, your original statement is that "obliviation is nothing like rape." If you would not consent to memory modification, and you would not consent to rape (obviously, because if you consented it wouldn't be rape), then that's one similarity that took me no time whatsoever.

** I'm fairly certain that marriage laws and other such weird shit in fanon is extrapolated from the way love potions are handled both in-universe and narratively. Everything that we see of love potions suggest that not only does wizarding society not mind that date rape drugs are openly sold, but the way they're treated by the narrative itself is if they're a joke. It would be weirder if wizarding society /didn't/ have some extremely questionable practices as well.

At the same time, I think it was both incredibly cowardly and boring for Rowling to tone down love potions. Not only are they clearly not creating true love (or at least, planting the seed for it), but they have an extremely limited duration It just seemed like a way to play off something she added without thinking about much at first, and had to reconcile it with a story whose characters are supposed to be interpreted as good.

This is why nobody can really agree on the morality of the wizarding world. It's not that there's moral ambiguity, it's that there's inconsistencies between character behavior, the setting, and the narrative.

There are interesting stories to be told and conflicts to be had revolving around love potions, but you wouldn't see it outside fanfiction (and truthfully, there'd be a lot of people complaining anyways).

** I'd be leery taking the presentation of love potions in the books to represent the position of the wizarding world. Like many aspects of Rowling's worldbuilding, the implications weren't thought through. If they /are/ a correct depiction, that's insane.

#+end_quote

Yeah, the twins really suffer from Rowling's 'pranks are funny' bias here. IIRC their love potions last up to 24 hours, which is /really scary/ as a date-rape drug. I will note that the love potions they sell are marketed only to witches, and the 'attractiveness of the girl' apparently influences the strength of the effect (as does the weight of the boy). It's not clear if these potions are totally generic or if they only work when used by girls on boys. They'd be /slightly/ less terrifying in that case, albeit still horrifying.

  brewing Amortentia is a NEWT class without an apparent worry over the potion going awry as with the Felix Felicis.
#+end_quote

Did they actually brew Amortentia in class? I recall Slughorn showing them a cauldron of it during their first lesson, but I don't remember anyone else making any.

--------------

I think it's fair to suggest that wizards care much less about consent than contemporary society. A few notes:

- Magic-users go about their daily lives constantly armed with a deadly weapon. As a matter of practical course, this means anybody who feels their consent has been violated can retaliate with extreme measures. Even if they can't get away from you, their friends and family can intervene with a lot of firepower.

- The aphrodisiac effect of Veela is looked upon poorly by at least a substantial minority of society, but tolerated. I'm struggling to think of a male character expressing substantial disapproval - Mr Weasley is annoyed, and the referee at the World Cup is angered, but by and large there isn't substantial blow-back against the Bulgarian mascots casually influencing the minds of the crowd.

- There are no canon examples of love potion use I can think of other than women using them on men.

- It's important to remember that there's a huge divide between the rights of wizards and the rights of muggles, who are casually mind-raped with widespread government and societal approval.

- Equivalent effects to what we would consider date-rape drugs (cheering charms, elixir of euphoria) are easily available to high school students and above and not subject to significant regulation or control. The recipes for much more powerful potions (Weasley's Wizard Wheezes) are readily available to intelligence researchers/dedicated experimenters, and Amortentia (assuming Dumbledore's theory is correct) is within reach for an uneducated, possibly illiterate Merope.

- The unforgivability of the Imperius curse does reassure us that the wizarding world considers /some/ levels of coercion to be illegal/immoral.

- But, on the other hand, Harry is bound by the Goblet of Fire without his knowledge or consent, and nobody even /mentions/ this other than to tell him he must compete.

It'd be interesting and illuminating to see what would happen if in reverse of the Romilda Vane love potion fiasco an older, male Hogwarts student successfully dosed a younger, female student. Or even just an older student dosing a younger student. I'd very much like to know what Dumbledore's reaction would have been had Ron (or Harry) not been prevented from acting on his artificial desires.

--------------

So by and large, I'd guess that (sexual) consent is important /if/ the people involved are wizards or have powerful wizard relatives/patrons, since they might otherwise register their disapproval by hexing their assailants and making noise in front of the Wizengamot. But if the victim can't defend themselves and no one else comes forward to complain...

If the person giving dubious consent is a somebody in a bad situation (e.g. Merope, a poor debtor not skilled with magic, a near-human who is legally prohibited from having a wand, a squib, or a muggle in the know) then I don't think wizarding society cares (other than people like Hermione). I know some fics have taken this to its dark conclusion: seedy Knockturn alley brothels where the sex workers can, among other things, be forced to polyjuice into whatever form the client wants. I think this is realistic.

True... but it /was/ the first NEWT potions lesson, and Slughorn was clearly trying to 'wow' them with some of the most powerful potions available to master brewers. Hence the draught of living death and felix felicis in the same display. It was a much more mature and serious setting than your average potions class and the focus was on technical brewing, not 'here's something you can do.' Students who got an EE on their potions OWL and chose to continue on with NEWT classes might reasonably be expected to behave with reasonable caution when it comes to brewing dangerous stuff (Not that that ever stops teenagers from getting into trouble). It seems tame compared to other mentions of love potions in the books, I guess.

**** To be fair, we do not know how exactly the love potions that the twins sell work. If they have a clear influence on the mind of the one they were given to then yes, it's horrible no matter what limitations they may have, but if what they are doing is limited to simply making that one girl appear way more attractive to the person who took it so they have a hard time to not behave like a horny dog but could possibly resist it then it's “only” questionable.

Since we do not know whether the love potion that was in the chocolates came from the twins or if that's a different one (since she originally offered him gillywater, which presumably was spiked with their love potion), we can't say for sure that the potions they sell have that kind of effect. But yes, considering that she had access to whatever she put in the chocolates (since that one clearly affected the mind), be it gotten from the twins or be it self-brewed, something is seriously wrong with that society as a whole.

[[/u/jedijinnora][u/jedijinnora]] never even said that. Perhaps you misread of perhaps you are a bit touchy about the topic, but I can't say. You went fully torqued and immediately attacked [[/u/jedijinnora][u/jedijinnora]] which really isn't cool. You assumed they are speaking about their opinion on male rape victims but I don't even think that's what they are speaking about at all.

Here is what was said:

#+begin_quote
  It's not clear if these potions are totally generic or if they only work when used by girls on boys. *They'd be slightly less terrifying in that case, albeit still horrifying*
#+end_quote

They are saying the potions are terrifying regardless of who they effect, and that belief is clear. They are actually correct in saying the situation would be less terrifying if the potions only works by girls using them on boys, but not in the way you're insinuating. It's less terrifying, although still thoroughly terrifying, simply by looking at the numbers. Roughly half of the population not being able to utilize the potions is objectively a less terrifying situation then if everyone were able to dose anyone else whilly nilly. Actually it would be even less than half of the population if you take into account that male/male and female/female wouldn't be able to utilize the potions, so again it's minimized a bit more.

Another point is that [[/u/jedijinnora][u/jedijinnora]] mentioned the drinker's body mass alters the effectiveness of the potion as well as the users comeliness. Considering men on average have a higher body mass, we could say that the effectiveness of a potion dose on average would be reduced if used only on men. Once again the whole situation is /slightly/ less terrifying. Really that would be the best case scenario for possible love potion victims if the victim were on average of higher body mass then the user. Speaking about the comeliness, if the user were already attractive to the drinker then the potions effects would be more pronounced. That just makes logical sense. It has nothing to do with a belief - a belief I doubt [[/u/jedijinnora][u/jedijinnora]] even has - that male rape victims are /not actually/ being raped if the assailant is a pretty woman.

I need to reiterate again that [[/u/jedijinnora][u/jedijinnora]] *didn't* mention anything about a belief that 'men don't get raped as long as the assailant is pretty'.\\
You are entirely wrong in assuming and insinuating that was said.

and conclude that I think girls raping boys is okay. I say, right there, that I think this scenario is horrifying.

Scenario 1: love potions work when used on anybody by anybody. Scenario 2: love potions only work when used by women on men.

Let me be clear: *both of these scenarios allow a horrifying and unconscionable amount of rape. Neither is acceptable.* However, I think it is clear that scenario 2 is /slightly less terrible/ than scenario 1. That doesn't make it okay. That doesn't mean I like it.

#+end_quote

Boys being raped is wrong. The nature of the attacker does not matter one whit. Anyone being raped is wrong. Anyone having their consent violated is wrong.

So we are in full agreement on this point. A worldview that 'boys being raped is fine as long as the girl is hot' is fucked up beyond belief. *I DO NOT HOLD SUCH A WORLDVIEW*. If I did, I would be evil. I would be fucked up beyond belief. *BUT I DO NOT HOLD SUCH A WORLDVIEW*. And I /resent/, in the strongest possible terms, your accusation of such.

What we disagree about, then, is whether I mistakenly, wrongly said something that made you think that I think:

This is my opinion of the case where the love potions are usable only by a specific group on a specific group. I'll add the clarification that the actual genders don't matter to my opinion (i.e., it would be 'slightly less terrifying, albeit still horrifying' if the potions were only usable by women on men, women on women, only usable by men on men, only usable by men on women, or only usable by X on Y where X and Y are categories smaller than 'anyone').

So somehow the previous sentence asserted that, in your words:

  boys being raped is fine as long as the girl is hot

I do not believe the sentence

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote

  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

does anything of the sort. Can you explain your train of logic to me? Where did I express approval for any kind of sexual assault. *Albeit still horrifying*. I don't get how you can read those words and think that /I think/ any kind of sexual assault is okay. I don't! I don't! I'm sick to my stomach that you and a lot of others seem to think that I believe this. I don't know how I can say it any clearer.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Again, /how is it slightly less terrible?/
#+end_quote

It is slightly less terrible because there are fewer options for rape drugs available to some sexual predators.

Again, it is still terrible that consent is abused by anyone, anywhere. But in one situation /some/ evil predators have a harder time assaulting /some/ of their victims.

It's like, there are evil people who do evil things, and restricting love potions doesn't stop this, I agree. Both worlds are terrible. But love potions are a tool in some predators' toolboxes, and in the case where their use is restricted /this tool is taken away/. Isn't it slightly less terrible if predators have a harder time raping people? Like I said, *this is still horrifying*, but isn't it a tiny, tiny, almost insignificant improvement? Isn't it slightly less terrible, and we all understand that this does not prevent it from being evil in the extreme? Can't I look at two horrific eventualities and note that one is the lesser evil, even if the difference is so small it's almost unnoticeable in comparison to /how evil/ both of these situations are?

*********** I'd like to chime in hear to say that, first of all, this is perhaps one of the most coherent, calm, and decisive explanations of a misunderstanding I've ever seen on reddit in my entire life. Good job! But I do feel compelled (because this is the internet) to say that you're original comment (the whole less 'terrible') thing was incredibly easy to misinterpret, especially as this is a thread about rape.

Rape is a really important, and also easily triggering topic; and in many cases any discussion talking about male victims can cause even more redditrage as we live in a culture where 'don't drop the soap' jokes are still considered relatively PC. In many cases where an issue feels ignored by mainstream media, anybody with strong feelings about the issue, or who knows anybody effected, often feel extremely compelled to speak out against any and all slights.

So all in all this was a very calm and well thought-out response to such an instant outpouring of hate, but I just wanted to try and explain why that hate came both so suddenly and so bitterly. This particular subset of the topic is something very rarely discussed seriously, and indeed public discussion of it is often frowned up/seen as a lot weirder/less important than other, similar issues; so when the topic comes up in places where people can comment anonymously, avoiding normal public scruples and/or the danger of being branded as some kind of crazy MRA, tempers can flare ridiculously high.

:) TL:DR I'm just kind of rambling cuz long angry comment threads hurt my soul.

** Cannon always seemed to have an over-reliance on rule-of-cool and not take the worldbuilding part too seriously (Rowling ain't no Tolkien).

However, if cannon allows moral and consent issues to be trumped by the narrative, fannon seems to actively embrace it. Part of it is just people trying to flesh out the world, but there is a scary amount of celebrating the idea of having great power and using it to bend people to their ideals :/.

On the other hand, there are a few really good fics breaking down the implications that prove fun to read.

J. K. Rowling has said that it is of important symbolic significance that Voldemort, incapable of love himself, was conceived in an act of coercion, rather than genuine love.[12]

  Ravleen: How much does the fact that voldemort was conceived under a love potion have to do with his nonability to understand love is it more symbolic

  J.K. Rowling: It was a symbolic way of showing that he came from a loveless union -- but of course, everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him.

  J.K. Rowling: The enchantment under which Tom Riddle fathered Voldemort is important because it shows coercion, and there can't be many more prejudicial ways to enter the world than as the result of such a union.

****** The debunking is where she says if Merope had survived and raised and loved him, everything would have changed. Voldemort isn't incapable of love, he just never learns it because of his upbringing in the orphanage. The love potion conception is a literary symbol of that, not an actual reason that prevents him from loving.

****** Point is, the love potion isn't what made Tom incapable of love, it's the fact that his parents' relationship fell apart, his father did not care about him, and his mother died shortly after giving birth to him. And while those things were caused by a love potion, there is no direct link from this to Tom being incapable of love, thus it is symbolic, the love potion becoming a symbol for what happened but not the direct cause of what happened to Tom.

******* Exactly this. If her surviving to raise him would have made the difference for his ability to love/understand love, then it was decidedly *not* the love potion conception in itself causing him to be unable to do that. It wasn't some magical interference, potion side effect type thing that some poorly phrased citations make it seem like.

** Dark thought: maybe they don't give a damn as long as it's used on Muggles? True, there's the misuse of muggle artifacts office, but what if the purpose of that department is actually closer to being a part of maintaining the statute of secrecy, and not about muggle protection? That actually makes some sense- Arthur is already shown to be a bit of an odd one out for his fascination with Muggles, I don't think any other magical raised in the wizarding world shows that much interest. He could be skewing our view of his job.

Maybe using a love potion on another magical /is/ a joke- like they expect you or a friend to realize what it is. I mean, look at some of the darker pranks the Marauders pulled on Snape. The public humiliation, the hexes... maybe it's in the same vein of stuff.

***** I don't know that I really want to dip into the realm of whether they CONSIDER it rape. Rape has always struck me as a fairly black and white issue, whether someone believes it is rape or not. Even if your theory is correct, we shouldn't avoid calling it rape just because the characters in this completely made-up universe might not call it that.

I'm not up on Game of Thrones, so I'm not familiar with the show's politics on whether rape is alright or not, I'm afraid.

****** The Ironborn are basically pirates all around. Rather than actually being a crime rape is like some kind of life goal and you never really meet its quota. Raid a town and rape as much as you can. If you like a girl more than usual just keep her and she becomes one of your saltwives. Go back home, get laid and drink as much as possible until you need to raid for more cash again. Rinse and repeat for basically your entire life and that's an Ironborn for you.

As for the avoidance of calling it rape, that really depends on the narrative of a story. Good writing takes place over politics when it comes to fiction imo. If you can't correctly write a villain or other societies because you can't get over your own views to do so then you're a bad writer.

Similarly, I imagine Romilda Vane knew what she was doing was questionable when she attempted to dose Harry with a love potion, presumably in order to rape him. Whether /she/ would call it rape is up for debate, but we could agree here, as outsiders from the narrative, that Romilda Vane would be a rapist, because she raped somebody.
