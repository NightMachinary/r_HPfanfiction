** Having Harry give the Weasley's money, would just embarrass them. Even ignoring their pride at hand, Harry is the same age as their youngest son, even if he did it as an adult, it'd make the Weasley parents feel like they couldn't take care of their children.

And really, they did rather well, imo. All children were fed and given what they needed, sure there were things that they wanted, that they couldn't have, but overall they were still good.

And that's even considering the fact that Molly didn't work, though that did make me wonder... why she didn't work once Ginny went to Hogwarts, she could have done odd jobs here and there, while the children were at Hogwarts...

Wouldn't be surprised if she did, and just didn't say anything to the children about doing it. Also wouldn't surprise me if Charlie or Bill sent them occasional money. Getting money from a child that's yours is less embarrassing then getting money from a child that isn't. (Though that'd probably only happen in very intense moments, or much needed moments).

*** I don't think the OP is claiming that this would be one of Harry's better ideas, just that it would be a fun writing prompt.

*** All Harry should really do is make sure ron and gin gin get proper wands and make sure they can study without disadvantages due to money.

**** Ron never told his parents that his wand was busted; until later, then their parents got him a new one, otherwise both of their wands worked well for them.

While money is nice to have, I've went without before, it helps you learn what to do with it, and how/what to buy stuff on.

Ron never wanted Harry to buy him expensive looking stuff, and a wand is expansive and would have told Harry not too, same as Ginny, she would have as well.

***** I think I have been reading too much fanfic, even though it pains me to admit this. Maybe I should have a re read of the series

****** Fanfics often change our way we view or think of certain characters.

Harry wanted to buy Ron some expensive looking object, Ron objected until Harry basically had to force him, saying it was his Christmas (or Birthday gift, can't remember which) gift for the next some odd years.

******* Omniculors - Harry got him to take them by saying that they were both his birthday and Christmas presents. Ron unknowingly paid him back with leprechaun gold, which vanished, but this wasn't revealed till much later.

** To be fair the Weasley are poor planners did they buy 5 copies of Lockhart books when only 2 of the kids have the class at the same time

*** The school might require all the kids have their own copy.

Not only that, but playing musical chairs with textbooks is harder than it seems. They might have classes on opposite ends of the school. Homework would get really tricky, really fast. Sure, they don't have classes at the same time, but they may all need to read the book at the same time.

Sharing is trickier than it seems. I grew up with three other siblings and we had to share everything.

***** That doesn't stop the teacher from requiring every student have their own copy.

And it doesn't make sharing any easier. If anything, it makes it harder because all of his homework assignments are going to involve those specific textbooks. If there were more than one teacher that other teacher would require their own textbooks.
