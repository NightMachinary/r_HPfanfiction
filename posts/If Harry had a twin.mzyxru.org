I always wondered where the trope where Harry has a twin that would automatically be super jealous to be in his shadow, and that they wouldn't get along at Hogwarts came from.

I am not talking about the wrong boy who lived fanfictions where they are separated (that makes no sense in my opinion) , but about those where harry AND his twin were both raised at the Dursleys ?

I personally think that their childhoods would make them super close to each other since they would have both suffered the abuse of The Dursleys and found comfort in each other. So they probably would show a united front at Hogwarts.

I don't know if they would end up in the same houses or not, and Im totally not saying that they would be like Fred and George, but they would still have each other's back and stay close.


** I can see Harry twin getting a teeny tiny bit jealous. But that is mostly due to them wanting to have and identity. Outside of being the "Boy who lived" twin. But Loving Harry fair more than they could ever be jealous of him.

Or maybe Harry's twins a squib. And they're just jealous that he can get away from the Dursley. But also loving him a lot.

I honestly haven't read a lot of fic's were Harry has a twin so I don't know.

** I've got a Wip where Harry is favoured by Hagrid in the first few scenes and his twin is annoyed by it, going so far as agreeing with Draco in Madam Malkins. But they talk it out before Eyelops and Hagrid apologises by giving Hedwig to the twin (Harry is a messy kid and wouldn't get along with her in this AU).

Most of the heart of the story is about the twin still choosing to protect Harry since he is the relation to Lily that keeps Harry safe.

** Yeah I've always wondered how the wbwl thing became such a rigid and defined trope because the idea of the potters actually abandoning a child is so ridiculous.

I'm writing one where they're twins but because of their upbringing at the Dursleys they're super tight because it's basically them against the world. it's the only way I see that going unless there have been mitigating circumstances. Like perhaps Petunia would engage in some divide and conquer head games, but I think twins or any siblings would be more likely to bind together as kids in the face of shitty abusive behaviour
