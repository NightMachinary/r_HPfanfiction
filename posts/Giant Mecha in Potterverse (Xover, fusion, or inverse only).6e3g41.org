I have a pacific rim/hp xover in my read list but i've yet to see pacific rim. Anyone got any suggestions? I'm craving Harry piloting a veritech fighter against other planes then transforming to kick ass of other giant things.


** Omg I just had this wicked dream the other night where Arthur bought Ron an issue of Robotech thinking it was a standard muggle science magazine and then Ron becomes obsessed with building his own mecha, learning by watching Arthur work on his ford.

I don't have the writing ability to do the plot bunny justice, but seriously picture it. It would be gold.
