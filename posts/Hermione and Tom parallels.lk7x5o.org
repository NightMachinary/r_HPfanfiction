Two muggleborns (or close enough) with a thirst to prove themselves and learn more about the magical world?

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

My own two cents: Hermione and Tom both learned from a young age how important magical power and knowledge is to the achievement of their goals. They are both unafraid to use their considerable talents to achieve their own ends even if it means they have to hurt others. They both have huge ruthless streaks covered up by polished reputations that even their closest friends have fallen for.

**** I hate the booksmart argument so much. Hermione is so important to the plot precisely because of how she /applies/ her magic. Off the top of my head, there's the polyjuice potion, the DA coins, the Beaded Bag, the protection charms, using non-combat magic in combat situations etc. etc. She isn't "just booksmart" by any measure.

More generally, with the exception of magic based on intent and emotion (which the minority of the magic by a huge margin), booksmart is how you become powerful in the Wizarding World. Knowledge is literally power there. The more spells you know, the more powerful you are. The most powerful wizards are noted based on how varied their spellwork is in a duel. Dumbledore and Voldemort are the most powerful people in the world precisely because of the extent of their magical knowledge. Hermione's "booksmart" therefore directly translates into "power".

Also, her EE in DADA isn't indicative of her power. It's a matter of personality. Gut and nerve when facing stuff like Boggarts for example can make or break your score. Extremely cognitive Hermione will get points docked because she'd freeze up, not because she can't perform the magic.

So yes, Hermione is in fact a very powerful witch.

***** Hermione isn't really anywhere close to being as powerful as Dumbledore or Voldemort. In canon, Snape was shown to be extremely studios as a teen and created spells of his own. James and Sirius knew a whole lot of magic and got straight O's in their O.W.Ls without working their asses off.

None of them compared to Voldemort, and by extension, Dumbledore.

Hermione is a very powerful witch, yes. But she would never end up being the kind of threat Voldemort was because she doesn't have his (or Dumbledore's, or occasionally, even Harry's) instinctual understanding of magic. Dumbledore talks about theories of magic beyond that which books refer to, giving insight that isn't academic in nature. Voldemort, for all his disregard of love, recognises Lily's protection as a strong and old enchantment, and comes up with a method to subvert it. Harry himself sees how the Bonds of Blood saved his life, thus allowing him to live after taking the Killing Curse again, during his conversation with Dumbledore in Deathly Hallows.

Has Hermione ever showed this? Remember, Harry taught her too in OotP, during their DA lessons. Stuff which he learnt at 14 for the Triwizard Tournament from a textbook, she learned that from Harry when she was 16.

This does not discredit Hermione. She is quite a good witch in her own right. But putting her in the top bracket of wizards and witches vastly overstates her power, and fails to recognise her real role and importance in canon.

#+end_quote

I don't believe I claimed that she was. She isn't. Even if her baseline ability is like Dumbledore's or Voldemort's (which is a stretch I know, but let's suppose for the sake of the argument), they are inclined like scientists while she is inclined like a politician. She studies magic based on what she needs instead of learning for learning's sake. That's a tendency that would put her at a disadvantage against more curious individuals like Voldemort and DUmbledore were shown to be.

My point really was more that her inclination towards power is a lot like Riddle's. They seek power because there are things that they want, and their experiences have taught them that it is only through gaining more power and knowledge that they could achieve their goals. Riddle desires immortality so he learns about and creates his horcruxes. Hermione desires to finish the war and keep harry safe, so she learns of esoteric charms and spells far above their year to do so.

I was more referring to the similarities in disposition rather than raw ability. (There isn't a feat between them that are similar enough to make a fair comparison, I don't think.)

I'm going to point out that it's a bit unfair to compare 18-year-old Hermione with fully grown Dumbledore or Voldemort in terms of instinctive understanding of magic. I think all questions about her abilities would be put to rest if her understanding of magic at 15 matches Voldemort's and Dumbledore's already. Also, how do you know that their baselines of knowledge weren't academic?

(A tangent: I really don't buy into any of that being "instinctive" in the sense that the understanding was innate. It had always sounded like these two incredibly learned individuals had learned enough magic over their lifetimes so as to be able to recognize even some of the most arcane magics. Kind of like how an experienced doctor would be able to "instinctively" that something is wrong with you, you know? It's a function of their experience rather than any "innate" sense.)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I also think this is another flawed comparison. For one thing, he only understood what the Bonds of Blood did after Dumbledore explained it to him. For another, not only is he experiencing the effects of these special bonds and protections, he was also a first-hand witness to Voldemort's rituals and attempts. That's a lot of information that he has sole access to that Hermione doesn't have. Singular access to information isn't a function of instinct I don't think.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

And again, this is unfair. Harry didn't learn those spells from a textbook. Hermione and Ron were right there assisting him in the learning. They learned it at the same time, but he mastered it first because Hermione /spent all of her time and energy helping him learn./ With the exception of the Patronus, she was still always the first one to master the spell now that she's actually learning for herself.

*I'm still not claiming that she's as powerful as them by the way! Just pointing out that the baselines you're using are flawed.*

#+end_quote

I agree. As I mentioned at the very top (ignore those digressions), I don't think she's on the level of Voldemort or Dumbledore.

I'm still not sure what caused the confusion, but if it was the mention of Voldemort and Dumbledore in my explanation, I was merely using them to illustrate what I meant when I said that possessing more magical knowledge often means power in the Wizarding World. Hermione being "booksmart" (ie. possessing significantly more knowledge than her peers) therefore translates to her being more powerful than most wizards and witches /her age./

The only two things here that discredit book smart are the coins, which were a bite off the Dark Mark, and using spells not as they were intended, but Ron does this with the troll and I'm certain he's not the only one. None of this is "ingenious."

#+begin_quote
  booksmart is how you become powerful in the Wizarding World
#+end_quote

As shown by Snape, Dumbledore, and TMR parroting what you found in a book isn't the end all and be all of becoming powerful. Hermione lacks all their creativity and ingenuity. She doesn't look at the Marauder's Map and the Prince's book as anything other than dangerous. She heard Harry's wand moved of its own accord and learned of the Hallows only to deny both. Tom Riddle and Dumbledore would never do that.

****** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/kh5w7r/unpopular_opinion_hermione_is_actually_very/][This]] is my argument for Hermione's creativity. She doesn't just "parrot" what she learns from the books. That's selling her incredibly short.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle and Dumbledore would never do that.
#+end_quote

Tom Riddle and Voldemort also do not have an extremely reckless best friend whose interest in those objects is likely going to get himself and others hurt or killed. Her overcorrecting to stop instead of meeting these objects with curiosity makes perfect sense for her situation and is not an argument for her lack of curiosity.

Anyway, I do agree with you that she isn't inclined as a scientist in the same way Dumbledore and Voldemort were. Her interests laid in politics where theirs laid in magical advancement.

Copy-pasting my explanation from the other person I replied to.

Lmfao? Tom Riddle was creating Horcruxes and killing people at 16. Dumbledore was best friends with Gellert Grindelwald at 16/17. Nevermind that the Marauder's Map was clearly not dangerous and she was happy to use 'Muffliato' the very next book. Hermione overcorrected because she's a close-minded skeptic.
