"Harry! How come yeh're here today?"

"Just came to meet hedwig, Hagrid"

The half giant visibly sombered at his declaration so he plasted a smile and followed.

"Don't worry. I'll spend some time with you after I'm done with her, I'm sure you have some rock cakes."

Hagrid perked up at the words, his sullen look gone.

"Right. I can share some stories 'bout yeh parents while we eat."

This time it was harry whose mood did a double take.

"Hagrid, I have told you that I don't want to talk or hear about my parents. Please, don't let me keep reminding you."

Hagrid lowered his head.

"Sorry, 's jus... Jus that I thought yeh'd be happy."

"I'd be the exact opposite."

Harry turned to the small trail beside Hagrid's hut before the atmosphere could grow more awakward. A little further on the path he came to small bump on the ground, a makeshift cross protuding from it. He reached into his robes and laid something down on it.

"Here girl, got some treats for you. Sorry, if they're not to your liking."

The earthen tomb offered no response. So, he continued with his purpose for today.

"I-I won't be coming again after today, Hedwig." He let the silence weigh in air for just a moment. "It hurts. Even the happy memories hurt and everytime I come here I'm just back... in those moments. I won't apologise or undercut it girl. This is just me being selfish." He got up walking away from the grave a few steps before taking one last look. The memory of Malfoy piercing hedwig's chest with that small potion knife crossed his thoughts, he instantly turned away.

"Goodbye, friend."

*** Harry later proceeds to kill (in an alleged accident) Lucius for slipping the dairy in Ginny's bag that finds it's way to Luna. Draco watchs it but has no evidence to prove the murder :)
