Where instead of changing things for the better, the character (or characters) change things for the worse by accident.

Maybe Voldemort comes back sooner, maybe characters die in this timeline that didn't in theirs, maybe the Basilisk kills people instead of only petrifying them this time around, maybe Sirius' soul gets sucked by Dementors, just any kind of horrible thing. Can be other things then what I mentioned.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new, would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes and the like. (Doesn't have to focus on pairings).


** I always want to see a fic in which Hermione kills Tom Riddle in his orphanage and the resulting butterfly effects lead to Grindelwald winning

**** Tom was born in 1926, and Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald in 1945, so the timeline works out.

** Another option can start off like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], but on September 26 1983, Soviet nuclear early warning system [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident][detected the launch of 5 US ICBMs]]. In our world, Lieutenant Colonel [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident][Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov]] judged it to be a false alarm and prevented a retaliatory nuclear strike.

In this world, however, he was not present that day and things quickly escalated to global thermonuclear war. 95% of human population perished. Potters, Grangers, and a few friends must now survive the post apocalyptic and radioactive landscape.

** Don't know if this is strictly time-travel or not... definitely do-over, but with multiple twists.
