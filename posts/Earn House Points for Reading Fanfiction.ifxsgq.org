Ever wanted to earn House Points for reading fanfics, making recs, and engaging with other readers? Join our Discord! We do several reads a month, offer help to writers, and are a generally friendly place for people in the fandom. <3

(We are lacking in Gryffindors, so come rep Gryffindor House to even things up a bit!)
