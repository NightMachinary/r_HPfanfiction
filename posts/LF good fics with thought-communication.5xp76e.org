I simply love the concept, in basically any form. Be it with Legillimency, soul-bonds, or anything else the author comes up with.

I love the concept, and am quite fond of it even outside the potterverse (for example with Eragon, Open Minds, ...)

The only thing that disqualifies a fic outight for me is mpreg and snarry, however I'd prefer some nonslash.

Edit: Stuff that I already read: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5xozzu/lf_good_soulbondsoulmate_aus/dejswmw]]


** Generally, soul-bonded Harry/Ginny can talk like that. Here are some less well-known ones:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345): no soul-bond here, but they talk through legilimency.

I have read far fewer Harry/Hermione fics with though communications, but they are some of my MOST FAVORITE ones:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): It's Harry/Hermione/Ron.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341): Harry/Hermione/Luna converse telepathically through the Force.

** I had an idea for a fic like this in the shower yesterday. It involved the premise of basically the entire goblin species sharing a local 'hive mind' type of connection, with proximity and trust affecting how well they can communicate. Intercontinental communication? No way. Standing right next to another goblin? If both are willing, both can communicate at such a level that individual lines are blurred, and both individuals come away changed from the experience (which is the greatest sign of trust goblins can give each other).

I still have to work out a lot of details, such as how much individuality each goblin actually has, what the network is capable of (if multiple goblins work together, can they increase the signal strength and communicate with an isolated pocket far away?) and what its downsides might be.

This would also tie in quite nicely with another idea I had about goblin society, namely that goblin magic forces each goblin to specialise before they reach adulthood. Specialising is a process where goblins select which traits they want to enhance at the cost of which others, and it would be taboo not to specialise, but the degree to which a goblin does so is up to them. All goblins shown in the series are goblins specialised to have eyesight strong enough to read handwriting and intelligence for diplomacy. Others, below Gringotts, might be specialised to be extra in tune with the magic of metals and have increased physical strength, at the cost of the ability to speak, see, smell, and think too much for themselves. This 'smither' would be offset by the presence of a 'sighter' which sees the state of the steel in such detail as to see the crystallization in the metal (but cannot speak, hear, smell, think well, or feel much in the way of magic), and an 'architecter' which plans out the final shape of the design and how to get there using its increased mental visualisation prowess (at the cost of sight, hearing, speaking, hearing and magical attunement). All three of these would have to use a complete mind-meld to overcome their respective drawbacks and work as one to create artifacts of incredible power, far greater than one working alone could accomplish.

The hive mind would also explain why goblins view items as the property of the ones that made it (the goblins themselves) as their concept of individuality is stunted enough such that personal possessions are almost a foreign idea. It would also give a built-in reason for why they're ticked off at not being allowed to use wands: using wands would allow individual goblins to somewhat overcome the drawbacks of specialising away from magic use and attunement. It wouldn't make them completely overpowered, but it would provide them a decent incentive to want to have wands.

My idea was also to have Harry, via accidental magic, tap into and become part of the goblin neural network at a young age (due to wanting friends). This wouldn't be a fluffy 'good goblin' story though, as I'm not forgetting how they're a vicious, underhanded warrior race of bloodthirsty midgets.
