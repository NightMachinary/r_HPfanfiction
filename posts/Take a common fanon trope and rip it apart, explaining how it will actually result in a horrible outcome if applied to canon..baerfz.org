Thought about this after reading a fic where someone convinced Harry he was going to have to marry Draco who is a Male Veela that imprinted on him. He ran away from Britain whilst all the Griffindor's barricaded themselves in the Tower to defend his escape. Turns out it was just a joke but because he never bothered checking it got completely out of hand.


** Due to some +bullshit+ ancient pureblood custom, Harry has to marry ten girls.

He simply marries ten friends and occasionally invites them over for pub crawls and the like. Everyone pursues their own romantic life and simply gets married in the Muggle world when the time comes.

Only that goblins are still bastards in canon, and therefore they not only tricked Harry into handing everything he owns over to them, but they also used his blood to give him a blood-curse which kills him on the spot. This is the real reason why you can never trust a goblin.

Harry is removed from the Dursleys and gets to live with some magical family, only for Death Eaters to kill him and the family because there isn't a bond of blood charm anymore.

Harry starts deliberately slaughtering Death Eaters only for it to turn out that the majority of them were just civilian wizards under the Imperius Curse and thats why they were helpless against a outnumbered not fully trained opponent.

Harry spends a year mostly training wandless magic and martial arts, only to be totally outclassed when he tries to use them in a real fight because they are much inferior to wand magic.

Harry thinks that Goblins will help him when he finds out about him being a horcrux (because Goblins have a repuation to be helpful I guess?) and they respond by discretely killing him, because thats how you destroy a horcrux.

  ‘You might ask -- and with good reason -- why it had to be so. Why could some wizarding family not have taken you in? Many would have done so more than gladly, would have been honoured and delighted to raise you as a son.

  ‘My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but I realised. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters -- and many of them are almost as terrible as he -- were still at large, angry, desperate and violent. And I had to make my decision, too, with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone for ever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure, too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you.

  ‘I knew that Voldemort's knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power.

  ‘But I knew, too, where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated -- to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother's blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative.'

  ‘She doesn't love me,' said Harry at once. ‘She doesn't give a damn --'

  ‘But she took you,' Dumbledore cut across him. ‘She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, *she sealed* *the charm I placed upon you.* *Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.'*

  ‘I still don't --'

  ‘While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, whilst you are there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years.'

Exactly what decent marriage law fics is based on: survival of a species, usually necessitated by some plague, the war, or other cataclysm. And in such a situation even the best or "most enlightened" societies would gladly toss personal freedoms out the window.

Muggleborns would be in a unique situation, of course. They have the choice to run, to be muggle again. But Hermione... I think she'd stay. She'd persevere, one way or another.

Edit: all these fics always mention population numbers; the intent is to frame necessity via extinction.

Usually, it is after some war with Voldemort or Grindelwald and centered around Britain.

And even if we assume your "there are only X wizards left" scenario, it would be way smarter to marry muggles since that way you get double the amount of magical children. That is why marriage laws are stupid, unless it is for a breeding kink (and even then it should not pair two magical characters together for peak efficiency).

Hermione herself consistently cries and Harry just can't handle it (every time she does he gets frustrated) because that's part of who he is and exactly why he likes Ginny.

That's something to be ashamed of, isn't it? Don't talk about that, do you?" he spat venomously. He spun on his heel and stalked for the door, fuming in righteous indignation. Just before he got to the door, Ron muttered quietly "uh, mate?"

Harry stopped without turning around as Ron continued to speak. "My second cousin, The Accountant, works for organized crime. He's been on the run for years. Killed a bunch of muggles too. Nobody has heard from him since. That's why we don't talk about him."

** Voldemort is an excitable lunatic whose vocabulary largely consists of "Crucio", "Avada Kedavra", "How dare you?!" and "Impossible!", who regularly throws tantrums and tortures minions when he doesn't get his way. His Death Eaters are incompetent morons to a T as well.\\
This bizarre incompetence means that Voldemort's initial attempt to conquer magical Britain is easily defeated. But lawyers for the Death Eaters (and Tom Riddle) successfully argue that their overt villainy and incompetence was due to magical compulsion, pointing the finger of suspicion at radical muggleborns. While the poor, addled purebloods (and the genius student Tom Riddle) are taken to St. Mungos for long-term care, the rift between pureblood and muggleborn only grows greater.

House-elves /need/ to be slaves; if they aren't bonded to a witch or wizard, they'll quickly die.\\
With Grimmauld Place empty, Kreacher soon snuffs it, and the house falls into complete disrepair, taken over by magical pests. Even once Sirius returns (name cleared or not), nobody knowing the significance of the locket (as per canon) means it's tossed out with no house-elf to save it. Which naturally makes it much harder to find again once it turns out it's a horcrux, which wastes precious time, which gives Voldemort more time to consolidate his control over magical Britain...\\
Bonus; the Death Eaters manage to replicate the magical bond that binds house-elves to serve or die. They apply it to muggleborns en-masse; as a result, even after Voldemort is defeated, hundreds of innocent muggleborns are either dead or trapped as household slaves by unbreakable magic.

** Is it just me, or are most of the answers people have given unrelated to canon? Like this example from the OP:

#+begin_quote
  Or Harry goes to the Wizengamot and declares himself Lord Potter-Black-Gaunt-Slytherin-Merlin and demands his seat on the council after Draco's pureblood lessons have explained how that all works and everyone just pisses themselves laughing at him because Draco made it all up and the Wizengamot is an elected council because literally everyone is related and how would that even work? Harry looses all credibility and his name becomes synonymous with muggleborn stupidity.

A deconstruction would be that in canon Harry running away would just mean Voldemort would come after him overseas, he has no qualms about it (having done so in canon) and no one can stop him. Harry would be on the run for the rest of his life and the Death Eaters' would continue his reign of terror on Britain. All of Harry's friends would be brutally murdered in an attempt to bring him out of hiding.

And in addition, whilst Harry does that the hired hit wizards have to return the money because they are public servants and can't take bribes. Or they fail miserably because the Death Eaters have infiltrated their own ranks and they can't exactly take down Voldemort.
