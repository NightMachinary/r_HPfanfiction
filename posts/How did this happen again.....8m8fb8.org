Ok,so we know that the elder wand backfired on voldermort in their final showdown,but!!How did the elder wand kill Harry in the forest then,if wands dont hurt their owners??


** The wand probably aimed for the piece of soul lodged into Harry, rather than Harry himself, which is why he didn't die. Another possibility is that it's because it IS the elder wand Voldemort was using and, from what I believe, it's pretty much a wand that brings death to it's owners, so while it would care if it's being handled by another person, it wouldn't care that much if it's owner died because of it.

** Harry didn't cast the Disarming Charm in the forest.

It's not that Voldemort can't use the Elder Wand, or it backfires on him. He can use it just fine, just not to its potential because he is not its true master. If Voldemort's Killing Curse had hit Harry, it would have acted as normal and killed him.

Rather, it's that when Voldemort's magic went up against Harry's magic, Harry's magic triumphed due to being the true master of the wand Voldemort was using. The Disarming Charm overpowered the Killing Curse and reversed it onto Voldemort.

But in the forest there was no magical contest. Harry just took the hit.

The real question, of course, is why Voldemort killing Harry in the forest did not transfer mastery of the wand from Harry to him. Is it because Harry didn't stay dead? It's unlikely, given the low bar the wand requires to transfer ownership. It's specifically noted that it doesn't require death, just defeat. Is it because Harry went to death willingly, and therefore there was no defeat? Again, this seems weak. The Elder Wand is the ultimately disloyal wand, to the point that a casual disarming is sufficient to transfer ownership.

I'm not sure about that. That was essentially Dumbledore and Snape's plan. Kill Dumbledore willingly, and the Elder Wand's power will not transfer. Harry went to death willingly, and the Elder Wand did not transfer its power to Voldemort. Harry just cheated by coming back.

It all really hinges on how you interpret this passage from /Half-Blood Prince/:

#+begin_quote
  The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted: “Expelliarmus!”

  Harry's body became instantly rigid and immobile, and he felt himself fall back against the Tower wall, propped like an unsteady statue, unable to move or speak. He could not understand how it had happened --- Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm ---

  Then, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledore's wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and understood... Dumbledore had wordlessly immobilised Harry, and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself.
#+end_quote

Now, there are two ways to interpret this. Harry is correct; Dumbledore lost the chance to defend himself, and was therefore "defeated" by Draco. Or Harry is an unreliable narrator; Dumbledore allowed Draco to disarm him, but the wand's ownership was transferred anyways. In either scenario, Dumbledore made the decision to immobilize Harry to keep him safe.

I think we know which of those two options is the most likely, but that's not what I'm debating here.

In the former case, you could posit that Harry didn't lose ownership of the wand when Voldemort cast the killing curse because Harry allowed it to happen. He wasn't defeated and, therefore, kept ownership.

In the case of the latter, then Harry should be a really fucked boi.

--------------

However, there is ONE other option which is entirely non-canonical but /kind/ of makes sense. Dumbledore intended for the wand to die with him but, despite his valiant efforts to appear otherwise, Dumbledore was shown to not be omniscient. It's entirely possible that the wand /cannot die/.

Hear me out.

If the wand's current master dies uncontested, rather than just losing its power, what if it picks the best "case" for who should be the other owner, even if those cases wouldn't normally have been enough to transfer ownership.

Dumbledore dies. Pass over Snape, because Dumbledore not only allowed but /begged/ him to do it. Neither party wanted to "defeat" each other. You can't consider that a defeat in any sense of the word. Accept Draco, because Draco was intending to "defeat" Dumbledore, even if Dumbledore allowed it.

So Draco is the master.

Then Harry comes along, disarms ("defeats") him, and becomes its Master. He goes into the forest, the wand's ownership doesn't pass to Voldemort because Harry /allows/ him to kill him. Because Harry doesn't /actually/ die, the wand doesn't transfer ownership (similar to your own posit above). Perhaps if Harry had chosen to stay dead, the wand, not being able to "die", picks the "best case" and Voldemort becomes its master, similar to how Draco was only chosen after Dumbledore died.

--------------

That headcanon is somewhat convoluted but it /can/ make sense of something that is otherwise poorly explained.

EDIT: You could also just make that case that because Harry was the MoD, he /can't/ lose ownership of the wand. Maybe that's one of the benefits of the Otherwise-Most-Ambiguous-And-Unexplained-Titles-Ever-Granted-Ever.

*** I theorize that it is because Harry was defeated, not truly. Sometimes you need to get knocked down to get back up, or in Harry's case, get ‘killed'. Usually defeat includes losing his wand, which he didn't do..

*** I don't think giving up without attempting to fight works. Harry didn't have a wand out so presumably the wand couldn't count that as a defeat, otherwise "defeat" could cover too many things and the wand would be constantly changing allegiances or its power sealed quickly after its creation.

** Because Harry wasn't defeated. Not only did the curse fail to kill him, Voldemort was just as unconscious as Harry at the time. Add on to the fact that Harry went there intending to die without fighting, it can't be called a defeat.

** Something I never understood is why usage of Expelliarmus would count as defeating a master. Expelliarmus is used plenty before DH without any mention of this whatsoever; Snape disarming Lockhart in CoS, Harry disarming Severus in PoA, among others. Why didn't the victim's wand change allegiance then?
