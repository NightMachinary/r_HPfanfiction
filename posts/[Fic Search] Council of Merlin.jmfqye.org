Some time ago I read a story where Dumbledore dies after sealing Voldemort in stone, leaving Harry a crown that grants him access to the council of Merlin, consisting of previous wearers of the Crown.. Harry takes advice from the council, and they work from the afterlife to sever Voldemort's connection to his horcruxes.. Someone help me out here..
