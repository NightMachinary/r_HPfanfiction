Hi,

I'm looking for fics (non slash) where Harry would travel through time and either become one of Hogwarts' founder or be one of their teacher. And by saying being a founder I don't mean taking over his body but arriving in the past and growing older there and meeting the 3 others and founding the school together.

Same with Merlin. Harry goes back in time and grows to be Merlin or one of his teacher.

I make this request because I already read some fics where Harry goes back to become a founder's apprentice or Merlin's apprentice or some thing like this but rarely be one or their teacher (maybe even being partially oblivious to it all by not having proper names or his overall lack of historical knowledge).

I have preferences for completed fics of on-going not abandoned ones.

Thanks


** A long journey home is probably the best story that uses this trope, which has fem!harry teaching Merlin.

Basilisk born has harry as Salazar Slytherin. I didn't much enjoy it, but it's quite popular so maybe it'll do it for you.

What's past is prologue by steerpike is my personal favourite of the “harry is Salazar” fics, but the meat of the story takes place in the present day.

Their are a couple “harry is Merlin stories” kicking about, but they are generally mediocre, and are mostly reincarnation or inheritance style fics, wherein the stories don't really feature the historical aspect at all.

I'll post some more if I think of them. I can't link anything as I'm on mobile.

*** Ok thanks I'll look into it. I hesitated quite a bit about reading "A Long Journey Home". Does "Basilisk Born" has Harry as Slytherin in the past or the present?

Thanks
