So I've started reading Hecatemus by Marj123. I liked it at first, and I'm usually so into creature fics, but it started getting a bit... Uncomfortable? IDK how to explain. Is it worth finishing? Lol Also I guess, any advice on similar-but-not-quite-as-hardcore fics?

*** I mean, I like most most of it. It's just kind of uncomfortable how little choice he has and all. ðŸ˜… And like all the being locked up, people fighting over him, etc. Lol I guess his emotions in the fic just get to me. I didn't finish though, and I guess that's probably not much different from most creature fics.

**** I think you misinterpreted my comment . I really don't like the fic and don't think it gets better as it progresses

***** Oh, I guess I did. Sorry! It did make me uncomfortable, I just like similar, lesser (like less traumatic) stories. Sorry for the misunderstanding. ðŸ˜Š
