Ok so I don't have much to work with but there was a fic that I read a while back. It was a fic that involved a confident and if I remember correctly he was more talented as well. There was a modified prophecy and one of the lines that had etched itself in my head from that prophecy is "His name will be legend his actions will be myth." I've been trying to find it for some time now with no success but I do know it exists. If anyone can find it I would be very grateful however, given how much I've struggled to find it no worries if you guys don't have any luck. I'd use the bot but I don't really know how to use it.


** This came up in a quick google search. It's the second in a series, but the first chapter has that prophecy. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Web of Lies)

****** Yup. That's the one! Thanks a lot! Some friends and I were having a discussion about different fics and that line kept coming back to me and it was annoying me to hell and back. Now that I remember the title, it's coming back to me. That is a actually a really good series. I highly recommend it.
