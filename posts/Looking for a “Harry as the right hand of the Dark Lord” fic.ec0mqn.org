:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
As the title says, I remember he being introduced as a misterious new associate of Voldemort, total badass and ruthless. In this universe the Potter were still alive and had another daughter. The plot twist was that Harry was actually working for a recently escaped Grindewald who swoops in at the last second and conquers England. Does anyone know what fic this is? I can't find it!

** I think this is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]], linkffn(2705927), in which the Harry from the other dimension meets this depiction.

But in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929), he openly allied with Grindelwald and conquered more than just Britain.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? COMPLETE.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...
