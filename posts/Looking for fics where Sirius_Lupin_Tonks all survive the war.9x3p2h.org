Hi,

​

I have been reading a number of fics that tell Lupin's and Tonks' story starting from OotP which are mostly true to canon. Right now I'm reading a really well written one in German and it just got to the end of the 5th book and while it's beautifully written it's making me feel really down.

​

So I was wondering if anyone had any recs for some good fics where all three characters survive, preferably longer ones. I am looking for fics with Tonks/Lupin pairing, not Wolfstar (though I don't mind if there is some history between the two) and where all of them retain their characters from the books. Can be either in English or in German.

​

Thanks

So this is a whole everybody lives AU in which the Potters don't die but Harry is the BWL. It starts with a one-shot prequel and goes through every HP book without even remotely being a rehash. It's ongoing and we've just gotten to the DoM battle in OotP. I highly recommend it.

  Nighttime was the worst part of Harry's summer. He'd fall asleep, prepared for nightmares. He'd find his nightmares, and when he was startled awake, he'd lie in bed, thinking his mother or father were downstairs, probably having similar nightmares. There was nothing about sleep anymore that held comfort for him.--- --- ---  How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived?  Ships not listed because I am unsure if they will deviate from canon. Character tags added as they appear.

** Well linkffn(The Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie) has this, but it's probably not what you're expecting.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

*** Thanks. I looked at a short fic that is a bonus scene from this and it really doesn't sound like what I was hoping for. I'm looking for something that is true to canon with the exception of the survivals.

**** Ah, then this is /definitely/ not what you're looking for. It's a good story though, if you ever want something a bit different.

  Post-OotP --- Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. Rebuilding his life with a war brewing in their world isn't simple. It's a good thing he has a family that he can fall back on this time. OR What if Sirius never fell through the veil but lives instead? Harry & Sirius family fic. Canon divergence after OotP to DH but compliant. No Slash.
