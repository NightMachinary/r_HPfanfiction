I have heard this line SO many times as a comment.so I read the book and came to a conclusion that--- Harry Potter is a weird hybrid of YA , children and adult genres....hear me out, the writing and the way characters are portrayed in the first 2 books is childish and can be seen as aimed for the younger audience,but starting from book 3 it's writing and theme tends to get a bit darker, I have read many YA books and most are lighter than this series but many of the adult dark genre have some common themes with it especially, in the last 2 books....I think jkr was in a dillema most of the time she was writing this series, because when it started to get dark ,she would add some weird childish concept just to keep it aimed for the children???so....


** as [[/u/ubiquitous_archer][u/ubiquitous_archer]] said, they are definately books that mature with the reader and the character.

The first 2 are 100% kids books aimed at kids (10yrs?). Book 3 and 4 are a bit older (13 yrs?)... early teens... book 5 is mid teens (14yrs?), books 6/7 are later teens (15/16 years ish?).

You can read them at any age but i don't think you'd really appreciate the themes and context until those ages is what Im trying to say...

So overall yes, they are kids books aimed at kids.

*** Probably more young adult in my eyes, but the first 2, 100% kids.

** I always think the books are almost written for readers who are the same as the characters. They progressively get a little bit more mature, as if the person who started reading them would be older as they come out.

*** Children's/YA books are intended to appeal to an audience a year or so younger than the protagonist, something they can see themselves becoming in the not-to-distant future. Kids as a rule do not enjoy reading stories about somebody younger than they are. So the original target for the first book would have been 9-11 year olds.

** It's a bit complicated, but I guess you could assume that book one was especially targeted towards children. I know it's written from little Harry's POV for the most part, but even the book as a whole just comes across as being childish in many ways. For example:

- The Slytherins are so blatantly and collectively the mean, evil house without even some shades of grey. Yes, it's Harry's POV (such a convenient excuse that's always used), but none of those students are ever shown in a slightly better light at any point. They're the evil ones who younger readers are supposed to dislike, while the average older-reader would probably wonder if an entire house could be such a waste of space.

- We're supposed to cheer and feel triumphant when Dumbledore dishes out those convenient points at the end of the book (I did as a child). However, the average older-reader would see that that was a rather unprofessional thing to do at the time (some children might, too). At the very least, Dumbledore should have given those points earlier or just not given them at all. Let the Slytherins win, so what? But seeing as it's a children's book, I guess the narrative had to make Harry and friends beat the evil Slytherins (hooray!).

- The adults are almost useless, while the children are, for the most part, the heroes of the book. However, the average older-reader might wonder if Harry even needed to stop Quirrell in the first place (what if Voldemort just couldn't get that Stone no matter what?).

- It's very convenient how the obstacle course just so happens to be within the capabilities of the trio. Of course, had there been some truly difficult protections set up (i.e., maybe something Rune-related or some extremely difficult spellwork, etc.), then there wouldn't have been that grand sense of adventure for our little heroes. The trio would be stuck and/or would be forced to finally leave it to the adults. I'm not sure if that would've made for a good outcome in a children's book.

- The Dursleys' abuse is mostly dumbed down (JKR supposedly had to do so in order to reach a wider audience), whereas the later books imply that Harry might have been beaten by Vernon at some stage. Also, what we /do/ see of the Dursleys' abuse towards Harry is mostly played off in a comical, light-hearted way.

There might be more examples of the book itself being made more 'child-friendly', but I'm not going to list them all. Bottom line is that the series originally started off feeling like it was targeted at younger viewers first, and then got darker as things went on (and not just because it's from Harry's POV).

** I would say the stories aren't /targeted/ at an audience of a certain age, but are /about/ characters of a certain age --- which changes throughout the series.

** It starts Middle Grade and ends as a YA book. I think that's the terminology. She rightfully assumed her readers would grow with the books. Time will do that to a person.
