I found this story a few years back and absolutely loved it but of course can't for the life of me find it anywhere.

The main story line is Voledmort makes a deal with Harry to change what happens the day he tried to kill Harry when he revels that Lilly was pregnant. Harry chooses to save his Mom and he finds himself in an alternate universe where he has a sister, grew up with Snape as his Stepdad and has twin half-brothers. Draco is his best friend and he grew up in Slytherin. He still remembered his old life and eventually works to befriend Ron and Hermione again to figure out how to get his old life back.

Anyway does anyone know which story this was? Or some better ways to search for something like that.


** That's the second book of the Psychic Serpent Trilogy linkffn(Harry Potter and the Time of Good Intentions by Barb LP).

From what I've been told, people thought Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent was a leaked copy of the 5th Book, so that should give you an idea of how old the series is.

Honestly? It's not as good as you're remembering.

*** That title does sound familiar. You are probably right about how I remember it, but it was one of those things that has been bugging me for the last week or so trying to remember what it was and find it. Thanks!!
