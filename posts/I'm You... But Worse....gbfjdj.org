A nobleman born in poverty and abuse who happened upon influence and fortune from his dead family. Through backhanded methods he gained control of many of the Noble houses to expand his control into the Wizagmot (and beyond).

He gained much of his power by exploiting close blood ties with many influential/old families and consolidating it with carefully chosen marriage contracts (allowing him multiple 'wives' due to the Line Preservation Laws).

Most/All of his "wives" serve as instruments in his grand designs, servicing him as protectors or servants as their contracts compel them to. Some reluctantly, most resigned, very few willingly.

His fortune is immense, his influence unparalleled; nothing occurs in Magical Britain without his go ahead. And very little in Magical Europe happens without his involvement in some shape or form.

Yes, the Dark Lord and manipulators of old would salivate at the control this man has. Those who would oppose him ensure their opinions and movements remain entirely under the radar, better wizards and witches have tried, none have succeeded as of yet.

Until hope arrived, a bewildered young man (looking scarily familiar to their foe) arrived. Displaced in time, away from the world he knew... Harry James Potter found his attentions turned to Lord Hadrian Potter-Black, the shadowy ruler of this world.

I'd totally read this, provided it doesn't nerf either of them into being idiots.

** This is very interesting, but I think that if you go for a realistic approach, you run into the same problem Lord Hadrian would/should have run with Dumbledore. The stronger, more connected and politically active party would obliterate such a threat within a day of their appearance.

*** Exactly, my idea was with no prep, rhyme or reason, Harry would quickly be captured and "kept" by Hadrian. Then it would be a tale of trying to subtly destroy the establishment from within by instead appealing to the real support structure to his hierarchy (and the reason he's so politically powerful):

His wives.

My idea would be to have this become a story about the intricacies of contract law and blood magic, Harry able to do a lot of what Hadrian can get away with because they are the same person.

***** I do. Perhaps it's just a whim.

My initial idea here is that he fully intends on sending him back, but also knows he's in a similar position to how he was: Dursley's, Voldemort etc.

Hadrian out of "the kindness of his heart" intends on training up Harry to prepare him to steamroll his world's version of Dumbledore and Voldemort. Thus allowing Harry freedom instead of imprisonment and allowing a younger, more innocent Harry to see the how and why behind this darker more cynical Hadrian. Maybe they'd begin to argue on how Hadrian views his old friends and teachers.

I'd like it if Dumbledore was a villain in Hadrian's world, but Harry's Dumbledore is the canon one (maybe misguided but still good), Hadrian unable to fathom a "good Dumbledore" and just thinking Harry is either still under his manipulators spell or plain stupid.

****** You could use a part of canon that's only implicitly stated, which is that the blood connection between Voldemort and Harry allowed Harry to come back to life by sacrificing the Horcrux instead of himself.

As Hadrian doesn't have anyone he shares that sort of blood connection with anymore (say, if it was based on Motherhood exclusively, to the point it couldn't be used through a blood-related child), he might connect the dots and reason that Harry's blood is enough for this connection to exist, which, if he forces Harry to create a Horcrux out of Hadrian, would insure his own immortality without costing him his soul in return.

The plan would then look like this:

- Hadrian somehow forces Harry to make a Horcrux out of Hadrian.

- Hadrian then uses the lingering echoes of Lily's magic on both their souls to prevent himself from being overtaken by the Horcrux

- Then, he places Harry in stasis, preventing him from affecting Hadrian through the Horcrux, and from destroying it through regret

- In this way, Hadrian's immortality is guaranteed, provided he has the Elixir of Life. That's a pretty prevalent trope, so he probably does

- He cannot age or die from disease, and if he is killed, then he'll sacrifice the Harry Horcrux for his return.

Of course, none of this actually has to happen, but I think it would be supremely interesting if it did. And it would of course create a very good reason as to why Hadrian protects Harry's life to all his ability.

** This reminds me of linkffn(The Lone Traveler by dunuelos). There's a series of chapters in there where almost this exact situation occurs, except there's already a power struggle going on and he just tips the balance. It's not as developed as this idea seems, but it's so similar in premise it's eerie lol.

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.
