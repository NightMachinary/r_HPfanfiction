:END:
As the title says Harry ends up kissing his mom.

But not in the gross way.

I don't remember anything about this fic aside from Harry ends up back at Potter manor at some point and his (Butler?) Brings him into a back room and his mom's body is on the bed. But to wake her up he has to kiss her and like will her soul back into her body.

If anyone knows that would be very cash money.

Thank you


** Based on that scene alone it sounds like linkffn(harry potter and the curse's cure by Drsgon-Raptor) last i checked it was unfinished though

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
