I'll take any I can get, same pairing or not. All I'm looking for is the same or similar vibe, so if you got something you'd think I'd appreciate, that's fine too.

One last note, gender doesn't matter, so don't hold back on that account.

Also, read that story, it'll give you the warm fuzzies.

Edit: It's by the same person that wrote that ice cream fic about Harry and Daphne, which is so good I'm going to read it again.


** That was as good as "Ice Cream", which is high praise IMO. Seems like I'm going to have to follow this author.

** Did you ever find anything? I've just reread twins and ice cream and I really want something along the same lines as them.

*** Nope. I didn't find anything as sweet or cute as those are. I looked. I'm still looking.
