Are there any well written and believable fics where Harry and Dudley are both Wizards? I always wondered what would have happened if Dudley had ended up as a Wizard like Harry and how Petunia and Vernon would respond to that.

Any rating is fine. Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash.

Looking for Multi-Chapters here, would like them to be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.


** hmm linkffn(Magical Relations) is the first thing to come to mind. Is up to their fifth year, 72 chapters, last updated march of '16.

*** That was one of my favorite fics of all time. Bonus that it also has one of the best written Draco portrayals I've come across.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

** Dudley became a wizard in the Dangerverse stories but I didn't think it handled the concept particularly well; it was really just a side-plot with no real importance and his characterisation remained shallow and unlikeable. Still, it is a story with wizard Dudley!

I don't remember if his being a wizard was introduced in the first story, "Living With Danger" or the second one, "Living Without Danger," but the second one definitely has him at Hogwarts -- and in Slytherin.
