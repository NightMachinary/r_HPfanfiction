:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a fic a few years ago that I absolutely loved but can't seem to find anywhere anymore.

I remember it was a Female OC/Fred Weasely pairing. I think the protaganist was a Ravenclaw and a gifted healer (not 100% on the Ravenclaw bit, though). I do remember that she ended up becoming a Death Eater under duress, even going so far as to be given a green cloak to go with her mask and to only be known as the "Green Woman" or "Green Healer" or something. It went through the books up through DH.

I also remember it had a small sequel- where after twenty-odd years, she takes her son to meet the friends and family of his father- and to finally come clean to them of her role in the past. Said son is the new Potions professor at Hogwarts, and beloved by the younger generations- and while expecting to be hauled in by Aurors or even killed, she's instead embraced by the Weasley/Potter clan as a long-lost branch of the family and forgiven for everything that had happened in the past.

I remember it being up on Fanfiction, but never bothered looking for it elsewhere because I thought I'd never forget it. Anybody have any ideas?


** Would like to read this after finishing AQATWA. Commenting just to remind myself

**** Glad you asked! It's Alexandra Quick and the World Away, the fifth book of the AQ series and is /the best/ series in my opinion. Ironically, Alex Quick herself is quite a little rebel girl, or rather a big rebel girl now since she's 16 at this point in the stories.

It's about the Wizarding World in America set in the late 2000s (first book) and early 2010s (books 4/5 and probably 6-7). It's darker than the original Potter books, and although Alex is a talented witch, she goes though more pain (both physical and mental) and angst than is touched upon in canon.

Basically, it's about the Confederation of America, which is the equivalent of the British Ministry of Magic, except that the Confederation is much more corrupt, and hides a lethal secret far darker than anything referred to in the original Harry Potter books, and since we're only on book 5 of what's planned to be a 7 book series, can have a very destructive impact in the future.

There's quite a lot of character parallels, since Alex's developing sense of nobility, mischief and self-sacrificing chivalry is basically a mix of Harry and James, Anna's devotion and loyalty is like a female Neville, and the Grimm sisters are ambiguous like Snape. But even despite the parallels, the OCs are all lovable on their own unique ways since they aren't direct “parallels” at all, just similarities.

Oh, and you'll definitely fall in love with Anna Chu, as I certainly did.

** I remember MC's cover story in the latter half was that she'd gone to America and been hired by a rich, reclusive old wizard to be his live-in healer for the rest of his days. During the final battle, takes her vengeance by undoing the healing she'd provided earlier that day, causing many of the Death Eaters to fall once the full effect of their wounds reopening hits them- and she leaves the emerald cloak in the small closet that they tossed Voldemort into before acting like she just heard about the battle and showing up again to help heal everyone.

In the epilogue, she has also personally taken over the apothecary in Diagon Alley.

...I think there was also a Youtube playlist for this, but... I'm not having any luck on finding that, either.
