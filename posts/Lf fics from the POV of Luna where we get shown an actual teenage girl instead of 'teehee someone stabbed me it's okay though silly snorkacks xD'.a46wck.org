  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

*** Seconded. That is /the/ Luna-fic that manages to strike a balance of some potentially supernatural elements for Luna's psyche, but still stays far away from Sage!Luna tropes.

I fear it is to late for my mind to be restored to a point where these things would make me hesitate in clicking a link to a fic. However I really should remember to put some sort of "Hey, this fic is a bit dark and slightly disturbing in places so not everyone's cup of tea" warning when linking it and similar ones.

**** Ff.net does take down fics sometimes, just not very often, and usually ones that only barely skirt the rules. There was one deleted a couple of months ago for having "adult content" which consisted of the one scene in which two characters make out against a tree.

They do need to get more consistent though.

**** Grains of Sand is a wonderful little time-travel based plot. It avoids most of the plot issues traditionally in such fics, and is quite unique. The main character is Nymphadora. linkffn(12188150)

Luna's reveal is at the very end but has become my accepted version of her backstory. Plus it has you get to see Luna meet a Snorack for the first time and it is adorable
