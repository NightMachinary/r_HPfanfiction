I've always been interested in f!h fics but most of the ones I've seen pair Harry with a boy. are there any decent ones that don't? I don't mind the pairing (as long as it's not a creepy age difference) & I don't mind what the plot is, but would prefer something long and not just porn. Thanks!

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

** linkffn(12768475)

A well written fic about Harry traveling back in time and finding out that her real appearance(and gender) has been hidden by a blood glamour. But don't worry she accepts being a girl quite fast. Has a necromancer Harry and Fem!Harry/Fleur pairing.

**** I think it's really good and worth reading on past that point. Such a heavy event befalling a main character is a direction that few authors ever have the guts to do (threatened rape is not uncommon, but it actually happening is rare). I don't think that the author handled the event that well though. The act of it happening was well executed in my opinion as it has a pretty big impact on the story at that point, but the fallout of it all is pretty flat. The ramifcations later in the story are pretty minimal from what I remember so you could just read around it and still follow along pretty easily.

**** I personally believe so, things really pick up when Fleur shows up and it seems to be going in a really cool eldritch direction with Life and Death

** I've mostly found it the other way round, unless f!Harry is paired with Voldemort, which I consider it's own category. f!lesbian!Harry is so very often also a dark!Harry that I have grown to dislike her greatly.
