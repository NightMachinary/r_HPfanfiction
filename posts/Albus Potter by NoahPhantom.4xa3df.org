What's everyone's thoughts on the soon-to-be completed Albus Potter series by NoahPhantom? Link in the title.

I like how the world building is a bit larger than the other completed Albus series, by Vekin87. But I confess Albus' friends don't seem very three-dimensional, apart from Exo.

** It's the first next gen series I've read, and I'm a fan. It's pretty insane at times, and Albus Potter is OP no matter what the author says, but I've recommended it quite a few times, including recently to a friend who ran out of good ST fanfic to read and wanted to branch out in other fandoms.

** I'm loving it. There's crazy adventures, a plot that advances between each book, monsters that are actually scary, and the advancements in magic are just awesome. I feel like the character development is pretty good considering there's about 20 characters that all play a major role in the story, and we get to know each of them pretty well.
