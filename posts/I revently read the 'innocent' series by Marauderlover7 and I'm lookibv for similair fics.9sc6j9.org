I especially liked Sirius raising Harry, good characterisation of Ron and the Draco bring a Gryffindor aspect.

So any Sirius raising Harry recs? Or Gryffindor Draco?

Thanks!


** Try A Marauder's Plan by catsarecool-- Linkao3(1085412) . Sirius raising Harry starting from POA. Great series and everyone's in-character.

You can also try the Dangerverse, written by whydoyouneedtoknow on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. It's an excellent series (I'm sorry I don't have a direct link) but it's worth a look for both parent!Sirius and Gryffindor!Draco.

*** Word of warning, Marauders Plan is really, really tropey. If that's the sort of thing that irritates you, I'd probably give it a hard pass.

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...

** linkffn(The Wise One: Book One: Becoming) and its sequels are a Sirius-raises-Harry story that I remember reading around the same time as the Innocent series and being of similar quality.

  When Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and 8-year-old Harry Potter disappears, the world is thrown into upheaval. What will Britain and Harry be without each other, and who will face the Dark? You only THINK you've read this before. I guarantee you haven't.
