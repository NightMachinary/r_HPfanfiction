** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Harry Potter and The Descent Into Darkness]] by Athey is close to what you are looking for. It is LV/HP slash, but the explicit scenes are clearly marked and easily skip-able.

** I don't know the specific story you're speaking of.

Some evil Harry stories:

[[http://patronuscharm.net/s/139/1/][Oedipus Flower]] by Vash has an evil Harry. Warning: patricide, incest; NC-17.

#+begin_quote
  Did Harry really get his Slytherin qualities from Tom Riddle, or were they always meant to be?
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]] by Ruskbyte and sequel. Hellraiser crossover.

#+begin_quote
  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1106246/1/From-the-Abyss][From the Abyss]] by the same author. One of the first "Harry in Azkaban" stories.

#+begin_quote
  Three years ago he was wrongfully sent to Azkaban. Now something has happened. Something that has placed the power of a god into the hands of a man that's half insane. A man who wants revenge. The question now is; who's Harry going to kill first?
