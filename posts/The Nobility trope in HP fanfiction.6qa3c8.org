So I want to discuss one of my pet peeves in fanfiction: when somehow, half of the wizarding population turns out to be Lord This or Lady That.

I feel like it almost never adds to the narrative, and has so little basis in canon (IIRC, no one is ever mentioned to be Lord anything). When it happens, it usually is followed by Harry very weirdly abusing his nobility, because of course, he has to be Lord Potter or Lord Black. In canon, ae have a reference to nobility in "The Most Ancient And Noble House of Black", but nowhere is it said that this means /actual/ nobility, instead of just a family made of people very full of themselves who want to put on airs.

It's a trope that makes a lot of people out of character. On top of that, I also find a lot of the character development ends up being wasted in explaining the Wizengamot political system that the author just invented.

In case it's not clear: I really don't like it, and I never see how it makes a story more interesting. If you disagree with me: change my mind! Why is this an attarctive plot device to you? What narrative elements does it add? Can you recommend a fanfiction that does this well that could change my mind?


** Personally, I really like the nobility trope, but only if it's done well. I'm actually writing a fic that has the nobility trope, and here's what I've done to avoid the pet peeves you mentioned.

The Wizengamot has a definite structure and backstory, which will become relevant to the main plot. I did a lot of reading on 15th-17th century British government, and based my Wizengamot off of the House of Lords and House of Commons at the time. The House of Lords was way stronger and kind of OP, and the House of Commons was more like appeasement. This ties into cultural history (both fact and fictional).

Not every pureblood is a lord. This gives a more nuanced class-structure to wizarding society. There's the High Houses (41) who have seats in the House of Lords, then there's the Lower Houses which are all the other pureblood families, halfbloods, and muggleborns.

Harry is not Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor, and all the problems won't magically (no pun intended) disappear when he comes of age and is able to play politics. He's going to have to work very hard for very little progress, and face many setbacks along the way.

The UK doesn't exist in a bubble, and foreign countries are relevant.

In terms of fic recommendations, I don't know all too many that do it well. There's a fair bit in the well-known linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin), and if you want to check out my fic, it's linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn).

** When I first read the books I, like you, took that line about the Blacks to mean they thought highly of themselves. It was a little jarring to stumble across lordship fics when I started reading fanon and I agree most are really poorly done.

However, before coming to the HP fanon I read a ton of Jane Austen fanfiction, so I'm better versed in the British aristocracy than your average American, although far less so than your average Brit.

Wizarding history seems a bit nebulous and I haven't done much research on it, so here's my impression of things: wizards hid throughout most of history, but as we see in canon are never fully separate; since the British caste system completely shaped society and many wizards enjoy power, who would turn down a lordship if granted to them, especially before a consolidated wizarding government formed? From what I remember from history class, if you were a serf you were basically a slave as you had no means of bettering yourself and were all but chained to the land and whims of your local lord. Think Robin Hood, but less prettied up and with more back breaking labor and a lot more starvation and disease. Based upon that, I see the wizarding world going two possible ways: towards living isolated and separate from that fucked up system, or taking advantage of that system.

The first, I think, is how JKR went. Just noped out of that highly stratified society because when everyone can do magic that sees to a basic level of comfort and wellbeing, why subject yourself to that?

However, in Founders Era fics I've read, wizarding society is usually fractured like muggle society, with people living fairly isolated lives and ignorant of their neighbors the next village or two over. At that point in time, wizards haven't really had a chance to form a centralized government. If that's so, how can you do aught but blend in with muggles, whether you be born a serf, the ultra rare member of the middle class, or part of the nobility? And if you're offered a rare opportunity at a lordship, you'd be completely insane to turn it down. So would a magically powerful wizarding family that can raise its fortune in the muggle world through subtle use of magic so as not to subject themselves to early death from manual labor, starvation, and disease turn down social power and privilege? Personally, I'd take that lordship. So yes, I can see wizarding families with actual titles granted to them through muggle patents of nobility.

The problem is, a lot of lordship fics seem to be written by my fellow Americans, who have never lived under a society with legit titles. They use the lordship as another way of making the character OP and as an excuse to do whatever they want. And while actual lords could literally get away with murder in medieval society, it just rings very false today. Because the closer we get to modern day society, the less the lords can get away with.

Also, the nobility is highly stratified, going from baronets (who aren't actual peers of the realm), to barons, viscounts, earls, marquises, and dukes. In HP fanon, there is no actual stratification of the wizarding nobility, just vague notions of "my family has purer blood than yours for x number of generations, so our lordship is more powerful". Most authors have Harry acting more like a duke, basically able to waltz in and rofl stomp on everybody, except in an exuberant and showy American way that a British peer of the realm would find uncouth.

Another thing is, dukes are usually related to the king, which is why they're able to get away with so much. You've got the Duke of Wales, who is always a legitimate relation to the king (usually next in line to the throne), and you've got the bastards of the king who are granted duchies. And dukes are called "your grace", not "my lord". I'm pretty sure the Potters aren't related to the royal family in any way. Sure, a case could probably be made that they're from some duchy that's so old it's not closely related to the modern royal family anymore, but that doesn't seem likely.

If Harry had a title at all, his classmates would be addressing him as "my lord" from the getgo. If your dad was a lord and he died when you're a baby, you automatically get the title. You don't have to wait until you're of age to be addressed as my lord or your grace. Sure you might not be allowed a seat in the House of Lords or have full control of all your inheritance, but you're still called by your correct title. Yet no one does that to Harry in first year in any fic I've read. You just don't hide someone's title from them. Insane, evil, manipulative Dumbledore would have to make Harry's title taboo, make a geas, etc for everyone to hide it from him.

Also, as there are much closer relatives to Sirius Black than Harry, he wouldn't inherit the Black lordship. Draco Malfoy likely would, possibly after petitioning the Queen. You can't just put in your will who you want your tile to go to; it's written into your patent of nobility, the paperwork the monarch who gave your family its nobility signed. Those papers list the rules for how future descendants can inherit your title.

So, long answer short, peerage tiles can be a legit thing in a fic depending on how you want your ancient wizarding history to go, but most people who use them in stories makes them wildly unrealistic with arbitrary rules governing the system of nobility. I've never seen a story that really uses them correctly or well. Although there have been some that use them well enough to enhance the story and not be annoying, although I can't remember them at the moment.

I think the oft recommended "Patron" by Starfox5 might, but I've read so many fics since that one that I can't say for certain. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron]]

There was some other fic that got the inheritance thing right, where Sirius wills Harry as much wealth as he can, but can't prevent the title from going to Draco Malfoy. Harry takes much glee in giving Malfoy an empty title. If I remember the name of that fic I'll edit this.

*** On Pottermore, JKR said that the Malfoys were well-placed at the British Court - one of them even courted Queen Elizabeth I. He wouldn't have been able to do that if he hadn't been a (high-ranking) noble. Further, I don't think that the wizards formed an egalitarian society while everyone else had nobles and aristocracies, not when wizards were part of those societies for thousands of years. The idea that, in Britain, there are no aristocrats is quite far-fetched, unless there was a revolution at some point after the SoS went into effect. How much a title means in Wizarding Britain is another question though.

However, even without an actual aristocracy, societies tend to form an "upper class", with more or less strict barriers of entry - often, being rich is not enough to be accepted; you have to have old money at the least - or blue blood.

In my stories, I usually assume that there is a bunch of rich, influential "Old Families" who run the country through the hereditary Wizengamot. Or would, if not for the fact that in the Magical World, personal power almost directly translates into political power - without a Dark Lord around to counter Dumbledore, his suggestions carry a lot of weight, to say the least.

Further, in my stories the Old Families generally don't use noble titles, or any formal way to discern each other (apart from having seats in the Wizengamot) but everyone knows who is part of them, and who's not (any more).

Considering the aristocracy has had little to nothing to do with power in the modern UK, this is debatable.

The monarchy began to decline in power from the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215, then there was the civil war and the beheading of Charles I leading to a full blown 11 year Interregnum where parliament ruled, and after the Restoration it only took 30 years for parliament to organise the Glorious Revolution and choose their own monarch. After this, the Bill of Rights severely restricted the power of the monarch, and the civil lists were established, and for the last 350-ish years the Crown incomes have been added directly to the treasury and the royals only given an allowance. The royal prerogative still exists, but since then parliamentary power has only increased, the true ruler of the country has been parliament.

This was 1688, about ten years prior to the SoS, so it's assumed wizards would know about it - and the increasing power of parliament over the monarchy and the dangerous position much of the upper class faced depending on religion probably affected that decision.

By the modern day, the upper echelons of society are as much celebrities, nouveau billionaires and well-bred wealthy upper-middle classes as titled aristocracy. The UK has a much less clear-cut upper class now than in the US - the old money/new money divide is way more socially important there, whereas here it is who you know and how much money you have.

Interestingly, JKR's use of bloodlines gives a reflection of the 'well-bred' aspect of British upper classes, but she seems to avoid the actual titles themselves - probably indicating that they mean as little as the Queen who is at the centre of the aristocracy seems to mean to the wizarding world - she is never mentioned.

*** Can I just correct you - it's the /Prince/ of Wales, not the Duke of Wales, that is first in line for the throne. The other current royal duchies include the Duke of Windsor, Duke of Wessex, Duke of Cambridge, Duke of Edinburgh, Duke of Lancaster & Duke of Normandy, Duke of York, Duke of Gloucester, Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay and Duke of Kent. Some of these are held by the same person, e.g his Royal Highness Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, Duke of Rothesay and of Cornwall.

Duchies are nearly all in line for the throne and related to the royal family in some way. Many other layers of aristocracy are too, but the duchies the most so. No bastard of the royal family is going to get a duchy, not unless they are recognised legitimate (lot of debate about Prince Harry).

The interesting thing about the aristocracy is that they revolve around the royal court. With the wizarding world showing no obvious allegiance to the monarch, why would titled positions at court be their main frame of class reference? It's possible some family have aristocratic titles, but these titles have no meaning in the wizarding world without a monarchy or principality.

JK's world seems more preoccupied with pureblooded magic than titles, so I can't personally bear a 'lordship' fic that isn't a comedy as there's never the grounds written well enough for titles to work.

Considering I'm reading fan fiction about a magical world I am willing to suspend some disbelief to entertain a lordship fic if enough other elements of the story are done well enough, although I can't say I've ever found one that truly executes the trope well. And it's never a trope I intentionally seek out. Other equally dodgy premises get that honor :)

The Crown on Netflix did a good job of illustrating who is who and how it all works too, and shows you actually how little power the Queen had back in the 50's when she took charge. Also just a very good show.

** Sirius was also the one that said that, and was being mocking. So its hard to tell if they would even refer to themselves like that.

As to defend it: I mostly don't read them, as they are almost all horribly written. However it could be interesting. One fic I found it isn't explicitly a nobility by blood system, but has a caste system: linkffn(9783012). Firebird's song linkffn(8629685) also has a strong nobility system, however that is much more divisive amongst readers. I like how it can add antagonists that aren't even evil, or really mean. It can make a world and system that is domineering and threatening to the protagonist in ways that you can't get with the normal Voldemort approach.

** I'll be blunt. 'Pureblood nobility' lets authors reframe blood purism in terms of basic snobbery, not racism.

And that's fine. The beauty of fanfiction is in these little bits of wriggle room. While Rowling made the comparisons between racism and purism very explicit, that's not a conflict I'm interested in reading. I think it's hamfisted and makes for cartoonish and unsympathetic Slytherins. As a reader, I want nuanced and realistic characters (whether as protagonists or antagonists) and nobility is an easy way of explaining Draco's bratty behaviour.

That said, I've yet to find a nobility fic that I /like/. Lazy writers fall back on well-worn tropes and dressing.

I think the fact that the wizarding purebloods didn't laugh him out of town when he went around claiming to be a lord says a lot, they at least recognize the title and don't denigrate it as muggle only or anything. it may be defunct in the wizarding world as an actual title at this point, but it seems to have been in use in the past at least enough for them to respect it somewhat.

So it seems to me that if it was an absolutely ludicrous concept then no one would have signed on to become a Death Eater in the first place in order to get cursed.

There's also his original name for the Death Eaters, the Knights of Walpurgis. Knighthood is a title in Britain. ( Edit: I think...er, okay, not too clear on that actually)

What I'm guessing happened is that wizards and witches used to have and use titles back before the Statute of Secrecy- probably the average wizard was a lot more likely to have a title than the average muggle, even- and had to give them up when the worlds separated. Maybe the older pureblood families look on that as part of the "old ways" that they miss or would like to bring back?

** Harry Potter is, on some level, a smart and radical critique of an elitist society. Hermione might be naive with her Elf rights campaign, but her heart is in the right place. Old families are mostly corrupt, sinister, and unhappy. Main protagonists are egalitarian and above the prejudices of the traditional wizarding world. I find it interesting that so many fanfic authors choose to go against that. Many, even well written, stories directly contradict central message of the novels. Harry prevails not through hard work and help of friends, but because he suddenly learns he owns half the Britain as an heir to multiple noble houses... And Hermione is bashed as someone who does not know her place. JK's HP is about self-determination, equality (including gender equality, and that is also missing from many fanfics in this subgenre), and it's a good thing :) It makes readers believe in themselves, even if they have to suffer some bullies with rich parents... Well researched stories, showing complex world of feudal society, are rare and interesting. But many authors just read one Austen book and got some strange ideas about how nobility speaks and arranges marriages... Aristocratic Harry is very AU, and to make it work you need to know a bit about worldbuilding, and how an aristocratic society works, otherwise it's just going to be rubbish.

** The biggest problem I have is the idea of an isolated wizarding nobility, as opposed to wizards who happen to be part of the Muggle nobility, as the Malfoy family was (and presumably still is, whether or not they advertise it).

An isolated wizarding nobility is odd for a couple of reasons. Firstly, because any system of nobility needs a fount of honour, i.e. a source from which all other nobility follows. In the feudal system this is ultimately the monarch. But of course wizarding Britain has no separate monarch. Secondly, because until the modern age, nobility was essentially tied up with land: you had a title which related to a specific place, where you would hold land. That land was held under a form of feudal tenure, whereby you owed your feudal lord some particular duty in exchange for your rights to the land and the title which accompanied it. But there's no sign of wizards holding any great amount of land, or of it being all that important to them.

(Feudal tenures other than freehold and leasehold, which come with no duties attached, were abolished well before the nobility became defunct. Nonetheless the theory of feudal tenure forms an essential part of the legal theory forming the basis of real property rights in the English legal system).

But more than all of that, the fundamental point is that in most fics, these titles are supposed to go back a very long time - well before the statute of secrecy was passed. But it makes no sense for these two societies to have separate systems of nobility when they were in fact one society - as the history of the Malfoy family demonstrates.

*** It also makes no sense for the noble wizards to give up their titles when the SoS went into effect. That's not how things worked at the time.

** So aside from the whole infinite vault trope I think there's two main reasons for it. One is putting Harry into the same social class as the love interest (Daphne/Susan/etc.) and the other is setting up an easy way to populate the Wizengamot; if your a Lord or Lady of a noble house then you have a seat.

** I always assumed people got this from A Song of Ice and Fire and it's a trope that could work, just not with the current Ministry of Magic and Courts, etc.... I imagine that the canon potterverse has conventional nobility (Large Mansions with Rare and Banned Books, Piles and piles of Gold and Artifacts, Family Grimoire of some sort, and maybe a Family Wand that all true ____ heirs may wield once they become of age). But not extreme political power like an automatic government position, politicans might want to know you and might want to be friends with you, but you can't be born into becoming a politician. In fact, I think politicians were very rare for those families considering the fact that honor in the Magical World is duelled rather than bought and sold.

** The problem is that you usually have Lords, but no real political system in these fics. You have the Lords on one side, the ministry on the other, and everyone else submitted to their arbitrary.

It could be interesting if you had something a little more developed and sensible, with intermediary bodies, corporations, guilds, even local parliaments to act as counter powers. Maybe even monasteries, that would act more as places of knowledge and studies (which are the aspects that have been lost in the monasteries) without the religious aspect of their Muggle counterparts.\\
You can't just have a class with all the powers, especially when you got magic in the equation because it doesn't do for a very stable society.
