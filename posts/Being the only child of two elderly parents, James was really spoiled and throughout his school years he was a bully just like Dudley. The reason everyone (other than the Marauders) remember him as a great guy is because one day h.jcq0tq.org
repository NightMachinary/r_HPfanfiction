I believe that JK said in an interview that the reason Dudley changed was because the Dementors showed him how he was really perceived by others. I would think that that would have happened to James too. He might have tried to also make amends with Snape, but he had to go into hiding before he got the chance.


** I personally like the idea that his parents got ill and died during the cap between fivth year and sixth year of hogwarts

which caused him to mature greatly
