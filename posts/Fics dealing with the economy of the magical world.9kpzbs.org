** linkffn(Sympathetic Properties) has... Er, all of the things you said you didn't want, but at least the writing is decent, I guess? Much of the later story covers a bunch of OCs and you can even ignore Harry and his goings on and focus solely on the whole Flamel business if you really want to.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

** So, this series involves a lot of talk about the economy of the Wizarding world, and Harry takes an interest in that (grows to be a business/political person but largely due to his own work, not inherited), but it's a long series starting from before Hogwarts. Also is slash, has bashing and manipulative Dumbles (but there is actual character development so Dumbles realizes he may be in error), and is a crossover - the first book with Naruto and future books with Avatar the last Airbender.

*** I also have my own work that touches on Wizarding economy, but Harry is still in first year and I don't want to do a super mature, 'I am an adult in an eleven year old body' Harry.
