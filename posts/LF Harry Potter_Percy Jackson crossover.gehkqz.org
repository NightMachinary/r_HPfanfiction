:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a specific crossover that involves a female potter twin who is not Harry joining the hunt. She then returns to England because(surprise she is actually the chosen one and not her brother) with Zoe and I believe Talia or another girl. If anyone can help me find this fic I would really appreciate it.( the fic I am looking for is not with the moon and the stars up above)

  First story I'm putting on this website. When Danielle Potter was thrown out of Potter Manor in favor of her 'boy-who-lived' brother, she meets a certain group of man hating Hunters who take her to America. Welcome to the world of the gods, young witch. Twin story, girl-who-lived, minor bashing of Dumbledore and Potters.
