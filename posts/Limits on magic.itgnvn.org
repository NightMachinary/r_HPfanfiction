How do you guys feel about the trope in fanfics where the mc can do impossible stuff with magic because they never knew it wasn't possible. Pretty much where the only thing limiting magic is the beliefs on how it should work. So for example, the mc kills a dementor because they never knew it wasn't possible, and this their magic wasn't limited by thinking they couldn't be killed


** I abhor it. If that was the case, Luna Lovegood, the conspiracy nutjob of the wizarding world, could destroy the world because Hogwarts' curriculum is a ploy by the nargles to surpress humans.

One of my favorite things was that magic in Harry Potter correlated to intelligence, instinct, and practice. Everyone can be skilled with magic, but only a few are. I liked that theory was important for spellcasting.

** I hate it. Outside of crack fic, I dislike any trope that need the Magical World to be filled with retards to work. For hundreds of years, Muggleborn entered with Magical World without any "belief" about what they could or couldn't do. And yet, only the MC got to do impossible things.

I also hate any fic that "kill" Dementors. What's too hard to understand with "You can't kill something that's not alive in the first place". If it was only some way to "permanently seal a dementor", I wouldn't like it but still understand the logic, yet they only go with "Golden super Patronus kill the Dementors by physically beating them".

Ehhh. Technically you can't, but you can destroy something that doesn't live, and I'd fully expect most people to call it "killing" even if it's not strictly accurate.

** I recall an example of the didn't-know-it-was-impossible superpower being used well. Alas, I cannot remember the name of the fic.

It turned out Harry was the best at conjuring food (specifically chocolate). It didn't break the rules, in that it essentially disappeared from your belly - no calories, no nutrients, no waste - but it *tasted amazing*.

Naturally, this led to a bunch of girls fighting over him, because tropes.

** I think it stems from the idea that people who don't already think within certain frameworks might have new perspectives on problems, allowing them to come up with alternative, creative solutions. When it's used in a milder form, it's a great way to show your MC is smart, creative, or has a different way of thinking than others.

It also probably comes from how accidental magic seems to be relatively powerful and completely will-driven, if not controllable, in canon. When you consider that Harry could Apparate, change another person's hair color, vanish glass, and regrow his own hair, all without knowing what he's doing, I get why some authors apply similar logic to adults. What if Harry had realized he had magic before he went to Hogwarts? Could he manipulate things intentionally? Could he do things that don't have a specific spell? Those are interesting questions, and it's fun to play with the universe's rules. As long as your character isn't /too/ OP, I don't have a problem with it.

*** Voldemort's early use of magic also supports this - he /was/ intentionally using his magic to bully and traumatize other children.

I'd say the biggest issue with either proving or discounting “magic can do almost anything, if you believe it can” is that JKR never really put any effort into explaining the “how and why”s of magic, so we can only extrapolate from the tidbits we got in canon.

Why were Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Voldemort so powerful compared to your everyday witch or wizard? Sure they were each very intelligent, but why does that translate directly into magical power? If it was just “the more you study, the better you are at magic” then surely the disparity would be much lower, and you'd see a lot more powerhouses out of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff.

** I think it only turns into a problem when overdone. People unknowingly adhering to a placebo effect by coming to the wrong conclusion based on the result of an experiment is one thing that occurs in the real world (vitamins for example, by definition the body only needs relatively small amounts and throwing more of it won't help anybody, however we still have the misconception that more vitamins make you healthier because of that whole mess with Linus Pauling). So for example, having Harry circumvent some fictional nuance that everyone thinks is necessary to cast a specific spell or ritual or whatever is fine, making him capable of conjuring food though is not.

Aside from this there is also the willpower and mental discipline part of the equation. In some parts of the world's there are people who (with great discipline and effort) managed to train themselves to disregard greats amounts of pain or even remain meditating long past what others would think possible, but this is something that generally takes a fair amount of time and effort, not something to learn about in one lazy week.

My preferred take on it is that magic with a wand lets the wizard mold the spell based on their will and the movements they do with the wand, this way managing to do greater feats with precision, stability (so allowing the magic to continue either indefinitely or almost) and velocity with less magic used (ex. Transfiguration) and do this became the norm. While other types of magic either rely on no-focus at all (resulting in the person only being able to clumsy throw his power on the world with their rough intention until the world bends /some/ of it's rules on a /very/ limited space in a way with little to no precision or predictability) or through other focus that may be better suited for obtaining certain results but are overall slower/less immediately impressive/harder/less efficient or even dangerous to the user in many instances that could be achieved just as well using a wand, (something like potions, it takes longer to prepare than to cast a spell and it takes certain ingredients to do so, but in exchange it can provide effects that spells are simply unable to replicate to the full extent -eg. Felix Felicis- overall have a longer life-time, can be pre-prepared and are harder or even impossible to undo (or even detect) with spells, like Polyjuice), which makes many of the other ways of doing magic fall out of circulation.

** You have to be able to present it extremely well, or it ends up getting tiring. There is a book series known as the Belgaraid Series, and while there are almost no limits to magic, it's because of the fact that it's so hard to Master that the author could get away with it. So while you can have 'limitless' magic, you at least need obstacles to pass before you get to that state- and preferably, at the end of the book or series.
