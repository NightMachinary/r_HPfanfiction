Sirius's relationship with his family is super interesting to me so I'm curious to see how it's play out if he was a Slytherin. I've seen a few Regulus in Gryffindor fics that were interesting so I want to read the flip side.


** The main two that come to mind feature Sirius as already an adult. linkffn(stages of hope by kayly silverstorm) and linkao3(73 aberdeen by mici). 73 Aberdeen does feature flashbacks to Hogwarts, and it is Sirius/Remus.

Sirius gets sorted into Slytherin in linkffn(second start by 8thweasleykid), which is a Snape relives his life fic in which he manipulates the sorting hat to put his classmates in different houses. He puts Sirius in Slytherin as a punishment, but they end up being friends and Sirius ends up not getting kicked out by his family which might be what you're looking for but it's certainly not the focus of the story.

  There are some things ungoverned by fate. If Sirius Black had gone the path of every Black before him, if he had been in Slytherin, he would have been a very different boy. It would have been a very different war.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  Severus dies in the Shrieking Shack but is somehow thrown into the past as his eleven year old self.He has a chance to change so much and not just his relationship with Lily. Will he be successful or will fated circumstances be doomed to repeat themselves

** Jilly James wrote a Sirius time travel fic where he gets sorted into Slytherin, as part of a challenge for roughtrade. It was really good, but it has been taken down until she's fully finished writing it - it might be interesting to look out for when it gets reuploaded =).

** AU!Sirius was sorted into Slytherin in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/374837][The Mirror of Erised]] linkao3(374837), but it's not the focus of the fic.

  The only way to be certain you can defeat ultimate evil is when you've already done it before.
