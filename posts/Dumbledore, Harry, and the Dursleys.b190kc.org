I've only ever seen 3 types of stories. The ones in which Albus Dumbledore knows about Harry's treatment at the Dursleys and is subsequently very remorseful/bashed. The ones where it is ignored, at least in terms of Dumbledore. And lastly the ones where Dumbledore doesn't know about it.

Is it not possible that the British wizarding society is just more... accepting of ‘abuse?' Neville Longbottom was dropped out of a window, and when the story was retold, everyone laughed. Severus Snape didn't have the best home life, to my knowledge (that might be a fanon thing, I'm not sure), and nobody did anything.

Nobody doing anything sadly is also the case in the real world. Many children (and adults) face abuse (psychological, physical and/or sexual) in their home lives. Despite sometimes obvious signs a lot of it is never uncovered or acted upon, sometimes things are wilfully ignored. I see the same being true for the wizarding world. It's not about being uncaring or accepting of abuse.

*** But Dumbledore admits that he knew how bad it would be to Harry in OotP. The infamous "Ten Dark Years" confession. That's why it is impossible to write a grandfatherly Dumbledore without him being totally OOC. The man knew exactly how bad it was and he did not care to even visit once to make things better.

**** True, but that doesn't change that the wizarding world isn't necessarily more accepting of abuse. This happens in the real world too where evidence of abuse is ignored all too often.

***** I never claimed anything about the magical world in one way or another. We have a sample size of 2, which is too small to make guesses about the entire magical world.

****** I assumed your answer was in relation to it since you were responding to my comment about magical society's attitude towards abuse.

**** I always interpreted that confession as Dumbledore viewing the idea of a magical child growing up not being around and/or knowing about magic to be the worst thing someone could do to said child.

No, it isn't fanon. From the chapter OoP, chap. 26:

#+begin_quote
  Snape staggered; his wand flew upward, away from Harry --- and suddenly Harry's mind was teeming with memories that were not his --- a hook-nosed man was shouting at a cowering woman, while a small dark-haired boy cried in a corner.
#+end_quote

or DH, chap. 33:

  “How are things at your house?” Lily asked.

  A little crease appeared between his eyes.

  “Fine,” he said.

  “They're not arguing anymore?”

  “Oh yes, they're arguing,” said Snape. He picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing. “But it won't be that long and I'll be gone.”

  “Doesn't your dad like magic?”

  “He doesn't like anything, much,” said Snape.

  “Severus?”

*** Is it just me or Snape's, albeit limited, description of his father works well for Snape himself too? Cause Severus Snape doesn't like anything, much.

Dumbledore admitted that he knew that Harry was facing "ten dark years". He could have stepped in at any time. But no, let's make Harry disappear before any legal procedure can commence. And let's never bother to actually do something about that miscarriage of justice I uncovered.

That is actually canon. Dumbledore is pretty Machiavellian. Which is perfectly alright if you admit it, but the "he is so good" characterisation feels incredibly OOC to me.

** By my lights, Harry Potter is an extreme example of the underdog hero's story. The whole point is that he persists on his hero's journey despite having every reason to GTFO or just roll over and die and wins despite so many circumstances stacked unreasonably against him.

​

It is an explicit (toxic, IMO) message that, particularly if you're young and male, there's no higher value than working hard to help your society, even if it treats you like shit - and even to help and/or save the lives of specific individuals who have treated you like shit. ^{This bit I particularly disagree with.} And that you should persevere no matter what, because if you do, you'll win too, and get to start a family with a hot young wife (or more, if you're in some older or more 'out there' stories).
