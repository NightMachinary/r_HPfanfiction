Normally I try not to post multiple prompts in one day, but this one won't get out of my head. Harry gets raised (and experimented on) by the Flamels, who are the wizarding equivalent of mad scientists. Bonus points if he ends up being *exactly* like them, and casually experiments on anyone or anything that catches his fancy. Usually without asking permission. Or caring that his subjects are not happy with him giving them all sorts of weird side effects like tentacles growing out of their eyes because he wanted to see what would happen.


** There have been a few Harry raised by the Flamel stories, but I don't think any of them have taken this approach. Usually they are contacted by Dumbledore to take Harry in or its related to time travel or something else. But the idea of them kidnapping him for study like a lab specimen but growing to care him sounds hilarious.

*** Already read this one. I liked it, but it got totally derailed in the sequels. Absolute insanity. Naturally I love all three parts of the series.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on!
