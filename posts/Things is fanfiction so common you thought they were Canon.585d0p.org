*** I certainly imagine that there are spells that do this. We know of a drying charm that is very close to a warming charm - Dumbledore cast it on Harry in HBP. But at the same time, wizarding fashion seems to show a preference for using magically-created fire to warm things. Perhaps because it has greater permanence, but perhaps just for its aesthetic effect.

Safety may also be another aspect. Remember that it's easy to accidentally overdo charms, especially when you haven't yet mastered them. See cheering charms in GoF. When you accidentally overpower a cheering charm, the person giggles for a few hours. When you accidentally overpower a direct-on-person warming charm, you could boil the person alive. So I imagine such a spell could be quite advanced magic - not because it's difficult to create heat, but because one needs a good level of control to make just the right amount of heat.

Honestly, I can get behind this - why wouldn't you use a quick charm for heating and cooling? Plus, it could be vital in medical cases, such as hyperthermia where large scale rapid-cooling is needed. I wish we could have seen more healing spells in the books, and I do realise that it sadly wouldn't have worked nicely. Unless the trio were injured far more often, e.g. when camping during DH.

**** A bit of column A, a bit of column B. Giving something a category of its own with its own name implies that the category is a natural kind, or at the very least that the members of the category share something in common.

But in actual fact, some "protections" are charms, others are curses/hexes/jinxes, and others are transfigurations. They belong to separate magical disciplines. The shield charm and a curse can both be used to protect something, but they have very little in common in terms of their magical nature.

On that basis I would argue that it's highly misleading to create any category like "wards" to group together spells used to protect things. It would be a grouping by functional use as opposed to magical nature and thus goes against the categorisation of magic as we know of it by discipline: charms, transfiguration, dark arts, potions, alchemy, etc.

We can see the canon categorisation system by magical nature at work in lots of situations. One example would be the fact that they learn how to conjure water in Charms, not Transfiguration (Aguamenti). That's because, even though we know that conjuration generally is a part of Transfiguration, the nature of the spell is that of a Charm, not a transfiguration. Thus it is grouped with Charms and not Transfiguration.

Its possible to have more then one way to categorise magic, just because they tend to categorise magic by discipline, does not mean categorising by effect or usage is not valid.

They already do this in canon, Defence against the dark arts cuts across disciplines to cover magic used for personal protection. The Dark Arts covers magic used offensively. Enchantment covers charms/curses/transfiguration/potions used to imbue an object with magic.

While the non-canon category of 'wards' covers location based protection.

As is said its just a description for a group of magic that is in canon.

To be honest, I'll maintain and argue that this is canon over Fleamont and Euphemia any day. Mostly because the tradition of it being Charlus and Dorea pre-dates Pottermore by yonks and yonks.

I view JKR's works on Pottermore the same way I view Cursed Child. They're expanded universe things that the author added on so much later that you can more or less take them as canon as you wish. In my personal opinion, nothing on Pottermore or the clusterfuck called Cursed Child are actually canon.

**** People should never have assumed it was Charlus and Dorea in the first place.

From the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/official-final-version.gif][Black Family Tree]] written in 2006, which is the first time she was mentioned, Dorea Black was born in 1920 and died in 1977 at the age of 57. James Potter would have been born in the early 1960s (later confirmed to be March 1960), meaning Dorea would have been in her 40s when James was born.

Add to that what we had known about James' parents since 2005:

#+begin_quote
  James's parents were elderly, were getting on a little when he was born, which explains the only child, very pampered, had-him-late-in-life-so-he's-an-extra-treasure, as often happens, I think. They were old in wizarding terms, and they died. They succumbed to a wizarding illness. That's as far as it goes. There's nothing serious or sinister about those deaths. I just needed them out of the way so I killed them.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-3.htm]]

James was born to parents who were old even by wizarding standards. Whatever "old by wizarding standards" means, age 40 is not it.

So it was always the case that Dorea and Charlus could not have been James' parents. It's just some parts of the fandom willfully ignored this for what they perceived to be a neat tie-in.

Also, if we're talking about clusterfuck sources of HP information, then the Black Family Tree surely counts. People having kids at 13, most of them dying extremely young despite being wizards... the whole thing is difficult to fit in with the books. Far more so than most of the stuff on Pottermore and Cursed Child.

***** Sharingan, or "copy wheel eye" is what is called a doujutsu in an anime called Naruto (see it as op eye magic)\\
It takes the form of a blood red eyes with three coma like shape around the pupil and comes with different abilities.\\
The first, most popular notion is an increase in perception ability, giving the user the aptitude of following very fast movement and even perceive the slightest muscle twitch. If the body can follow what he sees, the user of the sharingan can predict the movement of his opponent and react accordingly. The next ability is illusion, where a sharingan user can either stun an enemy or catch him in whatever illusion the user sees fit as soon as the opponent locks eye with him.\\
The third is the ability to see "chakra" (think magic)

Finally the last ability is what gave it it's name of "copy wheel" , the ability to copy any technique, magical or physical, previously seen. A sharingan user can even copy what someone's writing only through the movement of his hands.

And I'm not delving into its evolution: mangekyou sharingan, the eternal mangekyou sharingan or the Rinnegan, because that's some op, DBZ level shit right there.

  I think I forget that notice-me-not isn't canon because there are muggle repelling charms (Leaky Cauldron entrance, I forget that details) that I just think its an extension.
#+end_quote

It's not 100% clear that the Leaky Cauldon is a Muggle repelling charm rather than a "notice me not" (the name is fanon but the effect isn't).

When Hagrid takes Harry to the Leaky Cauldron for the first time, it seems that Harry is able to feel the effects of the charm preventing people from noticing the Leaky Cauldron:

#+begin_quote
  It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. *If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there.* The people hurrying by didn't glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.
#+end_quote

Emphasis mine.

Since the spell affected Harry, and Harry is not a Muggle, it would seem that the spell prevents people in general from noticing it until it is pointed out to them - not just Muggles.

(But Muggle-specific repelling charms definitely exist, as we're told of them multiple times and see Harry and Hermione cast them on their campsite in DH).

***** It's possible it was once under the fidelius and the secret keeper died. As we know from DH, when the secret keeper dies then everyone who knew the secret becomes able to pass the secret on, and those recipients of the secret in turn become able to pass the secret on. If the "secret base" was large enough, given enough time I suppose the charm would remain in place only with the entire wizarding population being the secret keepers.

OR it could just be a notice-me-not charm lol.

That Snape point also is applicable here. Snape & Lily were good friends & many people knew it. Nobody told Harry this in seven years - it's very very irregular.

** Wands that are violent or destructive if they don't match. Just about all fanfictions have that. It's based on the movies, of course, but it's definitely not canon.

From the books (fair use):

#+begin_quote
  ‘Right then, Mr Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.'

  Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.

  ‘Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try --'

  Harry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr Ollivander.

  ‘No, no -- here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.'

  Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.
#+end_quote

No violence. No destruction. No dramatic movie-only exaggerations. The movie wands were impressive in their spectacular failure to match, but it's not canon. Canon is books.

It doesn't even make sense.

#+begin_quote

**** Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this a bit commonplace in British children's fiction for child abuse to be treated with a comic or whimsical effect? I recall Roald Dahl having similar plots.

When I originally read the series, the nature of the writing sort of prevented me from truly looking at Harry's upbringing for what it was. Because of this, I never really hated Dumbledore for leaving him there all those years. But reading a lot of fics, I totally can understand when the author has Harry be furious with Dumbledore.

***** You're right, especially re:Dahl. I had the same feelings when I was first reading them. It's this premise that yes, these people are bad and the things they do are wrong, but the story's aimed at children so we need to present it in a light that's not going to traumatise them. But because HP went from children's fiction to young adult halfway through, it makes the abuse more jarring. The kind of things that slip by in that kind of children's fiction is harder to overlook in young adult fiction, where we're meant to take everything a lot more seriously.

I think the problem with the abuse in fanfiction comes from people who took the Dursleys to the extreme. There are writers who have them beating Harry to within an inch of his life on a daily basis. I think this generated a sect of fandom who then responded by going in the complete opposite direction and saying that the events of canon were /not/ abusive. When those two groups are shouting at each other, it's harder for the sensible ones to get heard pointing out that the Dursleys /were/ abusive, but abuse is more complex than "break his arm once a month".

(And as a disclaimer in case people have read my fics, yes I have written extremely abusive Dursleys, but I'm aware that degree of violence isn't canon.)

*** The problem is that JK was a bit shit of an author to start with and it shows through on PS. She didn't have foresight into where she was taking the series and so there are a lot of inconsistencies. The abused orphan with a great destiny is a staple of children's fantasy, so she used it then forgot about it.

Harry isn't an abused kid. When I say this I mean Harry's character is not that of an abused person. Clearly the behavior we see from the Dursleys in PS is abusive. However the behavior we see from Dumbledore in PS is also in line with the worst tropes about him.

CoS is the other book in the series that is clearly a children's fantasy before JK really ups her writing chops and takes the series into a more young adult area. So likewise it has its problems as well.

I have no problem with manipulative!Dumbledore, or abused!Harry or any other trope a person wants to use. This is fanfiction, you're welcome to do what you please. The problem is that these and Weasley bashing and a few other tropes aren't used in an AU setting, instead authors think they're canon and try to impose those beliefs on others.

*** Harry is abused.

With many things, there is a lot of variety involved in this idea. There are MANY forms of abuse, and there are MANY ways for someone who has been abused to react to being abused.

They abused him. Verbal abuse is abuse. It can be even harsher than physical abuse because it's a lot easier to look at a bruise or broken bone and say "This doesn't happen to other people" ... but when it's "just words" it's just something that becomes accepted and internalized. You don't realize it's wrong because it's always been that way.

My friend was abused by her father who spoke down to her left right and center. Never laid a finger on her, never neglected her physically. But emotionally? Oh yes. She's mid 30's and has been struggling since she was 20 to work past the damage he did to her.

My mother was abused in a whole lot of different ways. She is nearing 60 and it still affects her deeply.

Rowling didn't write harry as an abuse survivor. because it's not very heroic, to have a character who is damaged in the way that someone in Harry's position SHOULD be damaged.

We never see harry going "but is it okay to eat this much?" or "so what chores do I have to do?" and "This bed is really mine??" or expecting a teacher to yell... or hit... him when he's misbehaved.

And yes, I think Harry was at least mildly physically abused. Harry Potter takes place in the 90's. Harry potter's pre-hogwarts years were in the 80's. Harry is about 3 years older than I am ;) That was when getting spankings was not uncommon and was not shunned. I don't think he was beaten to within an inch of his life like some fics depict by a murderous psychopathic uncle, but I strongly beleive that he had a belt taken to his behind on a regular basis.

From the HP Lexicon, some snippits of Harry's early life in the 80's:

- Aunt Marge comes to Dudley's fifth birthday party. She whacks Harry around the shins to keep him from beating Dudley at musical statues.

This is physical abuse.

- Harry attends primary school. He is laughed at because of his oversized, hand-me-down clothes and taped glasses, and ostracized because none of the other kids will brave Dudley's gang to befriend him

This is neglect. Hand me downs are not neglect by nature, but when there is enough money to buy the other child plenty of new clothing, it is neglect to never give him anything but /clothes that don't fit/

- Aunt Marge comes to Dudley's birthday party, bringing a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry.

Y'know I"m not sure what exactly to call this. But you don't give kids dog biscuits, except MAYBE as a joke, and then you have something else to give them to take the edge off. It was Dudley's birthday, so no gift to Harry was even required. Thus... this is pretty much just being mean to Harry.

- Aunt Marge comes to Dudley's 10th birthday party, bringing Ripper, her favorite bulldog. Harry accidentally steps on Ripper's tail and the dog "trees" him. Marge finally calls the dog off around midnight.

A party with 10 year olds is not going to start anywhere near midnight. She--and they--allowed him to stay up in that tree for at the LEAST 3 hours, and quite likely, several more. This is abuse, this is neglect.

- for his tenth birthday, Harry is given a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.

That is cruelty, much like the box of doggy treats.

- In june, Harry unexpectedly finds himself coming along on Dudley's birthday outing to the zoo, where he accidentally releases a boa constrictor - he is locked in his cupboard until the summer holidays have begun.

This is abuse. We presume he's let out for bathroom breaks, and if you assume he's let out to go to school too, tha'ts still a young boy spending multiple hours on end every day for multiple days in a small cramped space. And the word LOCKED is scary too--what if there had been a fire? What if Harry had been hurt (like, hitting his head on a stair and being knocked out)?

The Dursley's tell people he's goes to "St Brutus' Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys" Telling lies about an abused person is common. It discredits them to other people. After all, if Dad is always saying what a troublemaking liar the son is.... anyone who speaks to the son will think that any 'troublesome' statements like "dad beats me" are going to be a lie... even when faced with obvious signs of a beating.

A quote from Aunt marge... as I recall, after askign harry about his beatings at his boarding school, and harry saying something like "Oh yes, they beat me lots."

#+begin_quote
  "I still don't like your tone, boy. If you can speak of your beatings in that casual way, they clearly aren't hitting you hard enough. Petunia, I'd write to them if I were you. Make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this boy's case."
#+end_quote

This is abuse! Even if this is just a THREAT that is still abuse. Trying to instill fear of physical repercussions is abusive :C

Seriously. my mom's dad once had his kids clean an animal--as in, skin, debone, etc. The remains were placed into the trashcan. He made them watch as the trash collectors collected the trash. then turned to them and basically said something to point out how the trash guys didn't even realize what they were carrying away. They just threw it in the truck and moved on. and implied, basically, that it could have been them. (Forgive the vagueness. This is a terrible story, and I'm trying to keep it clean.)

I don't know how my mom, aunt and uncle handled that, but seriously? That is instilling the fear of physical repercussions. That was traumatizing. IS that what aunt marge did? oh no. No. Not remotely.

but that threat is so casual that there's no way this is the first time Harry is being threatened with further abuse for not having 'the right attitude'.

This is all abuse. The Dursleys are incredibly abusive. Harry is an abused child.

He is not written like one, though.

Again, I don't think he's beaten on a regular basis within an inch of his life, he doesn't magically heal, he isn't covered in scars from stem to stern, but he has had some pretty bad emotional, and mental abuse in his life, by canon.

Sorry to go on about this, but I have strong feelings on this, haha.

****** It's definitely most often used in Hermione fics involving Purebloods. The only example I can think of at the moment is linkffn(Nightmare by provacative envy).

  COMPLETE: A broken time turner shouldn't have sent me back so far. It was unprecedented. Stepping on it-smashing it-nothing should have happened. At most, I should have lost a week. At worst, I should have disappeared altogether. I shouldn't have traveled back fifty-two years; half a bloody century. This should not have happened. HG/TR.

****** I hear about tired old tropes for the first time fairly often, and reading fanfiction consumes the bulk of my waking hours. I guess there really are too many fics to get through all of them.

******* Upvotes are used more or less randomly these days. It helps [[/u/howtopleaseme]] argument better if someone actually agrees "Me too" instead of using the upvote system that barely works.

*** Sort of related, but misunderstandings/faux pas caused by something Hermione does is another one I see a lot.

Like one I read recently involved her casting a hair charm of some sort in Harry, which to purebloods was seen as an intimate act.
