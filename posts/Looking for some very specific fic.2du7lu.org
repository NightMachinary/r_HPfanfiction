I recently finished re-reading the series for the billionth time, but this was my first time reading them all back to back in one go. I'm going through Potter induced depression so I've decided to FINALLY try fanfiction. The reason I've never read any before is because I LOVE the cannon from the books (not the films, those irk me too much) and I wouldn't want to read anything that contradicted that. So I'm looking for some fiction that kind of fills in the gaps from the books, and is as accurate as possible. Additionally I'd like some stuff that takes place after the books and some marauder era stuff. The big thing is though, I don't want anything with ships that didn't happen, or people swapping houses, etc. I was recommended to read Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, since that apparently fits my guidelines. I really appreciate any help! Also, I know this is a fanfic subreddit, but if you know of any good fan films that take place in the potter universe or before the books, I'd be interested!


** When I first started reading fanfiction, I really wanted a good continuation of cannon or "Eighth Year" fic. I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day]] by Little0bird and it was everything I was hoping for. Its on par with cannon in terms of style and quality. I hope you enjoy it too.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles]] is what I consider hands down the best fan fiction story. It tells the story of the life of Severus Snape. No character defamation (well, except McNair and Bellatrix, but it's pretty canon that those guys are crazy), Voldemort is not stupid there, Dumbledore may be a tad manipulative but he means well. Book compliant to the letter, and doesn't skimp out on the ugly details of British culture (the classes in the pre-Thatcher era, working class problems, etc).

Also, some of the most well developed characters you will ever see, perhaps more so than even JKR pulled off.

*** I really enjoyed the young Snape chapters of that fic, but as it progressed I found myself skipping all his Death Eater parts. It may be that I just prefer reading about Good Snape, not Evil Snape.

**** Snape isn't really good or evil in that fic. He's just trying to survive as best he can, get Harry through things alive (despite his being an annoying brat)... but the last year of the story is painful to read.

***** It's still a bit of a weird factor, since he's doing evil things. I never really liked fics that went into much detail about what he did for the other side. I prefer he stays at Hogwarts and simply "got called" without going into specifics.

** You're missing out on a TON of great stories by sticking to canon only, and personally, I don't really like to read them. That said, there are a lot of canon compliant marauders, 'missing scene', and next-gen type fics. Also, if you're interested, there are a ton of EWE (Epilogue? What Epilogue?) that are Canon excluding the epilogue (obviously) that are also good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5318441/1/Box-on-the-Stool][Box on the Stool by Drifwood1965]] is a good canon storyto start with as it's very short at 800 words.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5032869/1/The-Way-We-Were][The Way We Were]] is a good as well but like all of Chem Prof's stories, there's an HHr (that means Harry/Hermione pairing) overtone to it.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7336803/1/Wizard-Behind-the-Wheel][Wizard Behind The Wheel]] starts in the epilogue.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3808497/1/The-Road-Not-Taken][The Road Not Taken]] is post epilogue but [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream][St. Elsewhere's]] into EWE.\\
There's another fic that follows the above story by has Harry being the one to say it's too late. I'll look for it, but I read it years ago and forgot to fav it.

Though I pretty much never read strict canon fics, apparently some of the ones at TVTropes' [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterDayInTheLimelight][Day In The Limelight]] (or, canon from another POV) and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterContinuation][Continuation]] (Canon and next-gen) lists are supposed to be good.

There's also the C2s [[https://www.fanfiction.net/communities/book/Harry-Potter/0/3/1/][(Community Collections)]] which you should check out, though not all of them will be canon compliant. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/The-Marauders-Era/4903/][The Marauders' Era]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-Potter-The-Next-Generation-Stories/55027/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/][The Next Generation Stories]] are the only two I could find that are almost entirely canon.

Finally, I can't greet a new fanfic reader without recommending a few of my favorite fics:\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] (Firefly/Serenity cross over); and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7024025/1/Restoring-Hope][Restoring Hope]].

** There's a fan film on Youtube -- The Greater Good, a twenty-minute piece showing the death of Ariana Dumbledore, and is done relatively professionally. I can't link at the moment but if you search you'll find it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] on fanfiction.net is one of the best canon-compliant fanfic writers out there, and you'd do well to look through some of his stories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1550595/Thanfiction][Thanfiction]], the author of DA&YoD, has also written many other canon-compliant fics.

I can't help you very much with next-gen or Marauder era stories, I'm afraid.

** I'd like to second the recommendation of Northumbrian's work by [[/u/playthepuck]] . This is probably the recommendation that most consistent with your desiderata.

Another novel-length story that deserves to be mentioned is Arsinoe de Blassenville's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age][The Golden Age]] is an impeccably written, canon-consistent story spanning the time between the end of the Battle of Hogwarts and the Epilogue. 97k words, complete (with a horrific ending). Warning: a bit of a depressing read.

#+begin_quote
  Post DH. In the wake of victory, Harry struggles with life, love, and the reform of the British wizarding world. He learns that life is complex, and that happy endings are fleeting. Chapter 24- Dreams: The Unicorn in Kensington Gardens
#+end_quote

A silly "missing moment" canon-compliant one-shot is Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4176058/1/India][India]].

#+begin_quote
  The real hero of Deathly Hallows was Hedwig; this is her story. A canon-compliant, Deathly Hallows era, spy/military/action/thriller with Hedwig as protagonist. Hedwig/Phantom.
#+end_quote

Finally, and more seriously, I can't recommend highly enough the body of work by Inverarity. Not only does he have an excellent, post-canon, "next generation" story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] (205k words, complete)...

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?
#+end_quote

...but also the same author has a series of novels, his Alexandra Quick series, that are consistent with HP canon, yet set in a school in the U.S. Events in HP canon are alluded to continually, though they do not form the nucleus of this series. The extensive backstory and richness of Inverarity's world rival that of JKR's and his stories are written expertly and consistent in tone with the formula from canon HP: plucky hero/heroine overcomes mystery and staggering odds with the help of his/her friends. I think you'll really enjoy them and get a feeling for what fanfiction has to offer (highly creative, novel-length efforts by professional-quality writers). It's not (as the detractors would say), all slash, dodgy smut, and poorly edited "crackfic."

**** May I ask, why do you not like Alternate Universe fics or different ships? I always felt that the best fanfiction uses the established HP universe to create its own story.
