I like reading fanfictions about the house of Black and I'm not going to lie, it kind of annoys me how Regulus is always portrayed as some goody two shoes and how a lot of authors blame him going bad on Sirius and James Potter.

I get how you can make a case against Sirius being a bad brother because he seems to reject everything that ties him to his family since he got to Hogwarts. And honestly I kind of understand why he did it, it must have been hard to prove to people that he was not like his family. Just see how all his friends/ teachers directly thought the worse of him after the war and he wasn't even given a trial. So yes I totally see Sirius turning his back on his brother, BUT wouldn't it be the normal thing to do if Regulus believed in blood purity and all the nonsense his parents spilled on him ? It was mentioned in the books that : " my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them.." (Sirius talking about his brother and parents beliefs)

So honestly I don't understand from where people got the idea to romanticise Regulus and glorify him. He got the mark and seemed to be okay with Voldemort's actions. Also mentioned in the books that he was proud of it : " They're all about Voldemort. Regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the Death Eaters... "

Regulus ended up defecting because of his house elf, and while that is noble and very brave on his part, it doesn't excuse all his past acts.

So honestly why are people so keen on glorifying him, and blame all his bad choices on other people (Sirius abandoning him, James stealing his brother lol? )

I don't have a problem if you want to make him the protagonist in your fanfictions, but it's really annoying to not write a convincing redemption arc or at least make it Alternate universe/Canon divergence where he is good. I happen to be really interested in the character and in the Black family in general and love to read about them, but this little details can have a big impact on the stories.


** The same place that Good Narcissa comes from. Or Friend Draco. There are no canon Good Slytherin characters that have personalities remotely fleshed out in the series, so if they want one for their story they have to create an OC and assign one of the empty names JKR jotted on the page once or twice (i.e. Daphne, Theo, Blaise) or go full headcanon with one of the slightly established names.

** I agree. I noticed many authors who write fics about Regulus, Draco, Narcissa, and sometimes even Snape write them as unsung heroes, victims and sacrificial lambs instead of giving them a good redemption arc.

For that reason, I find many fics focused around those characters boring and uninspiring even though I love the Blacks and morally grey characters.

Another annoying thing is the way Regulus is portrayed in fanfiction. In canon, he's almost a blank page. All we know is that he shared his parents beliefs (or at least Sirius thinks so), he was a death eater, who at least in the begining, was proud to serve (according to Kreacher and the clippings on the wall), he cared for Kreacher, figured out Voldemort's secret and died. We know nothing of his friends, personality, interests (besides Quidditch), and yet in almost every fic I've read (and I've read a lot), he is the same person. Shy and quiet, timid, bookworm, sensitive and usually a loner. Why? Even Sirius, whose personality was established in the series, has more faces in fanfiction than Regulus. Like, where is the arrogance, the pride, the fiery temper we see in Sirius, Walburga and Bella and even, to a certain degree, with Andromeda? Regulus is a missed opportunity in that regard.

** He seems to be a vulnerable/people pleaser type person, the way it is framed in the story, he never had the bite or backbone of Sirius, and now only lives with his Dark family, as a person who prioritizes family/relationships(It is unlikely Sirius was friendly with him in school). Of course it could be that he is actually a die-hard, bloodthirsty death eater, who turned his back on Sirius, but it is just not framed that way when his story is revealed as changing sides for his beloved house elf.

I could also see him being obsessed with taking him down and the cuttings being more him trying to work out more about horcruxes/what Voldemort would be using for them.

** I agree. My favorite fanfiction of all time is Blackpool by TheDivineComedian because it portrays Regulus so well. It's also so incredibly and eloquently written it's worth the read. I will rave about this fic until the end of time

Another amazing one I read is The Laughing Heart by smile_it_will_get_better on AO3. In this one where you understand Regulus' character and can possibly even sympathize with him but he is no saint and does horrible things while in the death eaters. It's a much more canon-characterization of him I think and is probably what Regulus' time in the death eaters was more like, aka very un-saint like.

** I've been working on a long [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2265983][series]] delving deep into the Black family, trying to make them sympathetic while still not-nice people. Regulus did not "go bad" because of James and Sirius, but his exposure to Sirius is helping him "go good" and try to redeem himself.

So many of my Blacks are finding a desire to redeem themselves far too late in life. Orion didn't fully realize he was a bad father until Sirius ran away. Walburga refuses to acknowledge the part she played in Sirius' rebellion. Regulus never wanted the responsibility on his shoulders but cannot let himself be a disappointment. Pollux was too placid to protect his grandson, and Arcturus realized too late the cost of blood supremacy.

** I could write paragraphs about Regulus but a lot of it is useless cause it is fanon. My best answer is that it is more interesting for Regulus to not be an obsessive blood supremacist.

It could also be that he was barely 18 when he died and had only just been confronted with the reality of his worldview (he graduated the same year he died). Maybe he would have changed a lot as a person if he was afforded the chance.

That said, I agree that him being "saintlike" is not the goal. He should have some questionable values and beliefs. I don't think he'd ever say that The Black family isn't the best family ever (the way that Sirius does every chance he gets) but outside of his parents influence he could introspect on what it really means (like he might decide that child abuse is bad all around).

*** Exactly, I just can't read fanfictions where poor little Regulus is innocent and every other person is responsible for him going bad. Or for them turning against Siriua and blaming him for his brother's sins. Or him just being a saint and all his faults excused in the blink of an eye. Persons like that can't change in a day, you need a long time to realise you are wrong and to get rid of all the prejudices, so if people are gonna turn him good at least they'd had to make it believable.

** Regulus is such an interesting character. His whole situation is ripe for a really good introspective situation, and I totally agree it's bizarre how he's treated in fanon. It's lowkey weird how people tend so much towards a black and white moral view point (a person is either evil or good, and if they were thought of as evil and then do something good, then they must have been good all along in secret), but one of the minor themes of the series is the morality isn't really black and white. In the books, Snape and Draco do morally terrible things only to redeem themselves to some degree, but in fanfiction so often these characters are treated as good all along, and there are huge divides and arguments over is Snape good or bad? when that's not even the point, people are complex and do good and bad things at different times in their lives for different reasons. It doesn't surprise me fanon treats Regulus the same way; it's difficult to pull off complex characterization.

As a side note, there's a pretty good series on Regulus on AO3 that's still being updated regularly (wink wink) linkao3(as the crow flies by amortentia (ofpoetsandsaints))

** Simple. People want to be special. Here is the break down. They feel like no one gets them, things suck they kinda want to hate everything. But not really. So they like this idea of an easy teen/ young guy who is all like dark and stuff. Cause you know "so are they". But they don't want to be evil. So its cool when Regulus turns on Voldemort. Jaded anti hero angsty guy. So they write stories of him not dieing. Because they want him to be special. If he can be all "dark and brooding and cool" so can they. I would bet that. Most Regulus fics are written by people from age 13-25.

90% of human action is driven by the desire to be special. The rest is pure "fuck that guy" mode.

This quote is a perfect reason why he's portrayed as a saint. Sirius, for all of his faults, could've done more to help his brother break the blood purity indoctrination. And when Regulus /does/ break it, he could've gone to Sirius and revealed the Horcruxes sooner.

So it's easy to see him as a saint because, at the end of the day, he went against everything he was taught and tried to end the Dark Lord. And the truth is that Sirius trusting him a little bit more, and there would've been more steps taken

After Sirius ran away, all the expections fell on him, maybe even more, a betrothal wouldn't be too far fetched.

I believe that he stopped talking to him but never hated him. Regulus grew up in an abusive home with his brother as his only confort and safe place.

Regulus could have been doted on and spoiled while Sirius was nagged at for being not as good of a son as Regulus, leading Sirius to rebel against his parents and become a Gryffindor. But that's all speculation, too, of course.

And that's why fanon exists. To me, as long as we don't have any information on something, and the Marauders fandom collectively agrees on something, it's as good as canon. If we have no content we make up our own content. Same for the entirety of the Marauders fandom, we have like 2% of canon content and we made the rest up.

I just ask... why is this Sirius' duty? He was just a kid as well, barely older and going through his own trouble with the Black family. Since when did we rely on kids to teach morality to other kids?\\
And by the end of Hogwarts, Regulus was already deep in the Voldemort propaganda and couldn't be helped. He had to experience the reality of his choice and decide for himself, nothing else would work.

If anything, trying to steer students away from such indoctrinations and the Death-eater route should be the responsibility of the teachers, who are responsible for the kids 24/7 for most of the year.

*** That's what I don't really understand. I accept the fact that Sirius could have done more to influence his brother at school because it simply would not have been possible at home. But from what I gathered in the small parts Regulus was mentioned in the books, he was a big believer of blood purity. He decided to go against Voldemort but we don't know if he decided to go against his beliefs. He didn't agree with Voldemort's methods when he defected, but we have 0 idea about his thoughts on the whole pureblood agenda. And this is why I have a problem with the way he is portrayed in fanfiction. I just think authors need to put an effort in a good redemption plot, because at the end of the day he went against Voldemort for his house elf and didn't really care about the halfbloods and muggleborns (as far as we know).

We should also keep in mind that Sirius left the house and was disinherited. We talk about Sirius making efforts but no one talks about Regulus making efforts for his brother ? I think it should go both ways. Again since we don't have any canon idea on the details I just talk about fanfictions in general.

I totally agree on the Horcrux point. If Regulus had someone he could trust on the other side of the war, things would have been very different.

Keep in mind it's chapter three, and already, you see that the Black weren't good people. Because Arcturus (you know,Sirius Grandfather we never learn about) is more fascinated and interested by the idea someone would make a horreur rather than the fact there is a very real one right in front of him and his heiress.

Also, there are other scenes that I plan later about the House of Black, Potter and Gaunt.

There are sides and possibilities you have professed to be interested in and there's actually quite a few fics that do explore that figure, by the way, ‘everyone' really isn't writing the same thing at all.

I don't have a problem with people writing this trope, I just find it hard to believe that Regulus would turn good in the blink of an eye and not gradually redeem himself, because from the tiny bits he's mentioned in canon he was a blood purist.

Honestly though for real the reason is because sometimes you want a not completly morally bankrupt POV from behind enemy lines, I think at the core of it.

I think a lot of the answers here are right though. Some people want their Timothee chal awhatsit teen angst love affair.

Others want to talk about abuse and victimhood and others want to talk about the finer points of morality and trying to crawl out of the quagmire when no one really wants you to and you have seemingly zero options.

Admittedly I've written him in different levels of immersion in the death eater bullshit meter, so I'm not on the complete woobifying end of the spectrum, hopefully; though I'm sure a lot of people would say I am

I actually like these fanfictions because it shows that Regulus is actually trying to get away and is looking for a way out. It at least shows that he is not okay with the way things are. I mostly have a problem with the one where he survives somehow and we are supposed to accept this new version of him especially if they chose to blame others.

I think it's just like in normal life when people tend to blame everything bad in their life on those around them while refusing to do self reflection.

** [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/review-of-escape-and-mr-and-mrs-percy-weasley.html][Moral inversion]] is very natural for all teenagers/young adults, who are struggling with creating their own moral structure ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Scott_Peck#The_Road_Less_Traveled][Stage Two]]). And these people are the most common writers/readers of fanfiction stories.

** I mean, after Sirius ran away, all the expections fell on Regulus' shoulders. House Black's reputation was ruined. Regulus was a child. He admired Voldemort because all his life he was surrounded by people who painted him as a hero. He probably got socially pressured into getting the Dark Mark.

Even if he got the Dark Mark at 16, I don't think that he ever did anything until he graduated.

And then he saw what the Death Eaters were actually doing, he witnessed murder, torture.

I once read a fanfiction in which he is sent to his first mission after graduating and when he comes back home he has a panic attack alone in his room, in the middle of the night because he had to kill someone for the first time, he saw the light leave their eyes, and it completely destroyed him.

If you look at what happened in canon, I honestly think it's realisitic. He realized that it was wrong and immediately tried to find a way to defeat Voldemort.

Anyone else would just take it and keep going. Because they'd be too afraid to defy Voldemort.

Or else, they'd run to Dumbledore for help. But he couldn't have that. He was a child. A death eater, but still a child. He probably thought that Dumbledore would just kill him on sight.

Regulus Arcturus Black was only 18 when he discovered Voldemort's deepest darkest secret before anyone else did, before even Dumbledore did.

And he died alone, choosing to sacrifice his own life instead of that of his House Elf. He was 18. And he died alone in that cave, drowned by thousands of cold, dead bodies dragging him to the depths of a freezing lake.

Regulus Arcturus Black was only 18 when he died as a hero for thousands of people he was raised to think of as the dirt under his shoes. He died thinking he had made Voldemort mortal again. He died fighting for the light. He died doing what he believed was right. That's more than you can say for Snape, who was forced into the light.

Regulus Arcturus Black was the true Hero of Slytherin.

*** I don't think it's unrealistic for him to turn good at the end, I mostly have a problem with people portraying him as good since day 1, because that mostly wasn't true. You say that he died for the people he thought beneath him, I wouldn't be so sure about that because for all we know he died for his house elf. Would he ever have defected if it wasn't for Kreattur ? Now that you mentioned Snape, I think they have more in common than we think. Both were death eaters, both willingly became one, and both defected because of a person they loved but nit because they thought that what Voldy was doing was bad.

It is mentioned in the books that Regulus has always been the favourite child and that he was proud of his family and beliefs, and that he really believed everything his parents told him.

Honestly that's what annoys me, it's like if the whole fandom just agreed that Regulus was good while writing fanfictions. I don't understand why. I get if they redeem him and turn him good at the end, but from the start? Isn't it kind of hypocritical considering the amount of other characters that actually fighted for the good but are thorn appart in fanfictions?

**** It's so funny that you seem to think that an author having him kill someone and then panic over it means they think he's innocent? Like they just wrote that he killed someone lmao, that's clearly stating that he's in the wrong.

Evil and morals aren't a clear cut thing, and redemption and realisations can look different too. Just because the narrative isn't being treated like you want it to doesn't think they think a murderer is fine and dandy

***** Yes because that's exactly what a lot of fanfictions I read do. - Regulus being a blood purist and Voldemort fanatic thats quits because he realises that there is a lot of violence, and then thats it. He's officially a good person, whose acts can't be questioned.

Okay and then what ? What about his beliefs? Does he still think himself above muggleborns? Does he still believe in blood purity? Because going against Voldemort doesn't mean going against those beliefs, even Narcissa lied to him to save her son.

****** I think we're reading different fics, because the ones I have read don't really have him being untouchable. I always find that so frustrating.

But I suppose in canon there's a precedent. Look at the way Harry treated Severus Snape's memory

*** We know nothing about him in Canon, so i dont know about morals tbh. I hope he did have them, but I don't see Sirius hating him then, maybe just being disappointed? So at the end of the day he might have been like I don't care about Voldemort and violence againt halfbloods, muggleborns, and other species but I draw the line at my house elf.
