Has there ever been a story that connects Harry Potter to Hyacinth Bucket from keeping up appearances? It seems that Hyacinth and her family (Daisy, Rose and Violet) would nicely connect to Lily and Petunia. Also Hyacinth and her obsession with social climbing and normalcy would fit in pretty well.


** Oh my! This would be awesome. So very awesome.

*** I guess the connection would have to be from the Evans side. Though I think it would be funny if Petunia met Vernon at one of Hyacinth's “little suppers”

**** Maybe the Buckets were related to the Potters since their names refer to similar items? Sheridan is magical and that's why he's never around...Mummy doesn't understand!

***** Oooh nice! Would be a great tie in to the Evans having flower names. I would really like to read that. Do you write fanfic at all?

I agree that Richard and Arthur would be good mates!

********* At least the dishes get done. :) For me dishes and laundry are like Snape's description of the Dark arts “Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.”

**** Petunia and Hyacinth as best friends? Daisy would be very accepting of magic. Richard is a squib? Or maybe the son of a squib. Wouldn't it be funny if he was related to one of the noble, pure blood families and if Hyacinth wasn't so “proper” she could be upper magical class?

***** Ooh Yes. All of this. Daisy would love magic and Hyacinth would constantly tell he me she is wrong and not proper. I love the idea of Richard as a son of a squib from a really ancient family maybe the last scion of a family who is a second generation squib. The family would be considered dead. He would initially try to educate his wife on magical etiquette but now he is so beaten down he doesn't try anymore. Richard would probably really get along with Arthur if they met

**** I [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bhu4kc/enter_the_dragon/][quite like it]], but it mostly doesn't match your original request. The juxtaposition of Harry being easy-going and friendly and overpowered, with the world being harsh and cutthroat and oppressive, makes for an interesting read. Updating every month or two.

*** No. It was played by [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0819655/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1][Elizabeth Spriggs]] in the first movie and [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0294067/][Dawn French]] in the third film.
