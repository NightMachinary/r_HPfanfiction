linkffn(The Birth of Evil by DisobedienceWriter)

In other words, a fanfiction where Harry controls magic at a young age and is kinda sorta evil, but he fights for a better world.

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years

** Although not precisely what you're looking for, Linkffn(The Evil Overlord List by boomvroomshroom) might suit.

Linkffn(Fire Born by wickedlfairy17) is a lot closer to the request and is one of my favourites. Don't be thrown off by the pairing, the author lays the ground work for the relationship to make sense.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  Being the Master of Death was a curse, plain and simple. That had been death's intention when he 'gifted' his trinkets to the brothers three. The sound of shedding skin crackled loudly in his ear as he got up to look over his new body, he was a girl this time, maybe eight or nine years old. Time travel fic Tom RiddleX Harry potter
