Am I the only one who hates it when a fic has Hermione or any other muggleborn witches or wizards take an inheritance test and its revealed that they're secretly descended from a long line of squibs and they're the last descendants from a long though dead line if pureblood wizards? I feel like it completely misses the point. Muggleborns aren't to be respected because they're secretly noble. They're to be respected and regarded as equal irrespective of their blood or background.


** Personally I like the squib explanation. I guess I will be the only one who comes out for it.

I don't think they should change names and become noble all of a sudden. But muggleborns being the result of Squibs is canon(as much as Pottermore is at least) in my head, it just doesn't change much

But considering if you go far back enough in the real world, it does not take a huge gap before everyone is related to each other. So if squibs are shunned and leave for the muggle world, it makes sense their descendants will produce wizards at some point. It is not going to make Hermione wizard nobility if she is 1/72 Lestrange tho. She would not even be recognized for that blood

There is likely a wizard Eve and Adam. As in Mitochondrial Eve. A mitochondrial witchy Eve would be plausible

I don't like the Lordships fanon that much. If something else does not make me stick with the fic, I might drop them. I hate the Goblin kind of inheritance tests in the plot. But I like the Wizengamot being partly related to being purebloods since it implies an archaic democracy and it fits into the theme of wizards being a bit archaic. But Harry testing for Gryffindor and Peverell blood and then gaining their seats is a big no. Seats would be transferable and it would be similar to ownership of house elves but even a better status symbol. Ollivander should be more likely to own a seat there as an established generational business. Blacks and Malfoys would hold seats because they would not transfer them and Gaunts would be already sold theirs gens ago if they had one. So purebloods would have them, seats would not change hands that much and when it did they would sell it to another pureblood. It would explain the bigorty of muggle-born registration act

I always imagine things being more like trade guilds and how the city states operated. Population and culture of wizards don't really make sense for actual nobility. There is also no reason for wizards to progress like muggles did. So I like the city states-like approach

I expect Blacks to claim nobility because they claim they are descended from Atlantis or something and claim they were the first witches in Britain without actual proof of it other than having history going back to medieval roots. Their claim of nobility should be obscure right now and even among Blacks there should be different opinions on it, some simple as "always pure"

In a perfect world, that isn't Magical Britain. That is the case.

But this isn't that, they are in Magical Britain, where blood status matters.

Personal headcanon here: There are two types of "muggleborns": true first generation magicals (AKA they popped out of nowhere, no family history), and magic being rekindled in a line of squibs. This makes more sense than the purely random stuff JKR introduced. Purebloods inbreed themselves into squibhood, then throw out the squibs. The squibs get married, have kids, etc with each successive generation cleaning out the inbreeding. Once it's all gone, magic comes back.

In all seriousness, a true "first generation magical" sounds like winning the lottery. And how many muggleborns were in Harry's year at Hogwarts? What are the odds of that? Astronomical.

*** While the squid theory makes sense too, I always thought that in a world with people that view muggles as barely human there would be a lot of r*pe children. How easy would it be to do that to someone? Confounded someone would make them believe something rediculous like the person they slept with is their husband. Imperious would make them a "willing" participant that would then rationalize it as a one night stand. There's also the memory charm which would make the women forget their rape causing them to think the child born was from their established relationship unless they looked absolutely nothing like the guy.

** You are right that inheritance tests, long lost squib lines, muggleborn inheritance, etc, don't seem to fit the original message that blood doesn't matter. I feel though that is an issue with writing, not with subject.

The worst contenders in this type of fics have Hermione discover she is descended from a long lost pureblood family, take up her family name, suddenly gain the poise of royalty, and becomes as desirable as a pureblood in the eyes of bigots like Malfoy. Poor characterization, poor understanding of bigotry, poor writing.

This lacks an understanding of bigotry. If the Malfoys found out that Hermione was the descendant of a squib from the Dagworth-Granger line, they wouldn't suddenly respect her, in fact they might respect her even less. In Harry Potter squibs are looked down on, hidden away, ignored, or sent to the muggle world. Why would being the grandchild of one of them as well as muggles make a bigot respect them?

In a noble house au this is even more of an issue, people wouldn't be overjoyed that the lost house of "blank" has returned, they would disregard anyone's claims and possibly kill them off. Also no reason that vaults and properties that would just be sitting around waiting for someone to claim them, when the line died out, their assets would be claimed by those that had any sort of claim on them.

The idea that muggleborn are descended from squibs doesn't invalidate the idea that blood doesn't matter though, because the majority of the blood of a longest squib descendant muggleborn is muggle. If blood mattered they would be weaker.

I've seen good interpretations a couple of times, such as one where Hermione was able to prove without a doubt that she was not to far removed from the Dagworth-Granger line, but they completely refused to acknowledge that there had been a squib in their family and wouldn't recognize her as a relative. Also, where muggleborn don't get any monetary, land, or magical inheritance from realizing who they are descended from.

The idea that muggleborn are descended from squibs or magical rape victims or whatever, fits within the Harry Potter universe well. The idea that discovering this heritage would really change much for the muggleborn does not.

Yeah sure it's cool to think you are Descended from King William the conqueror but don't expect the British monarchy to do anything about it (afterall he had a lot of basted that don't get anything as a rule) besides there's a rule of primogeniture, eldest gets all.

Heck, here in my country legal children gets all and if there's no reason to claim a family why add them to the family register. I sure as fuck ain't giving money to a third cousin that comes up and says their family. At most I'd just say good for them but I have no obligation to do shit. If great grandpa didn't give you stuff or your gran spent it all its not my problem. You sure as fuck not getting shit from me. Unless stated otherwise legal, main family gets all. So regardless of blood, if you're not in official family register an adopted child has more right to stuff than you.

Also in lord fics Harry gets willed money and property it is what most likely happened to the money and property of muggleborns, willed to something else.

For time travel, you could have a rule which forbids accumulation of titles, which leaves many families eligible to inherit House X, but because they have only one child, that child cannot take the title as they already inherit one. And whenever you have more, those can then go out there and claim their own.

But inherit only one house meant merger house get born, like House of Hanover became Wettin to Windsor but not Mountbatten (queen elizabeth 2 is Windsor, her husband is Mountbatten, the prince of wales is still windsor).

As for time travel... Well, I liked the one where Harry and Teddy goes to the past gets nothing but Fleamont and Charles goes, 'holy shit, he's not ours or dad's, which asswhore cousin disowned a kid or sired a bastard' since he looks bloodline but not part of family tree or vault access( spoiler, they and the blacks don't acknowledge him formally as 'family' but keeps an eye on him, nonetheless). Simply it's more interesting than a random family rising from the dead. It also explains the lack of papers since he's 'not part of the family' officially and his looks and ability are a 'coincidence'. traces that link him to the 'family' was erased. An automatic known pureblood name and money for time travel fic feels a bit lazy for me.

I'd take "random resurrected family" over another Potter because I generally find fics which explore something new more interesting. That is not to say that I haven't read good fics where Harry is "adopted" into the Potter or Black family in the past, but that automatically gives him a rather significant support network instead of the "lost in the past" vibe, where he generally only has one person to lean on, if any.

******* It's not the adopted to Potter or black in the past that I liked about it but rather looked down 'bastard' or disowned child that can ruin the family's 'light' political standing if people connected his existence I.e. Potter's don't acknowledge them and even trust them or Potter's aren't saints trope.

Basically what I don't like in 'ressurected family' trope is the money, heirlooms and status most people give time travellers. I prefer penniless nameless time traveller than one with attached lore, even legitimacy. The only 'random ressurected family' trope that I like is if it's from Identity theft( I.e. count of Monte Cristo style). I don't like how one seamlessly inserts themselves into the past by 'inheriting a dead family'.

it gives a vibe of what if Harry is just another upstart muggleborn/halfblood orphan with no grand family legacy. A clean slate but gives a problem due to lack of legitimacy of identity where a true value of name is questioned.

** My headcanon is that magic genes (however they work) are floating around the muggle population. 25 or 30 generations back everyone's related to everyone else anyway, and squibs used to be cast out into the muggle world, so it would be near-impossible for that /not/ to be the case. Thus, all muggle-borns have magical ancestry if you trace it back far enough. And by itself, I think this /supports/ the message that muggle-borns are the same as all other magicals.

But I do agree that it feels cheap when a muggle-born wins the lottery to be descended from a /noble/ line. (Yes, I use noble houses in my fics, but I try to downplay what they mean on a practical level.) And the idea of a "long line of squibs" is just silly. There's no indication that squibs are any different from muggles except for being aware of magic.

*** My headcannon is that the magic gene is a dormant part of humanity that everyone has, and that if a few people got mutations bring it to the fore and then intermarried you would get the first early generations of squib like shamans who could commune with the power of the world (magic). Over enough time of these bloodlines reinforcing their dormant magical traits the traits became dominant, and then by reproducing with regular people they are able to activate the dormant genes with their dominant ones resulting in a massive boom in the magical population. Some people born to these magicals were weaker than others while some had more control over their powers. This resulted in the community favoring the more controlled powerful ones and eventually the weaker ones intermarried enough with normal people that the magic gene became dormant again even if it was more developed. This trend continues with wizarding populations slowly growing apart from non magical ones, all the while the "squibs" are slowly spreading powerful if dormant magical genes throughout the muggle population just waiting for either random activation due to mutation, or another dominat version of the gene to come along and jumpstart it via a wizarding parent.

In this way many muggleborns randomly unlock their magical gene either by mutation or a combined genetic defect in their parents causing the dormant/recessive magical genes to come into play. At the same time, a magical marrying into a muggle family would be all but guaranteed to have magical offspring as they would activate their childrens dormant magic genes with their own active ones.

If we take that at face value, Hermione would come from some magical family if you go far enough in the past. Add in that there's a famous potioneer named 'Dagworth-Granger' and it's easy to make it so that she's the closest relative to some extinct noble house (particularly since any suitably old enough magical family would seemingly be noble).

I don't like that interpretation, and I solidly prefer magic to be able to arrive with anyone, no matter if they had a magical ancestor or not.

If the class divide is really as deep and violent as canon implies, you might be unable to overcome it, no matter your birth. Look at Rome if you want a good example. Plebians could make their way up the cursus honorum, they could be richer than a senator, yet they would never become a member of the patrician class on their own since that was tied to being a descendant of the initial Roman nobility.

They are nobles because it's their God given privilege and that has no factual basis. The same reason 'lord farquad' isn't king because he isn't married to a princess, you can only be noble if your born into it or married. And blood isn't everything, a Di daughter is not the same as a Shu daughter. At most a Shu can be is a concubine and not the lady of the house despite how much the husband loved her.

** I personally avoid all "inheritance" fics myself. They just don't align with how I envision the HP world in general being that Wizards are still pretty much normal humans except that they are able to perform magic. Kinda affirms the point why Muggle Borns shouldn't be looked down upon because they really are the same as a pure-blooded wizard.

** Like with most things it depends on how well it's done. One way it could work for me is the muggleborn using it as protection from the corrupt government. Like:

"You want to sue me? Ok, but I am descended from so and so and I want to be tried like a pureblood" So the courts will be more lenient lest they set a precedent you can throw any old pureblood in Azkaban. I can see this happen especially in Deathly Hallows. Just imagine it- Umbridge trying to put muggleborns on trial only for them to produce evidence from Gringotts they are the descendants of long lost pureblood lines.

(This has actually happened. After the communists take power (through murder, terrorism and war) the middle class starts trying to prove they are poor and villagers and have communist cousins. Or at least have sheltered communists. It's like a reverse meritocracy- instead of listing achievements on your CV you list how poor, overworked and uneducated you and your family are.)

Of course more often than not it's done badly- just for the power fantasy. And for children and teenagers to talk like 50-year-old politicians. I'm not saying I can write a convincing 12-year-old, but some authors need to tone it down a bit with the whole my lord/ my lady gimmick. And like another user already pointed out- it's worse if the purebloods suddenly start falling in love with Hermione. Or even worse- Hermione suddenly starts defending the "culture and traditions".

*** They are examples of young absolute monarchs, even some successfully acting. Charles XII had taken over the Throne of Sweden at age 15 and by the time he turned 18, he had crushed Denmark in a defensive war and absolutely destroyed the Russian Army at Narva while outnumbered almost 4:1 in the same year.

However, they are remarkable because they stand out. It certainly wasn't common.

*** Depends on how they do it Is the war just a political battle with acts of terrorism being rare or are they trying show muggleborns like those annoying tourist who go to countries with thousands of years of history and culture and because they didn't look into snub the locals Because if you stay true to canon then there is no way for the death eaters to be good But for all that this series is meant for kids who won't think too deeply about good, evil, consequences, responsibility That's why we have FanFiction where people can explore ideas

** i'm actually a fan of the idea that there is no such thing as "muggleborns", that they are all just descendants of squibs kicked out of their families, so the answer to your question on my part would be, no.

** I agree that they should be treated better but treating them with the same as everybody else? I don't think that's how real life works Someone whose family is an integral part of wizardimg society for generations and is rich will definitely get more respect than someone who is basically a foreign student with no history no money no meaningful contribution to society Remember muggle society means nothing to most witches and wizards Most death eaters are bigots who either work for or can bribe the ministry in a way to be shown in a better light

** I get your point, but I like this trope because of the explanation it gives as to why muggleborns exist. They don't all have to be related to some wealthy ancient family. I'm pretty sure not all wizarding families got it like that in terms of wealth and status. One of Harry's ancestors was in fact the one to bring big money into the family by starting a business.
