Its one where harry becomes friends with a few slytherins starting with draco.

I think it starts in potions class but I do remember that draco inquires about harry's well being and it escalates from there.

I've been craving fics where harry and draco become friends but its hard to find decent ones that aren't slash. This is one of the few I've read before and it popped into my memory but I can't remember the name of it.

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.
