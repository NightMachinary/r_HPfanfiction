There are a couple of instances where I wondered what adults did and if they actually did anything. It seems unlikely that after learning that Harry was entered for that tournament, Sirius was completely fine with it. He can't come to Hogwarts, but something like a very angry letter would be in order. Then in OOTP Snape stops giving Harry occlumency lessons. Sirius threatens to come and talk to Snape, but Remus says he should be the one to do it. So what might have happened after that conversation with Harry? Did Dumbledore know what happened?I know Harry is too interested in those visions to learn to close his mind, but was something done and Snape refused to teach him anyway? Is it possible to make adults do something in this situation and the one in GoF without going AU? Or do adults have to remain passive in order to stay canon compliant?


** This is a super common problem in stories about teenagers. It's difficult for Harry to save the day if the adults in his life are actually competent because they would outclass him in every way. So we get these conflicting portrayals of adults like Sirius& Lupin being intelligent and caring yet passive and uninvolved. I'm not sure what the solution is there.

*** As for that situation in OOTP, I suppose it's possible that Remus talked to Snape and Snape said Harry was useless at this. Then we have to involve Dumbledore and maybe he suggested that then Snape should keep an eye on Harry if he can't teach him or something. I mean,couldn't we sometimes keep a balance or something. I wish I hadn't realised how frustrrating this is!

What if adults were competent and took the CoS threat seriously?

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** Nowadays, I'm only looking for fics that do away with the “useless adults” trope that's so prevalent in children's literature.

As for canon stations, it's of course possible to keep them, but requires some serious plot railroading, especially in CoS.

My version of the TWT event will always have Barty Jr impersonating his father instead of Moody. He would still be able to hack the Goblet and manipulate the event, while remaining secure in his new identity. Even the Marauder's Map wouldn't be able to get him!

*** As for the DoM battle, I will get rid of that crappy “12 veteran Death Eaters failed to capture or kill 6 teenagers in a carefully setup ambush”. It's simply another useless adults and teenage wank moment. It also makes Harry (and Hermione more so) incredibly stupid. I will rewrite the entire sequence as:

- Harry got the vision from Voldemort
- Harry called Sirius via the Mirror
- Sirius thought it would be an excellent opportunity to setup Voldemort and convinced Harry after a long argument
- Harry and Co setup Umbridge and led her to a trap in the Forbidden Forest
- The Order mobilized, with Dumbledore polyjuiced as a student
- They surprised and killed majority of Death Eaters present, but Sirius got cocky and was hit by Bellatrix's AK
- Voldemort showed up to bail out his remaining Death Eaters

** If we assume that Lupin did confront Snape, he probably told him a) fuck off and then b) that Harry knew enough about Occlumency to not need more lessons.

If they didn't actually know the real reason that Harry needed to learn Occlumency then they might not have pushed as hard. I can't remember if it's implied they know the true reason or that they're just going to agree with anything Dumbledore says.

I'm not 100% sure if it's explicitly stated either, but my headcanon is that Dumbledore is keeping anything/everything connected to Voldemort, Harry, the Prophecy, and Horcruxes (Horcruxii? Whatever.) extremely close to his chest and on an absolute need to know only basis because of fears/concerns of too many people knowing too much might let the enemy become aware of what he's trying to do.

*** And then Lupin most probably contacts Dumbledore and tells him Snape refused. I wonder what would happen then. I'm not sure they knew what the reason was, because after Arthur is attacked, they speculate why Harry could see that vision. But couldn't they have realised that Dumbledore wanted those visions to stop since Voldemort could plant false visions in Harry's mind and lure him to the ministry? I don't think they needed to know Voldemort wanted a prophecy, maybe just knowing he wanted a weapon from there would be enough.Dumbledore seems like the only one who could actually make Snape continue teaching, so they had to inform him at least.

**** And then Dumbledore can't really get into contact with Snape because he's currently on the run. Or Snape is able to convince Dumbledore that Harry knows enough about Occlumency to not need lessons anymore. It's not like Dumbledore can ask Harry directly as he was literally on the run and had been avoid Harry all year.

** As someone said before, a common problem of Harry Potter (and any story with children MC).\\
Harry Potter is a mystery, in all the books, we have a mystery that is slowly unveiled until the revelation of the end, but since the hero is a child (or teenager depending of the book), it's him who must solve the mystery, which make the adult useless.

For example, from a logic point of view, it's stupid to think that Hermione, while being kept in the dark and going to class, was able to solve what was the monster of the CoS while Albus Dumbledore, supposed to incredibly brillant and with more hints than her could not.

The adult in HP have to be incompetent because it's the only way to have a child hero. Let's suppose adult were competent, what would happen? They would solve the mystery themselves faster than Harry and he would be as uninvolved as the other children (which he is supposed to be).\\
An explanation (really liked in fanfics) to justify the incompetence of adults is that Harry is manipulated by Dumbledore and that he was never more than a glorified pawn dancing in the palm of his hand.

And if you want to make the adult competents while keeping Harry as the hero, then you have to make him as good as them to even the field, but then you loose the other children as characters and they are more well fleshed and interesting as an author.

​

Also I think a solution to this problem is Voldemort. There is a fic with the idea of an awakened Harry Horcruxe that can communicate with Harry and even sometimes possess him. Thanks to this, you can have both a "child" MC dealing with children problem and trying to resolve a mystery, while also willingly or unwillingly being a pawn for the Horcruxe in his head that his playing a more difficult game with a suspectfull Dumbledore.

** I wouldn't describe Sirius as being "completely fine" with Harry being the Tournament. After all, he risks discovery to talk to Harry via the Floo, and he's quite serious about the danger Harry's in. Besides, who is he supposed to send an angry letter to - the goblet?

However, your larger point about the limited involvement of adults is fair. But as others have already pointed out, if that adults were all present and competent, there wouldn't be much of a story left for Harry. JKR, to her credit, does her best to give plot reasons for the general absence of adults, but at the end of the day you have to be willing to suspend some disbelief.

**** This is what I'm thinking of. It's one thing when reading from Harry's pov he is the hero of the day, but it's another thing entirely when you read something from another character's point of view and you know they should at least do something, not just wait for disaster to happen or Dumbledore to sort things out.

*** Maybe to Dumbledore. The point is that I can't imagine him just sitting and waiting for Harry to die in the tournament. Harry thinks he is completely alone there, but maybe adults did try something, only due to that magical binding contract their attempts failed.

** I feel like in canon, because Harry is the POV character, it's obscured that he's very much a fringe case.

To all intents and purposes, Dumbledore is his legal guardian during the school year, and Dumbledore has a vested interest and laser focus from day one of Harry growing up a particular way with particular values, and to an extent, kept off-balance. As part of that, Harry can't be too happy on an individual level or make connections with anyone he might wish to keep on living for, as opposed to sacrificing himself to save. So while Dumbledore will permit and facilitate some closeness, e.g. with Hagrid, briefly Remus, and the Weasley family here and there, anyone with whom Harry could develop an independent relationship, who isn't in Dumbledore's pocket, or under his control, is discouraged or blocked off. /Especially/ a wildcard like Sirius.

It's possible the occlumency lessons were a distraction all along going by just canon, given that they never come up again and we aren't led to believe that Harry masters the discipline.

As for adults in general, we don't see many examples of involved parents, but it does seem that parents can get involved if they choose at Hogwarts; the prime example being, of all the parents, Lucius Malfoy. Given that we know wizarding children are more durable physically, and/or mental health seems to not be at the forefront of wizarding care practise, it's possible that it's just uncommon for parents to get involved at Hogwarts, though. Certainly none of the parents that we meet as characters, except for in exceptional circumstances like in COS, visit Hogwarts to make a complaint. Possibly this is related to the story being set at a time where Dumbledore is Headmaster, both widely known for being fair and reasonable, likely having taught many of the parents of the kids currently at Hogwarts, and due to his political positions, perhaps holding an authority that most would feel uncomfortable challenging, either from a moral or legal standpoint.
