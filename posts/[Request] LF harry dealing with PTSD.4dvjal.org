so i like to think that there are fics out there that explore this topic and do it justice. i don't think there's any doubt that harry had an abusive childhood with his aunt and uncle, and no doubt he would have to deal with the aftermath of the war and whatnot. so my question to you all is, are there any well done stories out there that are about harry coping (or not coping at all) with the effects of all the trauma he's suffered?

also if there are any recommendations on ao3 that would be awesome too, but not necessarily required! thank you so much, my friends!

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

*** Ugh this is good but now I'm a little depressed. I hope it isn't over, the last chapter I read was a harsh place for it to stop.

I also was more annoyed than I should have been by the misspellings. The mixing of breathe vs breath especially was driving me nuts.

**** Yeah it really winds me up, it just seems so odd there are a few words spelled consistently wrong. It seems so odd when the grammar is otherwise good, so I'm assuming English is not their first language or they have a strong accent or something? Idk, hope it updates soon.

** Linkffn(1754428) is a good one. Harry is in 6th year I think, and not coping well with Sirius' death.

Linkffn(2529586) starts at around age 11 and Harry has Multiple Personality Disorder. I really like this story for the first 100-200K words. After that I kind of lost interest. However, it's absolutely fantastic in how it explores his alters and Harry's work to become whole again and reabsorb the other alters. I highly recommend it.

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.
