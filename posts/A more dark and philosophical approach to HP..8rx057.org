** Self-promotion pro-tip: fanfic readers don't generally care much about the themes of a fic. And if they do, they will only care for the themes if the fic engages them on its own merits first.

If you want people to read your fic, tell them about the plot/premise, not that you want to analyse "justice, corruptness, the two sides of a man, the boundaries of morality". Those things may well be interesting, but you have to establish your credibility as a writer before people are interested in what you have to say about those things. Which means telling a story people want to read.

*** I guess I understand. But I'm not really establishing my credibility as a writer, nor am I saying that I am better than other writers for addressing these topics. I'm just giving some background information to set the ultimate goal for me as a writer, that I intended it to be a little more than "just a story."

I understand that I don't cater to majority of fanfic readers, but I just thought of introducing another approach.

I do have a plot. I just didn't want to go into too many details because I didn't want to spoil anything. Thanks, though. I really appreciate the feedback.

Having themes is pretty expected for any quality literature, even if you're writing "just a story". Having goals as a writer is great, but usually themes and story are often very tightly intertwined, and if you put themes first - that's when stuff starts to get preachy.

Sure, keep them in mind, play with them - but don't overemphasise, because that really seems pretentious. It's not about catering to your audience, it's that writing meaningful stuff is hard - and it can go really wrong.

** The word you're looking for is "themes", Taure already mentioned it. In addition to what he said:

Most fanfiction is admittedly rather light on themes, but it does have them - even in the crackiest of fics.

For example, if you look ABC there are multiple themes going on:

- Merits of ruling by birthright (Harry vs. Wizengamot)
- The cost of fighting (Voldemort, Sirius, Harry and Albus)
- Potential of good / evil in the same person, "Who am I" with Riddlebottom
- Mental decline (Voldemort vs. Riddlebottom)
- Love and its types (Harry's Mother / Harry, Lily / her family, Ginny / Harry, ...)
- ...

And that is one of the crackiest fics in the fandom, yet it explores stuff. All of the stuff I've mentioned is in more than one scene. Why does this fic do it, when others don't? Because nonjon is a good author. A Long Journey Home hit quite a lot themes (Life and its relation to Death, Loss, Guilt, Redemption, Teching, ...), albeit too briefly most of the time.

Sure, it isn't Les Miserables, that has like 20 themes going on, all culminating in one song. The themes aren't "gritty" like some DC comics, but notheless these fics have them. And saying that tbe way DC handles themes is the only way doing it is also kind of wrong, because it has to fit the story, and if you look at the fics people write and read, these themes aren't high on their list, and also clash horribly with the themes of the original work.

While Death is a major theme in the books, so is friendship, celebrity, home, bravery, and selflessness. And of course, one of the overaching themes of the series: "Love Conquers All", and the different types of love. Grimdark just doesn't go to well with a lot of them.

And I need to say one thing: Darker doesn't mean "more philosophical". While a lot of fics could do with some more themes - and more /substance/ in general - they don't need to become darker to do so.

*** Sorry. I never meant to imply that "darker" means more philosophical. I said I would include them both, but not necessarily that they are the same thing.

Not sure what ABC is. And I'm not dissing on other writers and say that they don't do that. I acknowledge that they do. But I just mean that there aren't enough of them. I kind of wanted more stories that have more deeper meanings. Like Sandman and Watchmen.

Yes, I understand that there are lots of light themes. And I understand that they are also philosophical. I'm just establishing my own approach, to let my readers know just what to expect before going in. Maybe that was the wrong thing to emphasize, I don't know. But I like to know that information if I'm going in a fanfiction.

I wanted something that establishes moral dilemmas, philosophical and controversial topics, that leave people to discuss it kind of how you can discuss the Batman's dilemma over killing the Joker or just letting him live. Like Formalism vs. Utilitarianism. Or Empiricism vs. Rationalism. I don't know how to explain it. Like how overall, the Picture of Dorian Grey basically establishes the essence of a human, from the time he can think to the time of his death.

I never said that the way DC writes is the /only/ way to handle themes. I didn't even imply it. I said I got /inspiration/ from it, and that there's a lot of good themes in it.

I'm not really /overriding/ the themes of love or bravery or selflessness. There is definitely light themes in my story. I just added in another layer to flesh out the characters some more. Just give them more challenges. Harry in my story is still noble and selfless. Ron, Dumbledore, and Hermione, they all still love him. Lily still sacrificed herself, which keeps the theme of "love" in the books. I just wanted to analyze it from a different perspective, to add another layer to it. I'm not /overriding/ it.

Yes, definitely there is not only darkness. That's what the symbol of the shadows implies.

I hope that clears up some misunderstanding.

** If you are interested, I can write up what I think is problematic or weak with your fic. I was unable to make it past chapter 8 the last time I tried to read it a few days ago. It may be helpful as I am writing something similar. I'm just not sure how harsh or deep you want me to go.

It may take a few days, if you want the review, as I am sitting in a plane that is heading towards the runway as I speak.

*** That won't be necessary, but thanks anyway. The most significant chapters right now are 7, 9, 12 and 13. So, I don't think reading to Chapter 8 would help much. Thanks.

**** -shrugs-

Just wanted to help if you want more people to get to what you define as the most important chapters (so far). Reading 7 chapters to get to the main meat is quite a commitment.

If you are ever interested in ways to improve or want someone to take a second glance, I suggest going on the discord. They are super helpful.
