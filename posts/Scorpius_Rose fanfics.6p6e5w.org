  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** I recommend [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4260581/1/Lessons-Learned][Lessons Learned]] and the other fics in the series. It's a next-gen series with a large ensemble cast and 1st person POV chapters for Rose, Lily, James, Albus, Hugo, Harry and Ginny. All of the kids are really believably "teenaged" and most of them are totally unlikeable too. Realistically, they are all rather spoiled and are very popular due to the fame of their parents.

There are a few romance plot-lines, the best and most prominent being Scorpius/Rose but I would not say they are the focus of this fic necessarily. It is more about the family dynamics with the next gen kids/cousins. IIRC though they are more the focus of the later fics in the series.

  My shrink says I repress feelings and emotions. She told me once that I have trouble “admitting reality” to myself. Now, I don't know if that's true. After all, I don't have the fancy Psychological Healing degree, do I?
