I'm flying across the country for my gramma's funeral this weekend, and will have something like 8 hours on a plane (both ways) and at least one 6-hour layover. I would love a good, long fic I could get into over that time.

Difficulty: I have ready pretty much everything on the TVTropes list, so the best-loved doorstoppers are a no-go.

I don't care about most ships (though mildly obscure pairings are fun), would prefer non-slash unless it's a really good story, and prefer characters who I can recognize as something like their canon personalities. Absolutely no HP/SS or HP/LV.

Other than that, go nuts. Give me your best shots. Impress me. Please?


** One of the better fics I've ever come across features Tom Riddle. And it's somehow /not/ a romance, which makes it a real rarity. And it's called linkffn(Little Differences by Theta Serpentis)

If you finish that one, I'd also suggest taking a look at the author's outlines at the fic's livejournal page. Although the first book is very definitely completed, the series as a whole is not and never will be. [[http://tmr-chronicles.livejournal.com/][HUGE SPOILERS if you click]].

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Hmm. You mentioned them being like their cannon personalities, so.. No Crossovers? That's kind of my area of expertise. But I might be able to recommend something else. I've read hundreds of fics and I think I might have broken a billion words by now. I even know of some websites that you never see linked that have some good fanfics.

Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

** You want long fics? I've got 3 recommendations, each over 600k words.

Technically on the TVTropes list, but mentioning it anyway because it's awesome: [[http://hpmor.com/][/Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/]], also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality][on fanfiction.net]] and discussed on its own subreddit [[/r/HPMOR]]. The premise is roughly "what if Harry was raised as a boy genius scientist and then enters a magical world where pretty much every witch and wizard is smarter than their canon counterparts?" Nearly every canon character is easily recognizable as canon-like but smarter; Harry is less like his canon counterpart (for multiple excellent in-universe reasons, including an entirely different childhood) but not cliche!Dark. If you expect its magical 11-year-olds to act like Muggle children of that age, you'll be disappointed. If you're willing to follow along with its not-remotely-normal Harry, you get a long (661k words, complete) ride that tempers a very adult sense of consequences and the unforgiving universe with being hilarious and having an uplifting message about human growth. It's not for everyone, but take the author's advice and try the first 10 chapters.

It also has /multiple complete spinoffs / continuations/, and so many fanfics that there's [[http://harrypotterfanon.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Images?file=HPMoR_Fic_Tree.svg][an updating tree of them]]. Two of the most popular:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix][/Following the Phoenix/]]: complete alternate ending, 260k words, /has its own sequel/.
- [[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html][/Significant Digits/]], also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/1/Significant-Digits][on fanfiction.net]]: very nearly complete (epilogue slated to post this weekend), 293k words.

As for things not on the TVTropes list, I've enjoyed the longer works of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel][White Squirrel]], in particular:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][/The Accidental Animagus/]]: 648k words, ongoing
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][/The Arithmancer/]] along with its direct continuation [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][/Lady Archimedes/]], which are really one story: 637k words, ongoing

Those need no special notes, so the summaries are sufficient to pitch them.

Hopefully the over 2m words here will tide you over!

*** I have read all three of those. I enjoyed HPMOR, though I'm of the "That was an enjoyable, thought-provoking read" camp rather than the "Best anything in the history of ever" camp, and may or may not be interested in continuing reading the rest of that 'verse.

To be honest, I am of the opinion that Accidental Animagus and Arithmancer/Lady Archimedes are better than HPMOR, and of course a semiregular update schedule is a blessing.

**** I'm of the opinion that Significant Digits takes HPMOR in exactly the right direction, and is generally a much more cohesive, well paced fic than HPMOR. I liked HPMOR much more for its individual moments than its overall plot or writing. SD presses all my buttons though.

#+begin_quote
  A single-/dual-point-of-departure spinoff from Less Wrong's brilliant story "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality", branching away in Chapter 81. Hermione is sent to Azkaban, but Harry is not about to give up. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like his enemy is about to leave things alone either.
