Trying to write my first ever FanFic EVER. Would appreciate any constructive criticism or feedback!

Here it is; hope you enjoy!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10672225/1/Bringing-Hope-to-Hogwarts]]

Also, anybody else, feel free to post your own stories in the comments, lets all share some aspiring writer love!

#+begin_quote
  "I don't think I'll ever be ready." She replied.
#+end_quote

This states that someone says "I don't think I'll ever be ready." Subsequently, as a separate action, she replied. You want:

#+begin_quote
  "I don't think I'll ever be ready," she replied.
#+end_quote

You have this problem throughout.

Note that this doesn't apply to every sentence adjacent to a quote:

#+begin_quote
  He shrugged loosely. "I was a Hufflepuff."
#+end_quote

This is correct because this describes two actions, probably performed successively.

#+begin_quote
  Meena
#+end_quote

This is a feminine given name in the set of cultures with a strong Sanskrit influence. Do you intend for this character to be Indian? If so, more power to you. If not, you probably want the character to be named "Mina" -- it's used in Persian, Pashto, and Korean, as well as being a shortened form of some European names.

("Meena" is also an uncommon transcription of a Coptic given name for men. I somehow doubt that applies here.)

#+begin_quote
  'Sorry, Duke' Meena mumbled
#+end_quote

Be consistent in quote style. If you want to use double quotes, use double quotes here.

#+begin_quote
  'Hey! 'Yuh don' 'appen...
#+end_quote

Double quotes. Don't include an apostrophe before "yuh" unless the original word was "hyuh" or something.

#+begin_quote
  "She looks like an angel."
#+end_quote

Warning signs going off. Meena is no doubt special in several other ways and going to be popular among most people and those who dislike her clearly won't do so on her own merits and she'll unite the Houses and if she ever makes a mistake it won't be avoidable and...

#+begin_quote
  Child of the Stars
#+end_quote

Yep.

#+begin_quote
  Draco crushing on her
#+end_quote

Double yep.

#+begin_quote
  Pansy being jealous
#+end_quote

Totally.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione feeling threatened
#+end_quote

Noticing a trend?

#+begin_quote
  perfect Draught of the Living Death
#+end_quote

A Hogwarts education isn't worth much, it seems.

You have a character whose appearance is striking, probably attractive. She's fated to be special. She makes Pansy jealous -- not her fault! -- and Draco horny. Her knowledge rivals Granger's. Her potions ability is exceptional. This character is too superlative. Give her more disadvantages. Take away some of her advantages.

She has white hair. This isn't common for humans. Her fellow Slytherins should shun her as having creature blood. (Hagrid might feel closer to her for the same reason.)

She's a transfer student. She doesn't know anyone, and everyone has formed cliques already. She should feel lonely.

She left Durmstrang. She should be contrasting Hogwarts and Durmstrang more. She should miss something about Durmstrang, or else have some signs of emotional damage from her time there.

A standard formulation for a three-act story, as coined by our French friends in the 1880s, is:

Act 1: chase your character up a tree.

Act 2: throw rocks at them.

Act 3: get them down.

I see no signs that Meena will have any problems aside from people being jealous of her. And that's not an interesting story to read.

*** Thanks for your input, you're the first person to do so in depth! I thank you for your CC (Rather then just being mean), so thanks for that. I understand what you're saying on most points, i just didn't notice it before as this is my first fic ever, so i'm still learning - even with things like grammar, it would seem, ahah! Thank you again for all your points, i've taken note of each and shall try to incorporate a more believable character in the future :D Thank youuuu
