I've been reading a lot of fics lately where Harry goes dark to win the war, and kills a lot of people. I totally agree with this as a strategy to win, but reading it so much has made it a bit stale, so I thought I'd petition you guys for fics where Harry is very hesitant to kill, and tries very hard to not cause any death. This is probably very rare, but the idea of a Powerful!Harry who is quite good at magic taking down his opponents non-lethally is fascinating and very novel in this tropey fandom.

I hope you can help me out and rec me some fics! Thank you!


** Plot twist: Harry is anti-killing, but accidents always seem to happen to other people... Final Destination-like "accidents".

(aka in which Death likes to troll the living by unseeingly slumming it in Harry's home and becoming inspired by the Final Destination films on the muggle TV).

***** I agree the intro blurbs are corny. However, once you get farther in the fic, Harry escapes from Britain and goes to study at a new magic school in Canada. the fic introduces concepts like blood magic, string magic, and many forms new disciplines of magic. These are really awe inspiring cases of power, and the fic is one of the foremost in the field of introducing new magic in Fanfiction, it's seriously awesome. Once you get introduced to Harry's new friend group, the writing really shines and the characters feel very plausible. If it's not for you, that it's not for you, no pressure to read it. But I think if you push through some of the initial cringe you'll end up really liking it.

It's a sad state of affairs for the fandom as a whole right now, but people like him have actual conniptions if you tell them that some writers have Harry doing other people besides Ginny Weasley, in strict missionary position of course, till his dying day.

******* I don't want to be downvoted either but whatever. You are absolutely 100% correct. There is a fascinating story arc in the middle of Manacled that looks at how dirty war is, and how Harry refuses to lower his ideals and refuses to kill Death Eaters. This creates massive tension in the Order of the Phoenix between those that side with Harry and those that side with Kingsley and Hermione. It's one of my favourite parts of the fic.

******** It's unequivocally the best one. It's incredible how the reader is given an actual first hand account for how painful the opening of the fic is for the High Reeve because EVERY SINGLE TIME the protagonist Saids something to him that she's already said before but can't remember, it HURTS. And that's how the High Reeve must have felt for the first 100,000 words.

Gushing about Manacled aside, it doesn't present Harry in a negative light. It's supposed to be a realistic canon divergence on how Harry would lead the order in a world where Dumbledore died months before he did canonically, and they more or less deify him and his ideals as a bulwark against Voldemort. Harry is also being actively lied to by Kingsley and Hermione, and he makes the BEST choices he can with the information he's given. It's why I offered it as a suggestion, he's not being bashed in the fic, he's a tragic character.

**** Oh, i'm sorry- you thought you could engage in a shooting war with the standing orders of “take only prisoners,” and there wouldn't be drawbacks? It features an above- canon Harry that never goes dark in his pursuit of victory.

I'm sorry that doesn't end the way you think it does. But DOES fit with what OP asked for. It's just not the #indyharry trope you thought was going to be recced here.

*** Loook boss, I get what you're getting at here, but I've read canon two times, and I've specifically asked for fanfiction where he is a pacifist, which while it may've been a theme in canon, is not very common in Fanfic. I don't want to take this out on you but replying to request threads with Canon helps absolutely-fucking no one.
