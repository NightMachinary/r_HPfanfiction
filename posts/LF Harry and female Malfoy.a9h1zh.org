Just read this: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12660172/1/A-Life-Twice-Lived]]

And was surprised of how good I found it and was wondering if there were more similar stories out there.

Can be (fem/Draco, Draco's sister, Narcissa, etc.)


** Is this fic finished?

  The walls of Hogwarts hold many secrets, some of them benign and some rooted in a deep, dark past. When Harry stumbles upon the latter, his life and soul are shattered, leading him down a path of power, destruction, and sex. A Dark!Harry, Possessed!Harry, Harry/Harem story. Rated M.

  What if Harry had a twin sister, someone who grew up with him as they ventured through life together, instead of him facing the world by himself. And Malfoy has a sister as well, which makes life even more chaotic. Sequel to Battle of Wills, with AU elements. Story begins with Harry's 4th year. Harry/OC/OC/Fleur. Warning: wincest, BDSM, harem.
