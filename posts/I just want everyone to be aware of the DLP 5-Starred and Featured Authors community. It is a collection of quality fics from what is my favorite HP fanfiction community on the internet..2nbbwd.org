** Its from [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][these]] guys. They are kind of annoying, but there is a ton of FF and discussion there. Way more active than this sub.

*** Can you tell me what part of the fourm is annoying? I want to preface our conversation with I am not trying to start an argument(just in case you had a really bad time there). I see that a lot on fanfiction.net as well and I am wondering what has happened to make a lot of people bitter. I have been there and it just seems like a normal message board to me. Apart from the high amount of quality fiction.

**** I like the forum, but I still realize there are quite a few problems with it. They are a strong echo-chamber of various ideas, and so help you if you go against them. They are also fairly vitriolic in their disagreements. Additionally they have a heavy emphasis on darker aspects of FF, lighter fluffy ones are much rarer. Possibly due to there being less good ones, or the aforementioned biases.

So while they can be a good gauge of quality, I take anything said there with a heavy pinch of salt.

Eh, that's just DLP. 99% of the time it's not even said seriously. I've been a member since '08, lurked for a few years before that every once in a while.

Also, I would definitely say that while part of the reputation might have been earned (and a larger part came from butthurt writers), most of the members have grown up. DLP isn't nearly the same DLP that it was when it started and it isn't the same DLP that I joined in 2008. People are whole lot more mellow now than they used to be.

****** I only go when I get super bored and go to the recs of various forms. It has been about 3 or so years since I went there with any regularity.

But either way, just because they are offhandedly assholes doesn't prevent them from being assholes.

******* I agree. The fanfiction is in my opinion the best on the web. However rude is rude. It can sometimes be a little silly.

** Well it is one of the largest HP fanfiction community currently on FF.net so most people already know it I think.

** Yes, the standard of fics found at DLP is top notch, and the feedback/critique on fics posted - even the less than brilliant ones - is also really good.
