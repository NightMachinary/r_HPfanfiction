Alright, this is...a very old fanfic that I can't remember even where I read it. However, after suddenly remembering it, I'm rather desperate to read it again.

At some point about ten years ago or so, those quiz sites used to be really popular. And occasionally, you'd get works of fanfic on them. This was one of them.

It was primarily about the writer's OC (likely a self-insert) and Sirius Black. It started with their first year of Hogwarts. I can't remember any shenanigans from there, only that the author wrote another OC in to become Lupin's love interest.

What I do remember is that the two others became part of the Order. Sirius and the OC moved in together. Sirius got the flying bike as a birthday or Christmas present. The OC that was with Lupin was killed. I distinctly remember a scene where they all went to an Easter Egg Hunt with very young Ron and Harry, with Harry bringing the OC an egg (as this OC had become his godmother). Mostly, events in the story happened as those in the book did. Eventually, the OC became a teacher at Hogwarts and met Harry after many years.

That's about all I remember. I enjoyed it a lot and while it may not have...held up, exactly, I'd love to find it again.
