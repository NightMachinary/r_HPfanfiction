** Nope. Even without Hermione, I can't see Ron in a bachelor pad with no job. That's the part that sticks out to me. Ron always craved some success. Success was his greatest desire. He wasn't willing to put in Hermione's level of effort but he did well enough. There's no way he'd be okay having absolutely nothing to show for himself. He also wouldn't be okay having no job because of the money problems his family had. I can imagine him pleased with every paycheck.

As for the divorce, it's possible but I'd rather they didn't go there. They can go to muggle marriage counseling. They can even separate for a bit (Ron can live in his bachelor pad) and come back together. They can /want/ to separate but try something else for the kids. Adults can relate to that stuff too.

*** Those are very good points. The only little change I'd make is though I agree Ron desired success I don't remember seeing much evidence that he would work hard for something if it didn't totally interest him. Quidditch he worked hard at. Schoolwork, politics, not so much.

**** True, but that limited focus is pretty normal. Hermione was the only one to work hard and achieve good results in multiple subjects. Fred, George, and Harry all had their own areas of interest and they succeeded in them.

Ron expressed some interest in being an auror in OoTP. In HBP, it's revealed he did well enough to get into the required classes. No matter his attitude about school, he put in the work. If chaos hadn't broken out, it's entirely possible Ron would have continued into the auror program after he graduated.

I think Ron is lazier in reputation than he is in reality.

We've seen Ron study and we've seen him do his homework, he just procrastinate like a normal teenager.

The problem is Ron's school performance is used to make Harry's school performance /look better/. Because every time Harry looks at Ron's performance (or another classmate) it's always worse, (except for Hermione, of course) even if it looks equal Harry will then quickly note that his performance is a little bit better. (e.g. Harry notes his needle is a little bit pointier.)

****** And there's also the fact that Ron had started with a wand that wasn't in quite the best condition. That might have made it more difficult for him to get his spells to work fully compared to his peers, and after second year he would have been used to it just being a thing and thus not trying his very best there normally.

Not to mention that as far as Harry's practical ability to cast goes, he's an EE student at the very least, so Ron being below---if he truly is---doesn't really mean all that much. I mean, it's like saying that someone who's doing worse than an A- student is doing badly, which doesn't necessarily have to be the case.

** /sigh/ I'm so sick of having to explain this.

Rowling never claimed to regret pairing Ron/Hermione together. She merely said that she wrote them as wish fulfilment. And Rupert has defended Romione many times and clearly wasn't being entirely serious there. None of them were.

Anyway, I do kind of like the idea of how a trio adventure with a broken up couple included would go, but seeing as at least half of fanfics end up with an end game pairing, it would be very easy to ruin.

I don't pay much attention to Rowling's line about them needing counselling, because she says it as such an offhand remark, it's not really worth paying attention to. That's why I'm glad I'm not famous, because nowadays, famous people can't talk about buying new socks without fans judging them for it or expecting some deep explanation behind it.

As for the whole line about too much fundamental incompatibility...... Ok, ya got me on that one. I don't agree with it, but she clearly meant what she said there. Although I find it weird that she said that, when in some other interview she was the one who explained why they worked.

Those arguments were taken completely out of context and even if the article (or whatever it was) said what those fans want it to say... all it was saying was that Harry might have been a better match for Hermione. Not that Hermione was good for Harry and not that Ginny and Harry aren't good together. But none of that matter anyway because like I said, what JKR said was taken totally out of context. I just wish people would stop trying to throw it others faces as justification for their opinions. Everyone is entitled to their opinions... just don't provide fake evidence to support it. Rant over.

Apparently, (and I have no available source for this right now) Harry and Ginny were the only confirmed soulmates by JKR in the whole series. But nah, let's ignore all the evidence in the books about Harry and Hermione having zero interest in each other, and Weasley-bash based on an out of context misquote.

*** Hmm. I see where you're coming from. "Regret" was a strong word. From the interview she said she wrote them together because of wish fulfillment and not because it worked from a literary point of view. You're right, she likely still steadfastly defends the relationship but I think she's also admitting there was a lot of "hand of God" in getting these two together. In the full interview she gave, it still defends my point which is that the two still weren't compatible as adults even if it would have been nice for her to see the two together. It would have required hard work like any marriage.

I believe it meant that as the characters had been written and developed, they weren't ready, and jumped into marriage like many high school and even college sweethearts do.

Rupert picked up on this. While the rest of his interview was very lighthearted I think he said the initial "headline creator" (that the two wouldn't work out well) in earnest. As he knew the character, he also recognized they weren't ready.

Anyways I don't mean to create a flame war. It was inevitable based on what I posted sadly. But I think it's necessary to point out that a lot of post seventh year / post epilogue fanfics may need to address the relationship because as it stands it's a little shaky in credibility based on character studies alone. There's too little middle-aged adult realism and I wanted to draw some focus there. A little wish fulfillment of my own on a children's book I guess haha.

**** To be fair, though, /wish fulfilment/ can also mean that however good as a couple they would be she simply paired them together without much care for how they could have gotten together. So it doesn't necessarily mean they'd be miserable or anything, and if they worked on it they might actually make a good couple. But people like to take statements like this one too far.

And just to make it clear, I don't particularly care about pairings, and honestly I don't know what I am doing in this thread ... oh, wait, I'm here because the page it linked to didn't want to load for me for whatever reason and I won't let some website defeat me.

"It was a young relationship. I think the attraction itself is plausible but the combative side of it... I'm not sure you could have got over that in an adult relationship, there was too much fundamental incompatibility."

I think shippers on both sides see what they want to. RHr see the interview as an exaggeration. HHr see it as evidence that their ship is real and RHr is dead. Neither of these was true, based on what Rowling actually said.

** I always thought it was kind of awkward to have the two people who always bicker with one another end up together forever... It's cute at first, but there's always a serious underlying reason for the quarrels, isn't there? And they never really seem to work it out afterwards. From my personal experience,* I don't feel like it would work out in the long run. I think they're always going to have some of the same arguments, but in 19 years, I suppose they could have worked a lot of things out. We didn't really see that part of their relationship, after all.

However, knowing Hermione, I feel that she will have certain expectations that Ron may never meet. She might try and give it some time so see if he'll grow with her, but I don't see it happening all the time (or as much as she would like). And I don't want to bash Ron. I see him as a very dedicated and loving partner and father, but I think, realistically (had JKR not written in their relationship as "wish fulfillment"), they would have had a good run a few years after the war, but then broken it off before marriage and kids.

****** No problem, mate ;)

I agree that Sturgeon's Law applies to all pairings. However, it seems that there is a greater proportion of bad stories in the H/Hr pairing than others. The vast majority of the stories either butcher the characters (Hermionesue, bashing, etc) or are in the form of wish fulfillment (robst). I honestly can't list ten H/Hr fics that I could proudly recommend to friends as well written in an objective standpoint. Which is really sad because I feel that H/Hr has the potential to have some really good fics.

The reason I can't stand most H/Hr stories is because there's no development in the characters. The vast majority more or less come in the form of "Harry and Hermione are perfect couples who realize that they've been in love all along and together rule the galaxy as Mary Sue and Gary Stu." The problem, of course, is that in canon, Harry found Hermione's work ethic annoying as much as Ron did and that they fought in various circumstances as well (Firebolt, HBP book, debate on Deathly Hallows).

Another thing is that most H/Hr stories are focused primarily on Romance. I feel like this is a backlash of H/Hr fans from 1) as you said, canon cuckolds, and 2) bitterness that came from "losing" the shipping war. I feel that so many H/Hr stories are about proving/justifying the pairing that the authors often lose focus on important aspects of their stories such as characterization, pacing, plot progression, etc. Pairin, in my opinion, should be an aspect of a story, not the primary focus. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find many good stories that do that, which is why I prefer stories that have good Harry/Hermione friendship (such as Stages of Hope, The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks, What Lies Beneath, etc).

lol, sorry for the rant. I have a tendency of doing so :P

I would like to ask, though, since you are a H/Hr supporter and obviously an intelligent poster/reader, what H/Hr stories have you found to be the "best of"? I would like some good H/Hr recommendations for once.

These are good points. I would have rather seen JKR focus on the academically driven Harry from early PS who started reading his books before classes even started, but there are fewer opportunities for conflict in such a one-dimensional character. Making Harry a braniac would also have rendered Hermione's cleverness pointless. As far as the conflicts you mentioned... I think those have less to do with personality traits and more with the author's desire to move her plot in a particular direction. In my opinion, the Firebolt incident was written to delay Hermione's knowledge of Lupin's lycanthropy until the final confrontation in the Shrieking Shack. I can't excuse the other two instances you mention because by that point in the original series I mostly stopped caring what happened to the protagonists.

Definitely. I think the epilogue is the only place for a perfectly happy (or even bittersweet) protagonist. The /journey/ to get there is what makes the story fun to read. When the authors immediately have Harry find his one twoo wuv soulmate in the first chapter in a story labelled 'Romance,' there is absolutely /no/ conflict left. Who wants to read 100K words of epilogue?

I really like the work from Stanrick and Lorien829 but probably couldn't pick a favourite from either one of them.

Stanrick tends to be verbose in a manner not usually found in fanfiction and this has some interesting effects on his characterizations, particularly where Harry is concerned. He's intelligent, but no more academically driven than his canon counterpart. In linkffn(Thresholds by Stanrick) neither Harry nor Hermione are cursed with many of the faults brought on by adolescence, but I think the story is quite strong anyway. The characters make several references to important works in original fiction, which I think is quite satisfying, but others think breaks HP lore. I looked through the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=14917][DLP Rejected Submissions Thread]] and didn't find any mention of his work there, so it's possible the stories have slipped under their radar. His newer work linkffn(Favorite Things by Stanrick) is quite original and has one of the better slow-building romances I've read. There's very little angst, though, so if you enjoy fraught romantic tension that probably won't be up your alley.

Lorien829 is frequently recommended on the subreddit, but I think linkffn(Resistance by Lorien829) tends to put the romance a bit further ahead than the plot and the story is weaker than it should be. The [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=3942][DLP Thread]] is full of posters who have rated it 1/5 and 2/5 without reading it, so their opinion is worth less than nothing (as usual). linkffn(Shadow Walks by Lorien829) does a better job of keeping the mystery and suspense separate from the will-they-or-won't-they cliche. It took me ages to read this one because I find song lyrics at the beginning of a story to be an instant turn off, but it's good despite this.

linkffn(Screams Part One by clonserpents) is one of the best H/Hr series. [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=5922][DLP]] included the first in their C2, making it one of the only H/Hr stories I know to earn that distinction.

If you have any personal favourites I'd love to read them.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

  Most of the really vicious 'Harmonian' behaviour, though, was in response to the smugness from canon cuckolds like Melissa Anelli and Emerson Spartz.
#+end_quote

I disagree. 10+ years after that infamous interview, you still have the same old Weasley bashing and people who think that the canon couples are morally unworthy, that there is so much evidence for Harmony and that they are the true love. Even before that interview was released you still had Harmonians complaining and writing letters to JKR.

And Spartz was talking about those who saw what they wanted to see and called everyone else blind. Not those who enjoyed it as a fanon pairing. That may not have been clear in the original interview, but it was clear afterwards.

I mean, there wasn't that kind of interview about the Snily ship, and yet you do have "Snilians" who complain about Lily "choosing" James. And big stuff happened there too, remember the whole "Snapewives" wank? Anyway, this is because the Harmony ship and the Snily ship view themselves as direct competition to the canon ships, even though both are fanon ships, so of course they will be more militant. You won't have this problem with ships such as Ginny/Luna or Seamus/Dean +(something happened there I'm sure)+, even though both are also just as fanon as Harmony or Snily.

  The simple truth is that no pairing is immune from Sturgeon's law.
#+end_quote

I agree that it applies to all pairings. But it applies the most to Dramione. I mean, the appeal of the "Bad boy/Good girl" relationships is extremely strong. You can include Drarry as well in there. And I'm pretty sure a good part of it is due to Tom Felton.

I think that makes all the difference. Anyone can claim they were being misinterpreted after the fact, but Emerson's and Melissa's comments were deliberately callous. You can't walk back "delusional militant lunatic." Emerson had the opportunity to draw the distinction between the vitriolic 'Harmonian' elements who assumed canon H/Hr in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary and those who simply expressed a /preference/, but he didn't do that. It's immaterial, though. He's entitled to his opinion just as anyone else is. Emerson's decision to be crude doesn't give anyone else license to be uncivil.

The larger problem is that of representation. The Leaky Cauldron and Muggle.net bill themselves as representing the entire fandom, not just the canon enthusiasts with a grudge against non-canon pairings. That clearly wasn't the case.

******** In the original interview, no one used the word lunatic seriously, and militant was used to describe the online fandom as a whole, not just H/Hr shippers. Even before that interview JKR used a similar word to describe the ship debates.

Anyway, sometimes things can get out of hand when you're in a state of laughter and not thinking completely coherently. It appears that he's saying that everyone shipping H/Hr is delusional - but he did apologize for that and clarified his comments.

Not back then no. They made clear that the official line was R/Hr. There may still be a bias now, but it has mellowed down. Right now they are more representative of the fandom.

Not to mention that his opinion is probably based mostly on the movies, which degraded Ron and upgraded Hermione.
