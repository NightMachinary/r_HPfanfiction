I've written two crossovers of my own where Harry learns another kind of magic from the other fandom's canon and I'm looking for more. Any fandom, any rating, any pairing. Preferrably set during the series and before the epilogue.


** It's only a one-shot, but there's a cross-over with Harry learning another kind of magic here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8527691/8/An-Incomplete-Potter-Collection]]

In case the link weirds out, it's the eight chapter that matters.

** I highly recommend Linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) and its sequels, it fits what you're talking about and is one of the best HP fanfics I've ever read.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11898648/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Rune-Stone-Path][Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path]] has Harry learning runes, I can't remember how in depth the fanfic goes into describing how runes work though.

*** I have a generic question regarding these types of fics, when you have a multi-pairing like that does it mean several separate relationships over the course of the fic or a harem?

**** Honestly, I don't know. It seems to vary by author and story. This one specifically I'm not sure of, I'm a bit behind on it, so far I haven't seen any relationships.

Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way!

** Try linkffn(school spirit by story envy;Retsu's Folly). Those are awesome, but sadly the first isn't finished and it is in limbo.
