** The common stupid decisions in hp fanfics

Harry suddenly gets betrayed by his friends and housemate (Notably most of the time happening in gof and a few of the times on dh or cos ) his personality changes onto some 25-year-old dude in a teen body. Also some boring love story with Daphne or susan (Rare case Ginny or pansy)

Ron and Hermione as usually portrayed as an asshole duo so do the entire Weasley family (Minus Arthur and the twins with Charlie and Bill and ginny if it is hinny fic ). Goblins becoming his greatest ally revealing he has trillions of money and things like potter manor in the wizarding world (A wizarding version of jeff Bezos right here pals )

Oh somehow he is connected with blacks due to Charlus and dorea as his grandparents (Which is debunked badly by the author herself and Charlus is also not listed on Pottermore in the Potter family treeline but fanfic writers unlimited fanfic plot point is based on it ) he becomes lord black and lord potter. Alice Longbottom is his godmother and lily bff (Where canon never establishes they were familiar or was in the same batch and same house with Marauders and to think if Alice was her godmother and grand Longbottom let the kid go away to the awful Dursleys and here comes dark lord Dumbledore) Dumbledore is a manipulative bastard who was responsible for all misery and events in Harry's life to train him as a weapon to destroy voldie. Goblin traces Horcrux in him they team up to destroy the Horcrux and in a few months Horcrux and voldie both get killed by a superpower magical mutant Harry Potter. Also, he becomes some top level guy like the head of wizgenmont and going too far to become a mom or headmaster of Hogwarts also only at the age of 14 or 15. Our 14 or 15 years old harry is a disguised 25-year-old Frank Underwood (Even his political tactics will make him shame ) In the end, harry gets the girl who lives a super-rich life,Pettigrew, dumby, Molly, Ron, etc lives Azkaban for the rest of the life, and Hermione gets kicked out by the wizarding world for messing with lord hardian black potter peviral gaunt bullshit. Harry somehow destroys the entire Malfoy family with his magical powers making them bankrupt and ends the marriage of mama and papa Malfoy and making Draco his house-elf.

Luna Neville Weasley twins and Dobby is portrayed as a nice guy's who is on Harry's side as his new comrades. In the end, every time Neville and luna get married (Dh part 2 results lol ).

Amelia bones is actually the biggest ally of Harry here and his greatest friend (In canon she is just another ministry person for Harry)

Canon Harry needs to bitchslap this lord hardian black potter peverial gaunt Slytherin Ravenclaw Gryffindor asshole.
