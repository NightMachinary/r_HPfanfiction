** "Potter, you need to cut loose ends! Being Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin is hard enough as it is, but you need skills. Skills finger boy and know-it-all Granger have no clue on. I can help you with those skills!"

"No"

"HARRY DUD YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLUT OF FYRE!?? HAERRRY! IF YOU DID YOU CAN LEGALLY BECOME AN ADULT AND TAKE CONTROL OVER YOUR LIFE, GET BACk AT THE OLD COOT!"

"The old coot...? And stop shouting your words are slurring."

"ITS DUMBASSDOOR HARRY! CANT YOU SEE, DUMBLEDORK HAS BEEN STRATEGICALLY USING YOU AS HIS PAWN TO SECRETLY GET YOUR MONEY LIKE THE SCALLYWAG HE IS! YOUR FRIENDS ARE IN ON IT AS WELL, AND MY FATHER IS PLANNING TO SELL ME SO TAKE ME HARRY RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW!"

"Who-Who even are you?"

"OH NO! HARRY YOU HAVE BEEN OBLIVIATED, THE BOURGEOISIE STATE RUN BY FUDGE HAS TEAMED WITH DUMBLEDORE, IM AFRAID I MUST STRIP TO JOG YOUR MEMORIES, HPPEFULLY THEN WE CAN TAkE THE WIZGAMONT WITH YOUR 100 SEATS AND SHOW MALFOY WHO IS BIGGER!"

"What are you on about?"

Before Daphne replies Hermione and Ron enter and lead Harry away from the ward. A trip to get coffee in Saint Mungis led them here, in addition to Lockheart and Nevilles parents one Daphne Greengrass was in the permanent ward. That apparently is the "curse" of the Greengrass Clan..

** Daphne: You refusing to shake Draco' s hand is a grave insult. Has your ethiquette tutor thought you nothing?

Harry: Draco calling Hermione is a mudblood is a grave insult, why would I want to be friends with the bigot that decided he's my nemesis because I didn't shake his hand.

Daphne: Granger? Have you not noticed how condescending she is? When a professor ask questions she raises her hand, she's saying she's better than all of us and is the only one that can answer the question.

Harry: It really isn't that deep.

Daphne: Perhaps, but how do you explain how much effort she puts into her homework? When she writes essays longer than the professor tells us to, she's actually saying she doesn't respect the professors time.

Harry: I don't know, if the professors minded they would put a limit on the essay length instead of giving her O's and calling her the brightest witch of our age.

Daphne: At least she isn't as bad as Weasley, don't you see how he's holding you down? He's making you spend time playing exploding snap and wizarding chess.

Harry: I don't generally make friends by looking at what they have to offer. He's my friend because he's fun to be around.

*** I'll give it an A (on the A-F scale.)

Sorry, had to deduct the plus because of the brightest witch of our age.

Would have been nice to make fun of Daphne more though.

I enjoyed it though!

***** This!

One somewhat biased compliment, and people think she's a prodigy than just a very talented, above-average at best witch.

Hell, a lot of what Hermione does in later books? Upper-years, especially Ravenclaws, probably do shit like that all the time.

I wonder if there are fics out there that have this as a plot-point?

******* She didn't reverse engineer the dark mark... She got an idea from Harry's recollection to see if something similar can be made, and found the Protean charm. Protean charm was a well known spell taught to NEWT students, so kudos to her for learning it in 5th year, but that's about it.

Malfoy did the same thing a year later to communicate with imperiused Rosmerta.
