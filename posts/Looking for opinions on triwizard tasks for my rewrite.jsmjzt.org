So I have began writing my own fanfic that will be canon rewrite for years 4-7.

I'm wondering what kind of tasks you guys think would be cool for tasks 1 and 2.

Currently, I'm wanting to bring the international dueling circuit to hogwarts for the first task, with participants earning their task points based on how well they do in the IDC tournament. I liked this idea because I have read very few fanfics that bring dueling into the fics outside of mentioning flitwick as a master dueler, so I think this could be a cool approach to the 1st task but I would like opinions.

For task 2, I'll admit I'm not sure what another cool task could be, right now, I'm just planning my own variation of the lake task, but I'd much rather bring in a new 2nd task rather than do the same thing so many other rewrites do which is just edit the 2nd task. So, with that said, what are some things you all might want to see done for a 2nd task.


** I think you really should inspire in canon. Dueling is good, but it doesn't have the scale and uncommonness of the tournament's tasks.

So first a dragon and second the lake. They work really well. One a magical beast, another a course they need to beat to get a prize, with a certain riddle to it. Fire and water. One fixed place compared to the length of the lake. Sheer skill and knowing your magical beasts, compared to a task aimed at testing your resourcefulness.

So maybe you can play with those ideas, what made the dragon and lake work and how can you test the participants in a similar way.

*** Hmph. Ok. Maybe I can find another way to bring the dueling circuit into the book, because that's one thing I want to explore since nobody else really does.

**** You could just have it as something Bagman thought up to bring in more spectators. "And a special treat for you all, a little 'extra event', if you please, our Champions will - with permission from the IDC (international duelling circuit) - fight for your amusement!"

***** That would be cool! Not a bad idea, I'll think on this. Maybe use it as a precurse to the first task, or as you said an extra event maybe between the 2nd and 3rd tasks

****** Yeah. There is precedence for extra shit being stuck in, considering the Yule Ball. It'd make sense to make the Tournament more of a display production - if I'd've been organising it, there'd definitely've been a Fair event for British Merchants to sell their wares to students of the three schools and their families (who'd've been invited to visit for some of the tasks and events, at least).

** I mean, I think it's a good idea to bring duelling into the triwizard tournament but I'm not sure what you mean by very few fics. I've read multiple fics where duelling is a part of the triwizard tournament, so many I don't even remember them all.

I would do a survival challenge for one of the tasks. Toss your champions in the forbidden forest. They're allowed to sabotage and attack one another. Winner is either last man standing or the one with the most points. Points are given based on the judge's judgements on champion performance. This might include charming a campsite, subduing magical creatures, finding a way out, etc.

*** Ohh kind of a hunger games type of event. That sounds really cool! I might actually use this if you don't mind.

And hm, I haven't come by a lot of fanfics with dueling in them, well not dueling as in actual DUELING. They all have fight scenes but not orchistrated duels But maybe that's because I tend to stay in the more relationship focused fanfics

** I don't have any specific suggestions for tasks for you, I'm afraid, but I do have a sort of pattern I tend to use while writing challenges for D&D games. The thing you've gotta remember about the Tournament is that it's both a test and a display. You want to challenge your participants and get them to demonstrate their skills in front of an audience, right? It's not a specific rule of design or anything, but it's good to keep in mind.

So, first you have to decide what you wanna test.

You could make it physical (test of fitness or adroitness), magical (cast a big spell or solve a problem with magic), technical (in a sense of requiring specialist interaction or knowledge, not electrical engineering, eg. having to make a potion), logical (riddles or logic-puzzles), intuitive (poker-game type thinking), artistic (maybe poetry writing or interpretive dance as part of a ritual), chance (playing with probability or games of chance, or some kind of Leap of Faith choice), willpower/stamina (how long you can do a thing), emotional literacy (knowing what you're feeling and dealing with it properly, eg. with Dementors), an arcane test of mind/belief (think the Gate from D&D: Scourge of Worlds or the Grail from Indiana Jones), preparation (like the Golem thing in The Lie I've Lived), intellectual (needing to have read a thing or studied a thing to complete it, eg. Norse Poetry has these metaphor/rhyming-slang things called 'Kennings' that you'd not get without knowledge of the myth they represented, like 'Otters Ransom' meaning Gold after a myth in which a sum of gold was paid after Loki killed an Otter brother of some dwarves), creative (having to make something to impress a judge), morality (doing what's right even when everything is telling you to do something else), etc.

Second, you look at specific characteristics and structure.

Think about whether a task should be cooperative, person vs. environment (fight through a place to get somewhere/thing), a gated competition (do this to get to the next bit!), speed-trial/race, person vs. person (duelling), randomised (one person gets a Dragon, the other gets a mermaid, or wind and water, etc), with tools or without, blind/double-blind participants, etc.

Neither of those lists are limited ones, incidentally. You can take whatever options you like, even if they aren't there, the list is just a cross-section.

Either way, once you have the thing you wanna test and the extra features you wanna have, it makes it a lot easier to design specific tasks to test those things. :)

** In my mind, the Triwizard Tournament follows the hero's labors trope that it's so often found in fantasy tales. Probably the most famous are Hercules' twelve labors which all involved either killing a monster, bringing a treasure or accomplishing some sort of work that is considered impossible for a human in the allotted time, all while giving the audience a demonstration of strength, wits, charm, integrity.

For example you could have a Potion based tournament. The first task would involve answering a riddle (in the form of a scavenger hunt) that tells you what potion each champion has to brew. Each potion might contain one or more rare ingredients that have to be retrieved from a dangerous place such as the Quintapeds' Island (maybe that's a little too extreme though based on their description in Fantastic Beasts but you get the idea). That could be the second task. The final task would be brewing this really time consuming and complicated potion within an allotted time. It could even be presented in a similar fashion to cooking shows. The one who gets the best marks for the potion wins the cup. I would also add a tie-breaker task if two candidates get the same amount of points as a duel between them.

Edit: I also think that tasks should be interconnected because it gives the champions motivation to perform well in all of them. In GoF the only advantage of performing well in the first two tasks was to enter earlier in the maze but since Harry crossed paths with Fleur, it seems that had it not been for Crouch, being the first or the last in terms of points wouldn't have made a difference.
