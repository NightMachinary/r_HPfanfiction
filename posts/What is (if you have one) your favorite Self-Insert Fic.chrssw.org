I agree with the general sentiment that many Self Inserts are unbelievably cringy.

But after finishing linkffn(A Curse of Truth) I'm interested in finding more.

Despite it's flaws of a few cliches and less-than believable constant hyperbolic banter/flirting. *inhale*

it's still a solid story. Check it out!

Please recommend me a diamond from the dollar store jewelry box.

That ending though. I cry every time. ;(

*** Yes. This one is hilarious and fun, especially how one second she's the mature thirty year old in an eleven year old body, and the next she's fucking casting rainbows all over the dorm room.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

***** I have to admit that I dropped it right when she started getting one on one tutoring from Dumbledore at age 5 AND could read auras and see the future. It just seemed too out there. One of those aspects by themselves would be a hard sell, but all of them at once was too much.

****** Yeah there's also lords and ancient houses stuff and characters talk too much about how perfect the SI is, all of which I normally hate. But for whatever reason this fic works for me; I'd encourage you to try to get through at least the end of year 1 of Hogwarts before giving up.

** My favorite is the Perks of Survival: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/]]

Guy suddenly ends up in the body of Sally Anne Perks and is obsessed with her mysterious disappearance sometime before year 5. The SI spends most of her time just being a regular person and avoiding the plot in Slytherin. Ironically, the story abruptly stops right before year 5...

I like Echoes too. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11763334/1/Echoes]])
