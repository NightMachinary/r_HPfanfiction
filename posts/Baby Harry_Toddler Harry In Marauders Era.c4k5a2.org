** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

A bit weird time travel, starts with 8yo Harry making a wish, which travels back in time to before Harry was even born and changes a few details, which butterfly effect out into Harry getting rescued from the Dursleys the day after the wish.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
