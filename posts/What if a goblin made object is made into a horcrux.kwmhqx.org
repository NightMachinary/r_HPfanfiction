What if Voldemort used a goblin made object into a horcrux, like a sword? When basilisk venom is used on it will it absorb the venom or will it be destroyed? Can it be destroyed by anything except fiendfyre?


** There would be some goblins celebrating.

After all, the sword - the example used - only absorbs what would strengthen it. That means, either the object would be destroyed without making a horcrux, or the piece of soul would count as beneficial.

After that, there would be a soul in goblin item the goblins, unlike the maker of the horcrux, would know everything about. They would also possess skill to reforge the object and would not be stopped by usual means of protecting such from tampering.

Whether as a message not to fuck with goblins, or as remotely-controlled pawn of the bloodthirsty fuckers holding a piece of his soul and magic, the unfortunate Dark Lord (TM) would be a valuable commodity.

** I'm picturing the goblins getting very offended about their property being defaced like this. Voldemort might wish he were dead.

** Horcruxes are evil horrible magic according to canon. They are a literal taint on the world. I don't think you could make a goblin-made object into a Horcrux. Goblin-made objects only take in that which makes them stronger. I don't think something that /evil/ would stick.

But if it did work, just hit it with the Avada Kedavra. Easy and effective.

** why didn't the SOG absorb the evil of the horcrux?

*** Don't know but certainly not the goblins. I don't even know who makes utensils in the wizarding world. Maybe those who make utensils and such made the cup and it was in the posession of Helga Hufflepuff. As for the tiara, I feel it was a piece of jewelery that was enchanted by Rowena Ravenclaw.

**** Just for fun, I'm going to respectfully disagree and say the goblins made the diadem, the cup and the locket, using the same argument you put forth that they didn't. Plus this, the goblins certainly have the ability to purge any sort of dark magic such a soul fragment imbued in to one of their creations. And Rodericks goblin-made sword didn't have any problem absorbing basilisk venom, a highly toxic and arguably dark substance.

***** You do realise the Diadem, the cup and the locket were all destroyed because of basilisk venom? How could they have been goblin silver if they couldn't absorb it like /Godric/ Gryffindor's sword, which was the only Founder's relic to be explicitly said to be made of goblin silver.

****** In the Wheel of Time series, there is cuendillar, which is unbreakable and absorbs any force, magic or otherwise, used against it. Except that the Big Bad's prison is sealed by 7 cuendillar seals and they break. Why? Because the Big Bad is, essentially, the embodiment of evil, death, and decay. His touch on those seals is enough to weaken so they can be broken with little effort and eventually to destroy them on its own.

Similarly, the corrupting influence of a broken soul could damage the magic in goblin silver to the point that its invulnerability no longer applies. It can't enough to destroy the vessel--after all, a horcrux is no good if it destroys its own container--but it does weaken it.
