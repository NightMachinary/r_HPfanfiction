Back in my days of heavy fanfic readership, I enjoyed reading a fic on Portkey.net entitled something along the lines of "The Long Road Home".

The fic was Harry/Hermione (of course), and the basic plot premise was that, during the war, Hermione had been cursed so that she had to fully realize that she was in love with Harry, despite dating Ron at the time. Although she can hide it, it hurts her to keep the secret.

She never admitted it or acted on it, and years later Harry married Ginny in a true magic marriage, meaning that if he ever cheats on her or even has adulterous thoughts, Ginny will suffer (headaches, nausea, etc), and potentially even die.

Rather than deal with Harry and Ginny, Hermione moves to America and lives a muggle life, but by the time the story begins, moves back to Britain and begins to reintegrate herself back into magic Britain and Harry and Ron's lives. In this time, Harry has become an Auror and is partnered with Draco Malfoy, who has reformed since the war, and is now with Luna.

Once Hermione is back, Harry can't stop fantasizing about her to the detriment of his and Ginny's marriage, which was already on the rocks. Ginny begins to feel the negative effects of the magic bond with Harry.

Hermione is entangled in some shady business related to her time in America, which Harry is determined to uncover and protect her from.

Does this sound familiar to anyone?? The last time I remember seeing an update to this story on Portkey was around 2008 or 9, and then I stopped reading fanfic for a while.. The fact that I can't find it anywhere despite remembering the plot pretty specifically, and having pretty decent googling skills is making me fear that it's just been deleted.

Thank you!!!!

Oh yeah, one last detail I can remember. Ron is with Lavender, and Lavender has a kid via a previous marriage with some old rich dude.

You know, I had forgotten how many good stories Portkey has. While looking for the story, I saw so many others that I remember really liking.
