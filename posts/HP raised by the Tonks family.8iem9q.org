Are there any lengthy stories about Harry being removed from Privet Drive to be raised by Ted and Andromeda, perhaps with Tonks taking on some sort of big sister role? I prefer complete stories but as long as it's updated I can be flexible


** I am writing just that kind of story. After Sirius cannot prove his innocence, he goes to Andromeda and gets her to take him in. No multiple lordships or OP politics, guaranteed free from Graveyard fights, no harem and no braindead exaggeration of character flaws.

The next update is tomorrow.

  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turns out to be the best decision Sirius ever made. Eventual Harry/Lisa Turpin.

**** That pairing is an entirely different beast if Harry has been living with them since infancy.

... and who the heck is Lisa Turpin?

*Edit:* Oh oops, not sure why I assumed the description meant that Sirius left Harry with them pre-Azkaban.

I can definitely see why you'd be surprised that it isn't a Tonks pairing.

** Wouldn't say raised, but they (Harry and Acquila, Sirius' daughter) spend a lot of time with all 3 of them in linkffn(Black Bond)

  An eight year-old Harry Potter comes across Acquila Black, a girl at his school, only to realise that he shares a strange connection with her. Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and reunites with his daughter and godson, together leading the fight against the Darkest wizard of all times Part I of Black Bond (Chapters 1-20 under revision) (Thanks to Nerdman3000 for the cover image)
