Hey all--

I'm writing a FanFic set in 2002, between Harry's generation (Battle of Hogwarts is 1998) and the next generation (Teddy Lupin is a first year in 2009), and was trying to get a better sense of who would have been at Hogwarts at that time.

More specifically:

- Is there anyone we know for certain to be at Hogwarts in 2002? e.g. people who were 1st through 3rd years in DH, or are known younger siblings of canon characters, etc.
- What surnames would we expect to find at Hogwarts during this time? e.g. hypothetical younger siblings, or the last names of the generation after Lily's, or whatever other ways you have of guessing.

Thanks for whatever help you can give!

** Also, note that Teddy's year should be REALLY small. They might be missing a few Muggleborns because of all the drama that happened in 1998 (as in, the records for Muggleborns were wiped and they had trouble locating those kids). Furthermore, there should only be a few Purebloods - and those, like Teddy, should be primarily "oops babies". I mean, it's your story and you can do whatever you want, but I really like it when a story takes that into consideration. In contrast, the next few years after Teddy should be a boom.

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Pure-blood][Here's a list of Pureblood families from the HP wiki.]] Also, I like to Google search uncommon last names, and go from there when I need inspiration. I've found some really great names that way, and JKR herself stole many from friends and family...(and random tombstones).

*** This is broadly true, but baby booms don't have as much of an impact as one might think. It's the difference between 20 babies born per 1000 people and 25 babies born to 1000 people. And even the idea that there would be a baby boom is a little bit of a stretch, because baby booms require a perfect storm of political/social/economic factors. Not to mention that in the muggle world, the birth rate fell in large part because men were abroad and therefore did not have the opportunity to start families. Wizards can fight during the day and then come home to change diapers at night.

So while it's fair to say that Teddy's class would be a bit smaller because of war causalities, it would not be a 3rd of the size of, say, Victoire's.

I also question the premise that muggleborns would be lost, since the Ministry can still detect magical activity. Even if Hogwarts' book of names was destroyed in 1998 to protect the muggleborns, accidental magic would make it fairly easy to identify them in the muggle world. So there's no reason why a muggleborn in Teddy's year would not be found and invited to Hogwarts.

**** Maybe not necessarily losing Muggleborn data, but rather having to find it again. From what we know, accidental magic is rather sporadic. It might wind down to, "Well, there was 12 born but we can only find 11. Where's that last one?" I don't know how that would work in a story about Teddy, but it would be rather interesting if a Muggleborn finds out their records had been deleted and they were almost lost.

Good point about the baby booms in a small population. Didn't think about that, but I do want to point out that witches seem to be a lot more involved in fights (at least compared to the larger Muggle wars), so that might change things in regards to family planning (haha, why the hell would Lily Potter and Tonks have chosen to get pregnant as active members of the Order of the Phoenix during the First and Second Wars - they were literally on the losing side). Also, I don't know how much of a "war" they were fighting for the majority of the population. From what we see, I think it was more like, "You said the wrong thing, watch as I murder you and your entire family without a second thought." That would create a lot of paranoia. I don't know, I guess it really is up to interpretation.

Personally, I would say Harry's year of about 40 students is generally pretty small. Teddy's would probably be around the same size. I think it's capacity is much higher, though. Mostly I said it so they wouldn't put five in each and call it a day. Makes me cringe /every/ single time...

I actually think they probably didn't. James/Lily were still in their teens and fighting for the Order full-time. I have a hard time imagining Lily being okay with putting that on hold to be pregnant for nine months. And given Lupin's reaction to Tonks getting pregnant (and the fact that he has valid reasons for not wanting to play the odds with a biological child), I doubt that Teddy was planned. However, people do have children during wartime, Mrs. Weasley is an example of this.

And I think our perspective is slightly skewed because we see the books from Harry's perspective. For every family like the Weasleys (who are on the front lines) there are four families like the Edgecombes or the Patils.

*** Do you have a source for the records being wiped? That's something I keep seeing constantly, always without a quote or link, but it was Hogwarts, not the ministry, that had records of all the magical children born in its jurisdiction.

That was (part of) why the Muggleborn registration thing was started- to identify what students were Muggleborn because the ministry didn't know. I believe it's Pottermore that had information on the Quill of Acceptance and Book of Admittance, and it even says that the book and quill haven't been touched by human hands since they were put in their locked tower (meaning Minerva had to have a magical way to copy down the names written). If you don't like Pottermore for info (some don't) it was also talked about [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0200-scholastic-chat.htm][back in 2000]]

  What makes some witches/wizards become ghosts after they die and some not? A. You don't really find that out until Book VII, but I can say that the happiest people do not become ghosts. As you might guess, Moaning Myrtle!" Looks like she hadn't planned on killing Sirius

You could refer back to that at some point.
