Hey y'all!

Recommend me the best Neville Longbottom fics for the wiki. He has to be the main character or at least a main character. Romances are allowed.

Make sure to link using [[/u/FanfictionBot][u/FanfictionBot]] (see the sidebar), and write a line or two about the fic. Please list pairings and whether the fic is still being updated as well.

Thanks!

******* It's The Art of Self-Fashioning (I won't link it here since it's not Neville-centric, but it's easy to find on ffn.net). I love the plot, I love the role characters like Minerva and Regulus plays in it, but above all else I love that despite being the BWL Neville doesn't feel OOC. Harry is completely different, of course, and it's really dark and heartbreaking, but it also gives me hope sometimes. And I find it really well-written.

**** Honestly through your post I started reading... can I ask why? It feels a bit OOC to me at this point. I'm on chapter 5, and it feels like Harry or Neville are flaring their tempers up every five seconds. And while maybe some of it is IC for Harry, Neville never shows these traits. Even towards his parents he's weirdly protective? And Harry moping about his dead parents is really bizarre.

***** I feel like it's because Neville keeps a lot of it bottled up, the fic is being written from his perspective mostly instead of from Harry's. So you get his internal feelings, and if you look closely he's not verbally or psychically acting on those feelings very often. I think it's pretty accurate personally. Teenagers are pretty angsty haha.

** Can't use the Fanfictionbot, since the FF.Net version is gone... but I have the Fictionhunt link here: [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4838629/1]]

"Not Quite A Maia" by Naebody's Aunty. It's a crossover with The Lord Of The Rings, where Neville, fresh from the Battle of Hogwarts, is summoned to Middle-Earth to take Gandalf's place after Gandalf fell in Moria. Molly Weasley also comes along for the ride -- and Neville's Gran ends up in Middle-Earth by chance and becomes a real nuisance to the Orcs.

It's a pretty goofy story, but in places surprisingly deep, and it explores the differences between the two very different magic systems of HP and LOTR: HP magic is quicker, flashier and easier, and so the HP-wizards who just use magic willy-nilly come across as impossibly strong and powerful to the LOTR characters. LOTR magic is slower and takes longer to strike, but when it does strike the HP wizards can't compete at all.

No pairings, and the fic does appear to be abandoned after 53 chapters... but that's still 53 very good chapters, and a Neville who gets to be the hero for once.

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.

** Asking for Roses by Dogstar101 Hannah/Neville great romance with original plot. Complete. 5th year. Hannah helps Neville discover who he is and step out of the shadow of his gran.

You'll be the Death of Me by dominikki64 Best romance in HP fandom. Neville/OC. Currently Updating. Neville with DM's sister, Romeo and Juliet sort of feel, they can't be together but paints a superb picture of the Death Eaters POV. Best romance fic in fandom

Seven Years Bad Luck by Feelin Glayish Post DH 7th Year fic. Neville/Pansy. Very well written Pansy. Character arc of Neville is great, shows depth beyond what Canon gives. Worth a read. Complete.

Delight in Whatever Remains by greenschist. One shot, Neville/Hannah. Struggles of relationship and inability to have children. Gives good glimpse of characters. Would recommend.

Three Days by Lady Altair. Hannah/Neville. This is the author of Cauterize. One shot.

** The Landscape of the Heart - linkffn(7383815) - Hermione/Neville. The story is Hermione picking herself up after Ron's death. Understated emotion that still comes across powerfully. More Hermione-centric than Neville, though.

The Deserving One - linkffn(11255466) - Eighth year Neville fic. Liked the herbology stuff, and Neville coming to terms with his Slytherin former bullies. linkffn(11255466)

Learning Curves - linkao3(9137). Ron and Neville coming to terms with their sexuality. Ron/Neville.

Not A Gentleman So Much As A Gentle Man - linkao3(565572) - Another awkward first time fic. I loved Ginny's attitude in this. Neville/Ginny.

Caught on Fire - linkffn(12215200) - Neville/Ginny romance in Carrows ruled Hogwarts.

[[http://hp-rarities.livejournal.com/54096.html][Herbology: A Love Story]] - Another Neville/Ginny. Lovely writing, with some really well drawn imagery. It draws on Ginny's and Neville's shared experiences to paint a wonderful relationship.
