*I also assume that the ICW can issue an "Intervention" or "Sanction" as ultimate measure - basically, declare a magical country outlaw, and let the rest of the Magical World destroy it (and loot it/take it over).*

** In a few of my stories this was the reason there is no indigenous Magical Africa south of the Sahara Desert anymore - when they wanted to resist the muggle colonial powers with magic, they were destroyed. And in Divided and Entwined, the ICW sends an Inspection to Britain to check if they are a threat to the Statute of Secrecy.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
