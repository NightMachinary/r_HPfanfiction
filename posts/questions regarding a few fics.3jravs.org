i have 3 fics that really captures my interest and i'm torn as to which 3 should i read. Those 3 are; Harry potter and the boy who lived, Hogwarts battle school and The Denarian Renegade.

So if you guys would help me out and tell me what i'm in for and what those stories have in stored. normally the summary is enough for me to read but unfortunately the last two fics i chose to read based on the summary just really didn't work for me. your personal thoughts and review on those 3 fics are appreciated as well, oh and i can tolerate tiny or otherwise small spoilers if it helps. Thanks!


** HPBWL is the best in my opinion. A very refreshing story with lots of interesting magic and characters.

I don't like the other two. DR starts out very well written, but I dropped it after several chapters because the plot doesn't appeal to me. HBS lacks all the joviality, imagination and atmosphere that made HP a captivating series in the first place.

** To start, all 3 of them are awesome fics. Harry Potter and the BWL has a great worldbuilding of Durmstrang, a smart and decisive Harry, character building on Viktor Krum, great OCs. It is a ravenclaw!Harry story. There are not many action scenes, it is actually quite focused on classes of Durmstrang's system and Harry's place in it. It has a great OOC character 'Calypso' in it.

For Hogwarts Battle School, it would help if you have read "Ender's series", the first book of it is enough actually. Dumbledore is dead, Snape is headmaster and he creates a vicious and competititve Hogwarts with duels between students or even houses to mold Harry into becoming the one to kill Voldemort. It has great action scenes. Battles are not just "x threw a powerful curse y didn't have the power to block so x wins." kind of thing. It is indepth, smart, and enjoyable.

Finally, The Denarian Renegade. Firstly, if you haven't seen it, it is the first fic of a triology. It is a crossover with Dresden Files, to give a brief summary what this crossover adds to HP universe is, there are 'fallens', they do not have a body they exist as coins and the bearer of coin recieves fallens powers. This story is not centered around Hogwarts and Harry doesn't go there until iirc he is 14 years old. It has swearing and bit of a gore. Kind of a super!Harry but enemies are also not weak due to them having their own coins.

Lastly, in my personal preference i liked Harry Potter and the BWL the most, followed by Hogwarts Battle School and then The Denarian Renegade.

Edit: If you have further questions, pop into the IRC channel :) Edit2: Fixed the shameful mistake.

*** Just a note: It has a great /OC/ character. OC = Original Character OOC = Out of Character

** HBS is a grim look at the militirization of Hogwarts.

The school is an experiment and Harry is the main subject. The goal? To have Harry prepared to fight during Voldemort's eventual return.

The questions surrounding the plot are numerous. Will he be ready in time? Does Harry have the will and fortitude to succeed? Can he differentiate friend from foe? Is he being taught in the most effective way? How far can Harry be pushed until he breaks?

Win at all costs is the mantra of Headmaster Snape.

At all costs.

** HP and the Boy Who Lived has Harry being the brother of the boy who lived, he gets sorted into Slytherin/Ravenclaw(?) and although none of his family have ever been mean to him he feels like he doesn't belong and that he isn't being challenged enough at Hogwarts. He therefore transfers to Durmstrang that has a much more challenging environment. It's incredible, of the three i'd go with this first. It's a WIP but more is available on DLP.

Hogwarts Battle School is basically Enders Game, if you've read it, with a Harry Potter twist. Basically Harry is being manipulated into becoming a great leader. Snape is in charge of the school as per Dumbledores will (he died), Voldemort is dead and in order to ensure Harry is capable of beating him when he returns the school is transformed into "Battle School" where there's an emphasis on fighting and the students are ranked amongst each other. The author [[/u/kwanli]] is actually a redditor and pops up on the sub a lot so he might be able to help give a more accurate summary. This is also very good, one of the best HP fics around. Like you know how people always bitch that Dumbledore didn't train Harry to fight Voldemort? This is basically that happening.

Haven't read the other one, sorry.

** I like Hogwarts Battle School the best personally, but I was also a big fan of Ender's Game, so read into that what you will.

** - Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived is one of the best HP Fanfics. It captures the feeling of canon and expands on the world without going AU. Harry Potter is basically an OC, Nathan Potter is basically canon Harry. So we get to see canon from an outside perspective in a lot of ways.

- The Denarian series is good, and recommended a lot for a reason. It is AU, super Harry but super Voldemort as well. There are some things the story does very well, but some things it does very poorly. It also relies very heavily on 'fight scenes', of which I am not a fan. I ended up skipping and skimming them which made the story even worse.

- Hogwarts Battle School is another AU story, the description for it explains it pretty well. I'm not a big fan of Harry in this story, which made me not like it. The world is very good though, so give it a try.
