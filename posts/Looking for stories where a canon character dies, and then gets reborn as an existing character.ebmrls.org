This is a rather odd idea, that I thought of. But what would happen if let's say Draco Malfoy dies, and gets reborn as Harry Potter. Or something like that.

It doesn't have to be them, I was just giving that an example. It's a really odd idea, that's just came to me, that could become interesting, if done a certain way.

It doesn't have to be the Golden Trio Era, it can be ANY era, if they have this kind of idea.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

It can be Crack/Parody whatever, it can be serious, anywhere in between.


** I want to see a story where Merope Gaunt is reborn as Harry Potter. I wonder how she will tackle the Voldemort problem.

*** Oooh that'd be a interesting idea to see. Or heck, a Death Eater reborn as one of the good guys, that'd be so interesting.

** Seselt has a great take on this idea. Hermione's time using the time Turner throws her back but in a different body. She has to be very cunning to affect the changes she wants. linkao3(7944847)

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path.*time travel*

  Severus remembered dying---that last hopeless look into Lily green eyes. Now he's back in the past, inexplicably in the infant body of Harry Potter. Oh, and there's something wrong with Dudley. Weirdness ensues. A different time travel fix-it. Likely the oddest Severitus you'll ever read. Inspired by Path of Decision---I See the Moon---Athey's Rebirth. Betad by Eider Down.

** there's /plenty/ of stories where harry is salazar slytherin reborn, heck there is one where HERMIONE is salazar reborn, but if you mean "characters that are actually IN the books/movies" instead of just MENTIONED, i don't know any good ones like that
