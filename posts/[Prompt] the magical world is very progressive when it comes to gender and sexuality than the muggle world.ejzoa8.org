Bear with me here and suspend your disbelief a bit here as I try and ramble explain this bit of AU I want to propose for a fic idea. The fic proposal comes after "AU EXPLANATION END"

Assuming the magical world has been separated from the muggle for quite a while, and taking into consideration other factors that affect gender and sexuality, we can see that culturally they should have a very different perspective on gender equality and sexuality.

For starters, magic allows for the physical strength differences between genders. It doesn't matter that a man is physically stronger in general because magical ability is gender-neutral. This witches can and do overpower men too.

Just like washing machines (look up Hans Rosling's speeches), Magic also facilitates housekeeping and childrearing in such a way that it does not require one of the parents to give up a career to take up these tasks. This allows even more gender equality.

Magicals are also prone to not be religious, since most religions view them as devil spawns or worshippers, etc. and try to kill them etc. Therefore, they never subscribe to religious ideas of purity in devotion like the Major monotheistic religions do. There might even be the effects of older societies, where sexuality and nudity is embraced, idk.

If we were to refer to typical role about rituals and whatnot, we'd often see references to virgin sacrifices, idk about you but I'd never try to preserve my virginity if I was magical and want to avoid being kidnapped and sacrificed in a ritual. I still wouldn't do it willy-nilly with anyone but i wouldn't agonize I'm "giving up" something.

Furthermore, having no religious guiding of a society prevents the taboo regarding different sexualities and multiple partners (e.g. being with multiple people in a threesome relationship for example) and opens the door on a lot of teenage sexual exploration that's probably possible in a castle with very few adults to monitor everyone.

Pregnancies and STDs are also a non-issue with magic available.

Obviously, when it comes to "carrying on bloodlines" and what not, Magic could provide ways for men to get pregnant, women to impregnate other women, etc. So that wouldn't be an issue either. It also opens the door for gender transitioning quite easily with things like potions etc. And teens exploring sex in different genders or being gender-neutral etc.

AU EXPLANATION END.

So where does this leave us? Hermione Granger, a muggle born witch to two liberal dentists is heading to Hogwarts, and she's nervous about not fitting in having read about the cultural differences between muggles and magicals. Mixed dorms with shared public baths since no one is really embarrassed to be nude, and teenagers (no not in year 1 or 2, most start exploring in their third or 4th year when they actually hit puberty) that explore relationships and sex quite freely while studying magic.

She's worried about fitting in bc despite her parents being feminists and progressive, they're still not as progressive as magicals.

The fic starts in year 3 (assume mostly cannon events) and everyone is starting to get hormonal and etc.

The story should focus mostly on the social life and romance and drama etc. in Hogwarts and it shouldn't be just smut.

She and Harry relate over this both being somewhat weirded out since he was muggle-raised by Petunia-perfectly-normal-thank-you-very-much Dursley.

Honestly do whatever you want with the AU just don't make it so that it's wrong. Also please no Hermione bashing.


** That's kind of just how I treat canon, honestly. I don't think there's anything that heavily argues against that being the case. Of course a story based around the reality can be interesting.

Though I personally can only think of some slice of life scenarios (which I don't enjoy).

** Despite being progressive, I'd see Hermione as a bit conservative in clothing compared to wizardkind, at least until like, 5th year. Considering the fact that her best friend is also muggle-raised, her cordial at best relationship with her dormmates aside from it, and a Ron that I like to envision as romantically clueless (Not so much bashing as being uh, a bit late at the romance thing, through no fault of his own. He is just a late bloomer physically, but once he does truly enter puberty, he ends up the tallest guy in the dorm.), she is relatively isolated from all of this.

After 4th year, her wizarding dress style can become more liberal and daring as she develops into the grown, independent woman that the girl has already shown so much in canon, though I love a Hermione that is deliciously prude and somewhat of a wallflower in that respect, through no fault of her own. Many muggleborns would share this sentiment, certainly people born around 1980 or before.

And in regards to people stuck in the wrong biological body ? Magic can give you a perfect sex-change or anything inbetween that might be desired. Names are not permanent in Wizarding society until 17, a free potion doing what people want, courtesy of the government. If Hermione decided she would rather be uh...Hermes (???), the Ministry would help her with that in this world.

Just my ramblings on what you have written above.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** I would agree with parts of your logic but disagree with others: While magic makes for a great equalizer between men and women in terms of capability (and combat ability), that wouldn't necessarily lead to full gender equality. First and foremost, magicals are still human and thus have the same hormonal and instinctive programming as the rest of us, which would make wizards both more predisposed to protect witches than vice versa and more inclined to violence and risk-taking. If (and I'd consider it a big "if" canonically but the background of an AU can be whatever you want it to be) magic enables physiological gender transitions, that particular issue would be lessened.

Second there's the matter of bloodlines and heritage, something we see Purebloods being obsessive over. Unless there've been magical means for same-sex couples to reproduce for centuries (long enough to really percolate into the culture of people that can apparently live for 300+ years - see Armando Dippett as an example), there'd still likely be a stigma based in part upon same-sex couples being unable to continue the family line and/or questions about which family line their children are considered to be continuing.

Second-and-a-half, one of the original motives behind puritannical sexual mores is lineage and inheritance in patriarchal/partrilineal societies. In such societies, many men care a great deal (rightly or wrongly) about only supporting and leaving their name and estate to children of their loins. Reliable paternity testing is quite new on a cultural timescale, and beforehand the only method available was to take measures to ensure that only you could sire children on one or more women. Again, unless magic has been dealing with this issue for many generations or you make magical society matrilineal, it would still weigh on the social mores.

As far as STDs go, I'm sure that magic can probably deal with most or all mundane STDs, but we know canonically that there are magical diseases and so logically there are also likely to be magical STDs. Also, we Muggles have plenty of contraceptive options available to us but there are still lots of unintended pregnancies. Thus, I 100% disagree with you on pregnancies and STDs being rendered a non-issue by magic.

I do find it quite plausible, however, that transgender acceptance would be far greater among magicals. With so many things that could radically alter a person's body (Transfiguration, Polyjuice, etc.) I could totally see people using a similar framework to view a trans man's original feminine anatomy the same way they'd view a Transfiguration accident - as an alteration to the body's true form - and see it as only right that the body be corrected to match the soul.

Blood magic. Or throw it at Gringotts. Almost everybody uses Goblin Blood Magic or Heritage tests at the bank. Black Family Tapestry?

There would have to be stipulations on the gender changing. Purebloods would abuse the ever-living shite out of it. First born is always a male. Subsequent kids are always female. Let's face it, Pureblood look out for the wellbeing of the family itself before the needs or wants of singular members. And let's face it, that mainly means who is in charge.

*** Like I said, this is an AU that requires some suspension of disbelief. The main purpose for it is to foster fluff teenage relationship/friendship sexual/romantic drama but with a lot more progressive themes.

Say, for example, Angelina is having regular threesomes with the twins after quidditch practice, Ginny is hoping from wizard to wizard, Harry is secretly trans, but suppresses it bc of Dursleys, Neville is gay and fancies Ron, Draco likes to switch to female and have lesbian sex with Pansy, etc. Or conversely, Hermione still can't get used to having a shower at the same time as the others so she wakes up early every morning for that, or still feels weird about sleeping in the same room as boys, and somehow it comes up in conversation, idk.

Idk, it feels like it can be a nice playground, say a series of oneshots of fluff kinda smutty pieces or just day to day things that weird Hermione out and she tries to get over her "prudeness"

Obviously there will be some issues, id rather pretend all the Lord bs with preserving bloodlines not be part of this AU, but other issues like magical STDs or accidental pregnancies (but why would magicals be anti-abortion or not have abortion options? Again suspend some of your disbelief), they could even be some of the oneshots.

I personally feel like a lot of what we ascribe to typical masculine/feminine behaviour is social nurture, but again, you could be right, all I'm saying is that maybe suspend your sense of disbelief a bit for this AU.

** I think the magical world would be more progressive towards gender equality but less progressive towards a whole lot of other issues. Gender equality because with magic witches can be just as powerful and capable of fighting as wizards, so they'd have had gender equality for a lot longer. But the wizarding world is very traditional, changes slowly (result of smaller population) and has a massive problem with very rampant blood purity bigotry. There's also a lot of racism, although less against people with the wrong skin color but very strongly against goblins, muggles, squibs, veela, giants, etc. Because racism can happen a lot more easily the bigger the actual genetic differences between people are, and those differences are much much larger in the magical world than just skin color. Basic human rights is also an issue where wizards are way behind.
