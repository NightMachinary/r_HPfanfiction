Basically just that. Parody all the different cliche stuff from HP Fanfiction;

Time Travel

Soul Bond

Harem

Lord Hadrian Potter (or some such nonsense)

Luna is a seer

Twinspeak

Bashing of Dumbledore, all Weasleys (except Charlie because... what does anyone actually know about Charlie), Hermione (but make sure she becomes better for the ultimate Harmony soul bond harem with Luna Daphne Fleur and Tonks)

Wrong Boy Who Lived

Indy Harry

OP Harry

Random OC that redeems Snape and/or Draco

Hagrid never actually does anything in the story

Hedwig is smarter than Dumbledore, Hermione, Voldemort, and all the teachers combined

Pup/Cub/Prongslet

Glowing green eyes

And probably some others I can't remember right now.


** Linkffn(Potter Ever After) has several of these, but not all.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

** Linkffn(2829366) has a dimension hopping Harry that runs into quite a few of these. Bonus points to it because it was written in '06.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

** Linkffn(7191459) parodies a bunch of the cliches including some of those. I remember laughing a lot while reading it

  Hey, wouldn't it be cool if someone took as many fanfic cliches as possible and stuffed them all into one story? No? Well, I went ahead and did it anyway. Multi-chapter Mockfic. This summary is actually a lot better than I originally thought.
