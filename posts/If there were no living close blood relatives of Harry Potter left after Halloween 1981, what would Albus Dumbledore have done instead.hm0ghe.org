Maybe Petunia died before having Dudley, or she just wasn't a blood relation of Lily (with either one or both of them adopted by the parents Evans, perhaps), or whatever. Regardless of the circumstances, there's nobody alive that has close enough biological ties to baby Harry Potter following Voldemort's first downfall to cement any blood based protective enchantments originally cast upon him by Lily's sacrifice, so what would Albus Dumbledore do in this situation?

***** Lmao. I can see this being a fun read. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry swindles the twins out of their savings and steals Malfoy's watch. He then steals the philosopher's stone. And the diary (this thing is sentient, it was to be worth something!). He pawns off the Marauders' Map and seeks out Sirius hoping that the convict will aid him in some grand criminal pursuit. The Triwizard gets cancelled because Harry stole the Goblet of Fire. When the Order returns to Grimmauld after a mission, they find that all the silverware is missing.

And when it's finally time to hunt for horcruxes, Harry already has them all in his trunk, because he hadn't had time to pawn them yet.

**** I believe the options are: Elphias Doge, Sturgis Podmore, Emmeline Vance, Aberforth Dumbledore, Moody, and Albus himself.

Doge seems like an awful idea, Podmore is probably too young but possible, Vance is possible, Moody and Aberforth both seem like bad ideas though Aberforth might be possible, and Albus is too busy. So basically only OCs.

**** I'd bet on Amelia Bones or Agusta Longbottom, honestly, although if I were writing it I'd twist it around until I found a way to have him end up with the Tonkses.

They have one foot in traditional pureblood society and one in the Muggle world, after all, and having Dora as an older sister would make a very different and much happier Harry.

** Andromeda Tonks is his third cousin once removed, or second cousin in the common setting where Charlus is his grandpa, reasonably close

(easy trick for remembering cousin numbers: number of "gr" in the younger one's most recent common ancestor, in this case Dorea Black's parents, Cygnus Black II and Violetta Bulstrode, are Harry's "Gr"eat "Gr"eat "Gr"andparents, third cousin, but Andromeda's "Gr"eat "Gr"andparents, so "remove" one of the "grs" and you get 3rd cousin, once removed)

** Even if they're too distant for blood wards, i suspect that he would still give him to the closest acceptable relative even if its only for legal reasons. Wouldn't want folks like malfoy to challenge Harry's placement. In which case the Tonks family would become Harry's guardians as Andromeda is a (distant) cousin and her claim is as good as her sister narcissa, better actually because she wouldn't have the any deatheater taint: Malfoy and his underlings may have avoided azkaban but not without using up serious political capital, capital that he now cannot use to get the BWL into his custody

*** Actually this isn't confirmed in cannon. We get the idea because as the purebloods are portrayed mostly as the elite of society we automatically see them as being few and far between (the whole list of sacred 28 is even in cannon showed as being more opinion than fact), this plus how long they would have to have existed so that no one could point a muggleborn root makes it seems as if they intermarried like crazy.

If you use the definition of pure blood more common though (three generations without muggles) than eventually in the span of 4-5 generations muggleborn descendants would eventually be considered purebloods or at least half-bloods. Ignoring all the muggle-wank we see so often a person would realistically have better chances of obtaining a good life-standard in the world they completed their entire education and have been socializing since they were eleven years-old rather than in one where they would have to get all the education they should have gotten between ages 11-17.

So the number of muggleborns going back to the muggle world would be very close to zero, this plus their seven years of schooling during their teenager years versus the fickleness of friendships formed during childhood and never strengthened plus the odd months at the muggle world means that their social cycles would be majority in the wizarding world, and thus it's more probable that they would end forming couples with other Wizards/witches. Assuming that the choices aren't deliberately made with the goal of bettering their social status their choices would be randomly either other muggleborns, half-bloods that would form the majority of the population and non-bigoted purebloods (no way of knowing for sure, so let's make it as 50-60% of them since the prejudice seems to be at least associated with economic status). And so whatever choice they make their future children will at least be half-bloods. Now, assuming this children face the same scenario then their children would end up being purebloods if they marry other half-bloods in the same situation as them or if they marry a pureblood; and half-bloods if they marry a muggleborn or a half-blood with a muggle parent. Theoretically the family could stay as half-bloods indefinitely, but, again assuming no choices are made deliberately because of blood status, the more generations pass the less likely this is because of probability since we are enlarging the total number of events while maintaining the same chances.

Obviously this is based only on maths and thus doesn't really take in account possible changes in social norms, genocide events like Voldemort's war, social politics and cultural changes, neither does it tale into account the exceptions that while small at the time-span of a single event will eventually end up accumulating during the course of multiple events. But the fact remains that in a roughly estimative chances are that a family originated by a muggleborn will eventually become pureblood. This obviously doesn't justify segregation politics or bigotry, but if we go by this logic than chances are that the purebloods aren't really a portion of the population as small as we are likely to think, and so there wouldn't really be a need for intermarriage to preserve their family's status as pureblood.

This is even corroborate by cannon when Harry sees the memory of the Gaunts and it is shown as being the exception for purebloods instead of the rule.

** In Canon, the Blood Protection was not the only reason why Dumbledore left Harry with the Dursleys (though it was the main one), he also wanted Harry to grow up far from the Magical World, to not be overwhelmed by his own fame.

Raising Harry in the Magical World would be difficult, because everyone would want a piece of the "Boy-Who-Lived".\\
Most politician would love to use him as a poster child to avance their own career. Just like Scrimgeour in HBP, people like Crouch Sr would love to have the public "support" of Harry to keep the population happy or raise their chance in an election, even if he is just a child.\\
Most Death Eater and Voldemort sympathiser would also be interested by his guardianship. He could be used to prove that they were not sympathiser and only victim of the Imperius curse (like the Malfoy would). Or as a Dark Wizard to potentially replace the one he vainquised (like that girl in the book that shall not be named). He could also suffer a terrible "accident" just week after moving to his new home, child are so fragile after all.\\
Finally, the rest of the population would also very happy to raise him, since he is their hero and all.

With this situation in mind, I don't think that Dumbledore would leave Harry with the Ministry since it would put him in the spotlight way too soon, but also bear the risk of Harry living with bad guardians (considering how closely related the Pure Blood are, and the stakes at play, I don't think that Andy claim as a distant cousin would hold since people like the Malfoy or Crouch could also claim some relation while also having a lot more ressource to invest in a legal battle).\\
Raising Harry at Hogwarts could also pose a problem since most adult there are already busy herding teenagers without also having to take care of a toddler. There is also other problems like the Ministry being a lot more insistent to "meet" Harry if they knew where he lived, the complaints about favoritism, children being even worse than adult regarding celebrity and some of them being a bit angry about Harry being somewhat "responsible" for their parents/ siblings/ cousins being sent to Azkaban.

So even without Petunia, Dumbledore would probably still chose to first take care of Harry, and then explaining to the Ministry that it's been taken care of and that he is safe. He could probably refuse to send Harry to an orphanage considering how it went with the last one (and the fact that, apparently, British Children don't really go to orphanages since the 1950's), but foster home could still be a solution (and Harry could even be raised by trusted Squibb and under the best protections Dumbledore could give).

Another possibility could be Dumbledore taking a very long sabbatical and raising Harry himself but I'm not convinced by this solution. In the end, Dumbledore is an educator whose allegiance is toward the school. I'm not sure he would abandon his position as a Headmaster (and his duty to protect/ teach all of his students) just to raise Harry. Also in 1981, Dumbledore doesn't really know and love Harry like he would later. Of course he would care for him and would want to protect him, but just like he would want to protect Neville, or Susan Bones (both child turned orphan by the war and whose parents were Order Members or at least Voldemort opposants).

So I'm not sure that Dumbledore would leave his position and all of his duty just for Harry. I would say that the most likely possibility is Harry being raised in the Muggle World by some Squibb, maybe Mrs Figgs or another, unknown one. I also guess that Dumbledore would be forced to be more present in his childhood, since he would have to place protections on his house at the very least.

*** You atriculated a lot of my internal reasoning (and a lot better than I would have managed!) but I agree about Dumbledore's other motivations. He was committed to Harry being raised away from his fame, and even without blood wards anonymity in the muggle world is another type of defense. I also think he would want him to have a connection/understanding of muggles that will make him empathise with the muggleborn experience.

I reckon he would look for a muggle couple that wants to adopt and just leave him there. Dumbledore might have plans and an end game (and sure, he setup Mrs Figg who kept everything a secret) but I just don't feel like he would setup someone in that direct parental role to lie about everything; the inevitable betrayal just seems too cruel. Whereas with a random muggle couple he can coast on their ignorance.

**** I'm not sure the "inevitable betrayal" was already on the table in 1981.

Sure, it is pretty much confirmed that Harry is the subject of the Prophecy he would have to explain to Harry, But Dumbledore never gave much importance to it, so their discussion would be more along the lines of "While alive, he will always target you so be carefull ".

For the rest, Dumbledore suspected Voldemort survival but only confirmed it in 1991 after his attempt to steal the Stone. His mean of immortality (the Horcruxes) was also only round in 1992 when Harry brought him the destroyed diary. It's only after this date that Dumbledore found out that Harry was an Horcruxe (probably at the start of GoF when he sends him a letter about his visions). And he found a possible way to keep Harry alive at the end of that year (glimps of triumph when Harry tells him Voldemort used his blood).

Anyways, the point is that in 1981, Dumbledore didn't have much secret to keep from Harry (yet) so he would have though something like "I have to stay away from Harry so it will hurt less when he will need to die".

***** Oh oops, I should have been a bit more specific, in hindsight I see what you mean but I wasn't referring to any of that stuff (by 'stuff' I mean evil!mastermind Dumbledore).

The reason why I think Dumbledore would still choose to leave Harry with muggles is that muggle ignorance of the magical world means they wont have to lie to Harry about his heritage, cause they don't know it. Then they'll all discover the truth together and still have a trusting foundation to their relationship.

But if Dumbledore leaves Harry with a squib, or magical person who agrees to live away from the magical world, my assumption is that they would have to lie, either directly or by omission in order to protect Harry from his fame. So the inevitable betrayal is about Harry's feelings in that scenario when he would discover his guardian/s had been keeping secrets his whole life and the damage that would do to their relationship. Harry would probably understand and forgive them, but it still leaves a mark.

I don't think Dumbledore is cruel or pragmatic enough to do that, either to the chosen guardian or to Harry. Sure it happened that way with the Dursley's, but ultimately they were family (plus blood wards) so got custody. With the Dursley's out of the picture, the path is clear for Harry to have a guardian that actually cares and takes on the parental role properly.

** I'm still of the opinion that McGonagall should have raised Harry. Picture this- tiny Harry, polite as can be, with (slightly) less messy hair and tortoiseshell glasses to match. He's an animagus from a young age and he takes classes years ahead of others his age. He has a particular talent for transfiguration and potions, which Snape grudgingly acknowledges. He's the only Hogwarts champion in GoF, Cedric is spared, and, a week later, Minerva takes him on a field trip on which they defeat Voldemort.
