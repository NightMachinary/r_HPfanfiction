I've always struggled with the statute of secrecy, why haven't the magicals conquered muggles or at the very least bred more with them so that magical kind could expand their population. Here is an idea I just had to explain it, this is not cannon but i feel like I've only minorly tweaked it and cannon Harry Potter still could have occurred in this world.

Witches and wizards have been born amongst the muggle population since there were humans on earth, however their birth is very rare . They grow up with miraculous things occurring around them and they are either praised as being godly(child of a god, blessed a god themselves etc) , or killed for being demons. This is happening all around the world , for example Heracles. I would find some more examples from other cultures , I'm sure they are innumerable. They would find ways to harness this magic to varying degrees, some being almost a modern witch/wizard with the ability to use use spells and some simply being very healthy, lucky , smart and physically able (let's say Alexander the great) . These muggleborns have little idea of where their power comes from so they come to the same conclusions as the people around them.

Now this next part is key : their children have the same odds of being magical as any other muggle parents, even if two muggleborns somehow exist at the same time at the same place and have a child , its odds of having magic aren't any greater than any other child. So no magical society ever forms. Muggleborns live , do great things in their region and then die leaving behind none of their power. I would use this to explain god-king lineages , like the ones in Egypt and Persia. At some point this all changes when a great witch/wizard invents the world's first wand. I'm not sure at what date i would like this to occur. The invention of the wand allows witches/wizards access to powerful magic more easily. This wandmaker tours the world ( the entire world , wherever people can be found) in search of students. Together they advance magic further than it has ever been advanced. The students return to their regions to gather all the muggle borns that they can find and thus proto magical society is born , almost instantaneously across the globe.Eventually this would divide itself into regional governance.Still global cooperation is necessary for things like the stature of secrecy. Wand magic has allowed two magical parents to use spells to almost ensure that their child is magical , though failures do occur and squibs are born, however this is a very difficult process and most magical couples can only perform it a certain amount of times , I have an idea that this is somehow based on love but it isnt fully formed.Weasleys would have to be some kind of exception. It is even more difficult for a magician and a muggle to have a magical child because all of the work falls to one partner. Thus the size of magical society is limited. They hide from muggles , because despite their own power, muggles greatly outnumber them and could destroy them. Also hiding from muggles is rather easy with magic and their is no real benefit to magical kind exposing itself. They can take whatever land and food they want with magic. Purebloods make up the majority of magical society because of aforementioned mating difficulties and rarity of muggleborns. Over the years pureblood prejudice forms because it is rare for muggle borns and half bloods to enter society and they are seen as outsiders.

Please feel free to poke as many holes in this mythology as possible, I would actually appreciate it. I've never actually written fanfiction before, if I ever do i will probably use this idea. I would love it if someone took this idea and incorporated it into a story , even if it's only a few aspects. All I ask is that you send me a link . Also please let me know if this has been done before.

TLDR ; Before wands muggleborns were worshipped as gods, after wands wizards/witches became aware of themselves and formed a global society. Also having a magical kid is hard.


** Huh, cool idea.

It doesn't really explain the hundreds of magical creatures, some of whom are as intelligent as humans (centaurs, veela, goblins, giants, etc), though; if magical humans need specialized spells to breed true, but these other species presumably do not, why aren't they more populous than magical humans?

...Except that, given we see a quarter-Veela, quarter-goblin, a half-giant, and Umbridge DOES call centaurs and merpeople half-breeds (unreliable source as she is)...perhaps they CAN'T breed true without magic either.

That would have particularly damning implications as to the reasons why wizards want to keep goblins from learning wandlore...

*** I completely forgot to consider magical creatures , I'll have to give that some thought. I've always wanted to know more about the goblin rebellion. It was a clever (and infuriating) decision on the part of Rowling to make the our MC ignorant of wizarding history, simply because he had a boring teacher. Side note, where did we see a quarter goblin?

*** I've thought about it a bit now . What if magical creatures used to roam free pre wand. They would interact with muggles and generate a lot of folklore. They can breed true and are quite populous . Then after humans got wands and decided to go into hiding they convinced the other sentient races to follow suite and helped them establish hidden lands where they could live. This could be done by a mix of diplomacy and threats (wizards and witches now being the most powerful race due to wands ). For the non sentient races witches/wizards would simply force them into hidden habitats or slay the ones they considered dangerous .This could lead to quite a bit of resentment , thus goblin rebellions.

** It's a very interesting take on it. Tho some bits feel alittle odd. Like there must be something else to the kids. I can't think of lots of examples. But try Colin and his younger brother. Both muggleborn it be very very odd for both kids to be if sooo random. And besides Lilly I got the impression that if one kid was the other normally were as well. And I feel like squibs are more far and between. Idk that whole children side doesn't seem right the way you saying atleast not in the modern world maybe back in time could make sense tho.

*** Ya I guess I would have to leave muggleborn siblings out if i ever wrote a fic . It makes sense for actual cannon since I'm pretty sure JK Rowling said that magic actually is genetic. IDK about the number of squibs that there actually are. I would love if JK released a census of the magical world.

** Or simply the culture of wizard tends to have few child. I don't think their is many family that have a lot of siblings. Except the Weasley, but their are shown like oddities.

Maybe that's because wizard have birth control since the end of the time. Muggle have it since what 50 years/60 years.

If we compare with muggle, the more their are educated, the less they are making child...

*** That makes sense. However I feel like if you had the power to pass magic onto your offspring (freaking magic) then you would aim to create as many of those offspring as possible. Because magic is power and if there is one thing that humans love it's power. One of the founding ideas(I cant think of a better way to say that) of my theory is that magical society hides from the muggles out of fear, if wizards and witches could simply expand their population as much as possible and then have enough numbers to reveal themselves and no longer live in fear, then they would do that. This is pretty dark but i feel like if magical society was real they would probably kidnap muggle woman and force them to have their magical children. Or if they had some morals instead they would offer muggle women the opportunity to live a carefree life with wealth and fortune brought by magic in exchange for having magical children. Then they could expand their numbers greatly and eventually reveal themselves to muggles, feeling safe. Eventually there would be no muggles and everyone on the planet could use magic, yay! Since this has not happened in cannon I tried to think of a reason why wizards and witches have not enacted this plan that was more binding than a mere distaste of muggles.

**** The down size of more children tho is more competition for that power. When you eventually pass you now have to divide all the power you had amassed to all the numbered children. Think the Weasley they literally have to start from nothing knowing there is too many siblings to split any inheritance. Could you think what a kid raised like Draco would do if he gets told all of "daddies" wealth and power needs to get shared! With the darker families I could easily see sibling killing a pretty popular sport! Tho I think due to the war Harry's gen it not the greatest to use as exam for siblings like like to think if they could have both the Longbottom, Bones, and Potters(just to name a few) would of have a child or two more if their fates hadn't been in the way.

******** It's true that if magic is revealed, the wizard will lose the war. Because their are too few. Even if a wizard worth 50 guys they will lose, because 50 muggle ( military) are expendable and the raw number of muggle will compensate.

In the contrary the lost of even one wizard is catastrophic, beçause their are a few.

Yet I don't think that wizard are afraid of muggle. So they don't need to breed to compete with them
