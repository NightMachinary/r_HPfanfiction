** Not a stupid question, there are a lot of acronyms out there! I suspect it might spook a bot or two if I type it on grounds of profanity, but (having just checked) if you Google it then it's the first thing that comes up

** I actually really like this tag. Whenever an author tags their own characters 'BAMF' you know it's gonna be a cringefest so you can not click on it.

***** I've read some good BAMF Harry stories, but it is usually because of the horcrux being more active or because he's the Master of Death in those fics.

*** Sometimes they're okay. Sometimes. (Of Wizards and Heroes is tagged bamf Harry, for example.)

I just don't get the difference between bamf vs powerful, or bamf vs op, etc - I feel like it's just en edgy synonym for a tag that already exists.

*** it also has a habit of redirecting you to stuff you didn't click on and wouldn't want to. At least it has when I use it.
