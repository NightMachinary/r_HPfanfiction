Realistic Political!Harry who eventually becomes Minister of Magic, then uses his power to subvert the muggle election process and install Smart!Dudley as Prime Minister. Bonus points if the two then set their sights on the world.


** Lily and Petunia started planning as soon as Lily got her Hogwarts letter, hence marrying up into the Potter family? Petunia raising Harry is plan b. I'm sure someone could have fun writing it.

** ‚ÄúWhat did I tell you, boy?‚Äù snarled Vernon, ‚ÄúNever, and I repeat, *never* put your guard down.‚Äù Harry was, to be perfectly honest, exhausted. They've been practicing /for hours/. Couldn't they make a small break? They're managing highly dangerous tools, after all. His uncle, Vernon Dursley, narrowed his eyes, as if he'd somehow read young Harry Potter's mind. ‚ÄúYou have to train if you want to become a professional one day, just like me!‚Äù, his uncle straightened his back and raised his head, but motioned for him to sit down; the boy deserved a small break, after all. He's proven himself to be a quick learner; with some luck, and Vernon pulling in some favors, Harry will be able to start working at Grunnings' warehouse before he turns 16! For the past few weeks, Vernon has been teaching Harry how to do house maintenance. The easy stuff, he's still ten, after all. He already learned how to change a light bulb, how to unclog the drain in the shower, how to repair and repaint the fence, how to use a drill for minor tweaks, and loads of other minor stuff. Vernon was absolutely certain that this young man had a bright future in the drill-making company.

What he wasn't absolutely certain about, on the other hand, was his own son, Dudley. He hated to admit it, but Dudley was useless. He tried teaching him how to pull out a nail and he almost poked his right eye out. Vernon tried teaching him how to unscrew a light bulb, and he got, albeit just a little, electrocut. He finally gave up trying when Dudley was supposed to paint the fence and ended up with paint poisoning. Although Harry and Dudley were of same age, the difference in not only physical, but also cognitive abilities was, to put it lightly, astronomical. Vernon will probably find a way, pull a few strings, to secure Dudley's future, perhaps with a boring 9-5 office job at his company. After he finishes school, of course.

You see, Vernon was a cunning man. He could've as easily abused Harry, beaten the heck out of him, thrown him out on the street, but he knew something. Something other people did not know. There's a reason why Harry was wearing brand new clothes instead of Dudley's old cooked rags right now. There's a reason why they treated Harry almost like their own son. Why he was never hungry. Why he was never cold, thirsty or bruised. It wasn't out of goodness of their hearts, heavens no. It was because Vernon is a businessman, and a good one. And a good businessman always sees a golden opportunity to invest his time and money in.

When he heard from those freaks nine years ago that Lily and James Potter were dead, that his nephew had been the Wizarding world's savior, he jumped at the possibility to be his legal guardian. Imagine all the money he could earn from this wonderful opportunity! Imagine the royalties from all the books, merchandise, photos, news articles about the famous Harry Potter! So, together with the spiritual leader of those freaks, the Methuselah himself, Albus Dumbledore, and an army of both magical and regular lawyers, he coordinated to create the most efficient web of profit-making machines in whole of Britain!

Harry was, of course, blissfully unaware of his fame, his achievements, or his magical powers. That spiel Vernon gave Harry about working at Grunnings when he turns 16? All but a facade, to hide his true motives. The boy had to be humble and modest for this to work. Even when he becomes an adult and starts managing his own finances, Vernon made sure that he'd have enough money by then to cover the world in fifty pound notes. Twice. But until Harry goes away to that awful boarding school, Honkspurts or whatever it was, Vernon has to hide his bottomless pockets and bank accounts full of money. But when they eventually tell him about his freakiness, Vernon'll finally be free to do anything he ever wanted! He'll probably ditch Petunia somewhere in the Amazon forest or in the middle of the Pacific ocean and start banging supermodels. Until then...

/Somewhere in Scotland../

‚ÄúYoung Harry Potter shall be turning eleven in a month, Dumbledore‚Äù, squeaked Minerva McGonagall, ‚ÄúI hope he was not abused by those horrible muggles.‚Äù Albus Dumbledore, the old headmaster of Hogwarts, sighed deeply, ‚ÄúMinerva, we've already discussed this topic. Twice just today, to be precise! It is impervious the young lad stays with his blood relatives for his own safety!‚Äù - /and my pockets,/ he thought, although keeping that line to himself. For the past ten years Dumbledore had been rolling in galleons, the golden wizard currency; allowing him to fund his obscure experiments of debatable ethics, and a life of luxury while out of Hogwarts.

It's not like he needed all that extra money -- he was the most powerful and well known wizard in the world; he turned the role of Minister for Magic multiple times; but just the thought of being possibly the richest man alive aroused him. Anything he ever wanted has become a possibility -- and a one that he's about to take. Dumbledore smiled, he was one step from becoming the ultimate ruler of our realm; for all of his childhood plans, alongside with Gellert Grindelwald, shall become a reality. They shall together reshape the humankind, and provide us with an alternate hierarchy where *he*, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, shall be the supreme ruler of this plane of existence. /But enough daydreaming/, he looked at the stack of papers lying on his table, /let's get back to work/! Together with Vernon Dursley and multiple highest level child psychiatrists they devised a plan on how to introduce Harry to the Wizardring world in a most painless way. And it involves our favorite transfiguration teacher, Minerva McGonagall!

*** See, I could easily believe in this version of Vernon, since if you don't have a way of seeing business opportunities in everything and everyone, always looking for someone who has that drive, that hunger to go far and work hard, then you won't stay successful in business.

Granted, it's also about opportunities opening up at the right time too, like Jeff Bezos and amazon, or Bill Gates/Steve Jobs and computers, but being able to jump on the right thing at the right time...

** There's a somewhat similar fic or maybe snippet I've seen before that I've been reminded once that I should put up an actual fic request: Grunnings is actually a front for the Dwarves or Gnomes, though I think it was Dwarves. So Vernon actually takes Harry and Dudley and introduces them to his bosses and Vernon is pretty opportunistic about using Harry to further his position. Hermione or Luna might be involved, but that might just be me mixing up one of Rorschach's Blot's or Clell's works with this one (or it could actually be written by them, I have no clue).
