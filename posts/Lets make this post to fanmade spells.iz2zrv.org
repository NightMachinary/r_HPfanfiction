Mostifors transfiguration Spell 3year something to mouse


** Spells featured in Victoria Potter (some of which are canonical, but their incantations are not covered by canon):

- /Mutatio [Material]!/ - Shaping Spell - Changes a thing's form e.g. "Mutatio Lignum" changes the form of something made of wood.

- /[Material] Verto!/ - Transubstantiation Spell - Changes a thing's substance e.g. "Lignum verto" changes something from wood into the substance of the caster's choice.

- /Congelo!/ - Solidification Spell - Turns something into its solid form, e.g. water to ice, wine to grapes.

- /Immunignis!/ - Flame-Freezing Charm - Makes you immune to the harmful effects of heat

- /Obliviate Muggletum!/ - Place Memory Obliviation Charm - advanced use of the Obliviation Charm, you cast the charm on a place to remove the place's memory of an event. Affects Muggles ability to remember that event, but wizards are not affected.

- /Cadere!/ - Trip Jinx - Tangles your legs in an invisible rope

- /Percussio!/ - Thunderclap Charm - Creates a loud bang

- /Disjunculus!/ - Anamorphosis Charm - Makes a single object appear differently to different people.

- /Potify!/ - Potification Charm - Turns non potable water potable.

- /Propluvia!/ - Umbrella Charm - Conjures an invisible umbrella of which your wand forms the handle.

- /Inhospedentus!/ - Biting Jinx - If cast on a person, bites them. If cast on an object, brings that object to life with teeth and an aggressive attitude.

- /Shoo!/ - Animal Repelling Charm - Violently repels non-magical animals

- /Locomotor Rock!/ - Locomotion Charm - makes rocks fly

You know, now I think about it, making this list has made me appreciate how much of the magic in VP is not strictly speaking "spells". The Arrival of Happi; the Founder's Oak; the Draft of Sparta along with Stormhearts and the Heart of Autumn; the theory behind the Locomotion Charm (the vital force, kraft, impulse and totems); Transfiguration by technique; natural magic, alchemy, and deep magic; poisons; foe glasses; counterspells... even tumblegoats. So much more to magic than just rooty tooty point and shooty.

** You might like my previous post on the topic: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gvawsc/what_are_some_of_your_ideas_for_spells/]]

One of mine is the Inertness Charm. The charm will stabilize/render a substance inert. An explosive won't explode, fire is suppressed, etc. Only the most advanced casters can use the charm on magical substances. Intermediate-advanced casters can cast it in a form that covers areas. This form of the charm charm is used widely throughout the ministry as a counterpart to shield charms to protect against muggle weapons.

Another one of mine is /pulto/. A beginner's hex, it's basically a spell that shoves someone where it hits. The better at magic (and the spell specifically) the caster gets, the more condensed the spell's effects become. A third year should get a punch that can knock a muggle out and momentarily stun a wizard. A 5th year can kill a muggle with the spell. Voldemort and Dumbledore could shatter a wizard's skull with it if they wanted to.

** There was a fic I read where a character used a spell to knock Voldemort off his broom and torture him. The spell was 'Crookshanks'.

** I came up with “Araneasortia”, the spider version of serpensortia. If one of those big ass desert spiders came click clacking at me I would forget every piece of magic I know and take off running.
