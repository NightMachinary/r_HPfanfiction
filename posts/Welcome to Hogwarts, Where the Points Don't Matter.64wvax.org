Are there any stories where house points actually do something? Preferably on an individual level as well. Like, you need to have +30 house points to go to Hogsmeade, or Gryffindor doesn't get dessert because they're in the negatives.


** Having been to a school with 4 houses, an annual house cup, inter-house sports games, points etc... I can advise that they definitely do matter even without being attached to any material benefits. A lot of children (and adults) are innately competitive and points are a good measuring stick for that competitiveness. The point of winning the house cup is exactly that: winning.

**** Also different user but weirdly went to the school next door to Taure! We didn't have houses or points but we had a system of collecting stamps and commendations. For younger students especially this really seems to work as an incentive, even though it never meant anything or had a wider effect on our lives.

For further evidence that humans love fake points, look at the reddit karma system.

**** Different user but same principle. 10 houses all school activities counted for point (sport, drama, academics, uniform) in my time at the school it was enforced in two different ways.

Originally they linked the 12th graders perks to their house points, poorly performing houses were cut less slack, weren't allowed to leave campus for lunch ect. Note that by poorly performing i mean in the teachers eyes not absolute number of points they were just an indicator.

Later on as I became a 12th grader we switched up (new headmaster) to a more house pride driven system. That predicable fell flat. The problem with a non perk driven system was that it depended on charismatic leaders, which meant that you needed 10 charismatic teachers for each house head and 10 charismatic students for house captain. And you had to convince them to give a damn without incentive. We got competitive for sports by nothing else.

Interestingly there was also a spike in bullying, following the transition.

**** Most schools in the UK have a house system, not just Hogwarts. My school had three houses - Roman, Spartan and Trojan - which competed in sports matches, Sports Day, the annual swimming gala, the House Quiz, poetry competitions, etc. Individual points known as /credits/ contributed to the house points, and points were deducted when students earned /debits/. We all had different coloured polo shirts for sports events and things got /insanely/ competitive, particularly around Sports Day when people would paint their nails or paint R, S or T on their face/arms in their respective colour.

** Well, restricting things that are pretty normal (note: I never understood why first years aren't allowed out of school - by that age I regularly took the fucking bus from my little village to the next town to do some shopping, meet friends etc.) because of points is IMHO ridiculous (and I don't think the parents of the students would go along), but giving students incentives like say less homework for students who bring in the points and show that they are participating in lessons? Yeah, that might work!

Note: The point system also kind of falls flat because for one individual students (and houses) don't gain any advantage for themselves (Hermione might win the most points for Gryffindor, but she doesn't gain anything - hell, her efforts are in vain mostly because Snape actually takes more points of off Harry in a single potions lesson than Hermione can earn in an entire week IMHO...same for Neville etc.) or their house...hell, a lot of people (like the Weasley-Twins!) simply stop caring about the system (!), especially since it kind of aims to punish a group of people for the missdeeds for the of only one (or a few)! Hell, the reverse works, too as I've said: The students who earn tons of points aren't gaining anything and they are also punished if someone acts up...IMHO the point system makes NO SENSE! An individual point/merrit system might make more sense (with privileges attached to it! So if you earn your merrits you might gain say the services of a houself to bring you food while you study or to clean up your room/workspace after you are done (say if you are practicing potions to get a better grade despite Snape!) or you might gain access to a professors private collection of books or a restricted section pass etc.!

*** Right. Except as Taure says, for some reason it totally works in the real world. One way to read HP is as an example of the "British boarding school novel" of which there are dozens and dozens. And as such, the house & house point system is actually very real and fictional.

Relatedly, often people say Snape is totally unrealistic, but isn't that to is out of the 20th century british school tradition? I suspect Roger Waters (of Pink Floyd 'nor dark sarcasm in the classroom' fame) can totally understand that archetype.

**** Hm...as far as I know German boarding schools don't work this way, so excuse me: IMHO it IS weird :)

As for Snape: That he wasn't sacked is probably only because of Dumbledore (and Lucius Malfoy - must be nice to have a commong goal, normally they are enemies after all) protecting him from the repercussions...I'd love a fanfiction were Dumbledore is not like that and where Snape truly is a teacher (otherwise he'd have been sacked ages before Harry even goes to Hogwarts!)

*** Restrictions "normal things" isn't wierd...that's pretty standard punishment concepts. Remember that the school is a boarding school and thus responsible for parenting the students in addition to normal details of school life. Saying that someone can't play outside as a punishment makes complete sense in such a situation, assuming points were regulated and actually reflected a students behavior appropriately.

**** Yes but it also encourages bullying... Imagine what would happen if a quarter of the school doesn't get dessert because /three/ people were up at night and were punished a ton for it. It would need to be pretty much entirely individual or it wouldn't be fair at all.

**** Maybe - I just know that I'd probably act up even more this way (removing privileges, in my case the privilege to watch TV or have access to the internet, that works, but house-arrest? Well, I'd act up more, my parents were glad to get rid of me for a few hours after the periode of house arrest ended...they never did use it against me again :D ), so you would not be parenting me (or at least it wouldn't get through!)

***** Sure, parenting strategies are just that, strategies. There is no golden bullet that works to motivate every kid. Some kids will respond incredibly well to losing privelages as a punishment, others will simply shrug their shoulders and move on with life.

** Yeah, there would probably be at least a quarter of the school that didn't care enough, sure they might gain house points, but they don't really care about it enough to go out of their way to earn them. I feel like it would be better if there was downsides to losing points (besides detention, but that is separate from points), and rewards for earning points.\\
Admittedly Snape would probably make so the Gryffindors would be punished often because of his point taking.

** In my darkness ascendant story the great hall is decorated in green with silver silverware. When gryffindor wins, it'll be all red the next year with goldenware. They'll also get a party and there'll be other gains like getti g to leave for hogsmeade earlier and a later curfew and the like.

***** Carbon fiber is a muggle thing though, since I doubt wizards would think of making something like carbon fiber. Although, if for whatever reason they did it would probably be extremely easy to make for them so there's that.
