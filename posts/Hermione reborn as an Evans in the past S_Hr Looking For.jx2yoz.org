I actually remember about this story I just don't remember the title, Hermione is Lily's twin and in second year Hermione' friends with regulus and Evan rosier (whom Lily is suspicious of because he's a third year who knows a lot of "dark" spells) and in one part where Sirius tries to talk to regulus and Evan appears and says he and regulus are going to have a little chat and in that moment Hermione tries to get Evan to walk her to transfiguration and he calls her Ma Bichette and I think thats enough info

*** No, I dont think so anyway because Merlin's box is only up to first year and this stretches up to 4th or 5th while the scene I remembered was in 3rd year or so
