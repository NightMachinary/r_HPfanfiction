What are some fics you have bookmarked but haven't posted on this subreddit yet?


** I've never seen this shared on here. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=328230][The Deathly Children]] is an amazingly well written story about the three Dumbledore children.

*** For those who are curious, it is a W40K cross-over. The God-Emperor is an integral part of the W40K universe.

If you're interested in this crossover, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens]] (Complete) and Sequel (Complete) and Sequel (WIP) are pretty amusing.

** Never shared [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244417/][Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss]]. Doesn't really fit what most people seem to be looking for (Harry x non-magical OC doesn't seem to top the charts, popularity-wise), and it's not absolutely brilliant so I don't push it on people, but it's a well-written little 30K vignette that I enjoyed.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]] is a good time travel fic, where Hermione is sent back, and tries to fix the future. It's a somewhat original take on the whole time travel bit.

I'm immensely fond of this Hellraiser crossover. It's an easy-read and hauntingly memorable despite that.

Diary!Tom wakes up after Mr. Malfoy offs a business rival. He promptly kidnaps Harry to study how his elder self failed... hilarity ensues. Hasn't updated in a few months but the author is still alive and writing so maybe its still active?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]] is a really neat Bellatrix centered fic in a complete AU, which as the description says, never saw the rise of a Dark Lord Voldemort. Bellatrix is one of the best characters I've read, and there's a lot of action and intrigue. Updates once a week on Saturdays, and is nearing the end now.

** Darth Marrs's HP/Star Wars crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4521407/1/The-Boy-Who-Fell-A-HP-Starwars-Crossover][The Boy Who Fell]] hasn't been recommended before (to the best of my knowledge). One of the author's earlier stories, it's still one of his better ones (and doesn't suffer from the excessive grimmdark of, say, his Firebird trilogy). 135k words, complete.

  The Boy Who Lived didn't. Now 13 years after Harry Potter was murdered by the Dursleys, magical England is on the verge of collapse. So Luna Lovegood wishes for someone to come and make it all better.

*** This is amusing... not a Harry Potter fanfiction strictly speaking. But since I read the series it's crossed over with, its quite enjoyable and I /really/ agree with Ben's ideas concerning the D.E. Youths. Honestly, the DEs should just be bloody grateful they didn't get Jacen dropped on them instead of Ben.

I can't vouch for how good it would be if you don't know who Ben is beyond 'son of Luke' but Luna is Luna... which is /always/ hilarious.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9097983/1/Without-Thorn-the-Rose][Without Thorn the Rose]].

#+begin_quote
  A bittersweet coming-of-age story for fans of good writing. Lily died, and left James to raise a stranger's son alone. In the shadows of Azkaban, Harry learns from Dementors and Death Eaters, while in the caverns of the sea a mysterious power awaits the chance to steal his soul. Warnings inside.
#+end_quote

I liked this one a lot. Its familiar, but twisted into something new. Sequel WIP. Slash in the background, and "Minor slash" in the sequel. As arrogant as having "for fans of good writing" in the summary is, I thought it was well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6261496/1/Forced-Perception][Forced Perception]].

#+begin_quote
  Auror Harry Potter gets thrown back in time to 1898, Albus Dumbledore's seventh year at Hogwarts. Can Harry resist making changes and get back to 1998 before Dumbledore learns all about him? Post DH. Follows most canon, but time travel. Grindelwald later. Complete.
#+end_quote

I had high hopes for this one, and they fell flat. It falls in the "Time loop" category of time-travel: nothing can change. Which makes it a character piece, and, IMO, fails at that. None the less, it was something different, and so I appreciated that.

EDIT: Also, my favorites list can be found on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Ervb][https://www.fanfiction.net/~rvb]]

** Does fics in an other language count ? :D

Otherwise :

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6172058/1/Happy-ends][Happy Ends]] (femslash in the New Gen)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8395846/1/Just-Between-Us][Just Between Us]] Small vignettes between Ron & Hermione life, really great !

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5371934/1/All-The-Dementors-of-Azkaban][All the dementors of Azkaban]] Harry in Azkaban, classic non-canon theme

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1630989/1/Take-Time-to-Smell-the-Roses][Take time to smell the roses]] /Hermione has used a match making service to find a husband since that is what is expected in society. What happens when the person is someone she least expected?/

The first Severus/Hermione fics I ever read. A bit cliche in parts, but an interesting read.

(Try not to judge me too hard.) XD
