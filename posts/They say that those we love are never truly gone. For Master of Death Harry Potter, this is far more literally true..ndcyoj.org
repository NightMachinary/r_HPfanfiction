#+TITLE: They say that those we love are never truly gone. For Master of Death Harry Potter, this is far more literally true.

In a nutshell, either the souls or at least echoes of all of his loved ones (and possibly other people with whom he's had strong connections, including nemeses like Voldemort) are carried along in the back of Harry's mind. This would overall make him less angsty, because even if he physically outlives everybody they'll still be with him forever. On the other hand, it could make him seem bizarrely erratic to the unaware outsider as he unconsciously channels the influence of his various passengers and/or has conversations with them in his head. His temper would probably be a thing of legends, combining his own anger issues with Riddle's volatility and inclination towards disproportionately violent responses (plus the harder-to-rouse but more terrifying anger of the Weasley parents). He'd also likely have to occasionally push back dark urges from Voldemort.

This would work best for a crossover, since it really kinda relies on a Harry that's outlived the entire canon cast (except himself).


** This could be pretty comedic if the side-effect/caveat of the Stone, where the dead's souls are uncomfortable in the Living World aren't uncomfortable now. To them, it's like walking through a door and back again as they please.

In a set radius around him, they appear, have a chat with him, and then "go back home" at will.

Naturally, this is embarrassing when he's trying to have intimate time with his girlfriend and his mother just pops in 'random;y' for a chat.

"Damnit, Mother! Do you want grandkids or not!"

Or where Snape appears with Lily, and she still calls him a berk, despite James' attempt at getting them to be friendly again.

Who knew Lily could be go vulgar? No-one ever mentioned this to him!

** You could go AU-crossover too. Like On A Pale Horse. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][Here's the link]] if you haven't read it.

I pretty much mean cross the MOD Harry AU with a different AU. Time travel works too now that I think of it. I can totally imagine a post-gringotts-break-in Hermione ranting to Harry about religiously-rule-following Hermione.

** Not quite the same, but I remember reading one master of death fic where Harry had all of the various death gods in his head talking to him. He ends up gaining dominion over those who die to the killing curse.
