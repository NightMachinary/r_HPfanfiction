Basically I want fics that are either: complete genderswaps of male characters into female characters with the gender swap either being partial, stacking with the character's existing anatomy to turn them full intersex, metamorph characters able to do any of the above, male characters being turned female, intersex, or visually trans!male before getting knocked up, shape shifting if metamorph back to male or trans!female, and optionally getting locked into shape or gender while knocked up or being able to change shape as a metamorph only three times during it, and reversion to male or Trans!female after, before, or during birth, and metamorph knocked up shapeshifting shenanigans, preferably to avoid each three month's set of issues, hormones going apecrap with metamorphs, and Teddy Lupin causing all of the above to Tonks in such circumstances. Harry shapeshifting in such a way to annoy Lily (who can't do so) would be even funnier. Apparition/Portkey/Floo nausea being mistaken for morning sickness is even funnier. Bonus points if a male reacts that way. What's even more funny would be tonguelashings/tickling from both the Voldemort and Delfy side of Bellatrix during 1996-8 due to both of them being Parselmouths, and fans being fans. Bonus points if Voldie does this to get Delfy out quickly for obvious plot timeline reasons that (may) arise. If Bella's enjoyment of it is rudely interrupted by the obvious pain, even better. Bonus points if Bella remained physically untouched by Voldie's advances, and even more if the reason was Voldie being soft, with even more if that was due to being a reanimated soul. I would make it due to latent metamorph DNA leaving Bella out of the way, but Delfy really only had Narcissa's hair, plus Bella is an old mother who is super inbred with no Muggle DNA and Voldy is a mix of Pure Muggle and Near-squib sibling-marrying incestuous peasants. That's not a recipe for genetic diversity or magical ability. Delfy is just probably glitched genetically. This all presumes that such ideas have even been explored in this fandom. Yes, some of it requires slash and the like, but I guarantee that a good part of this isn't too weird for most fans. And bonus points if harry and or hermione are of African descent in order to meet CC/Epilogue diversity requirements for many prompts. I am on mobile, so can someone mark this nsfw for safety? Rule63 femslash is also desired. Along with any variety of selfslash including ones where one or both are female.

You say this like this community isn't literally solely comprised of Harry Potter fans. If your mindset is that most of us wouldn't consider this “too weird”, then who the fuck is this comment meant for?

*** I was mainly and intentionally implying that those afraid of slash won't truly hate these undefined tropes/ideas, and that since most of it bends the literal genders of those involved in the "slash"/girlslash, it could be more palatable to some depending on YMMV. The reversion around the time of birth appeases the smut fans, anti-trans, and anti-gay members of the fandom if they stick around or get informed of the double subversion, and the different definitions and variety of intersexuality scenarios in addition to the needed setup is just right for nearly anybody. Need slash but want a kid without true mpreg? Have one be a trans!male tomboy. Need that to be faux-straight? Have the male be a Trans!female instead. That's not even counting bifauxnens, and the like. Need a kid to result from girlslash? Have one normal female or bifauxnen for lulz and one trans!female. Or for free-range pairings, true intersexuals with flat and raised chests can be used! Feel free to only invoke Rule 63 under or overdone on characters as you like! We need better intersex and trans representation. That's all I meant. I wasn't implying that this fandom isn't purely HP. That would be so silly because the r/ title of the sub is [[/r/HPFFn][r/HPFFn]]! Sorry about my atrocious web existence.

*** I actually meant to say that this kind of sexuality trope shenanigans is probably ok in Harry Potter: a world with literal human-to-animal 2way conversions known as animagi. Also a good portion of fans here read other fandoms just as often as Harry Potter. In other magic-using fandoms that don't have the 1910 attitude towards technology and gender roles, this kind of shenanigans is more normal. Now some of them might have ran across this elsewhere, but due to fanon, rarely see it in Harry Potter, so the purpose of this was to state that this stuff is well within JKR's admittedly vague definitions of magical limitations but is very hard to contextualize into a 1910-values world that grew up with no religion besides paganism. See, LoTR fans could never handle this, as there is no muggle world in middle earth. Sorry for any confusion.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Harry and his twin sister are the Twins-Who-Lived, and their parents survived that Halloween night, there is a sexual social experiment at Hogwarts known as the Free Use Experience. Starting at the age of fourteen, students can willingly volunteer. Willing witches are used sexually, not only in private, but also in public. Harry Potter, a Metamorphmagus, who can change his gender, is forced to volunteer in the Free Use Experience as a girl at least twice a week -- including once during the week when he/she must attend classes during the day. To prepare for the Experience, Harry, his twin sister, Rose, and his girlfriend Hermione have begun a sexual relationship prior to their Fourth Year at Hogwarts.NOTE: This story is my most mature and risque story to date. It is not for prudes or readers under the age of 18. This story will probably have some type of sexual situation in many chapters. Read the warnings (tags) and heed them well. If you do not favor (or qualify for) any of this, turn back now. Relationships and Characters, and Tags are not final and will be CONSTANTLY UPDATED!This story can also be found on Fanfiction.net under my pen name/real name Vance McGill
