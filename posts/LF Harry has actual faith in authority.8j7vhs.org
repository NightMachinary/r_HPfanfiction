Both canon and fanfiction has Harry with not much opinion of authority figures "Oh, they won't do anything to help, why bother" what I want is a Competent Dumbledore. Harry can still solve some of the problems, but actually relying on adults to solve a lot of them for him.

- Harry reports his situation with the Dursleys to Child Services (Sleeping in a cupboard, a 4 year old being forced to cook, and having to "Duck a frying pan occasionally" IS Abuse, and Canon abuse at that) and Child services actually do something.
- Harry reports his mistreatment from Snape, and, in first year, McGonagall (150 points vs 20 from Malfoy) to Dumbledore, who makes Snape treat Harry like any other student, punishing him only when he deserves it, not "For breathing too loudly"
- Harry tells Dumbledore about the voice, and Dumbledore identifies it as Parseltongue, and, being Dumbledore, is able to do something about it.
- Harry gets help from the Teachers with the Tournament in ways that go around the "Tournament Oaths" or hires Lupin to tutor him or something.
- Harry brings up the fact that Voldemort has his blood, so the Blood wards might become ineffective, if he's still at the Dursleys after calling Child Services.
- Harry reports Umbridge to McGonagall, and if she does nothing, to Dumbledore.

Things along that line. Not so much a Teacher's pet, but more "This situation is way beyond me. Help" relies on a Nicer than Canon Dumbledore, who actively lets Harry have some childhood by solving the problems. Theoretically, if the Horcrux was gone from Harry, someeone could stun Voldemort and Harry just has to execute Voldemort's stunned corpse. The power he knows not could be Competent Adults.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

*** Thanks, I've read that one, but that's exactly the sort of thing I'm looking for. Realistic responses to problems. I know there was one where the police were searching the Dursleys for something else and found Harry as well.

#+end_quote

I don't like to be the voice of unpleasant reality or anything, but Surrey County Council was, this far back, not notably competent in the realm of childrens' services, and a child who wasn't being actually beaten to death wasn't going to merit much more than an occasional visit from a social worker. We're talking about the 1980s, here, before Childline and Victoria Climbie*, and just after the whole 'satanic panic' thing had got childrens' care social workers into very bad odour with everyone**.

The sad fact of the matter was that Surrey County Council has been in tory hands and therefore budget-slashing anything that was of benefit to The Wrong Sort - and it's very much assumed by such that child abuse only happens among the Wrong Sort - since the year dot and as a result their childcare department had a number of senior figures jailed following the whole slew of historic child abuse investigations that followed Operation Yewtree.

Getting adults involved in Privet Drive could conceivably have made things /worse./

Edit to add something that just turned up in my news feeds: [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-44084298][Rich families using 'privilege to opt out' of child services]] - and the Vernon Dursley we see in the books is at least at the bottom end of the scale that that would apply to. Senior position - director, even - at a manufacturing firm while still a twentysomething, which practically screams nepotism at worst and the old-boy-network at best. Privately-educated. His sister makes a 'living' as a dog breeder (you pretty much can't, one suspects the Dursleys were old-ish money, or at least had a tolerably-comfortable inheritance) and counts at least one retired colonel among her friends. /Exactly/ the kind of people that article is talking about.

*Victoria was 8 when she was starved and beaten to death in 2000, and childrens' services missed her plight repeatedly despite multiple reports of the child's condition. She wasn't the first child to be so failed, but (and the party politics of this is for another time) her death was the cause of a series of major public inquiries and a massive set of reforms.

** A joke at the time was about the difference between a Rottweiler and a social worker: it's easier to get your kid back off a Rottweiler...

** I would love to see a Harry & Dumbledore mentor fic where Harry is like "I thought all wizards speak snakes." And Dumbledore is just like "have a gingersnap Harry, now, while you're chewing I'll drone on about speaking mermish and then offer to find you a snake tongue tutor, and in the weeks that follow our conversation you'll wonder about what dusty old man I'll dig up to teach you the proper way to talk to snakes but in reality I'll bring you the complete opposite in personality because I'm Dumbledore and find hyper snakes who are interested in taking Human Studies as a cross eel-ective as amusing."

**** She does a lot on her own, but she also has no problem seeking help from staff or alerting the aurors when she encounters a problem she can't handle. Obviously story about the protagonist going right to the teachers every time something interesting happens would be pretty boring, but there's nothing like the complete distrust canon!Harry has for authority that prevents her from ever relying on a teacher when she needs to.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** Hm...and the first time he can't report stuff he will fail (and die!)

Note: I disagree with how Dumbledore and the other adults handle things (I seriously want Dumbledore in Azkaban for supporting child abuse ("...ten dark and difficult years..." - so he knew!)), but their lack of action at least toughened Harry up (despite the fact that the switch in his brain never fully flipped from "I want to be just lazy and unremarkable Harry" to "Oh shit, people are trying to kill me all the time! I truly need to wisen up and learn combat magic!")!

Also: How in the blazes can you have faith in people the betray you left and right and are abusers by proxy (both McGonagall and Dumbledore knew that Harry would not have a good childhood at the Dursleys - Dumbledore more than McGonagall but she never checked on Harry either or at least invited him to her office for talks in first year (I would, if I had a student who's parents I know and who isn't half as brilliant! I would want to know why that student is performing poorly! - Note: No, I am not an educator, but if I were I'd take an interest in my students!)...hell, Snape probably knew, too (he knows Petunia Dursley after all!))

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
