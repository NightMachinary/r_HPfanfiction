Can I ask, does anyone have any stories that bash certain characters (Sirius, Hermione, Weasleys, Dumbledore, Remus etc) with intelligent Harry Potter? I asked on another Reddit account and people started harassing me non-stop because I like bashing of characters and stories with Harry being a friend of the Goblins.


** There are a lot of Slytherin!Harry fics like this. It's not really my thing, so I don't have any links, but if you check out this subreddit for threads on Slytherin Harry, you'll probably find some.

There's also most Robst fics. They all bash at least one of those people.

*** I love Robst stories, I think I will take your suggestion. Even if it is not what I am looking for, I know the writer is amazing and I will enjoy reading/re-reading them. Thank you.
