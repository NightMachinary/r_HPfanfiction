I'm in the mood for something self-indulgent. Any good noble!Harry and/or rich!powerful!Harry fics out there?


** This will be the third time I throw a recommendation for [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6780275/1/The-Last-Casualties][The Last Casualties]] in as many days. The Potter family are about as noble as it gets in this, [[/s][]].

James and Lily are alive, HHr pairing.

*** I saw this in another thread and started it yesterday. I'm about 14 chapters in, and it's everything I want in summer reading material! It's over the top, just a bit weasley bashing, powerful!/noble!/mega rich! Harry, catholic Hermione weeping in church, James and Lily back from the dead... It should be terrible with all the cliches it hits. Yet I can't stop reading.

**** Speaking of which, why is catholic Hermione a thing? I see it off and on. In fact, the only times I see religion being injected at all it's either catholic Hermione or "wizards are totes still pagan, yo". I'm usually not bothered unless the author uses it to preach about abortion and premarital sex, but I've still wondered.

***** I find a fairly substantial number of fic writers are American and somewhat religious (of one stripe or another). This usually results in preaching about premarital sex as you indicated, but sometimes the preaching is more overt than others. It's not something I want in my fanfics, and it's something I basically skip over in Last Casualties.

As for the Catholicism, well, it's got a good deal going on and as far as Hermione goes it's really only plausible for her parents to be Anglican or Catholic. Maybe more people tend to find the Catholic church appropriate for magic/conspiracies/etc?

***** I honestly have no clue... It's not as if England is hugely Catholic these days. I think the earliest fic I remember seeing the 'Catholic Hermione' trope in is Leyna Rountree's 'The Twenty' back in 2004. I'm not going to complain too much... It's hardly the worst that happens.

**** Does Hermiones religion have bearing on the story? Or is she catholic just because?

**** Catholic Hermione ruined this one for me. It's just inexplicable and gratuitous.

***** What almost made me stop was when the baby was circumcised. First Why did they feel a need to include that?!?!?!? Secondly, most of England doesn't circumcise. And there is no way I believe that wizards would be a group who do (mostly Jews & Muslims these days).
