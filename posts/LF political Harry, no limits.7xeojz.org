  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** My biggest issue with these sorts of Fics is they have no real conflict. Firstly nothing bad of any real consequence can happen. Secondly any sort of difficulty in the opposition is easily dealt without any real obstacles.

These sorts of political Fics aren't really political. They are power wanks that instead of occuring in duels take place in the Wizengamot. A better question is how did Harry get these titles or allegiances?

My favourite "political" fic is the third installment in the Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs. Harry realizes the system cannot be changed and is actively out to get them. Rather than insert lordship and loophole here, Darth Marrs has the whole system torn down.

A Mauraders plan suffered from similar issues. Harry somehow got all the family magics power. He suddenly got the allegiance of the Malfoys through a contrived marriage contract loophole.
