After reading the trial in Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina (which is plain lawyer awesomeness) I've been wondering if it's a common theme. Both Innocent and Accidental Animagus have trial scenes although very differently.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** I'd really like to see a fic where Sirius gets a trial... and is then found guilty. Unless they have captured Peter Pettigrew, this is the most likely result by far:

- Sirius was the only wizard at the scene of the crime, other than Peter Pettigrew, who is dead.

- A curse has clearly been used.

- Multiple eye-witnesses recall Pettigrew angrily confronting Sirius and accusing him of being responsible for James and Lily's death, after which there is an explosion which kills Pettigrew.

- When Sirius was found at the scene of the crime, he was laughing.

- When in custody, Sirius offered no explanation for his actions.

- Character evidence: Dumbledore can testify to the fact that Sirius was Lily and James' intended Secret Keeper and that the only way Voldemort could have killed them was if Sirius betrayed them.

In response to this evidence, Sirius has his story about Peter being the real traitor and faking his own death. There are three problems with this defence:

- The defence depends on admitting that he is an illegal animagus. Not only is this a crime which will independently be sufficient to send Sirius to Azkaban, it is also further character evidence against Sirius. Why should the court trust the word of a man who just admitted to years of criminal dishonesty?

- He didn't mention this story while in custody. Waiting until trial to provide a defence makes it look like you've thought it up while in custody. Under English law, if you remain silent in your police interview but then later seek to raise a defence, an adverse inference can be drawn against you i.e. the jury is free to conclude that if your defence were true, you should have mentioned it at the earliest opportunity. Magical Britain may well have a similar position.

- There's no evidence to support anything of what he says, except the fact that Sirius himself is an illegal animagus.

In brief, unless Peter Pettigrew is produced as evidence, pretty much any court in the world would convict Sirius.

*** The only real evidence is that James and Lily told everyone that Sirius was the secret keeper, and that Sirius was at the crime scene having a mental breakdown. That's not enough to send someone to Azkaban without a trial. At least Dumbledore should have asked Sirius about what happened. But no, he was too busy leaving Harry on a doorstep in the middle of the night. Any decent lawyer could get Sirius out and Dumbledore arrested.

**** A decent lawyer will be able to undermine Dumbledore's hearsay evidence that Sirius was the secret keeper. They will be able to point out that Dumbledore's evidence only goes to James and Lily's intentions, and does not show that Sirius Black was /actually/ their secret keeper.

Nonetheless, on the totality of the evidence and considered in conjunction with the other evidence (in particular Pettigrew accusing Sirius of betraying the Potters before his apparent death at the hands of Sirius), a jury would likely still be confident that Sirius was the secret keeper and killed Pettigrew.

*** IANAL, but I see a few problems with your arguments:

1. If Peter is dead, where is the body? They found just a finger, but apparently enough remained of the other victims involved to determine how many bodies there were. Which casts reasonable doubt that Peter really died there.
2. Since there were two wizards involved and one is not accounted for, this is not enough of an argument for either side.
3. Fine so far, apart from the last part of the sentence. No body, no victim.
4. Supposed perpetrator had a mental breakdown. No argument for or against.
5. This one presupposes that Sirius has been properly questioned - which is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the books. As far as I remember, there has been some sort of questioning while Sirius was still dealing with his mental breakdown and clearly didn't even register the questions, let alone was aware enough to realize this was his chance to explain himself.
6. Character evidence doesn't fly here, since Sirus was also known to be James' closest friend. The issue with the secret keeper being known has been discussed by you elsewhere in this thread - no conclusive evidence for or against.

I am not really happy with your defence arguments as well:

1. Nowhere in the books does it say that illegal animagus are punished by sending them to Azkaban. Also, nowhere are any clear guidelines listed when and how an animagus has to register. Do they have to as soon as they achieve this, dow they have to do that when reaching a certain age (17, age of majority perhaps, or some other age with the implied reasoning that people usually start the process after finishing Hogwarts and take a while for it)? Also, while this is admittedly splitting hairs, technically the defence is that (James and) Peter were animagi while at school, and that is why Sirius knows their forms. Sirius being an animagus himself is not really the point and only useful for the prosecution if punishment for that crime is applicable and severe enough. Since Sirius was incarcerated at a young age, around 20 according to the books, it is possible that he didn't have to register while he was free, especially considering there was a civil war going on and Sirius was working for law enforcement. His years in Azkaban do not count against him, since no prisoner is expected or able to register.
2. I refer to point 5 above: If he had a proper interview, yes, probably. Not English, therefore I can't speak for that part, but it does make sense. But what if his interview was not conducted properly?
3. There is no convincing evidence against him as well, so along that line of reasoning we end up at "in dubio pro reo" -> Sirius has to be let go because of insufficient evidence.

**** We've seen multiple trials in canon so we know that veritaserum is not used. We also know that there are multiple ways to trick veritaserum, including occlumency, so that provides a good reason why this is the case.

In any event, it's usually unwise for a defendant to "take the stand" in their own trial, and lawyers will almost always advise that defendants take advantage of their right against self-incrimination. The reason for this is that under intense and clever questioning, even innocent people giving truthful answers can be made to look guilty. Defendant is nervous and keeps glancing at their lawyer? Jury thinks they look guilty. Defendant is inarticulate and hesitates frequently in their answers? Jury thinks they look guilty. Defendant forgets a minor detail about an event that happened a year ago? Jury thinks they look guilty. Etc.

#+begin_quote
  Veritaserum plays a big part in finding out the truth from Mad-Eye Moody in book four. Why then is it not used for example in the trials mentioned in the same book? It would be much easier in solving problems like whether Sirius Black was guilty or not?

  Veritaserum works best upon the unsuspecting, the vulnerable and those insufficiently skilled (in one way or another) to protect themselves against it. Barty Crouch had been attacked before the potion was given to him and was still very groggy, otherwise he could have employed a range of measures against the Potion - he might have sealed his own throat and faked a declaration of innocence, transformed the Potion into something else before it touched his lips, or employed Occlumency against its effects. In other words, just like every other kind of magic within the books, Veritaserum is not infallible. As some wizards can prevent themselves being affected, and others cannot, it is an unfair and unreliable tool to use at a trial.

  Sirius might have volunteered to take the potion had he been given the chance, but he was never offered it. Mr. Crouch senior, power mad and increasingly unjust in the way he was treating suspects, threw him into Azkaban on the (admittedly rather convincing) testimony of many eyewitnesses. The sad fact is that even if Sirius had told the truth under the influence of the Potion, Mr. Crouch could still have insisted that he was using trickery to render himself immune to it.

When Dumbledore seeks atonement in battle against Voldemort Harry inherits his power and his responsibilities. Harry must learn to wield those powers in a world where law and justice have powerful enemies and many must atone for injustice done.
