Hello! I'm looking for stories that have a particularly strong showing of house unity/stop calling all Slytherins evil/lets all work together! I just read a story where Harry destroys the hourglasses in order to stop them from fighting over something so ridiculous. I'm reading another now where the first years start a club together as a big group. I'm realising that I love these stories and I'd like to read more of them


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9476138]]) has a subplot where Draco persuades people that the point system is meaningless.

  The stupid hat was stupid and refused to help Harry. The whole school and its division in houses was stupid too, and the teachers.Harry was in Hogwarts, but he didn't want to be. He wanted to go back home.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** Try the Alpha series. linkffn(6389117). Don't be put off by the name, it has nothing to do with werewolves. It is a Slytherin Harry starting in year 1 with him pulling together the entire school so that by the end all the students work together to fight Voldemort.
