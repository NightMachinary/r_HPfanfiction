Is there a story out there with a person in the background manipulating the people around to achieve his goals?\\
Someone who is capable to even surpass Dumbledore with tricky skills and illegal methods?\\
It does not necessarily have to be Harry himself, but if he is, he shouldn´t be the boy-who-lived.\\
As an example, I´ve recently read Classroom of the Elite (light novel), whose main character enters an Elite school and begins to manipulate and exploit his fellow classmates for his own hidden purposes. In the middle of the story there are rumors that a certain person X is responsible for many achievements of the class the main character is in, but he still is not revealing himself and keeps on using his "friends" as pawns etc.\\
It would be fine if the main character was some sort of overpowered unless he is using/showing his strenght only if it´s really neccessary and just to a certain degree.\\
Maybe something the mc manipulates all his surroundings to defeat Voldemort? Maybe manipulating Harry Potter himself? Or something for the sake of Voldemort?\\
Hope you can help me out since I´ve fallen in love with this sort of genre.

  She stared up at the professors with big, innocent eyes. I grinned. Not only was Ms. Granger clever, but she was apparently an adept liar and surprisingly loyal, considering our previous lack of a relationship. If she was as talented at dueling as she was the simpler magics, she would resemble a younger, saner Bellatrix. As we hurried to our dormitory -- dismissed by the professors -- I seized the chance to recruit a new minion.

  "Hermione," I said sweetly, "Do you want to be friends?”

  Merlin bless the simple interactions of children.

  Dumbledore was a far greater dark lord than I could ever hope to be. He was fifty steps ahead of everyone else, so far ahead that -- by the time his plans came to fruition -- everyone involved had already died. My only hope was to throw him off balance by planning no steps ahead.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

  Five years after his defeat the shade of Voldemort visits Harry Potter, and has a slight accident with one of his Horcruxes. The Dark Lord wanted a new body, but this isn't what he had in mind.
