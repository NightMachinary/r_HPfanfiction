Are there H/G fics where the weasleys don't like Harry or do not approve of their relationship ?

*** Specifically, the Brennus fics that have the Weasleys not found of Harry are linkffn(Gothic by Brennus; In the Heat of the Night by Brennus, Hail Odysseus by Brennus; Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect by Brennus). linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nameless Man by Brennus) could qualify for this as well, but that is less of an opposition to Harry/Ginny and more opposition to Ginny's career/moving out. So if we count Nameless Man as 1/2 a fic where the Weasleys don't approve, that makes for 49.5% of his fics being anti-Weasleys as a whole. So pretty much every other, which I think is interesting.

Also don't read Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect. It is the stereotypical terrible, manipulative!Dumbledore first fic.

linkffn(Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always by deadwoodpecker) (and sequel) would be another.
