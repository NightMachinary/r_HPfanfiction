I'm looking for some ideas for a title to be given to Harry Potter as the Dark Lord and a name for his followers. Any ideas?


** The dread new dark lord walks through the charred door.

"You fools! it was was always about The boy-who-lived this and the chosen one that."

The frightened child looked the Dark Lord in the eye and replies, "What does that even matter, Harry Potter has nothing to do with you"

"Harry Potter is my Past, Present and Future"

The Dark Lord's wand tip glows and spells out in block letters

HARRY JAMES POTTER

slowly the letters begin to rearrange until they spell

PYJAMAS THE TERROR

The Dark Lord lifts back his cowl revealing a familiar lightning scar and cackles, "It's been me all along"

*** There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.

“Why do you care how I escaped?” said Harry slowly. “Voldemort was after your time...”

“Voldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present, and future, Harry Potter...” He pulled Harry's wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air, writing three shimmering words:

TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE

Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged themselves:

MR TOM A DILDO LOVER

Riddle looked at Harry, his face not betraying his emotions.

** There is a Harry-joins-Voldemort fic (/River Styx/), where Harry goes by the name *Dark Lord Filldeserp*. (It's Catalan for "son of snake", apparently.)

Even though the fic is supposed to be very dark and dramatic, I could't help but hear canned laughter in my head every time the character (and his name) appeared on the scene or did anything.

** You're going to need to give more context. What has he done? What does he believe? What do his followers believe he has done or is capable of doing? How serious are you trying to be or is this a crack fic?

*** Agreed. I already posted a list of crack suggestions, mostly to parody other shows or mock other characters, because a cause would lead to a theme in the naming. Voldemort was obsessed with death (and not dying), so his naming theme was focused around that.

Just look up the different Darths in the Star Wars Expanded Universe if you want something dark and edgy.

** I know I've seen The Dank Lord and his Potheads referred to before. It's just too easy a pun to resist :D

Anyway, it would appear in the HP universe, Dark Lords aren't really a thing. It's a title Voldemort seems to have brought into use for himself, or perhaps his followers did, given they couldn't say his name. I looked through the Dark Wizard wiki page, and the most they get is a sort of honorific, like the Foul, the Malicious, or the Evil - and those likely aren't self given.

I suspect even as a villain, he'd still be called the Man who Lived. After all, that in itself is a very impressive title - because he should have died multiple times.

A name for his group would depend on their aims and methods. Grindelwald's army seems to be just that.
