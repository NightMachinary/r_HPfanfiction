Hey, gang. An idea sorta strolled into my mind the other day - and resulted in a few hundred words of a draft first chapter - for a noir-ish detective story focusing on a grizzled, disenchanted and embittered Harry, who as part of a heavily-sidelined department in the Auror Office is tasked with a seemingly impossible investigation into a bizarre murder by bosses and Ministry officials that want him to fail, and want him gone.

He's half-tempted to just give up so that he can go home and retire to whatever's left of his life, but something gnaws at him as he examines the crime scene, and against his better judgement he keeps on looking. Then, even as the clues seem to reveal more questions than answers, another murder happens, this time in a far more public space. With pressure from a press that are stoking hysteria, and no support from his superiors or his - now quite distant - friends, Harry has to go deeper and further into the darkness than he thought he ever could in order to stop a deranged killer, and a part of him doesn't know if he'll come out the other side.

Inspired quite heavily by the "Detective Miller" character arc in James S.A. Corey's /The Expanse/, and also from the /Dresden Files/ - which I've just started getting my teeth into - I was wondering if there would be a market for such a story on here?

I'm not that skilled a writer, and I've got a main fic which is currently in progress so I have no idea if I even could put something proper together in any kind of timeframe, but the idea's sticking with me and won't let me leave it alone.

I even have a title: /Harry Potter and the Master of Death/

Let me know your thoughts - or if you'd be interested in reading such a story - in the comments!

*** Fair enough, apart from /The Sum of Their Parts/ I've never really enjoyed stories that follow that pattern. Although many of them have great ideas and satisfying moments, too many of them read - to me - like power-fantasies or bash-the-entire-wizarding-world to be entertaining. That and only a few of them make destroying the Ministry a challenge.

Thanks for taking the time to add your thoughts though, even with a different opinion!

It'll be in first person, as well as present tense - a style I've not used before, but something I think will work best with the tone and direction I want to take it, as well as Harry's own narrations on what's going on.

** There's always an audience for any type of story, no matter what kind it takes. I mean, have you seen some of the requests made here and what some authors are posting on FF at least? Your premise is definitely promising but I'd caution you to have an ending to your story before you start posting (if you decide to actually go through with it). You don't have to have all the details laid out but a clear and concise ending is important for this mystery/"noir-ish" story in which you can use as a compass to lead you to the end. Good luck!

** That does sound interesting. Reminds me a little bit of the Dirty Harry movie "Magnum Force" where Dirty Harry uncovered corruption that went all the way to the top. I'm interested in the background--why are Harry's friends distant? Why is his department on the fringe? What happened to the legend of the Boy Who Lived? Is he being set up by the head of the Auror department? By the Minister? He has to have someone on his side or else this will get real grim--sort of how Miller has Julie Mao, even if she is only a figment of his imagination. Who will be on Harry's side? Is it someone he wronged and he has to redeem himself to? I see potential for him pairing up with a scrappy reporter--maybe someone who grew up on the stories about Harry Potter and still believes in him. Lots of potential in this idea!

*** Magnum Force is the best Dirty Harry movie, hands down.

I like the idea of a scrappy reporter - with how I was going to involve the press anyway in the plot, such a thing wouldn't be out of place. Thanks for the idea, I'll see what I can come up with, although I do agree that Harry is gonna need at least some support, as much as I like leaving him on his own.

In terms of the background info, I'm still working a lot out - I didn't really want it to be a trio story, so I'm still developing how he could've become distant from Ron and Hermione, although I'm definitely leaning towards some kind of intrigue in the Ministry that happened early on in their careers, which led to the other two leaving its employ or just beginning to accept 'the way things are'.

For Harry, though, I wanted to put him in a nominal role in the Auror Dept, but not as a full-time field Auror. Instead, due to the machinations of higher-ups in the Ministry (for me, the idea is that Harry was too idealistic, too driven to create change and his investigations slightly /too/ thorough for some of the people at the top of the food chain) he's the sole officer of the /Pertinent Investigations Office/, essentially half cold-case room and half-archive, it's the dumping ground for Aurors that disturb the food chain too much, but are too competent or high-profile to fire completely.

In the end, the world has moved past the legend of the Boy-Who-Lived. He never made it to Auror-Captain (my replacement term for Head Auror) and Shacklebolt was replaced as Minister by someone far more /agreeable/ to certain interests early on. As a result, there are people high up in the Ministry's workings who have grudges against Harry, be it for the events of the series, or a certain investigation of his, or just because he's grown stubborn and unpleasant on top of already not accepting bribes or the like. He's a thorn in the side of a smoothly-running Ministry, but he's still slightly too important, and too good at his job as head of the PIO to be let go from the Auror Office completely.

**** I really like this idea. I like the idea that the world has moved on past him and he still hasn't really come to grips with what that means or how it could ultimately free him. He only knows one way to be, so that's how he is, rather like Roland Deschain. I think describing him as an Auror that is too competent or high-profile to simply fire is excellent.

This is a great setup for a wonderful character arc. Harry is initially presented as bitter, run down and all alone in the world, but through this case (and maybe the scrappy reporter) he realizes he doesn't have to be. I admit to being guilty of being too much in love with Harry to not see him succeed, but I think there is great potential in this setup.

*** You probably wouldn't like where I take it, then - I'm sure they'd feature, but after lots of events in Harry's personal life (the collapse of his - childless - marriage, for instance) and the aforementioned intrigues at the Ministry, coupled with this Harry's own solitary nature, they're no longer the /best/ of friends in the conventional sense. They're still best friends - who wouldn't be, after the events of the series? - but their lives have moved on a lot and Harry's... hasn't.

I wanted them to have a minor role in this story, at least for most of it. That's not to say they won't become important later, but in my mind this would be a heavily Harry-centric story, and for me to pursue the character direction I see it going in, he's best suited being separated from the trio for the most part.

*** Harry and Daphne is not my regular cup of tea but the summary was interesting enough. I looked at the reviews and it seems that the story is very polarizing, in that people either love it, with some calling it one of the best pieces they've come across on FF, or abhor it, with many complaining about Harry and Daphne's characterization.

**** I put off reading it for months, even though I am a Harry and Daphne fan. I rarely like a first person story and most writers who try their hand at noir or anything like it typically go overboard with the prose and the story creeps along like a dead snail.

However, when I did read it (due to the lack of believable Harry and Daphne fics out there) I actually got lost in the story very quickly. I found the characters were done well and, perhaps most importantly for me, the author did a great job of showing rather than telling. It is a grey story with a suitably grey ending so if you only like warm, fluffy stories or OP/omniscient Harry stories then don't touch it. However, if you enjoy a bit of mystery and intrigue and you don't mind real, believable characters then I'd say go for it.

Out of curiosity, why are you not a Harry and Daphne fan? I found a good story with that pairing when I started read fan fics and have been trying to find quality ones since. I admit, most of the time she is written as Miss Perfect or, even worse, the Ice Queen who is good at everything. However, the idea of Harry dating a Slytherin intrigues me and she's the only name in his year that is left to the imagination who could fit. I could recommend some of my favourites if you like.

***** I honestly don't have a great answer for you, in that the pair just never appealed to me. To be honest, I've read the Harry Potter series many times over and I don't recall Daphne anywhere in it. Mind you, I do like odd pairings, namely Charlie Weasley and Hermione Granger, but for some reason, Harry/Daphne just doesn't hold much weight, kind of like Draco/Hermione. I'm willing to give any story a shot, no matter what the pairing is, as "Unatoned" sounded rather intriguing. But I do share a mind with you as there aren't many quality Charlie/Hermione stories out there either.

****** Fair enough. She is only mentioned once in the books but as she is one of the only female Slytherins in Harry's year you could easily see him paired with (Pansy, Millicent and Tracey being the other girls), you can see the interest in Harry dating a pure blood Slytherin.

A fun one I really enjoyed (read it over three times) is linkffn(4079609) Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts. Mainly humour but a fun story.

Hermione and Charlie I could see, but it would have to be done well. Otherwise the whole dating Ron's brother thing is a bit hard to swallow. It's like Harry/Tonks, I guess. Any good, complete Hermione/Charlie fics you recommend?

******* That Harry/Daphne story looks interesting. Do you favor this over Unatoned? Or is it vice versa?

My favorite Charlie/Hermione stories are Games Are Afoot and Nocturnal. Games are Afoot starts really well and remains rather incredible for about 90% of the story, but the ending is really weak and disappointing. On the other hand, Nocturnal remains really good throughout as its ending is completely different from its beginning. It also displays some pretty cool imagination from the author as well, which I like. Neither story has any sort of bashing, which is extra bonus points for both of them.
