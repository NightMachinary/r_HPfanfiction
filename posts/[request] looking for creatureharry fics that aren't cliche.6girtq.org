just finished reading The Path Less Traveled by CatTales and really want more of that style


** It's been a While but perhaps linkffn(cold blood by derlacroix). I don't remember a plethora of cliche in it but i stopped reading a few chapters from the end because it was still updating. Just waiting for a perfect day to dust it off to finish reading it.
