*/Premise:/*

The, at the time, Heir of the House of Potter was taking a carriage through a rural hamlet, before being set upon by bandits. When bewitching them to leave him be he was further set upon by a mob (a mob who had intended to come to his aid) for his use of magic. His wand stripped from hin as the Muggles intended to drag him to the town square and set him ablaze.

When all was thought to be lost, a slip of a young woman bolted onto the scene and rescued him. Getting him to safety with his robes barely singed.

She was from a smaller family, a vassal of another prominent house in fact, and her Head of House (understandably) demanded payment.

The witch demanded to be married to the Heir and both Heads of Houses wrote up a rudimentary contract that promised the hand of the Potter Heir to their families Heiress.

A contract that, due to tragedy, was never fulfilled, later to be filed away within the Ministry's Archives. Unfulfilled, but still magically binding.

In the present day, after a long suffering summer, a young lady in an office within the Ministry of Magics Archives finds out that she's just hit the jackpot...

*/Applicable Ladies:/*

▪︎ /Romilda Vane/

▪︎ /Alicia Spinnet/

▪︎ /Katie Bell/

▪︎ /Angelina Johnson/

▪︎ /Milliscent Bulstrode/

▪︎ /Lisa Turpin/

▪︎ /Penelope Clearwater/

▪︎ /Lavender Brown/

▪︎ /Pansy Parkinson/

▪︎ /Septima Vector/

▪︎ /Marietta Edgecomb/

▪︎ /Megan Jones/

▪︎ /Flora Carrow/

▪︎ /Hestia Carrow/

▪︎ /Nerys Orpington/

▪︎ /Sally-Anne Perks/

*/Requirements:/*

Whichever lovely lady chosen */MUST/* have a selfish motive behind activating the marriage contract.

Love/a crush/attraction is allowed to come later, but it */MUST NOT/* start off this way.

E.g: /"Marietta Edgecomb called up her family debt as a way to get back at Harry over the SNEAK scar on her face, after seeing his blatant attraction to Cho and Ginny."/

/"Flora Carrow decides that marrying Harry will give her some form of protection from the Dark Lord and her Death Eater parents, giving her somewhere to escape to."/

/"Penelope Clearwater believes marriage to a rich family like the Potter's will help further her career in the Ministry, and allow her to get back at Percy for their horrible break-up."/

Etc.


** You know, I had an idea a month or two back that'd compliment this pretty well, I think?

Harry and X get married. her plan/scheme worked: they walked down the aisle.

Except that it went to shit in a 'be careful what you wish for' way afterwards.

Instead of settling into married life and accepting things, Harry remains bitter and holds a grudge.

Their wedding night to consummate the marriage? Despite her taking a potion to help fertility beforehand, he took a potion himself that acted like a magical condom. Neither knew of the other's potion, and it each cancelled the other out.

It was a simple, five minute 'pump and dump then rollover/sleep' thing, since he wanted it to be over and done with.

No pregnancy came of it, much to his relief.

After that, the only time he's intimate with her was to basically push her away, no matter how much she tries to spoon up to him. Their marital bed might as well be two singles pushed together.

He spends more time at work or 'out', and it's rumoured he's frequently seen with his ex-girlfriend or the girl that was almost his girlfriend.

If there was a clause in the contract that meant only he and she could have sex with each other or that it enforces fidelity, he skirts it with his 'floozy' in other ways/sex acts.

Alternatively, if there is no *coughExcough* girlfriend in the picture, he just remains celibate to spite her.

At first, she thought she could wear him down or wait out his stubbornness... until it became apparent he truly just didn't give a shit or that his hatred of her wasn't cooling.

Their anniversary, where she tried surprising him with his favourite meal and lingerie? He came home late from work and just went to bed, uncaring or not noticing.

Social occasions where they're expected to show up together? He genuinely forgets she's there, and she just ends up awkwardly standing around near him. Or he completes the bare minimum required of etiquette before skipping out, often leaving her to look around for him before realizing he'd ditched her.

Those occasions like where he's at the Weasleys or other friends? She's either snubbed or doesn't find out something went on until it'd finished days later and that he went without her.

He won't do anything for her or against her.

Yeah, her plan basically trapped her in a loveless, sexless marriage.

Or, if they're still in Hogwarts, everything but the sex thing still happens, and she can't understand why her fiance thinks she's just plain Buckbeak turds to him.

Why he doesn't want to hang around with her, and ignores her. Why he won't even kiss her on the cheek. Why he partners with other people in things like Potions.

Bonus if she's in another House and even her year-mates just look on them both with pity.

*** I love this, it feels a lot more realistic in regards to how Harry would handle things.

I'd love if Harry then got his "Ex-girlfriend" pregnant via IUI/IVF and starts raising kids with her. He hasn't cheated so the contract doesn't activate to punish him and X is furious and devastated.

Leading to Harry being seen out with his Ex and their kids and the world having to be reminded that Harry Potter has a wife and it isn't her.

/Bonus:/ Hermione and the Weasley's accept the other woman and the kids as the real Potter family. All whilst the wife watches in horror as Minister for Magic Hermione Granger is slowly introducing the concept of divorce to the Wizagmot.

****** Celestine Warbeck has married 3 times, so divorce is definitely a thing in Wizarding Britain.

But marriage contracts might have more stringent clauses.

*** I think that would only really work if it's a shorter or crack fic- it would be pretty depressing to keep reading that for a long time. Like as a 1-3 chapter one, it'd be a fun reversal of the tropes.

(Then again I have found that I'm a sucker for well done, unlikely romances - which is what the plot device that marriage contracts are are done to facilitate).

**** Kinda agree. It wouldn't be that long as a standalone, though I could see it is a sort of epilogue to a longer fic.

** I vote the Carrow twins. Not enough happens with them in fanfics. They could both pull off a legal loophole to get the both of them into it to escape the Dark Lord and the Slytherin Common Room. Both of them would help bring out Harry's Slytherin side. Toss in a re-sort because of the contract or a married quarters.

I do have ulterior motives. I just want to see the twins meet Fred and George. DOUBLE TWIN SPEAK!

*** I genuinely forget (and guarantee I will pretty soon) that there was a set of Carrow twins around when Harry went to Hogwarts. And those are perfectly reasonable motives!
