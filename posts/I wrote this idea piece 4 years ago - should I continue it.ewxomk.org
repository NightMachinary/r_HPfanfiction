** You should never leave a fic unfinished, even though you seem to have ended this one. Epic length fics are amazing to read however long they take to write. Take some of the ‚Äúthreads‚Äù and create a new story. I'm currently reading one that has taken 6+ years and is at 1.2mil words. Enjoy writing. Never stop learning. üëçüèº

** I'm interested. In the end most people I think prefer to read something imperfect that is finished, rather than something that is perfect and doesn't go anywhere. I'm definitely following the story, and I hope you do end up finishing it. :)

** Black Bond by Rajatarangini, and it's amazing. Angsty, but great character and world building.
