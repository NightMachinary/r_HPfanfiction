I have a rough outline for this character. I don't know whether I'll be using an OC or a canonical name for them but the rough outline is that they're an Unspeakable, so drawing from that they are intelligent, talented and fairly curious. I feel like he would end up with someone on his intellectual level (since Sirius was a pretty clever guy). They would also have to be close to James in this one, since he was basically Sirius's lifeline and his brother in all but blood. Whether they're originally friendly with him or later on down the line I don't know, but they end up like siblings because James obviously matters a lot to Sirius and I think he'd appreciate someone loving him and appreciating how much Sirius spends so much time around him, without objecting.

The main problem is, I don't really know the personality he'd end up with. In general, I don't like Sirius/Hermione or Sirius/Remus for some reasons, but I feel like the way Remus is portrayed (dry and subtle humor, calm and placid but also really mischievous) is someone who'd fit well with him. However, I don't know if they'd be more of a stick in the mud at first but later have their mischievous side drawn out by him later on. I like the idea of most likely her (I think the posters were Rowling trying to tell us Sirius was straight but I'm not entirely sure it's that solid of proof), being an Unspeakable because she'd have to be secretive about her work and Sirius not being able to know anything would drive him into wanting to know, since he had a pretty good sense of wanting to unravel mysteries and the department has just a lot of them.

I also think they'd not be really eyeing him all the time but wouldn't be fallible to his charisma. That sounds really cliché though, so I don't know about actually including that into their personality.

These are the only traits I have actually managed to gather. Do you have any input about what kind of partner Sirius would end up with? What does Sirius /need/ from a life partner, something to 'complete' him and balance him out without being an entirely new person for the sake of the pairing? It's not a romance plot, and by the time the story starts they're actually long since together. They aren't even the focus, but Harry is.

Edit: The story starts in 1994, Sirius never goes to Azkaban and James and Lily are alive. Pettigrew never turned traitor and Voldemort is still at large and the Order of the Phoenix has disbanded into into groups, one of which Sirius is the leader. The Sirius here has had a lot of time to mature from 22 years old and he's never had to endure any trauma beside Lupin dying sometime during the story.


** This AU is before Azkaban and before the death of James? You have a pretty different person before and after.

I think the fundamental thing is acceptance. He didn't have it at home. He does for perhaps the first time with James, and it inspired lifelong loyalty. The one time he got a little nasty with Harry (hanging up the Floo call), it's because "he" is "rejected," even if Harry was only concerned about his safety. He is who he is, and he's not going to change himself for a relationship that he doesn't really need when he has such a tight bond with his friends.

(This is why I've never enjoyed Hermione/Sirius; I think she's too controlling and nitpicky to make for a really natural pairing with him.)

Someone: * politically and morally aligned. He walked out on his family over differences here, it's non negotiable. * with shared interests and a similar personality, so there's an undercurrent of friendship, even if they don't begin that way. Those have been the most positive relationships in his life and what he'd (subconsciously or not) model. * emotionally open, and patient, and trustworthy. Even if this is before the worst of it for him, he'd already had a rough go of it, and his natural inclination is to brood and close up. So a person who can break him out of that, but not force it.

Definitely not a 'enemies to lovers' trope. Once he's got your number (/Snape/) he's so done with you. It would be Herculean to change his mind.

For the love of all of fanfic, the world doesn't need another idiot!Sirius to build up his partner's intelligence. Keep him in canon. His first magic in thirteen years is to conjure manacles from thin air with his /enemy's wand/. He basically guesses the GoF plot from a couple bits of gossip and a newspaper. It's possible for two people to be smart in a relationship, despite every single fanfic written to the contrary.

Is he young and fighting the war here? If so, I think you have the added challenge of building an OC that gives him something his mates cannot. (And not just sex; Sirius is notably good looking and charismatic. He could get just the physical bits without much issue, I'd imagine.) Anyone who comes into his orbit during the first war is another potential person he's got to protect, needs to fear for, who might be hurt by his death, takes time away from the Order, etc. I'd think sparks need to fly and quick, or he's not going to bother.

**** Not OP but I have a headcanon that Sirius really loved making models and charming them into things that would give Arthur Weasley a field day at work. Some of them, like the motrobike are for his own use. Others might be for defensive magic, used as protection for the Order and his house. Some of them might even be little trinkets and gifts he might give his mates. I also like to think he loved hanging around animals (his friends in canon were 1/3 animals). And as you said, the crossword obviously. I like to think that for Order work, he would sneak secret codes into the crosswords that would be the passwords to gain entry into Headquarters.

**** Anything you want! In canon, he doesn't have a whole hell of a lot of time for hobbies so we don't know much. You can read between the lines a bit...

Crosswords.

The motorcycle is another obvious one. The posters. Hagrid, who refers to him distantly as “young Sirius Black” still knew that he “loved that thing.” But more than that, he charmed it, and we know muggle electronics and magic don't mix. There are manuals around his room. Combine that with his restless personality and the success of the Marauder's inventions, and I completely agree with [[/u/Bookwork_Potterhead][u/Bookwork_Potterhead]]'s headcanon. Sirius was probably the “tinkerer” of the group. James would come up with the crazy ideas and he'd figure it out.

Quidditch. No canon evidence that he played (or not), but he knew Ludo Bagman by his reputation as a beater. He risked getting his soul sucked to watch Harry fly. James ‘Quidditch Captain' Potter is his favorite person.

He seems to be an animal lover and has a good relationship with them. He probably took CoMC as his elective (/oh, getting past dragons is simple/). Freedom loving guy, who grew up in a darkened, decaying town house---I figure he's outdoorsy or likes to spend time in fresh air, as unlike his childhood as possible.

Politics/current events, see especially the GoF cave scene when he is the info dump. He's pretty openly disdainful of hypocritical sources of power: Barty Crouch Sr. (who, to be fair, ruined his life) and even the way he drags his grandfather for his Order of Merlin (“it means he just gave them a load of gold”). He fought in a rebel organization. He left his family over political differences, essentially.

Music. Would love to know if God Rest Ye Merry Hippogriffs is a wizard Christmas classic or if he made it up. I think there's a piano in Grimmauld Place, but I may be confusing the movies and books. It's my personal headcanon that the Stubby Boardman/Sirius Black rumors came from /somewhere/.

+Fanon Sirius Black really cares about his flowing locks.+

I didn't meant to suggest that your OC should mirror him (unless you want to write that, of course!) More that, he'd look for someone who can at least enjoy his interests as a way to spend quality time, rather like a friend would. So maybe not a mechanic but not someone who can feign interest when he begins to talk about bench seats on a Bonneville.

***** I'm definitely not interested in creating a carbon copy of Sirius. In fact I really hate the 'carbon copy' that's in fact just a misinterpretation of Canon!Sirius to have him be a boisterous, goofy and flirtatious guy who also obviously smokes. Basically why I pretty much most Marlene/Sirius. I think Sirius was a pretty moody guy at times and based off the little we have if him in canon he shuts himself completely out when he's upset and he doesn't need an equally moody, passive aggressive person. I believe that'd be a disfunctional relationship. The thing is, this OC will play a huge role in the story as a side plot later on and since Remus is dead, James is already married and in hiding and Peter is abroad, that leaves them.

In this fic, Sirius barely sees his friends for the above reasons, although he and James try as hard as they can to meet up, especially when Peter is around. He obviously relies on him a lot and I'm not undermining how much James matters to him in this story since I love the James/Sirius bromance. I think he completely trusts them as well, and they trust him back. I also believe they'd have friends that Sirius would notice how loyal they are to, and since he would like them to be at the very least friendly with James, he'd have to be friendly with their friends as well. Strangely enough, I already fleshed out two of these character's best friends and they have names, background stories and all. Which is odd, come to think of it. They're on the light side of the war and I'm pretty settled on Slytherin rather than Ravenclaw although that could easily change.

I'm just unsure what the core traits of their characters could be. I sometimes refer to MBTI types, although they're not exactly reliable but give me vague ideas. I think Sirius is ENTP (although, is he in fact as extroverted as we'd like to believe? He isn't very open with a lot of people, even when young and I don't see him being the planner of every single party or even a regular participant). I don't like to believe that oh since he's ENTP, then they have to also match that. I also look at patronuses (Lily and James are a stag and a doe, Ron and Hermione's compliment each other, Harry and Ginny are both animals that are associated with being free and wild while Tonks shifted to Lupin). Sirius is a grim but I can't think of many other animals other than wolves that are associated with loyalty, aside from wolves (and Remus is dead for plot reasons and I don't want them to resemble him too much). I looked at the death and impending doom factor and came up with a thestral, although that's a magical animal and too many Mary Sues to my taste have thestral patronuses. Although they are not a central character. Do you have any ideas? There's also the 'opposites attract' thing and a cat is a thought that I've entertained.

What patronus would you pick as a starting point to flesh out their personality? What fits with a big, black dog?

I also believe that the softer, more thoughtful and gentle side of Sirius we see with James, Buckbeak and Crookshanks would come out, although what would bring it out other than complete trust and acceptance? Remus and Peter loved and accepted him, but he always went back to James, why?

Another question relating to hobbies and the like: would you see Sirius taking Arithmancy/ancient runes/alchemy or just settle for the old divination + COMC? I know he's intelligent but is he really the studious type? For what's it worth, he's also an auror in this fanfiction and goes out on private missions of his own that relate to curse-breaking. Can you also see him reading as a hobby ?

****** Your story sounds interesting. Good luck with writing it and I hope you'll post it here when finished!

You mentioned the boisterous Sirius that reads more fanon than canon, and wondered whether he's an “E”. (I love MBTI too. I always get, like, 49/51 at the E/I divide, so I also understand the personality type that can appear really outgoing but considers themselves an introvert at heart.) I think he probably /is/ more of an “E” type, but I do wonder how much of that is because the bits we get in canon, he is so lonely. It's kind of a skewed perception. He does tend to close up when he's upset, he needs his space, the entire year he was on the run he did so without help. I agree with you that he‘s more reserved than people tend to write him. He's got a really good mask. Also, James is sort of a special case, where he seemed to want to be around him all the time. But their relationship seems like the exception, not the rule. In either event, I would bet a partner who is more of “E” herself would be more complimentary.

I pegged him for COMC and divination, probably ancient runes. I know the tattoos are movie canon +and honestly so stupid that he “got them in Azkaban” like holy fuck have the producers even read these books+, but I totally love the tattooed Sirius with his magic enhancing runes trope. They're deeply magical and intuitive and no one really knows how to control them; that's very much up his alley. Arithmancy is just math, right? If you push the mechanical brain, with the motorcycle etc., then he probably enjoyed that to a small degree. Muggle Studies for damn sure. The thing is, Sirius tried to act all cool about not studying in Snape's Worst Memory, and like---been there, done that. But, BCJr. gets twelve OWLs. Hermione does too, I think. So do the elder Weasleys. That's more OWLs than there are slots for classes (Rowling's math is so hilarious to me. Same, girl.) Assuming that the year containing Snape, Lily---Slughorn's favorite potion's student, and the Marauders is not below average (it ain't), then James and Sirius had to get around a dozen too to be among the top students in their year. Maybe he didn't take all those electives, but he probably at least sat the test +just to show off+. I wouldn't call him studious, but someone naturally curious, who would go deep into anything that meets that sweet spot of interesting and challenging. I could very much see him as a reader for things that stimulate him in that way, just not the sort who will devote four hours to a bullshit essay for the sake of it.

I love that you have him a curse-breaker, by the way. I figure that or a Newt Scamander sort for him, if he ever had the opportunity to have a job.

Have you looked at other loyal animals, like horses, swans, eagles? It's not just compatibility but happy memories; so your patronus frequently takes a similar form because your partner is your source of many happy memories. Personally, I wouldn't worry too much about having them complimentary to start; they may well end up there down the line.

******* Thank you for the wishes.i'm currently fleshing out the characters and the plot and I think I'm starting soon.

I think in canon once James started dating Lily and spending more time around her, Sirius was happy for them both and became a sort of brotherly figure to Lily but he was still feeling kind of not let in on a part of James's life that he knew he could never be involved in. I think this also increased when he went into hiding. While he feels happy, for them truly he's also a bit upset, unfairly at that and he recognises it so he just shuts it off but James always takes notice and he's the only one to.

Do you have reason to think Sirius would take divination because I am confused by the common perception that he took it 100%. I also can see that at a time where the population was higher and with a year as talented as his, they didn't need time turners. Since he's a cursebreaker as a side job, I think being well versed in Arithmancy is necessary to him. I like the idea of ancient runes and Sirius, reminds me a bit of Blackpool. I'm pretty confident in Muggle studies and COMC but if he takes two more then he would need a time turner unless it was a side subject. I don't see him very studious.

What do you think of a Sirius paired up with a more grounded and sensible version of Luna Lovegood? Basically, a mashup of Luna and Lupin, where she has the subtle humor (I think I've settled on a she) of Lupin, as well as his perceptive nature and compassion with a sprinkle of his common sense but also Luna's creativity and imagination, not being afraid to stand out in the crowd and being very ambitious about seemingly outlandish ideas that, unlike Luna, actually do have a basis in fact. She can have a bit of an offbeat sense of humour like Luna's, though. Her bluntness is intentional, unlike her but also a bit embarrassing especially when it's snuck it with the subtlety of Remus. Most importantly has the ambition to prove herself and is driven by very personal goals.

Can you also see Sirius paired up with a Snape-type of spy? Not the personality is Snape, just his position as a spy. I see Sirius as a very confrontational person and someone who is a spy would let him see that fighting the war isn't just about being on the front lines and doing recon work. If I do adopt the plot line of Sirius and Snape forced to work together later on, he'd think a bit more maturely about Snape as a spy, through her, although she'd have to stop being an Unspeakable because that's too much. Maybe working in Flourish and Blotts.

I was also thinking about a Newt Scamander type of job, I think that while it provides the thrill of adventure it doesn't give him the satisfaction of a good mystery to solve, or some ominous things with a sense of danger. On a similar note, I actually see Sirius's animagus form as a grim. Not a big black dog of a typical breed but an actual grim. What makes him look not like one is because his form has pale eyes instead of red ones. Is that plausible? I like a swan so far, especially because black swans are sometimes associated with death which lines up nicely with Sirius's form. I can also think of a coyote, although I don't know if they're considered particularly loyal.

I'm also sorry for the late reply.

** I like reading first wizarding war stories so I hope you do write this!

My gut feeling would be that the only people he ever got close to/loved during this time (in canon) were the other marauders and maybe Lily. Remus seems like the obvious choice for romance. He's not a pureblood and he's a werewolf, which Sirius the rebellious teenager would prize highly. Personalitywise with those two you can either go with opposites attract, or you can argue that they're very similar (courageous, good fighters, strong beliefs, need to overthrow the Death Eaters because of their beliefs, mischief makers and the fact that Sirius's animagus is a canine, which could be seen as JKR's nod to the perfect partner for a werewolf).

I've seen a few stories that use a James/Lily/Sirius ship, which I think has potential in theory but I've not read one that's well-written.

Creating an OC for the time you're thinking might work really well. I'd decide how Sirius has developed during the war first to decide on what sort of person to match him with. Is he still fun-loving, overly arrogant etc or has he become more focused and serious? During the canon first war he most likely either slept around a lot and never formed attachments, or didn't do any type of relationships at all outside of the Marauders and possibly the Order. I believe JKR was asked on twitter why he never married before Azkaban, and her reply was that he was too busy being a rebel. I think it makes sense that he spent all his effort on fighting for the Order and whatever was left over with James and the others.

From what you write about your story, it maybe could be someone he's been seeing casually to let off steam with and then there's some sort of dramatic event that means they end up closer together? Maybe Lupin's death could be that. Or could be Marlene McKinnon's sibling who is the only one saved when the rest of the family is killed by the Death Eaters, and they look for revenge together? Whoever the love-interest is, they would probably have to be in the Order with Sirius for him to have time for them. Whoever it is would have to get along really well with James, I think that would be Sirius's first requirement. Maybe it could be another werewolf, or maybe a muggle or squib?

** Personally, I find Sirius to be incredibly mentally broken after Azkaban and a LOT of his 'intelligence' in long gone. Soul sucking will do that to you.

Sirius needs someone to take care of his broken ass and to help him come to terms with 12 years of violence against him.

Also, Sirius really doesn't seem to grasp that Harry is, well, HARRY, and not just James from his youth, seeing as Sirius wasn't all that old when he lost his best friend and then was mentally raped for 12 years. I dunno, there's just something about how he calls Harry 'James' and really acts as though Harry is his friend, not his godson.

TBH, if he hadn't died, he would be with Remus. Wolfstar all the way. Remus is his balance and understands Sirius as well as knowing how to cope with him.

*** This brings up the old book canon versus movie canon debate. Book Sirius never calls Harry “James” and is openly offended by the suggestion that he's confused. Plus, rather than acting like Harry is his buddy, Sirius spends so much of GOF warning Harry to be careful that Harry gets annoyed, knowing that Sirius was reckless in his own youth.

I also disagree about Sirius' intelligence being gone. He comes very close to unraveling the entire GOF mystery while sitting in a cave with almost no information.

So as to the original question about who Sirius would be with... you'll never get even close to a fandom consensus. Fandom can't agree on the most basic tenants of who Sirius is, or even whether he's gay/straight/bisexual/asexual.

(My opinion? Someone smart who has the approval of his surviving friends. Someone brave enough to balance him out when he's worked up about something. Probably not a pure blood because he has so many negative associations with the whole concept. And perhaps someone quiet/unassuming he would have overlooked as a very young man.)
