This is more of a question than anything, but I really want to know if anyone knows this fanfic at all. It about a young Harry who dies, and some police discover his body, Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall are preparing his body for a secret funeral, and then Snape decides to go back in time and save and raise Harry as there own. He moves them to a populated island to raise Harry. I don't know who wrote it, or even how I remember most of what happened, but I'm really interested in reading it again, I hope someone knows!?


** Is it Fixing Past Mistakes linkffn(10101403)? I quit before they got to the island, but everything else checks out, from what I remember

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE
