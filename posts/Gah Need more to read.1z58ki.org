#+begin_quote
  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
#+end_quote

Complete, sequel is expected.

Sirius is one of the main characters here but he won't appear often until the second half of the story.

** A general recommendation:

Sign up to the Dark Lord Potter Forums. They've been an active community for years where people post, beta, and link to their favorite stories. A lot of the best fics got a jump-start there, and I've found a few new ones that are very good also.

The section where authors submit new fics for crowd-sourced betas are also good, since they provide a rating system for users to vote on how good they think a fic is (1-5 stars).

It's great, and I'm just as hooked to it as [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]].
