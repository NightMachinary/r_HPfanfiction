Are there fics that involve the type of crazy that Marty Mcfly goes through?

What I imagine is Potter, after Hogwarts, inteacting with a Doc Brown type character, whether muggle or magical that messes up the time stream or wibbly wobbly timey-wimey stuff that spawns time variants A,B, and C.

Hell plus points if it features a Delorean and a Time travelling train.
