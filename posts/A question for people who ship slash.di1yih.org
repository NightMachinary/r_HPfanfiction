Why is Harry / Ron not a thing? Or at least not a more popular thing?

Im not saying this as someone who ships them. I actually dont. Ive never once thought of this ship.

I just dont know why.

Im not against Slash

I read the books Harry and Ron are super close in the books. So much so that Hermione even third wheels their friendship. I know Harry and Ron are just friends in the books and the story doesnt necessarily play out to support their romance.

But thats true for Harry /Hermione Harry/ Draco Harry/ Daphne Harry/Luna Harry/ literally anyone

Its not like fics dont play around with plot and ships that make 0 sense in canon make perfect sense in the plot of the fic.

So why not with Harry/Ron?

Ive heard people say oh well they just seem like friends to me. But why though? There are plenty of other characters Harry considers just friends who people ship with him. So whats different about Ron?


** Harry slash lacks variety to begin with, but...

- he's not a fan favorite
- he's, on paper, a male Ginny, who also isn't a fan favorite
- he's not a bad boy
- he's the most ordinary person in the entire series

**** Why does everyone blame the movies? Even if you use just book stuff (and limit yourself to in-universe explanations), that doesn't paint a very favourable picture of him, and the epilogue is especially awful in that regard (the movies even did Ron a favour there since they cut his assault on his driving instructor).

For example, I've read PoA countless times, and I've seen the movie often as well. I never paid much attention to who stands in front of Harry and those fan favourite scenes were never something I spent much time on because a serial killer could have easily slaughtered all three of them. Especially since Sirius is infamous for blowing up an entire street with one spell. Same goes for werewolves. Lupin would make mincemeat out of them all. The order of death would not be consequential as they all would die within a few minutes.

Especially since Ron probably knew about the dragon through Charlie (if he knew Charlie was in Britain, he knew why) and didn't tell Harry. Harry could have died.

Also, the Yule Ball. I've been envious and jealous of a lot of people in my life, but never did I act like Ron that day. Not at 12, not at 14 and not at 18. Hell, I don't know anyone who acted in such a fashion.

And Ron was certainly not in the right, bringing an illegal pet to a school where it was prey for two of the three sanctioned pets is simply stupid. His actions towards Hermione were dickish (she was a dick to Lavender though). And he never apologised for the wrong accusations.

Plus he learned from it. By your logic with the Horcrux, Ginny's views was that she should start attacking muggleborns.

The pet was not illegal. I hate it when people say that. It's just that you're only allowed 1 owl, cat, or toad. Percy had him as a pet.

Owls pretty much eat everything else on the pets list on occasion in real life. If Hedwig starts trying to eat Crookshanks, do we blame Hermione for that?

#+end_quote

Ron shows concern until he realizes Harry snarls at him.

Ginny did face a Horcrux. You can't blame her for her actions, so by extension, anything Ron did is also fairly blame proof. Unless you're talking about hating on insecurities only acted upon when influenced by a piece of Voldemort as a character flaw?

Let's talk about the owl. Owls have a variety of species and the larger ones in fact will prey on cats if given a good opportunity. It is not their general prey, but it was used as an example here because it is possible. If Crookshanks was repeatedly attacked by Hedwig, would Harry or Hermione be at fault?

Percy is a fairly rule abiding citizen. It's not proof in of itself, but it does support the argument. The rat was not explicitly banned and in fact was a pet for a known stickler for the rules.

I repeat, the rat was not banned and that list is not exclusive. What that list implies is that if Harry decided to get a cat, he would have to return his owl, or if Hermione got an owl, she could not have a cat.

************ I'm saying that Ron's biggest worry was if Harry banged Hermione, which is a pretty awful priority to have when she could have been dead for all Ron knew. Or taken by Death Eaters. Yes, the Horcrux isn't a boggart but merely wants to drive Ron away, but there should be more effective ways to get that done. For example a vision of the Lestranges brothers taking turns with Ginny while saying how it was all Harry's fault while his brothers are bleeding out and Molly is savaged by Greyback as retaliation for Ron coming back to Harry. Add enough horrifying details and that vision should be able to drive Ron away if he had his priorities straight. Instead there are his best friends making out and taunting him a little. Given the alternatives, one of which I outlined above, it puts Ron in a bad light.

Ron should be on his knees begging Hermione for forgiveness, not worrying if she has slept with Harry. Because Ron should know that Harry wouldn't do anything Hermione didn't want, something you can't say for the likes of the Lestrange brothers.

***** Ok here the thing about the books. Even though the book isnt the nicest to Ron all the time he still has his moments and because of this you have people who call out the narrative like pointing out how the narrative paints Ron in a negative light for being jealous but paints Hermione as sympathetic for being jealous.

But in the movies the positive aspects are cut out all together or given to other characters. So you only have the negative traits with none of the positive. Also his impact on the surrounding characters is lessened.

In the books there are alot of small scenes with Ron and Harry you really get to see and feel that bond. So its depressing and jarring when hes not friends with Harry with Harry for a bit in book 4 and 7. In the movies because they have to cut more out this effect is lost. But not just that. In moments where his presence or abscence could have been noted its not.

In book 7 when Ron leaves Hermione and Harry are really bummed out . Its depressing without Ron things are awkward and uncomfortable between them. They work best together during like intense activity and brainstorming together. If they have to lounge around together its boring to them without Ron.

The same thing happened in book 4 when Ron wasnt talking to him. But in the movies Hermione and Harry get along so well that Ron just feels unnecessary. His abscence isnt really felt at all. In the end of movie 6 when Hermione gives the we going with you Harry speech Ron kinda just sits in the back doesnt even stand next to him.

In the books Hermione third wheels their friendship and Ron is the glue almost. Hermione might have fights with Ron and Harry and stop talking to them but its never as jarring as Ron and Harry. Hermione and Harry as a pair is very awkward romantically or platonically.

In the movies Harry and Hermione work way better together Ron feels entirely unnecessary minus being comic relief and Harry Hermione not being the couple just seems weird.

Essentially while both have flaws Book Ron and Movie Ron just end up being different characters.

** Personally, I'm not a fan of Harry/Ron or Harry/Hermione precisely because they're such close friends. To me, Harry always seemed to share a more brotherly/sisterly relationship with Ron and Hermione respectively.

In general, I'd probably put it down to Ron not being a fan favourite, as well as the deeply unfavourable portrayal that he got in the movies. His humour and his loyalty were downplayed, and that made him an easily bashable and to an extent, unlikeable character. A large part of it might also be down to whether people preferred, aesthetically speaking, Tom Felton or Rupert Grint, for example.

People tend to write pairings between two characters they like, not because it makes sense. That's the same for all ships, slash or no. Those that have some kind of chemistry to begin with wind up being the most popular.

***** I cant really speak to the fics before the movies as I only got into fics long after the movies came out and I have no idea what the fics were like pre 2001 before the first movie came out. But in my experience in books 1-3 people seemed to like Ron decently well. Hermione was the one they had more mixed feelings on.

It was book 4 where people got pretty pissed by Ron. His fight with Harry was pretty jarring because Ron was such a constant presence even more so than Hermione who was paralyzed in book 2 and had a fight with Harry and Ron distancing herself for a good chunk of book 3. Harry and Ron on the other hand had been inseperable for 3 books from the moment they met. So it felt much more isolating for Harry and it was over something Harry didnt even do but Ron had accused him falsely of. So it made his actions stand out even more as horrible than if Harry had been less attached to Ron.

Ron had another horrible moment by making Hermione feel like shit after the Yule ball. So overall that was I think when the favorite friend started shifting. But you still had 3 books of Ron being very likable before this point.

But then Chamber of secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban came out as movies. Ron started to look like a nothing character. Not bad persay just kinda boring while Hermione started looking much more interesting due to toning down her flaws and giving her Rons better qualities. And therefore the dynamic of their friendship shifted. Harry and Ron were less close in the movies. Their bond was emphasized less and since Hermione got alot of the better qualities of Ron the aspects of Ron that made it easy for Harry to get along with him applied to Hermione now so their dynamic seemed better. Hermione never seperated from the group in movie 3 either. So now in movie 4 instead of it being jarring because of how close Ron is and all his positive qualities its just you getting a poor opinion of the least interesting member of the movie trio. And movie Ron never recovered.

While there were positives of the book version to go back into the movies were more influential and that depiction of Ron started seeping in.

So while you could say Ron was never a fan favorite i do think that he was popular enough that shipping would have been considered had the movie potrayal been closer to book canon. Especially pre movie 4.

****** I CAN speak to it because I WAS around then, mainly LiveJournal and the like. After book three came out is really when the fandom first started exploding with meta and fic. Ron and Hermione just weren't as popular. I remember Ron actually had some heated debates around his wand in book two (why he didn't inform his parents he needed a new wand because it was affecting his ability to learn properly versus him being sympathetic to his parents' financial situation). In book three more people actually took Hermione's side in the Ron vs Hermione fight over Scabbers and Crookshanks. Hell, I even remember people disliking the initial encounter with Ron on the train in the first book.

And then book four came out, and even more people were unhappy with Ron over everything you mentioned.

My point: Ron might have been likeable, but that doesn't mean he was well-liked, and I remember a lot of the reasons that people have as to why.

The first movie didn't come out until over a year after the release of book four. In other words, fans in the early days had no foresight of what was to come in terms of Ron's development.

I'm truthfully uncertain of fics written prior to book three's release because book three is when I first heard of the books, read them, and joined the fandom. The first big slash pairings were Draco/Harry and Sirius/Remus. I'd even venture a guess and say that Sirius/Remus was more popular than Draco/Harry in the early days (the LJ communities definitely had more members in SxL vs DxH, anyway), likely because they were adults and writing romances about very very young characters weirds some people out (which would be another strike against writing slash about Ron, at least in the fandom's formative years).

******* That is otetty interesting and yes for me personally Drarrys chemistry is like dramione in the sense its based in potentials and what if scenarios. While Wolfstar is popular based on their canonical interactions and because of potentials and what if situations. So Wolfstar has more shipping fuel than Drarry. Thats not to say one is better but one has more fuel to be popular.

So there could be a bigger resurrgence of it since those who were kids and grew up with the fics are now adults in the fandom and Sirius abd Remus aren't unpopular characters. But its possible they might gravitate towards Harrys gen as adults as opposed to the Marauders gen.

**** I'd argue it depends a lot on how the romance is set up. If you go down the popular mutual pining route, that indeed feels a little odd. But I know quite a few couples from school who were friends who decided to try dating and worked out.

I think what a lot of fiction authors get wrong is the order of things because love is, in most cases, something that needs time to develop. Perhaps it's something cultural, but I don't know a single example of people who declared their love before kissing, something incredibly common to read. Quite a few of my class mates got together simply because they were comfortable around each other, didn't find each other hideous and wanted in on the couple stuff. The feelings came later, or never at all. One girl made out with a bloke she had just met because he had a tongue piercing and she wanted to know what that would feel like on her tongue.

Oh I do too, I'm not saying that close friends can't become romantically attached, it's the the whole idea that these kids were around each other /all the time/ for 10 months out of the year since they were were preteens. They didn't have just a "see each other regularly" friendship for 10 months out of the year, but rather a "take every non-elective class together, take meals together, study together, go through dangerous adventures together," relationship. And on their downtime, they /still/ hung out with each other. To me, that kind of interaction is way more likely to develop a sibling-type relationship, rather than foster any kind of romantic feelings.

****** I thought the cutoff for sibling attachment was 6. At least from a psychological perspective.

I can certainly think of a few moments where canon could spawn romantic involvements. Hermione comforting Harry after Cho, Harry comforting Hermione when Ron got together with Lavender, Harry comforting Lavender...

A rebound is not the best foundation for a relationship, I freely admit that. But there is a difference between "Let's see if I can still score in a bar" and "shoulder to lean on". Even if the wishful "sometimes, you will make someone very happy" is very cliché.

Of course, you can always the rather badly written "noticing". Sometimes, you just spontaneously develop a crush on someone you have known for a long time, be it through an action, a piece of clothing, a new haircut, the lighting or even an idle thought. I feel like this is the most realistic start for a crush, and simultaneously the most difficult to write properly because it is very easy to oversell the crush in the narrative. As soon as the MC notices someone, they have big tits, long legs and a pert arse. Which is rather unbelievable for, let's say Hermione.

Post movies, simply because Ron's actor is probably the least conventionally attractive of all the pairing options within Harry's age range.

Having said that, there definitely was /some/ - I would hazard to say a higher ratio of it pre the movies, I remember reading some! An additional difficulty/change of pairing Harry/Ron as an author is who to then pair Hermione with, especially if you want to avoid Dramione.

** I think it's two things. Ron's relationship with Harry, the way it's written, comes off as properly familial, in a way not many other shippable characters are. This is the main reason I don't ship Harry/Hermione either. I, at least, don't see much potential there for tension of the romantic or sexual variety. The best Harry/Ron I've read is the Two Households series by Mad_Martha on ao3 and that has Slytherin!Harry and Gryffindor!Ron in a slightly adversarial relationship when the story begins. Harry and Ron are very much in character, and the progression of their relationship feels almost painfully real at times, so you should read it if you haven't already. If it was just them being friends, Wolfstar wouldn't have become the second most popular pairing in HP. Wolfstar is supported by the prose in the books so heavily that you don't even have to look at it sideways to pick up on it. Sirius and Remus aren't "just friends", there's something more already there.

The second thing is that a long, long time ago a few fans saw Draco's bratty behaviour as pigtail pulling and Harry and Draco being "archenemies" as UST, and Drarry ate up most of the slash part of this fandom, and somehow enemies to lovers became the most common slash dynamic in HP, at least for Harry. I'm a hardcore slash shipper and ship Harry with non-standard people who are just popular enough that I get one or two quality fics every few months, so I understand your pain, but once a ship makes an impression, it becomes very hard for people to look at things in other ways.

Enemies to lovers is one of the most popular tropes in the shipping community though so it's not very surprising that Drarry became so popular. Tom Felton is very attractive and he and Harry seem a bit obsessed with one another in canon. Despite hating each other, they have amazing chemistry together and tons of potential for an emotionally charged relationship. I don't care for this ship, but can easily see why it's the most common in the fandom. Ron just lacks the sexy bad boy vibe and his and Harry's interactions are more brotherly and boring in comparison to Draco.

That's not how I would describe the attempted use of an unforgivable or several acts of terrorism which nearly killed two of Harry's friends and constituted several war crimes.

***** There is no need to bring your nazi argument into this. But of course you don't see the sexual chemistry since you are presumably a straight guy. The actors are both hot and have great on screen chemistry as actors = this translates to them getting shipped by teenage girls and women in general.

This is also fanfiction so anything can be changed. Make Draco less of a whiny brat who can change his mind on death eater stuff and bam, you have yourself a redemption plot. The details regarding war crimes don't matter since those can be changed or glossed over. Just like you are fine with Harry/Bellatrix pairing (probably because she is also hot), others are fine with Draco because he is hot and want to read more about him. I don't even care about this pairing but as a a straight woman it's obvious to me as to why he is so popular.

****** I am fine with Bellatrix and Malfoy pairings under one specific circumstance, each. For Malfoy, that would be scepticism after year 1, for Bellatrix a change of heart after Azkaban (she needs to be punished after all) and before the DoM (so Sirius isn't an issue). I can't see a Malfoy pairing work after his actions during CoS, much less after his actions towards Hagrid and Buckbeak. Same with Bellatrix. Once Sirius dies, no game.

No. If looks were the objective, I'd simply go for Harry or Hermione with Andromeda after the war since they look almost the same but Andromeda is the lone good Slytherin from canon and has balls the size of a small moon. She's even 1-4 years younger and hasn't been in a gulag for a decade. Bellatrix is appealing because she is basically the Vader of Harry Potter, the competent evil enforcer. Put her on the good side and the Death Eaters are in for a pounding.

******** Yes, because at that point Neville is not as close to them as after the DoM. Neville is an acquaintance, Sirius is Harry's last father figure. And like I said, the only reason I find Bellatrix acceptable in that scenario is because she has served more than a decade in the worst place on earth. She has been punished for her past, with an inhumane severity. If that isn't enough to atone for mistakes, you don't need prisons since the only alternative would be executions. Which would mean Snape, Malfoy and the lot have to die as well.

As I said, there is exactly one scenario where Bellatrix would work, which would require her to ditch Voldemort because she does, under no circumstances, wants to return to Azkaban. I feel like being tortured by soul-sucking demons for a decade can cause that change of heart.

********** No, she was punished for her crimes by Azkaban. On a personal level, her turnaround would be acceptable because Harry does not care about Neville as much as about Sirius. Especially once Bellatrix saves his, Hermione's or Ron's life, which would be a given in the plotline I have in mind. And romance would take a few years to get going as there would be a lot of issues to work through.

*** Oh thats a really good point I know other brotp type ships that got very popular. Hell even in HP Dean and Seamus are very popular. But you get to see more of Harry and Ron becoming friends Harry becoming like Rons newest sibling . Hes close with all the Weasleys but i agree it feels most familial with Ron.

And i like playing with unconventional relationships too! But i know not everyone does and if i didnt Id never think to read this ship.

Thanks for the rec! I hadnt heard of it before now.

** Hm, this is a valid question. I think it may be because the friendship is so thoroughly written that we only see it that way? Ron is also very dude-ish and really doesn't draw much attention for coupling with anyone. He's a solid bloke who's a pal's pal and... that's it.

With say Harry/Draco there's tension and drama. With Harry/Ron there's... awkward exploration followed by smooth sailing? There's really nothing to write it would be so convenient for them.

** So I am generally (at best) apathetic to pairings in fanfiction, so long as they aren't ridiculously unbelievable within the context of a mildly canon HP story (looking at you Harry/Tom and Hermione/Tom). So I will try to offer what may be an outsiders view on the subject. The optimist in me says "authors want to explore more unique ideas and are using the pairing as a springboard for making that happen." The pessimist in me says "pairings are more often than not a form of fulfillment for the author and are never really realistic within the context of HP fics" (i.e. if 90% of fanfiction is crap, 99% of pairings in fanfiction are crap regardless of sexuality).

The realist in me? Its complicated. Both through observation of people watching/reading/hearing fiction in real life and statistics about preferences for romance and relationships (real or fictional), I have come to a particular conclusion.

/People seem to prefer the contrast./

What I mean by this is look at most relationships in real life. They usually arise from mutual or similar interests (ex. you like basketball, I like basketball, we have something in common), and these unite them in relationships. At least when they have a choice in the modern world. But overwhelmingly what I see in people is that their favorite pairings/ships in fiction are ones where the characters are diametrically opposed on many issues or lack many common interests. People like the friction, the arguements, and the eventual overcoming of the gap between the pairings. Basically this is why I think the Daphne Greengrass or Draco Malfoy pairings are so popular - the contrasting values of X-character create more entertainment than more organic and frankly believable relationships.

So why isn't Ron popular as a slash pairing? Ignoring the character sexuality, its basically the same reason I think people are less vested in pairings with Ginny. /They are the characters who (arguably) have the most in common in canon with Harry./ They like the same things, they are bullheaded and passionate to a fault, they value family to a tee, they don't like Slytherins/blood purity, they don't really care for rules that impede them, and so on. And to read, thats kind of boring in fiction for most people. Its more believable, but in a fanfiction of a story depicting magic schools, immortality-granting rocks, dragon reservations, and bad guys with snake fetishes does believability really matter?

Harry/AnyDE makes no sense. They're not just enemies, but mortal enemies. Just like Hermione/AnyDE also makes 0 sense. Those pairings only work if you remake one of the characters you're pairing, at which point you could save yourself the trouble and name it an OC, because that's what they are.

** I personally like Harry/Ron, because when you read fanfics about them they are pretty much the same with just a more intimacy. Fanfictions can hold a factor because you can deny it all you want, but fanfics really do affect your vision on characters and Ron is...well really bad in fanfics. It could also be the movie since people often use that for 'proof' when discussing stuff. I personally don't really understand why, seeing as how I ship it. But I guess, when I didn't ship it was because Harry was shipped with so many other people, and Ron was never really shown any attention, that I just didn't really notice.

(Not the point at the moment.) But Ron. That kid is just not, at any point, in any way, shape or form, queer. He is super straight. Plenty of characters you can run with being queer with even the least bit of incentive, but Ron is never once, at any point, coded as anything but a straight white male. (I don't even dislike Ron, he's just not written in anyway that could be construed as anything but Straight.)
