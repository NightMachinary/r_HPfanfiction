I'll take any recommendations for completed time travel fics, preferably with a romantic pairing involved but if it's really good I'll read Gen.

Can be regular time travel or a ‚Äúdo-over‚Äù situation


** Hahaha I'm back to recommend the linkao3(The Second String) because it's the best time travel fic üòä.

linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe) doesn't have a romance pairing but it's fun and easy.

I'm currently reading linkffn(The Beurocratic Error) and I've no idea whether that has a pairing or not but I think it does? Remus/Tonks is a think at least so far üòä

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** I tried to list ones that aren't the ones that are always recommended. (I.e. Oh God not again, of a linear circle, etc)

Interesting in that a different character is the one that time travels.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13867242]])

The /series/ isn't complete, but is is comprised of several longfics that /are/ and I'm pretty sure it's already pre-written because it updates quickly considering the word count. Draco time travel. Drarry.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1765369]])

My boy regulus. Slash.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23486791]])

This one is definitely pretty much just a harlequin romance novel but I loved it. Hottest James Potter EVER.

  Harry likes kids. That doesn't mean he's ready for a small boy to turn up on the doorstep of Grimmauld Place insisting that Harry is his father. That was weird enough, but the child identifying Draco Malfoy as his other parent was something Harry had no bloody idea how to handle.

  Draco Malfoy never asked for a second chance, nor did he particularly want one. But he found himself in his old body at eleven, and after a year at Hogwarts, he has a plan for the year before him: keep to himself, find Dobby, improve relations with fellow Slytherins to cordial but distant, get over this stupid obsession with Harry Potter, and no more jokes about controlling a Malfoy mountain troll. No one else thinks they're funny. And no more cursing people- well, only as many people as necessary...Draco Malfoy has never been very good at following plans.

#+begin_quote
  When Sirius runs away in 1976, Regulus starts writing him letters he never intends to send. They're simply a way to talk about all the things he can't say out loud to anyone - a chronicle of his descent into the Death Eaters, and the eventual realisation that he made all the wrong choices. In 1997, Harry is searching for the Locket-Horcrux at Grimmauld Place. Instead, he finds a stack of yellowed parchment that not only tells a tale that's more captivating than it has any right to, but might also hold the key to information on the remaining Horcruxes. Regulus Black installed a failsafe. Though neither Regulus, nor Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Sirius expected the result of the ritual to be quite this literal. With an Ex-Death Eater who was assumed to be dead in their midst, the Horcrux-hunt goes a bit differently. Regulus is mostly conflicted if his unexpected second chance is really worth all the trouble his company keeps putting him in.   Spoiler: It is. He just likes to complain.

With a journal of clues and a single long-jump time turner, Hermione must go back to before it all began. She has to go back to the fall of 1979.Part 1 of 2. Part 2 coming 2021.

**** Basically a crack fic is any fic that primarily focuses on humour, with very low stakes, and generally based around a very silly premise. Many time travel crack fics basically have Harry destroy all the Horcruxes and Voldemort within hours of arrival, then he spends the rest of the fic being a force of chaos.

Rule of thumb, if the fic reads like Harry Potter meets the Loony Tunes, it's probably crack.
