I found an unfinished one a while ago that i really enjoyed where harry had fallen into an au with this exact premise, where the gryfs were bad and the slyths were good and whatnot, but i'm looking to see if there're any more that fit this description??? Thank you to any sort of answers !

** There was a crack fic where Voldemort and Harry's souls were tied together, and they kept getting re-incarnated. They had a 78th life where Tom was the Boy Who Lived and Harry was the world's equivalent of Draco Malfoy

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4849382/1/Inverted][Inverted]], linkffn(4849382): In the other dimension, Tom Riddle was good, while Dumbledore was the evil 'Phoenix Lord'. Potters were still good, but the Weasleys were evil. Hermione and Bellatrix basically swapped their roles. This fic is FINISHED.

  DEAD. Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord? No slash.
