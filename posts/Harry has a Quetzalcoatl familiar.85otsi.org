***** its a Harem, with a LOT of smut, but with a good plot. The main pairing, at least until I stopped reading, at about 500k, was Harry/Luna/Fleur/Tonks. He has a few others on his harem, like Narcissa, 2 OCs, Professor Vectra, with the possibility of doing more, probably will get Fleur's mother and Penelope, eventually. IDK, like I said, I stoped reading around the 500k mark, not because the story wasnt interesting, but I lost motivation. Someday i'll finish it.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
