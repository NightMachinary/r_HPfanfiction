*** It's entirely possible that I have completely misremembered and that is the fic I'm thinking about. It would definitely explain why I've not been able to find it. Any chance you recall what the name of the fic was?

  In the battle against Kronos Percy the thrown back in time to 1994. Unable to even step foot in America as not risk damaging time itself he is exiled to UK, but all is not lost as he finds a world to hide away in, a world to live in. A world of magic. The wizarding world won't know what hit it.
