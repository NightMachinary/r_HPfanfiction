Looking for a fanfic where Harry is expelled from Hogwarts in book 5 and goes to Ivermorny (the wizarding school in America).

I would like it to be on AO3 (but other sites are fine), and for to either be complete or be updated recently (again, its fine if it's not).


** Not quite it, but linkao3(The Ilvermorny Champion) he attends there from the beginning.

  Alec crosses the line and pauses, before letting out a relieved sigh. He takes out the thin strip of paper in his jacket pocket.  Alexander Gideon LightwoodIlvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Alec steps as close as he can to the Goblet, and he drops the slip into the blue flames. It sizzles before gliding into the ashen center.A loud clap causes Alec to whirl around, his hand sliding into his jeans pocket and curling around his wand. He was no longer alone, although Alec didn't mind the audience once he sees him. He hopes his blush can be explained by his proximity to the flames.“I don't think we've been formally introduced,” the golden-eyed boy says with a cheshire-like grin. He crosses the blue line and extends his hand. “I'm Magnus.”
