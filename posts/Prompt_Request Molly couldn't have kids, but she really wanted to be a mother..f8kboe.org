And so, the Weasley children are all kids taken from different families and integrated into "The Weasley Clan" Once Harry Potter gets "adopted", The kids explain to him how things work at /home./

Can be fluffy (Kids are saved from bad family situations, or their parents killed by death eaters) or dark-ish (kidnapping?)


** I remember reading a fic where all the weasley kids were either abandoned children or orphans from the war. I believe it was a one shot. Harry doesn't learn about it till years later when he finally asks.

** There is a similar story, but I don't remember the name. In it Molly got pregnant still at school, used an abortion poition because she just was not ready yet, but the medicine she had acquired was too strong and made her infertile.

Molly still would have loved having kids, but instead she and Arthur (who stuck with her despite several people, including Molly's mother, thinking he should find a woman who could give him kids) start getting involved with the order. Molly basically becomes the order's first war babysitter. And at the end she adopts some kids (of which one may or may not have been Harry).

This story did not re-create the canon Weasley family, though.

** When Harry was rescued by the twins, and they shouted he was starved, she didnt yell at them some more. She went deadly quiet. 'Are you absolutely /certain/?'\\
'It wasn't that bad!' Harry protes te, although he was loath to defend them. Her head , formerly focused on her kids swiveled so fast towards him that her hair was a blur, and he involuntary took a step back. 'They- they gave me cold soup,' he said sheepisly. 'And they let me go to the loo.' He didn't say how often, but it was enough for Mrs Weasly. Had he wanted to step back before, now he almost wanted to run away at her fury. It was only the fury was -probably- not aimed at him that kept him standing still. Fidgeting a lot, but not running for the hills. Ron slung his head over Harry's shoulder and said, calmly; 'he can stay, can't he?' 'Oh yes, of course, dear,' she replied distracted. 'But don't let me catch any of you even /near/ the shed again!' As he and Ron walked inside, Harry could only just make out that she asked Fred and George the adress in a sweet voice that promised pain. For a moment, he almost felt sorry for the Dursley's, but they could probably handle her shouting, he reasoned. He ignored the nagging feeling that they'd have to deal with a lot /more/ than shouting. They went to sit on the sofa after a while, and he blinked, and when he opened his eyes, a strange man sat next to him in much the same position. He must have fallen asleep. For how long? 'Hello Harry,' the man next to him said, sounding as tired as he looked. 'I'm afraid you missed breakfast but Molly saved you a plate. The biggest she could find. The food is still warm, if you want it.' 'Where is Mrs. Weasly?' Mr. Weasly hestitated. 'She's away,' he said carefully. 'On some business.'

*** Pt 2

Harry, who had decided (wisely) not to ask anymore about Mrs. Weasly's business, inquired about what he did and how he had made the car fly. Apparently glad to have such a enthusiastic audience,Mr Weasly told Harry exactly how he ad managed it, which part he bewitched and how that interacted, about his first test-flight in the middle of the night ("Don't tell Molly, she'd have a fit.") and he even gave Harry several diagrams before asking Harry if it was in any way comparable to how planes work. Harry guessed it wasn't because the car didn't look like a plane in the slightest, and while he didn't know a lot about planes, he knew their flying had something to do with their shape and the wind. When Molly came home, she made a absolutely delightful lunch and didn't ask once about the Dursley's, something Harry had dreaded since he woke up.\\
Almost in return, he didn't ask her what she had done and ate his lunch in near-silence while Ron loudly grumbled about gnomes and gardening. Apparently everyone except Harry had needed to throw them out (literally, as Ron demonstrated with a potato) and they /still/ weren't done. Naturally, Harry offered his help, and it was, remarkable grudgingly, accepted.

So after lunch, they went all out again, onto a beautiful grassy field. Fred and George took it upon themselves to teach Harry the 'Noble art of throwing Gnomes' and also secretly taught him some funny (or less funny) spells on them. After Harry was done with his first, he felt a unusual satisfaction at seeing a gnome in a glittery pink tutu sail through the air, turning around like a odd discoball and playing some song he was to far away to catch. He didn't see the landing, because of the hedge, but Ron, who was there, assured Harry it was a very good throw indeed. He had just gotten the hang of it when the gnomes where gone and they headed back inside to find Dumbledore there!

He looked like he was in the midst of a lively discussion when they came in, but now he turned around and smiled at them as if he had just been visiting. He looked as if he was very happy and very sad at the same time.

'Hello Harry,' he said, and the sadness seemed to disappear as if it had never been there. 'I see you have been introduced to the Weasley's favorite pastime; gnomethrowing! I remember having been quite good at it myself, when I was younger, although I must admit, I never came up with the idea of a glittery tutu as a scoremark. Most inventive.'

'The twins taught me that, sir,' Harry replied, not sure how to react to this unexpected praise but wanting to give credit where it was due.

'They seem to have adopted you already!'

His voice was bright, as if he was merely happy that Harry's friends family where so kind to him, but Harry didn't miss the unreadable glance he threw at Mrs Weasly. Harry hoped it wasn't because he thought having a guest over with such a large family already was unwise resource-management, but if he had to hazard a guess, the discussion might have been about Dumbledore offering his help with money or food (surely Hogwarts had plenty to share?) and Mrs Weasley refusing. That wouldn't explain the glance (unless he thought it was too much and Harry saw no reason why Dumbledore would think so), but it would explain most /other/ things, like the suddenly tense atmosphere.

'Harry,' Dumbledore interupted those thoughts. 'Would you mind showing me around in the garden? I'm afraid it's been too long since I last visited, so I absolutely /have/ to see those Tinkling Bluebells Molly told me about before I go.'

**** Pt 3

Of course, Harry agreed, although he was very sure Dumbledore didn't want to talk about Tinklin g Bluebells (although they /did/ make rather beautiful sounds)

'How was your summer, Harry?' Dumbledore asked airilly.

'Uhm. Not very good sir. How was yours?'

'Oh, I had a rather nice time of it. Mrs. Weasley told me what happened and from what I heard -and saw- 'not very good' is the understatement of the century, right up there with 'a bit of a sticky situation' in the Korean War!'

His eyes suddenly seemed piercing.

'I talked to them after they saw Mrs Weasley,' he said quietly. 'I'm sure they'll treat you better next time.'

They didn't. It was unfortunate, but Harry carried on until he ran away. When he saw the Weasley's again, everything was alright again until a few days before they left, when, in a argument, he heard someone shout at Percy he 'didn't belong here'. He didn't think much of it; a normal brotherly argument about something-or-other, no doubt. Even later, he began to notice some of the comments Ron let slip where odd, to say the least. Things like 'It's probably not 'Weasley enough' for them' (which, as he later admitted was ridiculous, as it wasn't like his family held him to that standard, or any, for that matter) and 'oh, he just has nightmares about his old family again' (muttered while half-asleep but apparently awakened by Harry, followed by 'best make him a cup of tea, that'll help'). Of course, Harry calmly made a cup of tea and puzzled over the odd comment for as long as it took him to drink it. What /finally/ spurred him to ask questions, was a nightmare Ron had - and it /wasn't/ about spiders. 'No Mummy please! I'm not a witch, I swear! I'm NOT!' 'Ron? Ron, are you okay? Ron!' Ron seemed to awake and curl into himself even more. His eyes looked unseeing, he was gasping for breath, and his entire face was red and shiny with sweath. '/Aquamenti/,' Harry muttered rather desperately. '/Aquamenti!/' It seemed to help, a little. /He is just having nightmares about his old family... cup of tea, that'll help/. Ron had said that. Harry had no idea if he was echoing what others had said about him (were those fevers common in the wizarding world?) Or he had said about others but.. Well, maybe it would help. It's how the British cope with trauma, someone had once said. His tea was all out though, so he'd have to go somewhere else. Harry hestitated. Ron was clearly ill but... it was just a fever. Harry wouldn't go to the hospital wing for that, but Harry would keep going with a broken leg, as he had been informed before. In fact, he had done that in primary school after a particularly bad fall while running. Even the Dursley's hadn't noticed that one, not that they cared (/or maybe they had,/ a small voice whispered, /and had simply ignored it?/ Harry resolutely ignored it. Even the Dursley's wouldn't have done that). So his judgement on what was a emergency and what wasn't was... off, probably. Hermione would know but she would make a dreadful fuss. As would Pomfrey (and he really didn't want to wake her unnecesarily). Lupin might. And Lupin had tea, and rather good tea at that.

'C'on Ron,' he grunted, trying to get the taller boy to walk.

It seemed to take ages before he had finally reached the office and knocked, when the lack of answer /finally/ prompted the realisation that it was /four o'clock in the goddamn morning,/ of course Lupin wouldn't here.

'Harry?' There he was, just 'round the corner.

'Professor Lupin!'

Suddenly he felt embarassed at his question and fell silent.

'Why are you standing in front of my office with Mr. Weasley?'

'Oh, uh. It's Ron, sir, and he got a awful fever and I don't know how bad it is so I wonderedifyoucouldtellifhehastogototheHospitalwingsir?'

'Sorry?'

'Does he have to go to the hospitalwing sir or wil he be alright with a cup of tea, sir?'

'Why're you asking me?'

'You'd be the least likely to make a fuss, sir.'

Lupin chuckled at that.

'That I am,' he agreed amiably, before opening the door. 'Come in and let's see to him then.' He waved his wand and in one smooth movement the lights were all on. Harry very nearly gasped at how bad Ron looked now. His knees seemed to have gone weak, his facial coloring had migrated from red to a faint greenbluish, and while his eyes where half-open you could only see the whites. Hastily Harry put him on a chair and tried to remember how you were supposed to treat a ill person. What little books he remembered where aimed at children and involved cake and games, (he remembered because he never wanted cake when he was ill) and being kind (he liked to think he was already) and other frankly unrealistic things. He never remembered what happened when /he/ got a fever either so that wasn't any help either.

'Is there anything I can do to help him, Professor?'

'Sit down and try not to worry too much,' professor Lupin suggested. Harry did, watching Lupin weave spells and get potions, while Ron went on muttering about his family, ocassionally shouting either at his 'mom' or for his mom (which clearly wasn't Mrs Weasley). It seemed to be alternatively pleading and angered, but it rarely stopped completely. His previous mum must be worse than aunt Petunia. Apparently she had tried to burn him for being a Demon, or a witch, or something like that. This was after what seemed like a period of starvation and praying. Probably, at least. Timewise Ron was all over the place. Blisters seemed to grow on Ron's face where freckles had been, and disappear just as quickly.

'It's quite bad,' Lupin said while working on something that looked rather incomprehensible and dizzyingly complicated. 'When did this set in?'

'I don't know,sir.'

Lupin hummed and stopped his work. Ron looked much better now; stable, at least, and the muttering stopped.

'What do you know about the Weasley's?'

'They are a very kind family sir,'Harry answered truthfully.

'And large,' Lupin added, nodding. 'And did you never wonder /why/ they are so large despite being so poor?'

'Because Mrs Weasly wanted a girl?' Harry hazarded a guess.

'Nonono! No, it's because they adopt everyone who needs it. They simply can't bear the thought of not adopting someone if they really, really needs it. The ministry disapproves of them, of course, so no matter what job Arthur and Mrs Weasly would take, they would barely scrape by.'
