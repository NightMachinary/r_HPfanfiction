*** The following will make you want to bleach your eyes:\\
I'm thinking of that one fanfic where Harry and Ron kill hermione and then have sex with her dead body. I'm too well-travelled for my own good.

*** Hmm, I've seen him use magical chemical weapons, bring civilians into conflict in a couple Evil!Harry ones, I've seen him kill people already wounded by an irreversible dark curse. Seen him torture the fuck out of war prisoners. Just to name a few. Looking for more if you know any!

** Just to play devil's advocate. Did the wizards sign the Geneva Convention? If not, the the deatheaters are unlawful combatants which means that the restrictions (in terms of what you can do in fighting them) in the Geneva Convention do not apply (from a simple english reading. All bets are off when you get lawyers involved).
