[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4220317/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Marauders-Horcrux][This]] is what gave me the idea. Alternatively will someone please write one? :P

I'm just really curious as to how this would go down.


** linkao3(Cartographer's Craft) is the only one I know, but I vaguely remember we had a post just like yours a few month ago..

Edit; Can't find it, sorry.
