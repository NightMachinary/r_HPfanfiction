I know in most stories it is James friends (maruaders,etc) or wizarding family who take of harry. I want to see if there are ones where it is lily's friend from hogwarts who take of him.


** There aren't enough stories about Lily's friends, I agree (and I blame canon). The eponymous solicitor of The Difference a Good Solicitor Makes linkao3(15833916) isn't a /friend/ of Lily's, but she is a Muggleborn Lily trusted to take care of her son.

I also really like this fic for balancing the necessity of the blood wards on Privet Drive with the fact that it is /unconscionable/ to permit child abuse.

  Lily and James left Harry a muggle trust fund with a muggleborn trustee. This will impact Harry's childhood, leading to a more grounded Harry going to Hogwarts.This starts in Novemeber 1981, quickly covers Harry's pre-Hogwarts days, and Chp. 3 is when Harry's letter arrives.Anything recognizable belongs to JKR.

** Didn't they all die? That must be why they never show up. Or Lily was a basic popular girl without Regina's charm. I like the second idea, like the plastic leader from Mean Girls 2. I hated that movie, disgraced the original.

** Snape was Lily's friend and there is a whole plethora of fics out there where he takes care of Harry, either bc he is biological father of Harry for whatever reason and or adopts him.

"Fixing past mistakes" linkao3(1181386) would be a fic where Lily explicitly names Snape as Harry's guardian. Features manipulative Dumbledore who let the will disappear for his own gains and time travel.

*** Yes! I have read many. My thing is that beyond snape it seems no other friends seem to pop up. James seems to have a whole gang of friends,mentors, and co-workers. But lily had a life to and 1 friend seems kind of odd

Blame JKR. I don't think any other friend was ever mentioned in cannon (and I'm not even sure if Alice is supposed to be Lily's friend, don't remember)

***** J.K. Rowling sucks at portraying female friendships in general. The only female friendships we got were Parvati and Lavenders and that was looked down upon for being girly girls and the Gryffindor chasers where she did actually do a good job.

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts, causing a great deal of concern. Once the starting feast was over, Albus heads to Privet Drive along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. Unfortunately what they learn is anything but good, life for the magical world isn't going to be the same. Is there anything anyone can do to save the magical world?
