** Hello! I have a copy of it in epub, but I'd rather respect the author's wishes and keep it off the internet, so if you're still interested in reading it reply with your email, and I'll send it to you.

*** My only wish is to read it, as i don't have any reason to put it online against the author's will. If you can, ill appreciate for you to send it. I'll message my email to you.
