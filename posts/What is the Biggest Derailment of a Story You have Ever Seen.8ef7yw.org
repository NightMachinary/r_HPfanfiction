Basically as the title suggests, in your experience reading Harry Potter fan fiction which story takes the cake for being incredibly well written with logical tragectory only to hop the rails and crash marvelously?

For context, I just had this happen in a Game of Thrones story I had been reading which had been doing a great job on speculating what would happen in Season 8, only for it to go down the drain in the span of two chapters. Shame really, it was well written too.


** Junior Inquisitor. Trundles down the rails and then... goes off them. Right off the rails and into an entirely different type of story than it had been. Not badly done at all, but a huge freaking disjunct, and I'm still not sure if I liked the result or not.

Ironically, I still liked it enough to favorite the story, but when they had Harry go to the trouble of sorting through all the complaints and set up in detail how he was going to fix the school, and then completely wiped all that away, it nearly made me drop it.

** The one that sticks out for me in recent memory is linkffn(The Last Hero's Heir), was a relatively well written HP/GoT crossover with Harry and Lyanna Stark basically going on an adventure with a small amount of smut. Ended up as a harem fic of all things, with a hint of incest and pedophilia, then abandoned with the story ending summarised in half a page. Really quick turnaround too, I will likely never reread it because it just destroyed itself so quickly.

  AU. After being hounded by the press and pestered by his fans, Harry decides that he needs to get away. When he learns of the house elves plight and Kreacher offers him an escape, who's he to refuse. In true Gryffindor fashion, he charges into this new world without even considering the consequences. Little does he know the true effect his presence will have on his new home.

*** The first half is a truly spectacular example of what fanfiction can be. After the time jump it's still a decently serviceable fic. Granted when help up to the example of the first half it's not very good, but in comparison to some other fanfics I've read its miles better. So I didn't mind reading it. It's not excellent, but it does the job.

The sequel on the other hand is just weird. I feel like the author of the second half of Delenda est was constrained to specific plot points and pre-established parts that made that half readable. But given relatively free rein in the sequel they just went insane and wrote something that makes no sense.

Never a stellar story, but the pairing was interesting enough and the characters were written in a rather unique fashion. A little heavy on smut and fluff, but I've seen worse. Then one of the woman is injured, they get to Grimmauld place, Harry completely loses his shit, Snape knows the countercurse and then Harry is just one step short of snogging Snape out of gratitude. Harry's emotions in that scene were so horribly exaggerated and Snape became a hero for... countering a spell he taught the Death Eaters in the first place.

It was the truly insane update pace of the first half of the story, literally a chapter a day or more, that got it so many fans I think. I do seem to remember some shitty drama with Katie Bell at some point that started to sour me, and once he actually got with Fleur things starting getting decidedly weird, and kept going downhill. Never once felt any urge to reread the story though, that in itself should be a red flag for derailment.

It was somewhat fresh and actually looked to be doing some parts well of a tired fanfiction genre. And then it went off the rails and just slowly marched itself into weirdness and cliche. And the nonsensical “oh shit I need a cool plot point” moments really started to kill people off like they were flies. The ending/last 20 chapters literally ruined the entire point of the fic and made the title “A Cadmean Victory” utterly worthless.

  Okay, that's as much as I can take. This started out as an interesting story with an apparently unique central plot point. It started to get bogged down with the fairy stuff and now it's turned into scene after scene of lectures about obscure points of law, weaponry, magic, and anything else that crosses the author's mind. And let's ignore that you've turned the smartest witch of her generation into a bumpkin who needs constant hand-holding from her two friends.

  There's a lot of good material in here, but it's all being shovelled into one story with little regard for plot, pacing or character. Instead of one vast, all-encompassing story it might have been better to write several shorter pieces, each focussing on one or two aspects. But on this one, you've lost me. I simply can't face going through another 60 chapters of this - and I see it's not even finished yet.

I totally see how that happens. Fanfic authors just keep writing and writing and suddenly there's no more conflict, because everyone is friends with the protagonist. Happens if you don't map out your plot beforehand.

But if you just make stuff up that's not only completely out of character, but also really really stupid you're not really trying to write a (conventional) story anymore.

** I read a Harry/Ginny soul bond sort of fic that went from sweet and cliche for 2/3s of the story to a dramatic post apocalyptic and world rebuilding fic in a few chapters. Total whiplash

Edit: Remembered that they said that Voldemort was right to hide from the muggles and the muggles were hunting them down, the population dwindled really low and Harry and Ginny were planning how to survive. They...they might have ended up making a colony on the moon? I also think that the muggles made some virus that infected only magical folks but that could be another fic. Wish I could remember the name of it to make sure I'm remembering the madness right.

*** My fanfiction searches haven't turned up anything, I've looked through all the 100k+ Harry/Ginny fics with the word soul anywhere and it's not showing up. Maybe I've messed up some of the details or it was deleted. Maybe it just doesnt mention the soul bond in the description?

Kinda bummed that my hour and a half long search (why) for this weird fic has failed :/ Hopefully somebody out there sees this and remembers it to prove I'm not (too) crazy.

**** Well no freaking wonder I couldn't find it based off that description lol, thank you and [[/u/xeshtrill]] for letting me know what it was. I was really half convinced I dreamed it up or something. Agreed that as much as it was WTF, it was at least unique and truly took me by surprise.

I'm not really a Harry/Ginny fan myself (really not a fan of most romance in fics in general though) but for some reason I can't remember I found myself reading that fic. Time for a reread, should be interesting to see if there's foreshadowing to the madness in the later chapters.

Edit: It was what I was looking for but there must be another fic where the muggles create a medicine/disease that hurts magical folk and eventually they magically create a moon colony to protect the people left.

"Harry Potter and the Lady Thief" -- started with characters with complex past, hope for good drama, real insight into double life issues, mechanics of magical protections, possibility of original and smart ways of dealings with villains; continued with one-dimensional supporters, BAMF Hermione and very strange obsession with sex.

Yeah it had a really weird tonal shift in the end. When I read something like that I wonder whether the author is in a bad place, emotionally. My mood has certainly often influenced my writing.

** I hope you'll allow these two since they're series rather than stories that go off the rails.

The Wise One: Book One: Becoming (linkffn(4062601)) is fine. Really good, even. The second book becomes a pretty standard Powerful!Harry at Hogwarts, and the third is not good at all, with a particularly bad ending.

Something similar is true about Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy (linkffn(8629685)). I thought that series was excellent, then there's a brief wobble in book three before the whole thing comes crashing down at the end.
