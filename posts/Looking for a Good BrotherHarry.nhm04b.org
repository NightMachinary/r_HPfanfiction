I want fanfics that depict Harry as a Brother. He can be a blood related(as in quite a few AU fics), or he can be considered brother(like Ron and Harry's brotherly bond). He should be strong, protective, caring and gentle.

For a reference, I am looking for some bonds like how Harry and Fleur have in Swissdog's fanfics.


** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30090315][light to fight the shadows]] while the word "brother" is not mentioned, Harry very much acts like the way you described towards Hermione. He is indeed strong, protective, caring, and gentle towards her. Their relationship is definitely not romantic.

  When an urgent need for safety accidentally brings Hermione and Harry very far off the beaten path and forces their horcrux hunt to a screeching halt, she and Viktor must decide whether they're going to waste or embrace some unexpected holiday magic.

  For as long as he could remember, Harry Potter hadn't been alone. By his side had been his twin Jason.Then they arrived at Hogwarts and were Sorted into different Houses. Suddenly, a chasm lay between them, one Harry couldn't cross and Jason refused to.So Harry had to learn how to stand without his twin, finding friends and fighting a war along the way.

** There's a series I adore that is incomplete called the Older Brother series. Unfortunately it basically shifts the character who is more aligned to what people think of canon Harry to his little brother, but it is a nice fluffy story nonetheless. linkffn(12288494; 13156106)

  Something went different in 1981. There was a sacrifice, there was confusion, there was grief for the loss of life. But there was also a job given to a special boy. And he would not fail to protect his little brother.

  The Triwizard Tournament has come to Hogwarts. It should be a chance to meet witches and wizards from other countries and create ties to them. But somebody has it out for Aaron again. Harry Potter will show the world why you don't mess with his Family. Sequel to Older Brother
