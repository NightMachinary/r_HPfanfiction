If Slytherin had the Chamber of Secrets, and fanon often attributes the Room of Requirement to Ravenclaw, then what would the potential hidden rooms of Gryffindor and Hufflepuff look like?


** In one of the fic ideas I'm fleshing out now, Gryffindor was an adventurer-type and the founder most involved on the World Stage (Ravenclaw and Slytherin were both academic borderline-recluses and Hufflepuff ignored Humanity in favour of the Magical Races). So, his secret room was basically an apparition slingshot. Augments his Apparition Range to the point that he can appear vast distances away from Hogwarts in order to slay monsters and save townsfolk and such.

Haven't come up with a definite name for it yet, but I'm mulling over some variant of 'The Griffin's Door' at the moment.

Hufflepuff didn't have a secret room in the castle - hers was a cavern system deep in the Forbidden Forest. Very 'D&D Ranger' type home. It's only power was a calming effect on all who enter it - her paintings were imbued with charms to relax anyone who saw them, including all the untrusting Magical Creatures, Beings, and People who came to visit her.

** My head-canon:

Slytherin's - Chamber of Secrets, animal defender of castle

Hufflepuff's - Room of Requirement, whatever is necessary for anyone

Gryffindor's - (maybe) Headmaster's Office, with the statue guardian, I like to think of it as originally some kind or commanding general's room. Possibly the nick nacks everywhere are ward-monitors and thread detectors.

Ravenclaw's - (possibly) Moving Staircases - a puzzle each time one wants to change floors, especially if the movement pattern changes often. Something to keep one's mind sharp and noticing what is happening /right now/ rather than lost in plans and theories.

** "Why Salazar, we have regular rooms with a bed and a small desk. No one is expected to be as edgy as you," said Godric as Helga nodded in the back.

** The room of requirement is definitely a Hufflepuff thing.It's a room that gives whatever the user needs when you walk into it. And Helga was a very caring in accommodating person.

*** I guess one could argue that, though I've read several fics that give that honor to ravenclaw. But if you give the room to hufflepuff then what would ravenclaw's room look like?

** They have been found centuries ago, repurposed to to some better use than some hidden place nobody uses and their origin was forgotten. Nowadays Ravenclaw's secret room is part of the library, Gryffindor's is the Great Hall and Hufflepuff's is where the house elves do the laundry.
