I want to review your fic! Assuming you are okay with constructive criticism, I would love to read your fanfic and let you know what I think. If your fic is thousands and thousands of words, just know that I will likely only read the first few chapters.

My OTP is Dramione, so bonus points if that's your fic, but I'm really down to read any ship, timeline, etc. Just drop a link to your fic and I will leave a review ASAP! :)


** It's a work in progress at 76k words and I don't know if it's your bread and butter in plus of not being Dramione, but here: linkffn(Scion to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Beaudelaire). My reviews told me the story got really better starting from chapter 5 and I'll admit my first two chapters are my weakest if you think that can help you read further.

  Anthonie de Bousquet, son to the Marquis of Beaudelaire, is able to attend Hogwarts through an ancient bylaw in the school's rules while watching through his family and eventually by his own eyes the domestic and international affairs of the wizarding world. He and his friends will have to deal with evil plots, but their families won't let them down in times of need. AU/No romance

** I have three current WIPs!

linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) which is the first in a series that has Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all sorted into Slytherin. The focus is on politics (but no child politicians!) and world building.

linkffn(Purple Like Violets) which is my take on the Pureblood!Hermione trope

linkffn(Requiem by Flye Autumne) is a massive AU where Voldemort wins the First Wizarding War and establishes himself as a dictator over Wizarding Britain. The Order of the Phoenix is practically non-existent and there's some major Hunger Games vibes.

#+begin_quote
  Chessmaster Volume I. AU. Harry discovers that cleverness is the best way to outwit Dudley and his gang, which leads to a very different Sorting. While Harry and his friends try to unravel Hogwarts' various mysteries, the political tension in the Wizengamot reaches new heights as each faction conspires to control the fate of Wizarding Britain. Sequel complete.

  Bellatrix Lestrange wasn't always mad. There had been something, in fact one thing in particular, that tipped her over the edge. Fifteen years later, Hermione must come to terms with a startling truth and become someone she never thought she'd be: a perfect Death Eater's daughter.

#+begin_quote
  In 1981, Lord Voldemort was victorious in Godric's Hollow. Fourteen years later, he rules Britain with an ironclad fist. Each year, young witches and wizards compete in Requiem for a place in his inner circle. When Hermione is chosen to represent London, she's forced to use every one of her skills to succeed - or die trying. Very AU. Hunger Games inspired.

  [ON HIATUS]Slytherin!Harry Harry is abandoned by his parents to the abusive Dursleys so they can focus on his twin brother, Liam, who they think is the BWL. Harry desperately wants to be a good person, but its not as easy as it looks. Can he accept that they will never truly want him, and move on? Harry may finds solace in one Severus Snape, but can Severus look past his prejudice?

** Just a few months ago I finished my first ever long, multi chapter fanfiction! I always love for more people to take a peek and see if they like it, although I don't know if it'll be quite your cup of tea.

It's Ginny centric, and focuses on her recovering from the diary!

  The traces of Dark magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.
