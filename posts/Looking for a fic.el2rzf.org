Only thing I remember is that somebody (possibly an unspeakable; Croaker?) mentions to Harry that a side effect of Voldemort accidentally splitting his soul into eight pieces, is him becoming immortal (since flipping an eight 90 degrees gives you an infinity symbol). Also Voldemort originally meant to make seven pieces (himself plus six horcruxes) because seven is a magically powerful number and it became eight when he accidentally made Harry a horcrux.

Thank you for your help!
