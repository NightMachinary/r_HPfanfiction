Like the title says, I'm looking for any fic with Albus mentoring Harry through the story. I've already read "By the Divining Light", "Magicks of the Arcane" and "What you leave behind".

Fics where Harry has Dumbledore's memories like "The One he feared" and "In Light of Silver Memories" are also appreciated. Thanks!


** Linkffn(The Merging) Between learning about Riddle's past and horcruxes, Dumbledore teaches Harry to be able to duel on the level of Bellatrix and Voldemort. (He had the misfortune to give Bellatrix a challenge during the Battle of the DoM.)

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** Linkffn(The Merging) is Fantastic. Linkffn(The Half Blood Romantic) also has some Dumbledore mentoring Harry and seems very promising as a new story. Linkffn(What You Leave Behind) also features Dumbledore as a mentor.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** I have a vague recollection of a story where the closet in Harry's room at PD was a door to a secret location where Dumbledore and Sirius trained Harry. Would love to find that again.

I also remember it being mentioned that Dumbledore was a "generalist" rather than a combat specialist in magic, and that harry should try to follow the same path.
