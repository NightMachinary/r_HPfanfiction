:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's a long time since I read this one, but I'm pretty sure on the few details I remember...

Harry is released/escapes from Azkaban after a long stay. Not quite sure why; perhaps being thought dark, perhaps murder (maybe Ron, Ginny, Hermione, Cedric or Voldemort?).

Anyway, the fic starts with Harry remembering what happened between him being accused and him being sent to Azkaban:

Hedwig was killed infront of Harry - possibly by Hagrid, or at least Hagrid was the one who should watch her.

The photo-album, map and/or cloak is thrown on a fire and burned while Harry watches (being held back).

A while (a year or so) before - probably at Harry's birthday - Harry was gifted his own clock-hand with his picture, that was then added to the Weasly Family Clock, and Harry felt like he finally had a real family... Now (before he was sent to Azkaban), this hand is ripped off the clock, broken, and possibly burned - all in front of Harry.

Sadly, this is just the beginning of the fic, but it's what I remember.

Does this sound familiar to anybody?

  Harry was sent to Azkaban after being framed for murder in the beginning of his 6th year at Hogwarts. While there, he unlocks the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not". What will happen once his former friends know he's innocent? Watch the fun.

** I can't think of the one your talking about but Susan Bones and the Prisoner of Azkaban is pretty good but the Weasleys don't really betray him. Voldemort in the graveyard sets him up as the murderer of Cederic and shit goes downhill for Harry until Susan Bones gets him released
