I'm contemplating creating a short story about Antonin Dolohov. Detailing his years growing up, falling under Tom Riddle's banner at school, then becoming a member of the Knights of Walpurgis and killing the Prewett's.

Are their any other stories you know of that follow the history of a Death Eater? Seems like ripe pickings for creating interesting villains.


** In my story "Divided and Entwined", two of the POV characters end up Death Eaters over the course of the war - for different reasons.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I'd actually like to see a story about Evan Rosier. We know he was an amazing duellist; he fought Moody and died, but in the process gave him many of those distinctive scars. Reading about Rosier's path in life, before culminating in one final, epic duel to the death would be absolutely glorious.

  Antonin Dolohov hadn't always been a Death Eater. He once was a champion. He once had a family. He once had a wife. This is the story how he lost it all. Winner of the DLP July Politics Competition.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** - the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/809115][renascentia]] series co-written by tonberrys-and-kuchikopi are the type of fics that really needs more attention. Each fics' writing style is written in a way that I reminds me of a high level fictional read. Like the language is written by a extremely well verse writer, or in this case writers. A rare but delightful find in the fanfiction world. The authors understood each character extremely well, especially on the background of the Black brothers.

The authors have written several stories in that universe that centered around the brothers' past which are also insightful reads as well. Especially on Regulus' journey on being a Death Eater and why he backed out. They are all under their account on FFN or AO3.

However, there's the main story where Regulus is alive.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5651585/25/Wizards-are-stupid]]

This chapter of a one-shots collection is a short story about Theodore Nott being pushed into becoming a Death Eater by the 'good guys'. The collection as a whole relies a lot on bashing and 'then bad things happen' to make the wizards stupid as in the title, but this particular story is a pretty decent illustration of the 'Then Let Me Be Evil' trope.
