When James ran down (without a wand) to confront Voldemort, he was offered the choice to step aside as he was a pureblood and thus "better off without the mudblood and her spawn." James refused and Voldemort killed him. Remembering Snape's request, Voldemort also asked Lily to step aside but Lily also refuses. The killing curse cast on her backfires due to James' sacrifice and Voldemort is "vanquished."

So now both Lily and Harry have the sacrificial protection but only Harry has James' blood. How do you think this would affect Voldemort's Resurrection ritual if he tries to go that way? Harry's life would also be very different as he'd be raised by his mother.

This plot bunny wouldn't leave me alone even though I dislike the "passive sacrifice as super protection" trope.

And please, no Snape/Lily.


** I would love to see this written with Sirius and Lily becoming best friends after Jame's death. Sirius would never let anything happen to his best friend's wife and child, and Lily would want someone who understands her loss. But still with traces of their schoolyard bickering lol

*** Lily married James, but Sirius, remus and petigrew came as part of the package

I imagine she grew friendly with them during the final years but the friendship really bloomed while fighting the war together

I think this version of harry might be eager to prove himself, he knows he is loved but he wants to live up to image of his dad.

I also picture in this version, he would have been friends with both ron and nevile from a younger age

** That would be awesome, having the ghost of James floating over story. While Snape/Lily can be off the table it won't prevent Snape from chasing her and his natural inability to keep his mouth shut about hating James further driving the wedge between the them. Harry wanting to do his dad proud focusing on Transfiguration and Defense, getting into trouble with his friends on "adventures" into the forbidden forest and the like.

** In an AU where Snape isn't obsessed with Lily, he could probably take on a protector/platonic partner role, but he'd be up against Remus and Sirius, neither of whom are particularly fond of him. It could be interesting, but I'd like to see it as platonic Snape/Lily where he takes on a fatherly role to protect Harry and Lily without any expectation or desire for sex/romance.

*** You could have it be, that when Lilly was pregnant. James reached out to snape to make ammends.

Snape of course turned potter down, and then Potter went and died protecting lilly

Snape wants to continue hating potter, but he cant find it in himself to continuing hating someone who saved the one who loved. Potter gave his life protecting lilly and snape was the one who put her in danger. after a conversation with lilly, snape decides to become better afterall if James potter could become better so could snape

**** That could work.

Or the same, but Lily reaches out (because let's be honest, she didn't handle the ‘Mudblood' thing well either) and forces Snape and James to put up with each other.

They still aren't friends, but James insists that Snape protect Lily if anything ever happens - because he's clever and powerful and in a position to do so. Like, Sirius is liable to go off and do something stupid without thinking it through, Remus has enough problems of his own and doesn't need that responsibility, and Peter is... well.. Peter, so James acknowledges that Snape is level-headed and physically/magically capable of protecting Harry and Lily and makes him promise to do so.

Snape, of course, tells James he's an idiot and of course he's going to protect Lily and Harry because he cares about Lily (and deep down, he cares about Harry too.)

James then goes and dies, Sirius goes off tap and ‘murders' Pettigrew, they do try to get him out of Azkaban, but ultimately fail because the Aurors are fricking dumb, and Snape ends up taking on the protector/father role Sirius might have had.

BUT I WANT IT TO BE PLATONIC

****** True, but she was unnecessarily nasty afterwards when he tried to apologise.

Sometimes things come out of your mouth in the heat of the moment that you don't mean at all. It's not the first thought that counts, it's what you think immediately after that. Society and those we interact with condition us to think a certain way, and not all of it is pleasant. What really counts is what we think immediately after the initial ‘conditioned response' and in reaction to that initial response.

I'm not saying what he said was okay, but he immediately regretted it and tried to make amends, which indicates that he probably didn't believe it, and Lily was unnecessarily harsh.

******* you have to understand, this was the last straw

from the sound of it, Lilly had been justifying her friendship with snape for years.

he hangs out with death eaters, he calls other people mudbloods Lilly had been making excuses to him for years due to the childhood friendship

Imagine your in lillys postion, you have a childhood friend, and then he starts running with a bad crowd so you defend him and hope he sees the light, your other friends are constantly asking why your bothering and then one day he calls you a horrible slur,

he might apologise, but he hangs out with people who see you as sub human, he considers people like you subhuman

Lilly was fair to kind to snape in that moment

******** The fact that he hangs out with people that consider her subhuman doesn't mean he considers her subhuman. He may not consider Muggleborns as subhuman at all, but those people treat him well and don't tell him that what he is passionate about is evil or bad - even if it is.

You've got to understand, someone who is hanging with the wrong crowd doesn't necessarily believe in that crowd's ideologies. They're probably there because that crowd accepts them.

** The first part of your title matches up with linkffn(Deathly Hallowed) Lily whips out some dark magic ritual to protect Harry well before Voldemort attacks. However, Voldemort attacks, James dies and Voldemort ends up defeated by the ritual. Lily gets the credit being the Witch-Who-Lived. Fairly well done, creepy, but sadly abandoned.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.
