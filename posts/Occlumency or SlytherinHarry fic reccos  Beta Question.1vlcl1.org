Does anyone have any fics where Voldy and Snape are in Harry's head at the same time (either knowingly or unknowingly).

Also, what are your best Slytherin!Harry fics?

I prefer Snarry, Drarry or all three together, and have no preference for secondary pairings. I prefer longer stories to shorter ones, but that doesn't stop me from reading the shorter ones if their good. Please, nothing abandoned!

Nothing squicks me, so go ahead and give me your worst :-)

Part 2

I used to beta many moons ago and would like to get back in to it. Where's the best place to go these days to offer my services? While I prefer to read the above pairings for enjoyment, I will beta any pairing. Can proof for grammar, continuity, character, canon and some Brit slang.

Start with saving conner. This is an 8 book series. Starts first year with Harry in Slytherin. Each story is about as long as the actual HP books. Snape in later books takes on a fatherly role. It's Drarry, and the best Drarry I have ever read.

Lots of occulmency as well. I mean a ton in later books. Snape in his head, voldy in his head, etc. And I love how this series explains occulmency and how it is in someone's head.

The series is a bit slow for the first two books, but when it picks up it is wow! I recommended it to my beta, and he said he started it a while ago but certain things put it off for him. I told him that all those things would be addressed and he gave it a second shot and is currently glued to it.

I got my first beta from the list of betas that ff.net provides, and my second one saw my post for my story here and offered me his services. So you could do either of those. List yourself on the site, or offer your services to someone.

*** Thanks for the recco, definitely going to check it out :-)

Apparently to list yourself as a beta on ff.net you need to have published 5 stories or over 6000 words worth of entries :-( I'll definitely keep my eyes open here for people who might need a beta. Thanks!

** If you're on Livejournal, there's a thriving HP fanfic community there. I sometimes beta for people who ask for help there - specifically in the hp_beta community.

** At the moment, I'm liking both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9681858/1/As-It-Began][As It Began]] series and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]] series, both Snarry but not with Harry in Slytherin.
