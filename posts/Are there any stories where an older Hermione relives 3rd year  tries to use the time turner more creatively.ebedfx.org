E.g. to try & stop the events of that book being set in motion/to try and deal with future books' events before they become a problem.


** Seselt has a great take on this idea, but it isn't voluntary. Hermione's time using the time Turner throws her back but in a different body. She has to be very cunning to affect the changes she wants. linkao3(7944847)

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path.*time travel*

**** It's really good... very pithy and cryptic and totally captivating. She just finished the sequel, too.

  Hermione Granger wears Cathal Rosier like a flayed skin, unsure which one of them is the puppet. But there is still work to be done and revenge sings a siren call to the survivors of both sides of the Second Wizarding War. If Hermione cannot have her day in court then she will have her season in Hell.

She eventually relives it enough times to be considered "an older Hermione". Harry and Hermione make a temporal checkpoint and keep traveling back in time trying to fix their problems without serious problems coming up.

  + repeating time loops, incremental skill improvements, original plot, original Triwizard Tournament designs, some magical theory exploration

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** The Debt of Time has Hermione relive the entirety of her Hogwarts years but during the Marauder era. She attempts throughout the story to prevent Voldemort from gaining power, etc. Not exactly what you're looking for, but similar, and by far my favorite fanfic.
