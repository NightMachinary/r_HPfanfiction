So I've been recently reading "Second Life" by Nia River, and would love to read more in this scenario. Any good ones?

For reference: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3548816/1/Second-Life]]


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/][Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool]] by The Mad Mad Reviewer has a dialed-to-eleven-powerful, gender-swapped, dimension-traveling Harry acting as Harry's mentor. It's a subplot of the main plot, but is there.

Another Harry-mentors-Harry is nonjon's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/][Dimension Hopping for Beginners]].

Both are complete.

** Linked straight to Ch. 26, heads up.

EDIT: also, someone please tell me if Second Life is worth reading given that it's abandoned.

*** Thanks, fixed.

It is... okay... it doesn't get very far in the story at all. Older Harry starts at 16 years old, and he is planning on finishing Hogwarts, while taking care of younger Harry, but it doesn't get that far. It is pretty good for what it is. Good characterizations, pretty good beginning storyline, the author was headed in a good direction, but they must have ran out of ideas. Alice Longbottom plays a pretty good role in this one, and the author was pointing toward a Remus/Alice relationship. Unfortunately the story was abandoned just as it was getting pretty good.
