:END:
So, I'm going to spoil the main big flashback-ed reveal/drama of this story in this post. Sorry, but it's the only thing I really remember of the fic.

Basically, Harry gets raised by a French or Italian woman who struggles with depression and later kills herself. Harry finds the body and is understandably traumatised. He has a younger sister-type figure (who I think was the OC mother's biological daughter?) but I don't really remember anything about her.

I think Sirius knew the mother-figure and he's really sad when Harry tells him what happened to her, but I'm not 100% on that.
