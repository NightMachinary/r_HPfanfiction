A love triangle story between Severus Snape, Remus Lupin, and a talented witch named Luna Lightfoot.

This is hopefully going to be a long slow burn book. There will of course be smut, but most of the book will be about the relationships unfolding. This book follows the original book timeline (with some modifications in order adjust to the main character).\\
