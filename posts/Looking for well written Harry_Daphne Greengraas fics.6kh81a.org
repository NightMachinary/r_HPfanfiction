  Five years post-DH, EWE, Harry paired w/ Luna. Daphne Greengrass had always been a background figure in Harry's life: someone he didn't know, or ever suspected he would know, that much about. But an unexpected encounter with her one winter's night, and the story she told about herself, turned them into friends.

  Daphne Greengrass isn't the person that she was at Hogwarts. She's changed for the better. However, due to her lifestyle changes, her day-to-day has become a bit mundane. Work, Study, Sleep is the never-ending loop that is Daphne's life. Until one day, while at work, she comes face to face with the least boring person in Wizarding Britain. Can he spice things up a bit?
