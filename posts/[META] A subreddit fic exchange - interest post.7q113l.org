** That sounds interesting! The only thing that would worry me is the length requirement, it's kind of a big endeavor and responsibility to write a fanfic, especially if you're writing it for someone else, etc. I think one-shots or up to 5 chapters is good and if the author wants to continue it thats good. But I dunno how many people would be able to write an entire fanfic with their other stories and rl stuff going on as well. But I do love the idea! Don't think I don't, I just know for myself, i could not take on doing another entire long length fanfic, a one-shot I could definitely do.

**** I would love to! It'd be interesting to go outside my own interests and comfort zone into other peoples, it'll be a nice challenge. It might help us write better as well.

**** I just wrote my first horror original stories and posted them to Nosleep, and they were 1,000 to 2,000 words long, so yes I should be able to do that easily! :)

****** Oh okay. Well yes I like the idea. :) I am already trying to write out of my comfort zone by writing horror and also writing boy characters. :)

** This sounds neat, but I don't know if I want to be put on a deadline for something, even just a <5k blurb.

And secondly, is this for just 1 person to read? For everyone to see, but for 1 person's desires? I get the impression that the vast majority of your audience here are not writers- you've got a lot more people that want to see this than want to contribute.

** Why not run it over AO3? That's where those kinds of exchanges are usually hosted.

Edit: First there's a nomination phase, then people sign-up (includes their offers and requests), then they get matched by AO3 automatically.
