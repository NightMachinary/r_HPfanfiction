** Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter)

Harry dies three times before he even makes it to the sorting. He's toast more often than I can count. But he can redo everything each time he dies.

** Hmm...well, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11029663/1/Promotion][Promotion, by Endgames]]. It didn't get very far, only up to 1st year's Halloween, though.\\
I don't remember the details that well, but I recall that Quirrelmort goes a little overboard on said Halloween, assassinating Harry and unleashing the Basilisk on the Great Hall...

...Okay, rereading it, Quirrell engineers a detention for Harry so that he's alone and easily murdered, releases the basilisk whilst Trelawney's sick and Fawkes is unavailable (Burning Day), and employs a dozen mountain trolls for good measure. Talk about overkill.

  Harry is "the" one with "the" power to defeat the Dark Lord. As in, the only one with the ability to do so. Featuring everyone being a bit smarter, and an education system that makes more sense.

** Yes I would like something like this! Like what if Neville broke his spine from the broom fall instead of his arm? Or what if Hermione died to the trolly, or Ron lost a leg to the Stone challenges? :o Or what about if in second year students actually got EATEN or killed? Or Sirius was actually dangerously nuts that he ended up killing the Fat Lady portrait, or hurting students to get to Peter? :o HARD MODE!!! :) Things are not easy and smooth and people don't have plot armors. Well, at least, not massive amounts of it...
