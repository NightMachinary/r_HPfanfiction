:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fan fic just when book 7 was about to release. Everyone thought it as the original book. It had Harry chasing horcruxi throughout the book. It followed the popular fan theories of that time. One horcrux was stored in the room of requirements. There was a lot of snogging. The last word of the book was scar. As JKR mentioned it would be so.

Of course after the book released, we knew it was a fan fic.

Can anyone help me in finding the book?

*** Thank you so much!

I think this is it. I remembered another few details like Dudley was a wizard who never went to Hogwarts.

I really felt like the original and I remember we discussed eternally about the theories.

Thank you

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl
