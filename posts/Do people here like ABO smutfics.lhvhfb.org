I've been publishing chapters for an abo smutfic on ao3. I keep my chapters small with just enough content to keep people coming back. It's essentially, mostly, porn. My reception has been very good so far, people have complimented my style, but I keep getting comments with people whining about the omega trope characterization and/or the sex to plot ratio. It's a pwp??? It shocked me because I thought it was just sexy and fun. I've been in a lot of fandoms that utilize the same omega trope characteristics. And my fic has all the right abo and explicit tags!

I started writing my current work because I saw a shortage in shorter abo fics that get straight down to business and thought "well if I want to see that, other people do too." is there a shortage in these fics because people don't like the abo tropes? or is there an issue with shorter smutfics? Or is it absolutely fine?

** Honestly, a lot of fics under ABO give off misogynistic vibes. They tend call them the ‘genders' so it's not even subtle, and the alphas all have traditionally masculine traits and the omegas all have traditionally feminine traits, except it's iN tHeIr biOloGy so they must /want/ to stay at home barefoot and pregnant and be submissive all the time. And instead of periods they have a week long ‘heat' (where sexual consent is very dodgy in these fics). Omegas are literally exactly how men want women to be.

*** Absolutely, there's something deeply disturbing about it.

** People here seem not to like it, but I'm sure there are fans of that sort of thing who hang out somewhere else. There are probably ABO smutfic groups.

If you've given your fic appropriate tags, it's silly for readers to complain about it. Ignore these comments.

** I like more plot-centered fics, but a half-and-half plot/smut fic is also fine with me. Also, with ABO fics, I'm not a really big fan of very submissive omegas. Like, I'll still like the story and favorite it, but the best ABO fics imo are when the omega isn't just begging in bed/doing other really submissive things all the time.

** Not my thing personally as it can often get into werid territory and I'm not a fan of the most common ships used in it.

To each their own though

** A complaint on lack of plot in a pwp fic is not tenable criticism. It's the reader's oversight (Unless you've not mentioned the pwp bit in your tags?)

You do you, boo, I'm pretty sure there's an audience for the plotless sexy times!

** Quite frankly I hate everything about them. From their predictable plot points to the dumbness or their very essence, a/b/o fics are, in my eyes, some of the worst AUs one could possibly make.

My hatred over those has worsened with time, because at first it was just alphas and betas; dumb, but I could see and understand a bit how things would work (I've seens many stories where the weak, genetically inferior character shows to be better than most of the "naturally better" characters). I didn't like it, but I could see the appeal.

And suddenly it shifted and people created the omegas, who are even weaker than betas, are described as ugly, less intelligent... all in all, cannon fodder, trash, human wastes. But somehow you want to convince me that the peak of humanity, those fabled alphas, can be bothered to deal with such clearly inferior beings in a way that's remotely sympathetic?

And yeah, middle age bullshit some nobles ran off with farmers, or things, but farmers/nobles dynamic is far from alpha/omega dynamic. They're more like, well, the original stories between alphas and betas. You know, back when this AU wasn't absolute dogshit and had a tinsy tiny bit of substance.

** I think I have to work on my tags and summary more to make sure people KNOW more of what they're getting. I also started my fic out with the whole submissive omega concept- which some people don't like on principle- but I indicated I'd change that sub dynamic later on in the story. For some people the shift from submissive omega won't happen fast enough despite me asking for patience in my author's notes. So let's hope my tags/summary will help reduce any future confusion. I can address it again in the notes in my next chapter, but I don't want to give up many future plot elements. I'll have to find a way to say it nicely too...

** I've written a few myself, some longer and more plot based, others shorter and more smut focused, and I haven't gotten any complaints about either.

It may just be that those people were expecting something different and were disappointed.

I used to hate abo fics myself though. I still don't like the ones where the omega loses their sense of self when they're claimed. So I don't write those and that may be why I haven't gotten complaints. Still a lot of people like those and you can't please everyone. I wouldn't worry about it.
