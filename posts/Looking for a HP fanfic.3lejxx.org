Was looking for a HP fanfic. I can't remember enough of it. I remember that Harry makes legit war with the Wizards, at one point they use some sort of star bomb at Beubatons and kill Madame Maxine.

Fluer joins Harry in the story because he will fight for non human rights.

I really can't remember what the hell it was called. Please help
