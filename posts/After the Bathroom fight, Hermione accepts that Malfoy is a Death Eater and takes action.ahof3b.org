Since Malfoy almost succeeds in using the Cruciatus curse on Harry ("Cruci ---"), are there any stories where Harry tells the whole thing to Hermione and instead of being smug that she was right about Sectumsepra, she is more concerned that her friend was a split second away from being hit by an unforgivable? Preferably with some form of righteous retribution aimed at Malfoy and Snape (for covering it up and punishing Harry for clear-cut self-defence). Something which would be in-line with her vindictive streak. Or getting the Ministry involved somehow.

Romance is fine, no m/m, no redemption arcs, no Ron/Hermione.


** Here's my take on the premise. This is a repost of something I wrote a long time ago. Apologies for the script format.

--------------

/[In the Great Hall, Harry and Hermione are eating breakfast.]/

*Hermione:* [slams down her utensils] Fine. I honestly don't think that Draco is up to anything, but the Cruciatus crosses the line. Lend me your cloak and that Potions book.

*Harry:* Um... OK.

--------------

/[Next day, Harry is in the Great Hall eating lunch. Draco is conspicuously absent. Enter Hermione.]/

*Hermione:* Harry, we need to go to Myrtle's toilets right away. I'll explain on the way. We'll resolve this Draco situation right now. Also, here are your things.

*Harry:* What happened?

*Hermione:* I spent the rest of yesterday practicing nonverbal casting of the Stunning Spell and brewing Draught of the Living Death using Half-Blood Prince's improved recipe (which, I would like to point out, Slughorn had validated in class, so I wasn't brewing recklessly, /unlike some people/). This morning, I used your cloak to ambush and stun Draco and fed him the draught. I've left him in Myrtle's Toilets.

*Harry:* Why Myrtle's Toilets?

*Hermione:* Because, that's where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is. You're the only one in Hogwarts who can open the Chamber of Secrets, so if we leave him in there for the rest of the year, nobody will find him, and we can have a quiet year for once, without any inane mysteries to solve. Happy?

*Harry:* I guess that's as good a solution as any.

--------------

/[Late June of 1997, Hogwarts Express, after Dumbledore's funeral.]/

*Harry:* Hermione, is it just me, or have we forgotten something important?

*Hermione:* Well, it can't be that importan... bugger.

--------------

/[Spring 1998, Chamber of Secrets.]/

*Hermione:* That was brilliant, Ronald! I had no idea you were so good at voices!

*Ron:* I am a man of many tale... What.

*Hermione:* /[with a sigh]/ It's a long story of forgetfulness and procrastination. Just leave him there for now.‚Äã

--------------

/[Later the same day, Chamber of Secrets.]/

*Harry:* Open! Open!

*Hermione:* You're speaking English, Harry.

*Harry:* I am?

*Ron:* Yeah, you are, mate.

*Harry:* I guess Parseltongue was from Voldemort as well...

--------------

/[Even later...]/

*Ron:* Hshsshssshss! Shshshs! Hsshhh!

*Hermione:* Come on, Ron! I know you can do it!

*Ron:* Hsssshshshshs! Hshshhhs! Shsshsh!

*Hermione:* Don't give up!

*Ron:* My hongue hurh.

*Hermione:* I guess it was a one-in-a-million fluke...

*Ron:* Why dih you even puh him ih here?

*Hermione:* Yes, Harry, why did we put him in there? We still don't know if he was even planning anything!

*Harry:* Hey, you're the one who came up with the plan! I just wanted you to help me investigate!

*Hermione:* Oh, so now it's my fault for not wanting to waste my valuable time on your wild speculations?!

*Ron:* Honh ahgue oeh him. Mahfoy ih a phat.

*Harry:* That he is, mate.

*Hermione:* Very well... That Draught was exceedingly good, if I may say so myself. It should last another decade, at least. Plenty of time to find a Parselmouth.

*Harry:* Yeah, no rush.

** Dude, I really wish I could contribute an answer as that's a really underused scene to flip Hermione's view on the subject. Though, so much of HBP was contrived angst that severely hurt the characters and their development so I guess a lot of scenes could've turned out to help resolve issues if JKR hadn't wanted the plot to turn that way. H/Hr fics could start here, H & Hr friendships or counter-attacks against Malfoy, Dumbledore, Snape, etc could also start here.

I'll let you know if I ever find anything but maybe that's a good place to start your own story? HBP is a bit untouched compared to other books for story starts.

***** Thanks.

No Longer Alone, which is a PoA divergence where Harry ends up adopted by the Tonks family after the school year. Family/friendship-focused, a lot of emphasis on the characters, not so much action. Follows the stations of canon loosely, a greater divergence is scheduled for the chapter After the First Task.

Dawn of Darkness is the sixth year divergence I mentioned above. Basically, Harry takes Tonks to Slughorn's Christmas party because he needs some insights on the Horcruxes and what os going on. After waking up in her bed the next day, they agree that Harry should stay for the holidays and there is romantic fluff while more and more of the main plot is set in place, with the Ministry seemingly cracking down on random people and the Minister centralising power. After a spot of trouble, the pair decides to get out of Britain to figure out what the hell is going on. I was very dissatisfied with the first chapter and rewrote it three times before going back to writing the next update.

** Even if Hermione believed Harry, was there anything she could do? I mean Hermione would probably expect Dumbledore to do something about it and we know he didn't.

Anyway, Harry and Hermione take action against Malfoy and Snape in this one. Warning: Don't expect them to be soft with Death Eaters as they were in canon. They're pretty OOC.

***** And she did so at age 12. At 16, she led Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest so that one of the dangers inside took care of the problem. Umbridge ended up brutalised and, given the mythological background of the Centaurs, gang raped by a herd of monsters. And she did not bat an eye at that. No guilt, no remorse.

Hermione is by far the most ruthless of the trio.

It would be really odd that Dumbledore would randomly mention not to harm Malfoy, and even then Umbridge banned 51269679 things and Hermione didn't give a fuck because she had no respect for her left. It would not be difficult to imagine that Dumbledore's inaction would go down well with Hermione, depending on how much it goes against her perception of justice.

  ‚ÄòWhat are we going to do with them?' Ron whispered to Harry through the dark; then, even more quietly, ‚ÄòKill them? They'd kill us. They had a good go just now.'

  Hermione shuddered and took a step backwards. Harry shook his head.

  ‚ÄòWe just need to wipe their memories,' said Harry. ‚ÄòIt's better like that, it'll throw them off the scent. If we killed them, it'd be obvious we were here.'

  ‚ÄòYou're the boss,' said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. ‚ÄòBut I've never done a Memory Charm.'

Also, at the time, DEs had arrested quite a few of their relatives and allies but let them go after an interrogation. If the trio had escalated, it is not unlikely that the DEs would have escalated as well.

************* This. Exactly this.

They have absolutely no reason to spare those Death Eaters. Kill them and transfigure their bodies to hide the evidence, or wreck their god-damned memories. There is a civil war going on and they've lost control of the government. There is no just court of law or due process that could hold the Death Eaters accountable anymore. The trio should've learned their lessons and killed them.

And Dolohov kills Remus in the Battle of Hogwarts. There's no knowing how many lives could've been spared had they acted.

************** There was a very good reason (though not one the trio considered): escalating the fight against the regime would have been a very bad idea.

The Death Eater regime was confident in its supremacy, slow, bureaucratic, eager to preserve some veneer of legitimacy, taking its time. They would arrest known allies and associates of Harry Potter and then just let them go. (See Lupin's news in Chapter 11 of DH.) They would content themselves with taking the Muggleborns' wands, only killing those who resisted. They did nothing to secure the Ministry against infiltration. Voldemort wandered around Europe, looking for the Elder Wand, instead of hunting down the non-Potter enemies of the regime.

If the good guys started killing Death Eaters, all that could change very quickly.

I was talking about the mentality. Although they have been in deadly situations, those were rare and their experience was dominated by relatively comfortable, civilian lives. Their not escalating to cold-blooded killing that quickly is not unreasonable.

*** Interesting fic. I don't think that it's an implausible evolution for both Harry and Hermione to go Dark as a result of Ron's death. Harry is already pretty impulsive when it comes to the Dark Arts, and with Hermione, I think that once she convinces herself that murder is the answer, she'll go all-in on murder and not second-guess herself. The character dynamic that results also makes a lot of sense. (I.e., *Harry:* DIEDIEDIE! /Avada-/ *Hermione:* [after a nonverbal /Expelliarmus/ disarming Harry] No, not yet, Harry. This scum is more useful to us alive, for now.)

It's also refreshing that the fic doesn't undersell Hermione's talents and abilities the way a lot of Ruthless!Harry fics do: notice how Hermione casually casts most of her non-Unforgivables nonverbally and is usually the one to cast the more complex spells.
