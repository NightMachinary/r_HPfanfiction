With reddit's admins taking the next step towards its degradation, I thought it would be a good point for exchanging contacts now, when no one made for themselves the likelihood of abandoning reddit into a certainty yet.

I know of:

- [[http://forums.darklordpotter.net/]] --- Some good authors and discussions have repeatedly been linked to there.
- [[http://fanfiction.net/]] --- its forums are horrible in design and functionality but they're still there.
- ?.. AO3 maybe? --- does it even /have/ a forum?
- some private yandex\google groups and LJs that various authors set up on their own. I guess they are not usable for the purposes of this post.

Oh, and is [[https://www.pottermore.com/]] any good? I tried using it some time ago, but with all the random nicknames and stuff it didn't look particularly good as a serious discussion platform.

One of the main criteria for me, to be fair, is for the platform to have both branching and rating systems for comments.


** DLP is the only other forum that is still actually active but the community is different from the mostly request/promotion based one of [[/r/hpfanfiction]]. If Reddit does go down I'd agree trying to make a new one on Voat would probably be the best option.

** SpaceBattles.com forums have a very active HP fanfic discussion thread at [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-ideas-discussion-and-recs-thread-ninth-times-the-charm.305865]] .

** You could set up a /v/HPFanfiction subverse on [[https://voat.co/][Voat]] in parallel to this subreddit. It's a clone of Reddit, with some features added and some subtracted. (The site is rather slow right now, due to the newest exodus.)

** Pottermore has removed their social aspect after fighting a losing battle to keep the message boards safe for ten-year-olds. It's not much of a loss- the message boxes were no bigger than a story summary and had numerous restrictions, with no history beyond the last few pages of comments.

It was a fun challenge to communicate in that very limited venue, but the game is over.

Content-wise, there are a number of snippets from JKR to expand or explain things that were left unsaid, but half of the additions will make you pull your hair out in trying to reconcile them with prior information or basic logic.

In any case there are off-site archives of that content so that you wouldn't have to 'experience' the site in order to read them. The articles on wands and wandlore were quite good.

** harrypotterfanfiction.com has very active forums dedicated to the fandom and fan fiction. It's pretty heavily moderated, but things have loosened up somewhat in the past year. You can still get in trouble for a lot of things, but I think we can say "hell" and "damn" now. ;)

** Hexrpg.com has a fanfiction forum, but that particular part of the site seems a bit slow. It does have contests and such though (writing prompts, too).

*** The fanfiction on HEX is not that great though. Nor is the community for fanfiction. The community for anything else is amazing though.

**** Yeah I don't recommend the stuff that's published on there, but it does seem like the last few months they're trying to get activity for the forum itself back up (the contests do seem recent, at least). Once the summer calms down for me I'm gonna message the mods to see if I can host a monthly theme/recommendation thread since that's one thing I haven't seen yet.
