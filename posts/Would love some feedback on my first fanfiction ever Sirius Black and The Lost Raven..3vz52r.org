** My feedback: Theres a typo in your summary. Dark power*S* are awakening...

Typos in summaries are an absolute no-go.

** Another summary suggestion: danger lies +in+ around every corner.

I started reading it but there's a lot of grammar issues that need fixing, from commas (sometimes lacking, sometimes extraneous) to dialogue. In some cases you capitalize after dialogue and in some you do not. You're missing punctuation at the end of some dialogue.

#+begin_quote
  "Sirius," He said. "Why do you always have to push her buttons like that."
#+end_quote

How about,

#+begin_quote
  Regulus sighed. "Why must you always push her buttons?"
#+end_quote

Also,

#+begin_quote
  "...Whenever, you do something wrong, mum and dad go crazy!"
#+end_quote

Try losing the comma after the whatever. Little stuff like this in almost every paragraph makes it hard to get through.
