:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This was a fic I read a long time ago. I have no idea if it was slash, het, or gen. I don't remember anything at all about it, really, except this little scene which has stuck in my mind.

Dumbledore is talking to Harry about the horcruxes, and whether they should be destroyed as they collect them, or wait until they have them all in case Voldie can sense their destruction. He asks Harry what HE would do, if he had horcruxes and found out somebody was destroying them.

"Kill the person next to me and make another one," Harry promptly replies.

Dumbledore is completely nonplussed by the answer.


** Haven't read the story but it's like the only plausible answer. Dumbly is asking Harry what would he do if he were a cold blooded killer and Harry answers keeping in mind the mindset of a serial killer. Nothing strange here. /shrugs/

*** True, it's a really fair answer given that you have to put yourself into Voldemort's shoes.

**** Its all fun and games until Harry blows Dumbledore's head off because he went a bit too far down the rabbit hole thinking about what Voldemort would do.

*** As I recall, Dumbledore was expecting Harry to focus on Voldie's probable rage triggering even more vicious attacks, rather than a practical viewpoint.

** Canonically, it's mentioned (somewhere in Deathly Hallows) that Voldemort made his soul unstable by making so many Horcruxes, which is why Harry ended up as an accidental horcrux in the first place.

Can you imagine what would happen if Voldemort could just keep taking slivers out of his soul, replacing one of his seven horcruxes whenever they're destroyed? Assuming that souls don't have a limited mass or that he patches up his soul with horrific soul-stealing rituals?

...Actually, worse thought; at 5 horcruxes, Voldemort's soul was unstable enough that a bit of it fractured and latched on to Harry, altering the latter's magic (parseltongue).\\
If he just kept making and making horcruxes, what if he just broke apart into a tide of particles of corrupted soulstuff? One large chunk of Voldemort's soul was able to possess Ginny and drain the life out of her, what could a swarm of thousands of zombie-soul-shards do to someone?

*** This would actually be kind of hilarious from a crackfic perspective. Like, Voldie's soul is so unstable that anyone he bumps into becomes a horcrux. Now we have a plague of randomass people all claiming that they are the one true dark lord.

*** This would actually be a fairly believable way to have a sort of Voldemort-induced "zombie" apocalypse AU. Just need a way to make the Voldemort-particles transmissible, and bam, contagious dark disease that corrupts your soul.

(Alternatively, speaking of lycanthropy, Lupin did mention about how a dementor feeding on someone long enough could reduce them to something 'soulless and evil' like itself.)
