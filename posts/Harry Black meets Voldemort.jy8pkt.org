:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I know there are a lot of fics where Harry is part of the Black family but I'm looking for one with this specific scene. My memory of this fic is kinda vague but the scene has Harry in a Black family meeting where one of the Blacks, I think Orion, is introducing Tom Riddle to the family. Harry is part of Sirius and James' generation. I rhink when they introduced Harry they said that he had some sort of special training or education. I don't remember if Harry is a son of Dorea or Walburga though. I'm also not sure if it's time travel fic or if Harry is MOD. If you know it or a fic similar to this one, pls link it down below. Thanks!

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
