Can that ghost or whatever it was that Voldemort was living as can be destroyed or even caught when it has no body of its own?


** I would assume if all of the horcruxes were destroyed before Voldemort is reborn then he would just kind of cease to exist

** I'd say destroying all horcruxes would kill the wraith form of Voldemort. They are what tied him to the world and allowed him to circumvent death.

** In canon, it's uncertain - but I would say that /no/, you cannot destroy that form as it stands. You would need to hunt down and destroy all of the horcruxes, and only then could Voldemort's spirit form be actually destroyed.

I think there it's debatable whether or not simply destroying the horcruxes would be enough to kill him instantly, or if you'd need to add in one final destruction or disruption to his form to finish him off.

Catching wise, it's also not certain - and presumably takes a very specific situation to happen. But I've seen some people use it in FF to somewhat decent effect. I think personally I'd make it so that Voldemort could sort of 'consume' a horcrux to get out of that situation, just to let him keep being a threat.

*** I think it would be enough just to eliminate horcruxes before his re-embodiment, then the spirit (or however you call the flying thing which run out of Quirrel) would have no “anchors to the life” (which is the canonical phrase, IIRC) and it would just die.

*** I think he was mostly possessing animals. So once horcruxes were destroyed and the animal he was possessing died then nothing holds the disembodied spirit to realm of living.

** I do not think that it is possible to destroy Voldemort's spirit by itself. It is after all nothing more than a soul kept on the portal plane by its Horcruxes. Something giving a direct attack on the soul (like a spell or the Dementor Kiss) /may/ work, but I don't think there is any spell to attack the soul (even with the Killing Curse, the victim dies, but can still pass on to its next journey), and as for dementors, it's discutable if they would be interested in something like that and/or able to absorb something without a body (they can't "Kiss" a ghost as an example).\\
As for capturing it, I think, potentially, it would be possible. The whole Philosopher Stone obstacle course in PS looked like a plot to capture Voldemort (maybe by making him look into the Mirror of Erised and letting him get caught in his dreams), and since it's possible to "trap" ghost, the same could be possible with Voldemort spirit (would looking into the eyes of a Basilisk petrify him?).

But, since the Horcruxes are presented as some of "anchors" for his soul to remain in the mortal plane, I would guess that destroying all of them would force his spirit to "pass on" without the need to truly destroy him. Would make a pretty anticlimatic ending for a story thought.

** It should be technically possible, from what canon implies. The spell/ritual that creates a horcrux is capable of splitting a damaged soul thus implying that there is magic that can touch, affect and harm souls.

So it should be theoretically possible to destroy the disembodied spirit though it would be dark magic.

** Destroy horcruxes and then hit the spirit with an avada. Easy
