They're one of those ships which I really wish had more fics. For some reason, though, all the recs I can find with them have Harry there too. Is there any good Hermione/Luna /without/ Harry? (I have no objections to him being in the story and doing protagonist-type stuff and so on, as long as he's not in the ship.)

For One-Shots, you can't really do better than [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/kirby/DS01.html][Divinest Sense]].

Also, if you're into some messed up shit, you can't do better than anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1296427/charis-chan][charis-chan]].

** Here are a few from AO3 that got me into this ship in the first place:

I wholeheartedly agree that this ship needs more love and more good fics. I'm planning to write more myself, but I'm a terribly slow writer.
