"Ron, what did the spell say about his magic level?"

"Blimey it's over 9000!"

  "That's the thing about halfbloods, every spell we take makes us stronger!"

  /two chapters of Harry yelling, at voldemort, to power up/

  when voldemort uses up a horcux, his body doesn't die, he just undergoes a freeza-esk transformation and shouts "this isn't even my /whole/ soul!

I could get behind something like this.

**** You'd need a wand with a dragon testicle core for such wishes to work, though.

*** But Voldemort is also a halfblood.

Ooh what if he did a ritual to purge his father's DNA from him somehow so he lost that.

What if that's what he uses his wish for, so he is stuck with only Horcrux immortality.

** I feel like this core thing came from several canon things:

- Harry was able to do a spell at 13 that normal people don't do even at 17 or 18.

- All the powerful wizards (and witches) had distinct air about them.

- Wands chooses wizard/witch telling that magic in every wizard or witch has it's own distinct touch.

- After extensive magic use wizards and witches seemed tired.

- This thing actually puts a cap on wizards and Witches. A block. Unlimited power supply is always bad. Imagine Voldemort with unlimited powers.

I neither support t nor hate it. But it's a logical explanation of how things were done in Canon. Remember canon is 3rd person limited from Harry's perspective. JK Rowling had so much leeway. Fanfic writers have to come up with theories to explain stuff happening in fics as they are 3rd Person omniscient PoV.

*** Cue for [[/u/Taure]] to drop in (we've had this out in the past on other forums)...

Hermione also tells Harry in Book 1 that he's a "great wizard," greatness apparently arising not from mere "books and cleverness."

Voldemort states, "There is only power and those too weak to seek it." Weak could be read as magical weakness, implying varying levels of magical strength.

Mismatched wands don't produce as strong of spells.

Dumbledore writes to Grindelwald, "Yes, we have been given power and yes, that power gives us the right to rule, but it also gives us responsibilities over the ruled. We must stress this point, it will be the foundation stone upon which we build... where we meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary and no more." Is power only the existence of magic (which makes neither man special, as many Wizards existed at the time) or the degree of their magical power which sets them apart?
