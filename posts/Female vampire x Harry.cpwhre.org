One of my all time favorite long fics. Probably top 5 for me.

*** Writing quality aside, what the the hell was that author thinking when they decided three chapters was an appropriate way to format a 90k word story?

**** I've read single chapters that are over 100k+ words before... A Thid Path to the Future comes to mind. The latest chapter (39) the author apologizes for it being so short (only 30k words).

***** I've read that too, though I never realized the chapters were quite that long. I've just come to accept that that's how that author writes all his stuff. Though his chapters actually make sense as discrete story units despite their size and the overall story is commensurately large. This other story op recc'd is something else though. Seeing as its marked complete I can only assume he split it into beginning-middle-end arcs rather than proper chapters.

  Harry strikes a deal with a vampire and ends up getting far more than he had expected... (Canon compliant till the end of the fifth book but with a whole bunch of invented back story. How much do we know about Potterverse vampires, after all?) No slash, potential Dumbledore bashing, kickass vampire!

** There is the fanfic "Harry Potter and the Vampire's Kiss" by The Santi where Harry is turned into a vampire and falls in love with the female vampire who turned him. I think it was taken down but I have a copy of it saved if anyone wants it.

/Summary:/ AU post OoTP. Harry's summer after Sirius' death is horrible. None of his friends write to check up on him and his life begins to seem empty and meaningless. Harry wishes for death and a young Vampire grants him it. NOT SLASH. Over 80k words.

** Not quite what you're asking for, but I remember an old (really old) fanfic where a female vampire stumbles upon a 13 year-old Harry dying (I think that's what happened at least) so to save him she gives him her blood and mentors him in being a vampire.

I don't remember what is the story's name, it's been a long time ago since I've read it.
