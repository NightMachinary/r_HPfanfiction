*** Don't you need Dumbledore to make a portkey that works in Hogwarts? Pretty sure the only reason the triwizard cup worked was because it was supposed to be a portkey back outside the maze already.

However, he could easily just do it in Hogsmeade.

*** To add onto this for an alternative ending

Harry shouted”wait,wait,wait!”

The snake faced man curious decided to hold his fire if you will. The man asked”well potter why shouldn't I kill you?” Harry eyes clenched shut opened one and looked directly at the snake man. Harry stuttered”uh-um be-because I can help you!” Voldemort's interest was peaked the boy would like to help him? No he knew this was an attempt to save his own skin though he had to admit it was a very slytherin thing for the golden boy of gryffindor to do.

“Very well potter swear loyalty to me and you get to walk.”

Lucius who had recently recovered from the shock of losing his hand said”my lord are you sure?”

Voldemort snapped”of course I am Lucius now quiet.”

The boy Harry took his time responding before saying “very well I swear to live and serve Tom Marvolo riddle.”\\
Voldemort smiled not happily but satisfied.

“Lucius call bellatrix have her escort dear mr.potter to a room.” Lucius replied”yes-yes of course my lord.”
