Those areas had pretty much the same borders when the statute of secrecy was enacted than what we have today, but the rest of Europe has undergone massive geopolitical changes, meaning there should still be a magical Prussia, a magical Papal State as well as Poland-Lithuania, the Balkans should be a different mess than their Muggle counterparts due to Ottoman involvement and so on. What are your thoughts, headcanons, AUs or story recommendations which touch on that subject? (Be it the broad political strokes or slice of life stories from those corners)


** Worth noting that Transylvania has a national Quidditch team in canon, so this heavily implies that magical governments in canon do not align with Muggle ones.

My approach in general is to consider magical governments as arising out of a people, not a territory. Which is to say that they're more nations than they are states. So for example, during the years of the Ottoman Empire, the Turkish wizards would choose a Turkish wizard to represent them at the ICW and govern them, the Egyptians would pick one from among their number, the Greeks another, etc. States come and go, but ethnicity is much more fixed. So when the British Muggles take control over Egypt, nothing changes. The Egyptian wizards still have an Egyptian magical government. They just ignore the Muggle borders.

As a result, I imagine that the precise borders of a magical government's jurisdiction are "fuzzy" except in rare situations where a single people have occupied a well-defined geographic area for an extended time. This fuzziness would be the most common cause of disputes between magical nations, but it wouldn't be too much of a problem in day-to-day life because I suspect wizards have global free movement of people. This is similar to how free movement of people within the EU helps to smooth over territorial disputes.

*** What about Muggleborns though? Imagine you are a Bosnian boy who just learned of magic. Now he is told that the same nation whose Muggles are slaughtering his countryman is the legitimate magical government responsible for him (since Bosnia lost its independence in 1463 and only regained it in 92, making it somewhat difficult to believe that there was still a magical government around five centuries later). Or some Polish girl being told that Silesia was in fact administered by Bohemia, Austria or Prussia, so she better learns that language and pay her dues.

**** Bosnia would not have lost its magical government, that's my point. I'm not saying that the magical nations correspond to the Muggle nations in 1692. I'm saying that by 1692 the magical and Muggle political geography would already be vastly different to each other.

The Statute of Secrecy did not change the world, it made official a divide that had always existed. For example, in Britain, before the Ministry wizards already had their own separate magical government called the Wizard's Council, which was ruling magical Britain as early as 1269. We also know that the Wizengamot predates the Ministry.

So I'm saying that each nationality would have its own magical government, regardless of which state rules the territory of that nationality in the Muggle world. The magical government stays the same through Muggle border changes and has its origin in a group of magical people considering themselves to be an administrative unit i.e. coming together, choosing leaders from among themselves and making rules for their group.

I don't really see your angle. I'm saying that magical governments correspond to nationality/ethnicity, of which language is a significant part. So, for example:

You're a Greek wizard during the Ottoman Empire. You speak Greek. Your magical government is Greek and speaks Greek. Your Muggle government is the Ottoman government and speaks Turkish.

It seems to me that this system of government results in a much /higher/ chance of a person speaking the same language as their government than the Muggle world. The only time it would differ would be if you're a remnant of an ethnic group which has mostly died out (to the point that there's not enough people to have a government) and a different ethnic group is now dominant in the area in which you live.

As for education: there are only 11 permanent schools of magic in the world, so if you're attending a school, you're most likely going to have to learn another language anyway. This isn't a terrible barrier: while there is no translation spell, we know there must be a magically assisted way of acquiring a language from Crouch Sr speaking over 200 languages. In any case, the vast majority of wizards are home schooled, or otherwise attend small, ad hoc educational groups that pop up and disappear over the years.

That one is rather simple since back then, Turkish was only necessary for government business while your regular day-to-day stuff was done in Greek anyway. But if you are a Russian Muggle-born wizard born in Kaliningrad, you grew up learning Russian, about the Great Patriotic War and so on. But plot-twist, some Prussian guy shows up and tells you that you are living in magical Prussia since they don't care about the World Wars or the Potsdam conference. If you want to keep living there but use magic, their laws apply. So now you need to learn German while your classmates are already learning magic. You cannot do your homework, you fall even more behind and so on.

******** You've misunderstood my point, I think. If an area is ethnically Russian, then its magical government is the Russian magical government. In your scenario, no German wizard turns up, because the area is not German. The Muggleborn is visited by a Russian wizard.

The fact that the area *used to be* ethnically German does not mean it is governed in the present by the German magical government. Like I said, government is determined by the people, not territory, and the current people are Russian. The territories administered by magical governments would not be fixed, but would be affected by the migration of ethnic groups (and indeed their being wiped out, in the case of the Americas).

Then you run into the issue of the "old" families. Could you imagine someone like Malfoy suddenly accepting German/Russian/French rule just because some Muggles made a treaty? The magical government is independent of the Muggle one, so Muggle border changes would not be reflected in their magical counterparts. That's why I am assuming that there still would be a Prussian (not German) government there.

********** Historically, people have generally had a desire to remain with their own ethnic group. I think it likely that when Muggles migrate en masse, the wizards are going to be going with them by choice, even with the separation of governments. For example, the Malfoys chose to migrate to Britain with their Muggle Norman brethren.

Perhaps after 1692 this will become more fixed, but at worst, the displaced Muggleborn is going to be in no worse situation than the many Muggles over history who have found themselves governed by those of a different nationality. Indeed, if we go by the idea that wizards have freedom of movement, they at least have the choice to go live elsewhere, a freedom which many Muggles lacked.

Edit: And I said German rather than Prussian because I'm not sure that "Prussian" is a nationality. Even in the days of the Holy Roman Empire, a common German nation was recognised as existing - it was simply divided into many states. The title "King of the Germans" was used as early as the 1000s (by Henry IV).

#+end_quote

Are we talking about the same EU? Remember how Spain started a fight with Britain over Gibraltar? Hungary's anti-refugee fence? Border disputes between Slovenia and Croatia?

How much free movement is there, really, in the magical world? Can witches and wizards just cross borders by apparating, portkey or floo? My personal headcanon says that magical governments have monopolized networks across borders, in an effort at centralizing power. We see a hint towards ministry interference in transport in the way that it's not a Hogwarts teacher teaching apparition, it's a person from the ministry. And you need a license (from the ministry) to be allowed to apparate.

The more governments nestle in between people and their needs and necessities, the more powerful they become, which is a big theme of 17th and 18th century European history. I think magicals have had the same processes of state-building that muggles had. Without a border, a state doesn't exist, and therefore borders are still fixed in the magical world.

#+end_quote

I said smooth over, not eradicate :p The EU is full of territorial disputes, but no action is really taken upon them. Whenever an EU law is written which could be relevant to such a dispute, it will generally include something like the following:

#+begin_quote
  The application of this Regulation to the territory of Gibraltar is understood to be without prejudice to the respective legal positions of the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom with regard to the dispute over sovereignty over the territory.
#+end_quote

So all territorial disputes are preserved but not progressed or resolved. The four freedoms smooth over the issue by making it as if they were all part of a single country (mostly). Which is why Brexit has caused the Gibraltar issue to flare up - the "smoothing over" will no longer exist.

With respect to state building, I agree that magical governments would have become much more institutionalised than their earlier, more informal "governing council" type. However, I don't think this excludes fuzzy borders. For example, both the French and German governments could be claiming jurisdiction over Alsace-Lorraine, with the ICW "smoothing over" the dispute.

*** That's an interesting approach. It could run into issues with infrastructure, like the Trace, and it could run into jurisdictional issues with immigration. For instance, you're a Muggleborn with Gascon heritage, but when you were fourteen, your parents moved to Brittany with you in tow. Which government is responsible for your education? Who's going to detect if you use magic near muggles? Whose Obliviators get called?

And is this impacted by the French government's work in the 1600s to the present to force everyone into a more Parisian culture and ethnicity?

This is a lot more doable if your magic is tied to people and not places. Put the Trace on a kid and you can track them around the world. You can put in Floo connections anywhere, so long as one of your people calls it home. But if you need to lay down ward stones in blood, those stones define your jurisdiction, not your ethnic group.

**** Just as English, Scottish and Welsh wizards are all of British nationality and so have a single magical government (but Ireland appears to have a separate one) I think France would have a single magical government, not one for each regional identity.

Interestingly, "Britishness" seems to go back much longer in wizarding Britain than Muggle Britain, with Hogwarts being located in Scotland but serving all of Great Britain from the 11th century or earlier.

And yes, there would be issues of jurisdiction, which to me just makes the idea more interesting (a perfect system would be unrealistic). However, it's worth noting that I'm saying these magical governments /arise/ out of nationality, but over time they would become institutionalised, and change only very slowly (i.e. if almost all British people died out and Britain was subsequently occupied by Irish people, then the Irish magical government would assume jurisdiction over the area and the British magical government with be subsumed into it, but the process would take years).

** Small remark: Prussia overlaps a lot with Poland-Lithuania, so your post is contradictory.

We know the magical and muggle worlds became seperated in the 17th century. This was the time of horrific religious wars, the Treaty of Westphalia, the golden age of the Netherlands, as well as the glory days of Poland-Lithuania, centralizing England and France, and a growing global influence of Europe through colonies. Let's look at a map of [[https://i.redd.it/akq0olc6576x.jpg][Europe after 1648]]. You had three categories of empires here: 1) western empires, strongly centralizing and advanced economically (England, France and the Netherlands). 2) central empires. very fragmented (HRE and Italian states). 3) eastern empires. Humongous, but lagging behind the West economically (Ottoman Empire, Poland-Lithuania and Russia).

I strongly doubt that magical governments were frozen in time in this state. Evidence is that Transsylvania has a quidditch team, and that the British Ministry rules over magicals in Great Britain and Ireland. The latter sounds a bit more 18th, 19th century. Now an obvious explanation for these two things is that JKR just wrote a bunch of random crap for worldbuilding, and didn't think so much about it. That gives us readers more room to let our imagination run free.

I think magicals, just like muggles, went through a long phase of state-building in the 17th, 18th and 19th century. Of centralizing power, of a growing government that is able to wedge itself more and more in the lives of every person. So what shaped the borders? Just like with muggles, it's a hodgepodge. Sometimes geography would separate them, sometimes old charters and decrees dating from the middle ages and classical antiquity, and sometimes the actions of contemporary rulers. For the magical world, we can add some cool stuff like magical anomalies, old fideliuses and other wards that have grown in power and significance over time, and conflicts with other magical creatures like goblins and giants.

So Europe, before this process of statebuilding, is a patchwork of magical communities, magically warded estates (lots of them decreed in Roman times, some even predating Roman European conquest), areas ruled by other magical creatures and so forth. And as technology advanced, governments were more able to grow in power. Floo networks were invented, giving them the ability to regulate it, link up previously isolated magical pockets. Apparition became more frequently used, so now you need a license for that. Let's build a grand governmental office for that administration! Brooms got faster and their range increased, interconnecting magicals more and more, giving them more sense of unity. States grew in size and in centralized power. And now I'm not even considering what happened in the muggle world. Surely rulers like Louis XIV had a lot of sway over magicals and their government. It was mutually beneficial, as both had the same goal of centralization and extension of power. As long as interests didn't conflict and the two worlds stayed neatly separated, empires grew hand in hand. Exceptions could be magical nationalism resulting in revolt and independance (see: Transsylvania), or situations of the past somehow surviving (see: the British Ministry ruling over Britain and Ireland. Other examples could be small German states retaining their independence even after 1870).

... I think I'll stop now.

Like I said at another point here, I doubt wizards care about Muggle borders, even if that might fuck with the Muggleborn.

The core of Prussia (East Prussia, mainly around Königsberg) was never Polish. It went from Pagan to the Teutonic Knight, who were vassals of the Polish King for a rather short period before it fell to the Prince Elector of Brandenburg, who turned it into the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. It became Russian after the second World War.

** [[/u/Hellstrike][u/Hellstrike]] [[/u/BigFatNo]] [[/u/tkannelid]] I wish to revise my previous statement.

I'm looking at the following articles as source info:

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/history-of-the-quidditch-world-cup]]

[[https://www.pottermore.com/collection-episodic/history-of-magic-in-north-america-en]]

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ministers-for-magic]]

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-malfoy-family]]

To summarise:

1.  Before 1492, Old World wizards already knew about the Americas and had some contact with the native American wizards, which were similar in number (relative to the Muggle population) as in the rest of the world. For context, the population of all the Americas at this time was likely around 50 million Muggles, whereas there were 60 million Muggles in Europe alone. In North America, the Muggle population was likely around 7 million. So we're talking about a relatively small wizarding community compared to the old world, and likely focused in Central and South America.

2.  Despite this pre-Columbian contact, relations between New World and Old World wizards were not close enough for the native Americans to adopt the wand. So we can conclude that contact was sporadic and there was no significant trade.

3.  Further, native American magical culture was not socially organised. They had no magical government.

4.  When the Muggles started migrating to the Americas, wizards went with them. These wizards initially merged with native American magical society, who welcomed the European wizards.

5.  When the native American Muggles started dying out through war and disease, this “struck a blow at the unity of the magical community”. This could be a reference to the global magical community, or more specifically the magical community in North America. I suspect the latter, given the lack of significant contact between American and European wizards prior to this. Which suggests that the immigrant European wizards started to develop a separate society of their own in America.

6.  At this point there was still no magical government in North America, and no magical law enforcement.

7.  Wizard migration to North America dropped dramatically after 1692, and many who had migrated there previously decided to leave. After this, Muggleborns made up a significant part of the base of the new wizarding population, but once Rappaport's law gets put in place in 1790, basically everyone will be “pure-blood” by old world definitions within a generation or two.

8.  It is notable that at the time that anti-Muggle sentiment was growing in America, in Britain a Minister was getting voted out of office for being too anti-Muggle.

9.  Finally, after years of lawlessness, North American wizards come together and decide to create a government to rule over themselves. The article states this was “the first time that the North American wizarding community came together to create laws for themselves”. But it's also called the Magical Congress of the United States of America. So it's not clear if it includes Canada or not. Certainly Canada has a Quidditch team, but so does Scotland. It's possible that MACUSA originally included Canada but they later went their separate ways.

10. In 1809, New Spain had a Quidditch Team.

So what conclusions can we draw?

What this appears to suggest is that the origin of magical nations is simply in a group of wizards who consider themselves a part of one community coming together (via representatives), choosing leaders from among themselves and deciding on laws to regulate that group. Interestingly this is not tied to the existence of a Muggle state at all, but rather to a magical population, which suggests that the precise territory of these states may not be necessarily clear at the time of their founding, but over time would likely become established by custom.

Since wizards are choosing their own governments from their own people in a manner divorced from the Muggle state, it suggests an answer to what happens when a Muggle state takes over another one: the wizards simply ignore it. When the Ottoman Empire takes over Egypt, the same wizarding government continues to administer Egypt. When the British take it from the Ottomans, the magical government continues. The wizards watch the wars and conquests of their Muggle brethren with a mixture of bemusement and embarrassment, and then continue their lives as normal.

Another interesting thing is that wizarding Britain (not England) appears to have been a single administrative unit in the wizarding world long before it was in the Muggle world. Presumably this means that British wizards considered themselves to be a single community when they created the Wizards' Council to represent and govern them.

HOWEVER, the above state of affairs does not always hold.

Firstly, wizards can get involved in Muggle wars. We know from the Malfoy family article that they joined the Norman invasion of England. Post-statute of secrecy, magical warfare appears to be forbidden by the ICW (see the Crimean War comment). However, it's clear that World War 1 was not just a conflict between Muggle nations, but also between magical states, so this rule has been flouted on at least one occasion. It seems likely that all sides decided to help their Muggle counterparts in order to counter everyone else doing the same, and thus magical states all got sucked in where they were supposed to keep themselves separate. Similarly, the British Ministry's response regarding the American Revolutionary War -- “sitting this one out” -- implies that they don't sit all of them out.

Secondly, wizards can get involved in the conquest of other wizards. The existence of a magical New Spain is significant, because a magical New Spain is simply incompatible with a magical Aztec, Maya, Inca etc. It's possible that European magical diseases wiped out the local population in an analogy to the Muggle world, but it's also possible (likely, even, given that disease likely wouldn't finish the job) that Spanish wizards conquered the local magical societies alongside their Muggle partners. This occured before the Statute of Secrecy so it's not unknown for wizards to fight in Muggle territorial wars (see the Malfoys) but it's the first example we have of wizards not just joining a Muggle war, but actively conquering the parallel magical society.

So the answer to the question of what rule determines which magical states exist seems to be “there isn't a rule”. Sometimes magical nations are created by the spontaneous democratic act of a group of wizards. Sometimes a Muggle conflict is entirely Muggle and has zero impact on magical governments (US Revolutionary War). Sometimes a Muggle conquest involves wizards but only has an impact on the governance of the Muggle world (Norman invasion). Other times a Muggle conquest comes with a magical conflict as well, in which the wizards fight for dominance (Spanish Empire).

*** This again proves that Rowling has very little knowledge about the world outside of the former Empire because the "sometimes it changes, sometimes it does not" answer has some serious issues when applied to Europe. WWI involvement is interesting because it raises a lot more questions than it answers, from the Versailles treaty and the break up of the Central Powers up to the Eastern Borders (Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Baltics, Russia (Finland with Karelia)), especially considering the Russian Civil War and the Polish-Soviet war 1919-21.

And that doesn't even address the question of how and when Germany was unified because the collapse of the "first Germany" (Holy Roman Empire) collapsed due to religious reasons which cumulated in the thirty years war which doomed it, Napoleon just had to look sternly for it to collapse. Then there is the German Question (with or without Austria and it's dependencies, which at that time included Bohemia and Hungary and parts of the Balkans and Poland).

I mean, I use a magical, decentralised HRE as headcanon for my fics, but given that it would include everything from the low countries to Prussia, Bohemia and Austria, there are some serious balancing issues against the other European States. I need the Spanish Empire to exist just to have a counterweight, even if that raises the issue of Habsburg Spain, the Diets of Worms and Brussel (IIRC) and the War of the Spanish Succession. And that's just for a fanfic, not some work sold millions of times.

This depends greatly on how much land you need, and in part on how much exclusive infrastructure a nation needs. If your nation only needs a few square kilometers and the Mayan magical nation needs the same, you could fit them both in the same county with room to spare, let alone the same continent. Maybe you need to coordinate with other nations in the area for some things, like locating muggleborns and deciding which society they'll enter.

Or perhaps you need to set up a lot of infrastructure to support things like the Floo network, portkeys, and Apparition, and perhaps you need a lot of land for farming things like dragons and venomous tentacula. Or you need exclusive control of an area to reliably find muggleborns. That means that New Spain would have to seize territory or be a vassal of another country.

Anyway, I only see this as useful as a way to come up with interesting things to write. I don't really care about canon so much.
