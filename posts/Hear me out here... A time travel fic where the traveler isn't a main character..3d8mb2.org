So I've just finished catching up with Applied Cultural Anthropology (I'll link it using the bot in the comments below) and the author's portrayal of a competent Lockhart got me thinking that he was competent for a reason other than "AU".

One of these half formed theories was "what if he somehow was a future character that had been jumped back in time/a different body? He looks like he's learnt from mistakes that haven't happened yet."\\
Anyway, I think that a time travel "This will change everything" fic entirely from the perspective of someone who has no clue about time travel would be a pretty interesting read. What does everyone else think? Dumb idea? Best new fic concept?

If there's a positive enough response I might try and write a shortish one.

/Edit for clarity; my idea was a canon character (for example, Colin Creevey) goes back from post-DH to a time during the books with the purpose of changing the established future, but that sort of happens in the background and the main story focuses on Harry and co. reacting to the changes being brought on by a suddenly super-competent side character./

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

*** I love that story! They write The Doctor really well in it... But like CalcasieuRed said, it's not what I meant; I'm specifically talking about a canon character going back from a time post-DH and changing the timeline... basically what I'm talking about is the standard "back with a purpose" plot being thrown onto a character that the fic doesn't focus on much, if at all.

*** Eeeeh, I guess it does... I was more hoping for a fic in which a character goes back to the time period of the books and then changes the canon future instead of one that takes place entirely post-DH. Also, I'm very anti-Dramione, unless one of them has been written OOC, and judging by the summary they've kept it canon compliant apart from Fred dying so...

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
