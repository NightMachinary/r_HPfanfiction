I've been on instagram the last couple days and I've been looking at a couple fan accounts for Harry Potter. The comments have all been super toxic lately and they've been attacking people for not liking canon stuff and overall just being very ignorant of the fact that people can have an imagination and build the Hp universe to beyond what the books include. I got so shocked because this seems to come out of nowhere and I don't understand why people are trying to exclude other people who just want to enjoy the series?

Edit: Changed a word


** Sometimes I fear that the Harry Potter, particularly those who are into fan-fiction and enjoy shipping characters have become more excluding in most all aspects. There is so much gate-keeping that I am glad I have already found my community and am safe within it surrounded by all my wholesome people.\\
To me, shipping non-canon ships is incredibly enjoyable because you don't have any canon content and you go on the internet, and find a pile of fan-fiction and fan-art created by those who have had the same or similar thought to yourself.\\
This should be something that brings people together, not creates a disconnect.\\
I agree it is such a shame to see, particularly in a series about the promotion of equality, freedom and self-discovery.\\
I have no time for gate-keepers and I am sorry you have had to witness this toxicity and I hope you don't give up on finding a community that suits you.

*** Shippers become weird little cliques on most fandoms, and they often become rather hostile to each other. It's a shame but it happens pretty reliably.

Usually, the older the fandom, the less obvious this is, because most people eventually realize how silly shipping arguments are. And then the conversations just sort of trail off and leave the main discourse.

And on a fandom as large as Harry Potter, each ship feels like a small fandom in and of itself, with fans and fanfiction their own unique quirks, cliches, repeated themes, inside jokes, general opinions, etc.

**** Agreed.\\
I am 100% guilty of this, but mostly because I have come across a lot of hate in the past and wish to protect myself, this is why I have Discord server where any and all Harry Potter ships are welcome, but to be honest the majority of us all just hang about and watch videos together and chat about hobbies.

The only reason I tend to distance myself from the general Harry Potter shippers (though not today apparently) is because that is where I find most of the hate comes from. I love any and all ships and love hearing about others talk about the ones they love, it is always such fun

** I don't know if it's any worse than it was pre-HBP. The shipping wars then were pretty brutal, haha.

However, I do find that there is a lot more toxic hate in the HP fandom nowadays. As soon as we stopped talking about shipping, it felt like the fandom in the past largely got along. Now it feels very splintered (and yes, I do blame JKR for part of it). So many topics get such a huge backlash if you even so much as mention it.

*** Maybe I'm not in the right areas of the fandom anymore, but god it's *sooooo* much less toxic than it used to be.

The 2000's had real life stalking, hacking, sock puppets, a big author scamming readers, and a major site imploding due to admin drama off the top of my head. That's not even getting into the insanity of shipping and the "delusionals".

Okay everyone hates Cursed Child (the play is good despite the story being trash), and JK Rowling being transphobic is problematic, but people negging non-canon ships seems like nothing in comparison to the craziness it used to be.

I meant that shipping wars are a lot less toxic now than they were back then. There are other topics that take the center stage as more problematic. The stalking has definitely decreased, so you're right about that. However, I feel like that it was only present in some communities. The majority were pretty tame (at least from my recollection).

I find [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] and similar subreddits to be pretty mild (which is lovely), but there are other places on Reddit and Facebook that get super heated. And I'm defining toxic as any conversation that devolves into personal attacks. Here are some of the more controversial topics:

- Cursed Child (people aren't allowed to talk about the parts they enjoyed)
- black Hermione
- any headcanon with a character as another race
- LGBTQ+ representation

There are certain non-canon ships I tend to not enjoy, but the reason for that is usually not the ship itself but that so many writers seem to couple it with character bashing. - But even then, if it is somebody s cup of tea I have no problem with it.

******* Some people aren't looking for criticism, though. If you're not in an "improvement" state of mind, it can be hard to read something that's critical. Also, when everything is just plain text, it's hard to know what tone something is said in. It's a combination of reviewers not being explicit in their kind intentions (not that they have to be) and authors seeing rage and criticism side by side with little distinction.

Sometimes receiving criticism, even when you know it's kind-hearted, is just a reminder that what you're writing is being judged and it can be a bit paralyzing.

You could say that if someone's going to post something online, they should be prepared for any type of feedback. Yeah, that's probably the healthier approach. But also, if someone says that they're not looking for criticism, you should respect their request.

9 times out of 10, if a fic has "Don't like, don't read" in the summary, that author has had a bunch of criticism for it or another fic, and is responding defensively - thus rejecting any possible constructive elements of said criticism.

Personally, i'm of the mindset that the story matters more than the pairing. I'm pretty open to who Harry - and everyone else - gets paired to. I'm a member of both the Harry/Hermione & Harry/Ginny subreddits - it would be more if I wouldn't spend all day reading fics. it's all to easy to when working from home 😅

Hopefully this'll all calm down because it's starting to just split the community up. I know it won't happen, but it would be nice if we could see more celebration of actual writing skill (which there is a lot of here) rather than basing our whole community off pairings.

Back when we had active archives/forums devoted to specific ships (Gryffindor Tower only featured H/G ships, sugarquill for Ron/Hermione, there was a Draco/Ginny archive I forgot the name of) and things could get /vile/ between them. Canon or non-canon, for some people the fact it's not the ship in /their/ canon is enough to fling vitriol.

** I've seen this happen in another fandom, where young fans, who were probably fandom-ing for the first time, were absolutely destroying the creators because the most famous ship didn't become canon, while older fans, or at least those who were more experienced in fandoms, were kinda disappointed but seemed to understand shipping is not the same thing as wanting it to happen officially.

There's this gap sometimes, between fans who read fanfiction and fans who seem to not even know what that is. "Canon" fans tend to discuss what happens in the story with really mild what-ifs, mostly thinking about canon-compliant events. Not to say their thinking is shallow, they can go really deep, but it's deep /into canon/. "Fandom" fans will propose some outlandish thing (like, idk "what if Harry went to Azkaban") and 'canon' fans will Not Understand, because /they think you want the thing to happen in canon/, since that's how /they/ interact with Harry Potter. But in reality, you just want to read 100k words about /the possibility/.

That creates a sort of cult to the purity of canon, where everything that isn't official is automatically labeled as inferior because of the "weird fanfiction people". On the other side of the coin, you get a backlash against what /is/ official, because the possibilities seem much less limiting.

Of course, most people aren't 100% on one side of the other, but it's the extremities that tend to fight.

** Hmm, I dunno about “coming out of nowhere.” HP shipping wars have existed since time immemorial, it's just that fans, both old and new (i.e. those who weren't part of the fandom during the original publication run or the release of the movies) are still engaging in it in 2020 so it can seem like it's a new phenomenon. I suspect the whole social media stan culture has a bit to do with how---for the lack of a better word, /militant/ it can all get.

Now don't get me wrong---online communities are wonderful, more so if you find one where the people are friendly or like you and take you into the fold, but because they are made up of people they reflect how they behave (offline) in groups: They share a belief, they are eager to be right, and they want to rally more people to their cause. And this is not just the Canon shippers. I'm a non-Canon shipper myself who'd been around for the general nastiness of the Shipping Wars of ‘06 (three guesses as to what my ship was/is), albeit I was too young to have participated in it, but I'd be the first to admit that no side can wash their hands clean off of that. Shipping has become a bit of a sport, really, so it's not spared from raging fans who trash-talk the competition and pick fights because of it, etc etc.

All of which is to say, it is the most human thing to want to go to war for a cause and (figuratively) die for it, as we HP fans should very well know---or more often than not, throw digital flames and spears around for it.

Much as I'd like to think that the HP fandom should've grown past that by now, as many of us are probably in our 30s to 40s... sometimes some people just have their base instincts at work when they're engaging online. Which absolutely should not be the case. Online spaces are strange things because we haven't a direct precedent for it, but if you look at it as just a group of people coming together in a (virtual) space to represent different interests in an argument, it becomes a bit clearer as to why people can act the way they do.

I'm a firm believer in everyone staying in their own damn lane so that everyone can have their fun. Some people find it invigorating to bicker with others, which I suppose is well and good within reason, but I think the rest of us can all agree that what we look for in fandom is a break from real life, so it is in our interests to keep online fandom spaces as stress-free as possible.

That is the simple truth."

To continue to use her own words, she more recently felt the need to conflate gender transition with conversion therapy.

"Many, myself included, believe we are watching a new kind of conversion therapy for young gay people, who are being set on a lifelong path of medicalization that may result in the loss of their fertility and/or full sexual function."

Is that ignorance or wilful slander of her position? She never said this. What she said is that there are sexual predators among us, for whom having transgender certificate without any hassle is the golden opportunity to commit crimes. Not *every* transgender woman (I get always lost which is which ... born as a man with all male bits trying to be a woman) is a predator. But apparently male privilege even includes a right to decide when one can use ladies room.

It's what she says directly. There's no need to slander someone when you can, as I did, simply quote them.

"So I want trans women to be safe. At the same time, I do not want to make natal girls and women less safe. When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he's a woman -- and, as I've said, gender confirmation certificates may now be granted without any need for surgery or hormones -- then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside. That is the simple truth.

On Saturday morning, I read that the Scottish government is proceeding with its controversial gender recognition plans, which will in effect mean that all a man needs to ‘become a woman' is to say he's one."

"I refuse to bow down to a movement that I believe is doing demonstrable harm in seeking to erode ‘woman' as a political and biological class and offering cover to predators like few before it."

Just another TERF concern trolling with the idea that cis men are going to 'pretend' to be trans in order to access women's bathrooms and assault them. The same oh-so familiar rhetoric used to justify the so-called 'bathroom bills' in the States, and with the same cynical desire to refuse to recognize transgender people as their proper gender, only this time set off by Scotland working to shorten the waiting period required for that recognition to be legal as well as social.

** I have been reading fanfiction online for more then twenty years and offline for even longer, and these things come in waves. Ignoring the groups that insist that what a character's sexual orientation in canon is then it has to be the same in all fics. And ignoring those who insist that a show/book/movie/series is to wholesome to allow incest, bdsm, harems, ect... I even saw one group that insisted that an old British show called May to December was to wholesome to include a relationship that was a cougar/cub pairing even though the main plot of May to December is an older man/younger woman in a relationship. As if an older man/younger woman relationship was fine but an older woman/younger man relationship is immoral.

There will always be someone(s) that grip and complain about canon/non-canon ships or about gender/specie/race/age/sexual orientation in a fic. As long as they don't start flaming your stories or blocking you if they are a moderator of the site you normally post at, ignore them. Find a site(s) that has more of the ship(s) that you like. Ask groups like this one for fic recs or even site recs.

Erase the flames, block them from commenting on your stories if that site allows or calmly counter them. If they are blocking a story you wrote, start looking for a new site(s) to post on, then repost your old stories at your new site(s) as well as the one(s) they blocked and leave a note on your old site about the move. Also remember to ad a note on your new site that some of your stories are reposts and include your old name in that note if you change your name when you change site(s).

** I'm a casual shipper, I'd say. I'm happy to read fics focused on any ship, as long as the chemistry and buildup work.

The canon Harry/Ginny doesn't do much for me, since it feels more like Rowling shoved it in as consolation for Ron and Hermione getting together.

Which is why I love fanfiction. While I'll probably never get over that first gut reaction of "Harry and Ginny? Ehh..." I can, however, find immense joy in how others add to that pairing.

To use other fandoms, Naruto is the fandom I feel most comfortable with M/M pairings. Somehow, despite my bring straight, seeing Kakashi be cute with a boyfriend, or Naruto being inclined to his feminine side are both able to melt my heart into a happy puddle.

RWBY, by contrast, is a series for which I'm almost overly picky. I'll still read just about any combination you could think of (except enabler, eww), but you've gotta really make the chemistry work for me to buy that everyone's bi, otherwise it just descends into crack.

But that's all in fanfiction. In regards to canon, I'll always take what I'm given, as long as there's even a bit of chemistry, and it has a foundation that's more than just pandering to the audience.

Harry/Ginny has scant little chemistry, to the point where it'd make as much sense for Harry and Luna to get together, but that's nowhere near my biggest complaint about canon.

In Naruto, NaruHina works because Naruto recognizes Hinata's strength and is emotionally mature enough to realize she's honest in her emotions, unlike that time Sakura "confessed" in hopes of getting Naruto to quit running himself ragged chasing Sasuke.

SasuSaku also works, to a lesser extent, for the reason stated above. The only real blip is whether Sasuke still deserves Sakura's devotion after everything he's done, but that's all a matter of opinion.

And then there's Bmblb. Much as I love Yang and Blake as characters, the foundation of their relationship is still shaky at best, but I'm hoping to see that there's more than just chemistry and pandering holding the ship together. Of course, what would be an amazing thing in the world of fiction would be for it to not work out, and they attempt other options. That's be a very teenager thing to do, but sadly 87% of fiction seems to be based on the misconception that teenagers won't date until they've found The One (™️), and then they are either married or never date again.

Ahhh well, that's my ship ramble done for the week.

TLDR: I want to see chemistry and fireworks in my 3 course ship/meal, not a pandering fast food burger of sadness and too much mayo.

*** I actually remember liking a bunch of Harry/Ginny stuff before it was canon - because the fics took the time to develop the pairing. And then it became canon, and the canon was so boring, and I dropped it.

I dislike NaruHina but I agree that it was better developed than Harry/Ginny. Which is too bad because Harry/Ginny had a lot of potential, which Rowling did squat with.

**** Oh yeah. And the reason I like NaruHina is, as I said, because there's chemistry between them, the foundation of their relationship isn't made of sand, and they're wholesome together. I'm sure it would have been even better had Kishimoto been a romance author, but that wasn't his focus so I'm happy with what we got, and am happy to let fanfiction give me all the cute WAFFy moments.

I just wish the Harry/Ginny ship didn't rely entirely on fanfiction to get even a passing grade. There are fully fanon ships that are more seaworthy, which is sad for something considered canon.

** I can't say I've ever seen any ships involving heavy artillery in Harry Potter so to learn that people are really anti them now is quite surprising to me. In fact, there barely any cargo ships at all

(I'm sorry, it just seemed so obvious a joke to make.)

In terms of shipping... yeah, ship wars are a Thing. I guess, the explanation that some people have proposed about the whole TERF stuff is a serviceable explanation for why you might notice it more now. There are all sorts of ways that people handle dealing with "creator of thing I like is a terrible person" and not everyone drives a hard distinction between "thing" and "its creator". Some people even draw a distinction between living and dead authors since the living author personally benefits from continued consumption and interest in their work. It seems possible that this state of confusion might manifest in "well, I need to defend what I like" which means defending canon.

Honestly, some of the comments on this sub about canon compliant or muggle AU fics are quite gate keepery, too. Even in this thread there's a comment to the effect of "superfans need to be aware of fanfic"... I'm not sure if that's what [[/u/Lord_Anarchy][u/Lord_Anarchy]] meant to say though. Fanfics are just one way of engaging with a property.

I know the idea of "if you don't like it, don't read it" blew up a bit ITT but... it's true. We're not talking about a situation where the existence of a 120k Drapple inhibits the production or even exposure of every fic and ship one does like. If you don't like Drapple... and I suspect no-one likes it enough to have written such a long one... just go find something else. Power to the author who wrote it, but as readers we should just move on and find something we want to read whether that's canon compliant, canon ships or whatever else.

(And yes, I know, there's a good chance our hypothetical Drapple superfan probably would like some acknowledgement that their fic is out there and being found by people but... I'm sure they'd rather get feedback from someone who was genuinely curious about their fic. Possibly, even if they ended up hating it. For example, I take every possible opportunity to suggest someone read my eventually Hinny Azkaban fic. [[https://medium.com/@Frameworkisdigimon/to-the-ordinary-world-everybodys-got-to-write-an-azkaban-fic-sometime-2785009bffe8][I can't be the only person like this.]])

And now I'm veering into the troublesome question of whether or not an author should say that their fic is going to have such and such ship in the summary.....

I'm not sure what options there are here... and sometimes it is good to have people who come along and say "actually, that thing you like is deeply problematic"... but I guess starting a discussion about it is reasonable. At least some people end up thinking.

** It's really upsetting in my opinion. I'm a huge shipper of Harry/Hermione and somebody asked me if I've even read the books, which is very offensive. I've literally read the whole series nearly 10 times. Let's push that aside, however... I understand why Harry would like Ginny, and I also LOVE the Hinny ship, but it just came out of absolutely nowhere and it doesn't have a lot of build throughout the entire series. Now before Harry developed feelings for Ginny, I always thought he was going to end up with Hermione. Don't come at me with the "they're more like siblings" tosh. The two have went through absolutely everything together and they've never left each other's side, and there are many more reasons and even quotes from the book with which I can provide more reasons... I understand, it would be very predictable, but I just cant push aside that they would be a perfect couple. That's why we need the fan content, so everyone should be at least happy, so we dont need to strive off only the books. Sorry about that rant, I'm just really defensive when it comes to my ships. It's just really offensive that others put other ships down just because they aren't canon. This is a huge fandom, one of the biggest in the world, and there are many toxic people as well as those who accept everybody for what they like. There are many various ships and opinions, and it doesnt have to be canon. I really don't understand? People like a certain pairing, what's wrong with that? Everybody should be free to like what they like without being put down. Now, I dont like Drarry/Dramione ships, but I dont offend people who do, and I dont attempt to just list reasons at them why it wouldn't work! I also understand why people would ship them. Everybody has certain preferences, and I understand that people also dont like my ships, but they dont need to be toxic about it and put me and everyone else who ships it down to show their ship is "superior". Now, I absolutely understand the hate on ships like Snape/Hermione or Harry/Voldemort. Those are simply... pedophilic. But I dont understand why anyone should bring other ships down.

I'm with you on Harry/Voldemort. That stuff tends to be quite gross with nonsense like the horcrux in Harry being used to justify why he at 15 is "soulmates" with a 70 year old man and it's 99% of the time used to push forward a ship between a teenage boy and a man old enough to be his grandfather. (The 1% that aren't usually revolve around the premise that "Tom" comes back via the diary and is technically sixteen. That's less gross, but there are still huge moral issues for me of shipping Harry with the guy who killed his family.) In case you can't tell, this is one I just won't read, not if you paid me!

But Hermione/Snape, not actually usually so gross. The majority of these fics run with the idea that he somehow survived the Shack and they end up getting together when they meet by chance years later when Hermione becomes a potions expert or Hogwarts teacher and is in her 20s. I don't think shipping a woman in her 20s with a man in his 40s is particularly gross, especially a character like Hermione who absolutely knows her own mind and is easy to write as independent and not coercable. Tbh I love the H/S ship that concentrates on this sort of premise - that they end up working together as /adult equals/ and go from enemies to friends to being a couple because they respect each others intellect and skills. I love anything where Hermione can have a conversation with someone who can genuinely keep up with her thought process, rather than Ron's usual fanon reaction of /shock that someone could read and remember words./ That said there are stories out there that use this ship to justify an adult man with an underage girl, or a student-teacher relationship - both illegal, both coercive and abusive, both gross. That's never acceptable. But done well, with Hermione aged up to 25 or so, I think this can be a good ship and there's some really well written ones out there.

**** I understand, ADULT Hermione and ADULT Snape fics that can be handled well are acceptable. I guess I've never actually gotten into it, I've just seen student/teacher fics that are... gross, abusive, and I didn't want to search more on that ship. I definitely understand now, it could work if it's well-written and Hermione isn't underage. The story would seem interesting and I like the aspect of Hermione and Snape working together at Hogwarts. I also love the enemies to lovers trope, it builds their relationship a lot and they can overall become a great couple, leaving behind the past. In that comment I'm just talking about all the pedophilic shipping stories that nobody should ever see in my opinion. Nobody should ever try to justify a relationship between an underage child and a full-grown adult. If you make the characters appropriate ages then the ship could work. I've just been more on the basic side if you put it that way. (I mostly just read Harmione or Hinny fics when it comes to romance). Also, the Voldemort/Harry pairing in my opinion is the worst or one of the worst ships ever. Voldemort literally made his life miserable and killed everyone he loved, he also wanted to kill him more than anything in existence. No. Just no. I will never in my life read anything with Harry and Voldemort pairing.

Absolutely. 100%. It's grim and it upsets me there's so much of it in the fandom. I also think it's gross when people write explicit sex scenes between two underage kids - I was once reading what seemed like a perfectly good fic that was Harry/Hermione - I assumed it would be a long build up to them having a relationship when they were like 15 or 16. For 20 chapters, that's exactly what it was. Tropey, but well written. I'm enjoying it greatly. And then, BAM, explicit scene about two eleven year old kids "exploring each others bodies," and their parents tell them "because you're soul mates you might be ready for sex next year." What, when they're twelve? No thank you. I don't want to read about sex between children ta.

Harry/Voldemort can get in the fucking sea. Preferably when the sea is on fire. There's a sixty year age difference and Voldemort killed his parents. That could never, even with an adult Harry or deaged Voldemort, be a healthy relationship. I don't like it, I won't read it, and I'm so pleased to find someone else who feels strongly about this!

****** I agree with absolutely everything you just said. I think I've also read something similar on that Harry/Hermione one. I don't remember the name or the author and honestly I'm glad I don't. It was during their first year and it started off great with their friendship and all. Then, near the end of one chapter when they're trapped in the room with potions, there is a really graphic and intense sex scene OUT OF NOWHERE... I dont really want to talk about it. I dont know how one can come up with children, CHILDREN having sex, and actually writing it as if it were passionate or something like that. First off, it is absolutely unacceptable and a disgrace. Second, children, especially these two, would have never even known what it is let alone act it. There wasnt even a warning in the description...

Another thing that disgusts me is bestiality. I've heard of it and it's just fucking gross, I'm lucky I havent stumbled upon a fic like that yet. Please dont tell me there are people who actually make ships like these if they actually exist? I hope not. I cant bare to imagine what it would be.

Voldemort kills Harry's parents. Voldemort haunts Harry in his dreams. He is the reason Harry has PTSD. Voldemort has controlled Harry's mind. Voldemort has tortured Harry. Voldemort is the reason Harry feels like he is different from everyone else, being marked and everything, instead of having the happy life he could've had with James and Lily. No, he is left with the Dursleys where he is neglected and shoved in a cupboard. He also feels like an outcast in his own World of magic, where he thinks he is like everyone. Even there he has to be special in a way, because of Voldemort making him his main target. Voldemort wants to kill him more than anyone in the World, and you're telling me this is a pairing that people actually ship? Hands down worst ship anyone has ever come up with. Voldemort is the one that made Harry's life hell.
