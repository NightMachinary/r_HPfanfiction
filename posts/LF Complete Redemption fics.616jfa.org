Could be Snape, Malfoy, whoever. It doesn't matter if it's time travel or what. Just make sure the fic is complete.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

*** This fic is fantastic if u can get past the premise (that Draco is exiled to the Muggle World). It's probably the only real fic I've read where Draco truly realizes how much of a shit he is and then learns to become a better person for it.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/31886][Memories and Dreams]] is a canon and epilogue-compliant series that redeems both Snape and Dudley.

The premise is that Dudley growing up becomes a social worker helping abused kids, and one of those kids turns out to be a Muggle-born wizard (which attracts Harry and Hermione). I won't spoiled how Snape is integrated into the story, because of spoilers but it's quite good.
