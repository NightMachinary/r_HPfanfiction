I went into this fic not at all expecting to like it much or to get through the whole thing, but was pleasantly surprised when I spent several days not being able to put my phone down. It is Remus/Tonks, gives a very detailed idea of the inner workings of the order, and really maps out their relationship beginnings. There is a great balance of Angst and Fluff, and it for the most part sticks to canon. I would really recommend this fic, its well written and truly charming. To anyone who has read this - do you know any more similar ones? I loved the portrayal of Sirius in this, and would be eager to see a fic with Remus, Tonks or Sirius written in a similar way.


** Not precisely the same, but for a canon-compliant but humorous look at the early days of the Remus/Tonks relationship, I'll always suggest Gilpin's Up All Night. linkffn(3159138)

And in keeping with the Christmas theme, I like the short story Remus Lupin and the Christmas Snail. Only has a little Remus/Tonks, but it popped into mind when I saw this request. linkffn(2191224)

  Co authored with Mrs Tater. The night before Harry's hearing in OotP and, for Remus and Tonks, it really was asking for trouble to go out like this. Risky and unprofessional. In fact, anything might happen... COMPLETE
