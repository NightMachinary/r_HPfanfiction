I really, really want to read something that covers a realistically-rendered historical period through the lenses of the wizarding world. Maybe something like Hogwarts life in the 1600s or the 1800s - many 'modern' age fanfiction seems to stress that tradition used to be more prominent, etc. I want to read about this supposed prominence so much. OCs are more than fine.

If no one's written anything fleshed out of this sort, I might actually end up writing something myself for it. This is what I get for listening to 'In Noctem' on a nonstop loop for the past 2 1/2 hours. /Pls/.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

#+begin_quote
  The war in Europe and a trainload of muggle children, sent as evacuees to the safety of Hogsmeade, receive more attention in the village than events in the wizards' school. Familiar names wear younger faces. Acts of kindness bring their own punishment.

  The school stood long before the boy with the unusual scar arrived. Each year new students enter, and old leave. 1835 featured its own triumphs and tragedies as students in the houses contend with each other for recognition as the best house at Hogwarts.

Buffy crossover, but really well done without overpowering either side. I'm not sure how realistic it is as I know almost nothing about the American war of independence.

** linkffn(7305804) may fit a bit into what you're looking for, but considering is a timetravel fic, maybe not. It's set during the foundation of Hogwarts, so at least it's historical.

  In Parseltongue, there is no word for "end." Written from a Ten Names Game prompt and a lot creepier than my normal fare.
