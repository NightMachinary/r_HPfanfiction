I just started reading this story because i saw it recommended quite often. But i must say i think its really horrible. Hermione shouts for no reason and 11 year old talk like their 40. I stopped when Harry got on first name Basis with Daphne and Tracie, because he used some hair product. Either this fic is some inside joke i dont get, or will it improve later on?


** I read it just for the interesting twists, but you can get those just by skimming. In fact, I recommend skimming, because in third year (which starts somewhere around chapter 90?) it gets bogged down in mini-plots. I think the author has lost their way and has chosen to focus on world-building to make up for it. As another person mentioned, the first year is bad, second year makes up for it, and third year is going nowhere. Tropes have yet to be subverted, too.

** Honestly I used to love it, but now the updates are slower, I find myself forgetting what happened previously. It gets quite AU and because of the sheets amount of fics I read every day, I can't keep up. Also, it has become quite boring imo. AUs only work if they either only change a few factors, or if they change everything. Anything on between, I find myself always comparing with the original and other similar stories, not able to tell which is which.

** It tries to be a meta-critique of overused HP fanfiction tropes. Not in the lampshade hanging that, say, HPMOR has toward canon, but in trying to twist them to be good.

It doesn't always succeed. It does tend to give fresh takes on the ideas, though.

** It improves, but it still has many problems.

The fic combines many popular tropes (wbwl, Harry in Slytherin) with being pretty internally consistent, having a lot of twists and some interesting ideas and new plotlines. It also used to have a really fast update rate.

But now that it slowed, it is really obvious how crappy the pacing is. Additionally the fic relies too much on cliches, which author promised to deconstruct, but which he mostly plays straight. The good worldbuilding ideas are counterbalanced by some really bad ones, and sometimes a muggle wank pokes through.

Despite its faults, it's a fun read if you stop on the end of the second year. Reading the third one so far is frustrating as new chapters largely fail to move the plot forwards.

**** Now that I think, I really should've used "outweighed", there is more bad ideas than good ones.

Good:

- Magical Australia built by those who for one reason or another had to escape
- Using the Killing Curse wand-movement from Pottermore looking like sowilo curse to explain how spells reflect ideas through symbols and at the same time tie it into the plot.
- In a rare case of what I will criticise in a moment being good - Hogwarts having a high degree of independence fom British goverment to ensure its neutrality.

Bad:

- A ton of strained explanations for canon elements. Like author thinking "why people hate werewolves when they are a containable and limited problem?" and deciding that werewolves are actually monsters even in human form except for Lupin who is special for some reason.
- A ton of strained explanations for fanon elements. Like the kids not acting like kids due to drinking potion that puts the information into their heads. Ah, it's not like the information is put into the potion or requires the knowledge of the creator. Everybody with the same recipe will get the same outdated physics potion for example.
- Magical cores *Sometimes there are elements of worldbuilding that are put in without any thought put into them that wasn't even necessary to mention - like the tools used in magic by far easterns few chapters back.

Muggle wank:

- Muggles have so convienient transportation! And they can go into space! Wow! It's so great and unimaginable!

Did this need an explanation? It seems very realistic to me that there would be prejudice against werewolves, particularly considering that wolfsbane is only a recent invention.

***** The "we program our young kids with knowledge via potions" bit stood out most to me. That sounds like the starting premise for a psychological horror fic, or a crossover with The Matrix.

The ethical and societal implications if that actually happened would be enormous. There's just no way that the wizarding world of Harry Potter would look the way it did if that actually was how they 'educated' (programmed) their children.

*** So I haven't read any of third year yet, so this is just based on the first two. But I'd say the author at least somewhat subverts the tropes. At least in contrast to fics that use them seriously with no subversion at all, like the Sarcasm and Slytherin series.

** The first 100k+ words (30 odd chapters) are utter shite. Supposedly the second year improves a lot, but I couldn't be bothered to slog through 17 interludes to get to the second year.

I've read posts that spoil some things and I have to admit that some of the ideas sound genuinely clever, but I also gather that they're stuck in between dozens of chapters of filler that build the backstories of tertiary characters instead of moving the plot along, the author throws any idea they come up with in there without regard for pacing, saturation, or tonal consistency, and for all that has happened, we know from the prologue that the twins will still be at each other's throats in year 4, and James will still be an unrepentant dickhead.

In those first 100k words I did read the author hammered every cliche on the fucking head and then apparently claims that they subvert them 40 chapters later. That's not subverting tropes, it's just bad writing. The protagonist seems like someone who would be featured on [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]].

In all, PoS reminds me of MoR. I despise MoR.

Given all that, I am not the slightest bit surprised that it's so massively popular.

You seem to think otherwise, and I'd like to hear your reasoning.

********* The story starts out as Harry-centric with 95% of the story from Harry's perspective. Mid-way through the story, the author introduces a Gary Stu Mulciber who gets increasing wordcount devoted to him. He's basically super indy Harry in OC form. Then later, the same happens for Sturgis. Meanwhile a massively over the top Sirius subplot takes up an increasing proportion of the story. By the time you get to the sequel, Harry is basically forgotten about as an afterthought, as is the original premise of the fic, and the fic is just a huge wank over the three "OCs" of Sirus, Mulciber and Sturgis.

I mean, the Harry in the story is massively unlikeable, so leaving him behind isn't exactly the worst thing, but the replacements are just as objectionable.

** Spoiler, if you read ahead a bit they start shunning him again.

I absolutely loved it and it improves drastically later on. I definitely thought year 1 was the slowest and has the most "abrupt" changes to canon characters, since it basically plays all the tropes straight and doesn't really do much interesting stuff in the way of twists, but year 2 definitely picks up. The end of year 2, with Lockhart, and the start of year 3 were great, especially the arc where Jim and Ron go to magical India for a few chapters and the whole setup/payoff with the escape of the Prisoner of Azkaban. In year 2 especially, the fic does a good job of fleshing out the characters without devolving into bashing, especially of Ron + Harry's brother, and I've seen much of the same in year 3 - most Twin/WBWL fics make the brother a target for bashing, but Jim gets a ton of great development over time, and secondary characters (Theo, Blaise, Marcus, Ron, Hermione) have their own solid goals and characters arcs that they go through. The Malfoy character development is also pretty original. Dumbledore knows to make hard decisions, but is still fundamentally a good person.

The "11-year olds talking like they're 40" is explained away by potions that can teach non-magical subjects to children/strong schooling in the case of characters like Hermione and Justin, and Harry's own ability to direct conversations has plot relevance (he has some rudimentary Legilimency abilities and some kind of connection to Voldemort), but honestly writing 11-year olds to talk like 11-year olds is pretty annoying to handle well anyway. The faux-politics takes a backseat later on anyway.

*** In my opinion, characters being abnormally smart isn't a turnoff as long as they interact with each other in believable ways.

From what I've read of first year, PoS fails to execute any believable dialogue. In many cases the secondary characters seem like carboard cutouts whose only purpose is to stand still while Harry monologues at them. The most egregious example is in chapter 27 when first year Harry, at that point a social pariah, stands up in front of the entire Slytherin house (including all of the uperclassmen and prefects) and monologues for three paragraphs strait without anyone telling him to shutup for his arrogance and presumption. Then he proceeds to a backroom where the most influential people in Slytherin house roll over for him while he directs the conversation without any meaningful resistance.

That was the point that I gave up on reading PoS, even though I'd seen nothing but good reviews and really wanted to like it. I understand why people dislike HPMOR and why they would compare it to PoS. Both fics have extremely smart protagonists who like to talk. However, in my opinion HPMOR does a better job giving consistency to the motives and feelings of its secondary characters, so everything that comes out of their mouths actually fits with who they are, and when it makes sense for them to cut Harry down to size they do so. PoS fails in that regard.

Harry talks like someone who has read the books and rolls his eyes that everyone doesn't see how /obvious/ things like - Quirrell having a parasitic Voldemort under his turban - are. That's not actual fiction, that's a meta comment on other fiction (that the author has read so much she became bored with it) --- no thanks.

Once Harry shaped up and became cool....sorry, "Slytherinesque and posh", they wanted to be associated with him.

Kids are full of cliques like that, despite trying so hard to be grown up. Kindergartners do the same thing.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
