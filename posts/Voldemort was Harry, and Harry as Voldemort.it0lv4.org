Something happens and they somehow switch bodies. (I can't remember if they find out why or not, or if it hadn't gotten to that point yet).

Harry (as Voldemort) ends up getting Snape's help, he was trying to help Harry return back to himself, Dumbledore thought he was losing Snape or something.

I think Voldemort as Harry started a relationship with Draco, and obliviated Hermione because she was close to the information of Harry not being himself (Not entirely sure on that)

Can't remember what site it was on or if it was completed or not. I believe Voldemort as Harry was starting to abuse Draco while in the relationship.

Harry as Voldemort kills Bellatrix I remember, because it was sometime after Bellatrix had killed Sirius.

That's all I can remember, really.


** I think it is Becoming by Sensiblytainted. I read the first few chapters so it may have changed from the body switch. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5118649/1/Becoming]]
