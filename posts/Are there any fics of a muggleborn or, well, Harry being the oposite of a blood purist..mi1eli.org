Insulting all the wizarding traditions, mocking the quill, ink, parchment and robes, pointing out how backwards they all are Etc. Etc.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]] goes way beyond simply insulting wizarding traditions. Actions don't only take place within Britain either.

Similarly, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]'s first chapter already shows what Harry thinks and is doing to traditional wizarding society.

*** The term your looking for is Muggle-wank and there are tons out there. Unfortunately most of them are extremely cringeworthy and instead of bashing purebloods they normally try to say that somehow non-magical stuff is always better than magical stuff as if anybody alive today wouldn't murder a cousin or uncle or something if it would let them perform minor acts of magic let alone the stuff that happens in the wizarding world. I understand bashing the parchment and quils and the racism but the moment a fic goes "all magic is obviously inferior to SCIENCE and LOGIC and REASON and MODERN INFRASTRUCTURE" I check out. Honestly I would do a lot worse than kill a cousin if only I would get the ability to perform ONE spell from the middle books let alone any of the really cool stuff you can find in the fandom. I don't understand why anyone would write stories about a magical world where all they do is talk about how cool non-magicals are.
