#+TITLE: Dobby & Winky went to Hogwarts because they were free. By extrapolation...are most/all Hogwarts house-elves free, with elves being enslaved by Malfoys/Blacks/other dark families the exception rather than rule?

I can imagine it happening in a Flock of Wolves style way. One of the Hogwarts house-elves quietly admits to Dobby & Winky that they too are free, but are too ashamed to flaunt it...then another one comes later to admit exactly the same thing, and then another, and then another, and it turns out that Dumbledore has been paying them all salaries and they didn't want to join Hermione's S.P.E.W. because it sounds silly but also because they didn't want to advertise that they were all free elves...

--------------

...Honestly, it would fit into the brownie mythology a lot better if free (but still work-hungry) elves were the norm rather than the exception.


** I doubt it honestly- remember that the Hogwarts elves were looking down on Dobby and Winky- not helping Winky- only Dobby did that, taking care of her when she was the house elf version of a depressed alcoholic drinking herself to death- which never gets resolved as far as I know- she's probably dead by now. So much for SPEW.

And Dobby still wanted to work- I imagine free house elves are snapped up wanting pay or binding or however that works- it's never clear beyond clothing freeing them, after all, free/cheap labor is amazing.

*** Hmm...I don't remember it from the books too well (and I'm too lazy to look at the moment), but do the elves explicitly voice their complaint about Dobby & Winky being free? Or just that they're respectively an overt clothes-horse and a drunkard?

**** More that they looked down on the two and treated winky like a piece of furniture to be covered up when Harry went down to the kitchens to meet the two- it isn't stated so much as implied, at least in the movie version, I don't remember the exact wording of that scene.

***** Well, let's see...

  "Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years, sir, trying to find work!" Dobby squeaked. "But Dobby hasn't found work, sir, because Dobby wants paying now!" The house-elves all around the kitchen, who had been listening and watching with interest, all looked away at these words, as though Dobby had said something rude and embarrassing. Hermione, however, said, "Good for you, Dobby!" "Thank you, miss!" said Dobby, grinning toothily at her. "But most wizards doesn't want a house-elf who wants paying, miss. 'That's not the point of a house-elf,' they says, and they slammed the door in Dobby's face! Dobby likes work, but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid. Harry Potter.... Dobby likes being free!" The Hogwarts house-elves had now started edging away from Dobby, as though he were carrying something contagious. Winky, however, remained where she was, though there was a definite increase in the volume other crying.

And, later on...

  Winky's eyelids drooped and suddenly, without warning, she slid off her stool into the hearth, snoring loudly. The empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away across the stone-flagged floor. Half a dozen house-elves came hurrying forward, looking disgusted. One of them picked up the bottle; the others covered Winky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly, hiding her from view. "We is sorry you had to see that, sirs and miss!" squeaked a nearby elf, shaking his head and looking very ashamed. "We is hoping you will not judge us all by Winky, sirs and miss!" "She's unhappy!" said Hermione, exasperated. "Why don't you try and cheer her up instead of covering her up?" "Begging your pardon, miss," said the house-elf, bowing deeply again, "but house-elves has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and masters to be served." "Oh for heavens sake!" Hermione cried. "Listen to me, all of you! You've got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy! You've got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes, you don't have to do everything you're told - look at Dobby!" "Miss will please keep Dobby out of this," Dobby mumbled, looking scared. The cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the house-elves around the kitchen. They were suddenly looking at Hermione as though she were mad and dangerous. "We has your extra food!" squeaked an elf at Harry's elbow, and he shoved a large ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into Harry's arms. "Good-bye!" The house-elves crowded around Harry, Ron, and Hermione and began shunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of their backs.

Those are the two main appearances of the 'other house elves' in Goblet of Fire...does anyone else think it's kind of despicable that they treat Winky as an embarrassment to be swept under the table instead of someone who needs help? LF elf-bashing fics.

Yeah, even worse than I remembered. Ever wonder why Hermione stops mentioning Spew? This is why right here I bet.

******* Now I wonder. Do they cover up Winky and go 'please don't judge us based on her' and such because it's a cultural thing with them? Or do they do it because they're terrified of being harshly punished for defending their fellow elves or thinking about freedom?

I mean, they don't roll their eyes and stick out their tongues when Dobby mentions about enjoying freedom; they back away from him like he's the center of a danger zone. And from the writing it sounds like they're more afraid than angry when Hermione goes on about their rights. Do some of them remember getting help from well-meaning people in the past that ended badly?

** If I remember right Dumbledore offered them all freedom/payment but most took offense to it because of how ingrained being a servant is... it's been years but I do believe it's brought up in one of the books
