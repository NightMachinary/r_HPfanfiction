I'm looking for fic where Harry finds out the events of DH or HBP through book reading in his 5th year. I will like to hear other alternatives if you have them too I don't mind. Recommendations?


** Do you mean like... knows what happens in those books, or just learns things from those books, like horcruxes?

In Shadow Magic, for example, Harry learns that he's a horcrux far earlier than in canon. linkao3(15432591)

  AU. Harry was born with a power the Dark Lord knows not: the magic to see into shadows, to walk the shadows, and to send the shadows everywhere. This changes his life rather dramatically.
