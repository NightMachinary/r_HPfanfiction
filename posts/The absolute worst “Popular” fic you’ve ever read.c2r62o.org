For me, it's gotta be Harry Crow. It's just such overwhelming cringe, I can never make it past the second chapter before I nope out.

Yet it gets constantly recommended in every fanfiction group I'm in. Blech.

There's a chapter where God runs through every bad thing Harry ever did- breaking the Dursley's table as a little kid- because being an abused child is no excuse apparently, having an affair on Ginny (wtf!), and the message is that everyone's a shitty person and Harry's only getting into heaven because god is so forgiving.

Uhg, if I hadn't already been an atheist, that fic probably would have made me abandon Christianity.

** I have been rather pleasantly surprised by linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao), and although I had my complaints (magic-makes-you-horny, generally too much smut), I was persuaded it is possible to write a fem!Harry story, which is not horrible. So, I tried “Harriet Potter: What it is like to be a witch” (no, I am intentionally not linking to it) and it was just horrible. I am sorry for the author, he (I am quite certain it wasn't written by a woman) has certainly his issues, but it was just awful. Nymphadora Tonks [!!!] pulling fem!Harry for the shopping spree with detailed description of shopping for lingerie, Lord (or rather Lady) Potter/Gryffindor/Ravenclaw/etc., friendly gobblins, betrothed to Cedric Diggory. Just don't.

I have been in process of writing a novel about Petunia Dursley for couple of years already (in Czech and not finished, so not publicly available) and so I read all Petunia-related stories I can find. I strongly believe that her and Severus Snape could be written into a great story of forgiveness, repentance, conversion (perhaps even spiritual), but I haven't found really good version of that. So, when I found “A magical love affair” (that's between these two) I thought it could be good. Oh boy, it isn't.

And of course, there is always “Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles” (yes, I am a Christian, so I am even more embarrassed about the disaster; no, pretending it was meant as a satire won't save it).

**** Just to say thank you. And yes, I have my issues with Becoming Harriet, because I think it would be significantly better, if you believe in your own story and got rid of the clutches (deluge of smut, some horrible tropes like “magic makes you horny”). No, and I don't think pupils in the boarding school somewhere away in Scottland behave in a very chaste manner, so it is not that, and yes the chapter 54 although completely horrible and disgusting is supposed to be completely horrible and disgusting, so that's right (well, I could do with a little bit less of anatomy, but that's possibly my hypocrisy ... women in that situation are not spared of these anatomic details either). And yes, although I have my issues with your Snape (you have very much film!Snape aka Alan Rickman, missing all his horrible traits from the books), I have to admit that with his messed up life and horrible situation, BSDM somehow feels right for him (as much as I abhor that practice myself) and it is done relatively decently. But as I sad, Harriet could do much better if left with less (well, that's true for 90 % of fanfic stories, so you are in the great company there).

**** Oh thank you See this was a fic I really wanted to like. But never could get into because of Harry's characterization. I love smart Harry and mind games and world building. The scene with Draco and Harry in the robe shop cracked me up.

But they try to show Harry's intelligence in the laziest way possible. Like there is this part where he is told that no one did anything when Voldemort attacked. And Harry says oh bystander effect. And then explains the concept. This isnt a way to cope with the knowledge or even a explanation that factors into some theory he has like it has. Its just to be like oh look i know shit cuz im smart. Also its pointless because he has scenes where he explains concepts to show how he can use science math history and logic to kinda hack the wizarding world. But the author also just has to let you know about all the other concepts he knows too isnt he smart? Or Harry but lets me honest its just the Author. And hes so preachy and self assured about it its intolerable for me. It would be fine if it was a character flaw but if it is its one you are supposed to pander to and sympathize with it or just forgive to a degree at least enough to find him just ok maybe even a little charming most of the time and I just couldn't. Maybe that changes later and it gets better but I couldn't last that long.

I wont say its necessarily say its bad but it definetlty has flaws and personally i really didn't like it.

Though I do see the appeal especially if you haven't seen others like it before. But I had so that also might be another reason I didnt really like it as much.

The first few chapters are not where it shines, certainly. Harry is downright rude toward his parents, which is not great to read, and doubly so when they're actually good parents. And it's not the last time he's dismissive and arrogant toward others.

The thing is, the story doesn't /celebrate/ him acting this way. He gets slapped down for it, repeatedly and sometimes literally - his Defence teacher, upon observing his attitude, actually arranges for him to "learn to lose," which consists of him getting beaten up by senior students and not allowed to defend himself, all the while being required to constantly apologise and kowtow to them, just so that he is able to experience and adjust to failure. He is a clever strategist, but he loses his first ever mock battle simply because he never thought to delegate authority and responsibility to his soldiers. He's smart, and the story emphasises the importance of acting intelligently, but that doesn't stop him from almost destroying the planet by allowing dangerous knowledge to spread too widely.

It's a very thought-provoking read, with a lot of dry humor and some pretty cool battle scenes.

***** I've been reading HP fanfic for fifteen years. I've read plenty of in depth or thought provoking stories (or even just stories where a section shines through). I was nowhere near new to fics when I gave it a try (more than once), and certainly I've read worse over the years, but this story came off as pretentious and patting its own back with phrasing and the particular writing style. The first few chapters alone has such awkward phrasing and dialogue. A ten year old talking about quantum mechanics, even if it's supposed to be a very intelligent kid, is seriously stretching even the best suspension of disbelief. It's Artemis Fowl on steroids. Even if it's supposed to be a mockery, which frankly I can't tell, it's just outright not enjoyable to me.

Harry is thus a combination of Voldemort's cold intelligence with a loving and reasonably healthy childhood, producing a child who is smart, arrogant, generous to his friends, prejudiced against people who he deems less intelligent and worthy of his notice, motivated to save the world, and likely to destroy it if he doesn't get his knuckles rapped and his head pulled in.

****** Ok, I'll provide examples.

Dumbledore had to let his brother be tortured and killed during the war, because ransoming him would have completely drained their funds and set a bad precedent that would result in further kidnappings. Harry, by contrast, agreed to spend all his inherited money and go into substantial debt to protect Hermione from unjust imprisonment. Who was right? When the same amount of money can save one life or ten, does that mean you can set a fair monetary price on a life?

Criminals are locked up in a prison where every moment is not only unspeakable torture, but /makes them worse people/ by draining out whatever is good. What constitutes appropriate punishment? Is that kind of jail ever justified? If so, when? If not, what level of response is justified to attempt to remove it? What if the law and government disagree, then how far should you go?

There is an artifact that can make transfiguration permanent. You can fix any ailment by transfiguring the body into a healthy state and then making that persistent. You can create any material you want, in any shape. You can shapeshift. But it only works once every few minutes. What is the best way to use that artifact?

Harry (and Yudkowski, on his blog) believes in utilitarianism. He thinks at one point that if one person being tortured could have his pain be measured in numbers, and have those numbers stacked against the numbers of petty inconveniences that affect us all, it is right and just that that person be horribly tortured if it results in less aggregate harm, like a sufficient number of reduced cavities or splinters.

So, by his own internal morals, saving Hermione was the wrong choice, because it removes his ability to challenge Malfoy on the treatment of other Muggleborns.

#+end_quote

Jail is meant to be punitive, a deterrent, and rehabilitative, except that life sentences are, by definition, not rehabilitative (or, at least, it's irrelevant if they are). Azkaban is only for life sentences, and it's EXTREMELY punitive and a major deterrent. It's the fault of individual judges (or the Wizengamot, however that actually works) if it's not being used in the correct fashion.

** HPMOR. I've tried to read it twice, and both times have dropped out at basically the same point -the stupidly overlong Azkaban scene. I couldn't finish all the Azkaban stuff when I read it the first time, and then I went back and listened to the (pretty well made) audiobook version, and gave up in the chapter after it had all finished. I mean, it's like 10+ long chapters, plus at least 2 more "aftermath" chapters, and the story that takes place could have been condensed into one or two if the author wasn't so damn in love with himself and didn't take literally every opportunity to have Harry think a 5 page long internal monologue that name drops a bunch of scientists. Plus the obnoxious transhumanism and anti-nuclear shit as an allegory for Yudowski's own doomsday prophet AI research was tiring.

It's a real shame cause I like the first third or so quite a lot. Scientist Harry trying to experiment with magic and learn how it works, developing things like Partial Transfiguration (although the overblown "Harry dug down deeper and realised that the real world is just atoms, and then deeper and he realised it's just forces, and then even blah blah" makes P.T irritating). But then it decides to become Ender's Game and also has VoldeQuirrell being stupidly overdramatic and too obviously evil for this super genius Harry to not look like a moron for going along with all his plans.

No, that doesn't follow. Familiarity with the original work will have an impact on how something is written, of course, but it doesn't, by itself, dictate writing quality. Theoretically you could write fanfiction entirely sight unseen, just having heard about the original franchise, and that doesn't guarantee poor quality, nor good quality. You might have a hard time including some of the details from canon, but that's not always a goal.

Furthermore, there are many fics where the author has read the whole series, but chooses to entirely reject canon after, let's say book 5. Does that mean that they "failed in the most elementary way possible"? No, not by itself. They still wrote Harry Potter fanfiction, and maybe they did a good job or maybe they didn't.

It's also misleading to imply that Yudkowsky had no idea what he was writing about. Besides reading several books of canon before he started, he read a large number of other fanfics. I think he also finished reading canon eventually, though I'm not sure about that one. He certainly knew enough that he could write /a/ Harry Potter fanfic; how well he wrote must then be judged on its own merits.

No, it really wouldn't. Fanfiction doesn't have to aim for any particular level of canon understanding. It isn't (necessarily) a review of canon. It is a literary work in its own right, and its usage of canon characters may even be incidental depending on the author's goals.

At most, if you feel that MoR misrepresents canon, you could argue that that reduces the value of those portions that are intended to specifically contrast and criticise canon. But even if you demonstrate that misrepresentation, that's a far cry from being an "absolute worst."

******************* Sure it could count. Suppose I were to write a Naruto fic where his use of the shadow clone causes serious mental problems every time a clone bursts and he gets a memory dump. He continues to use it, because it's a valuable tool and he faces life threatening situations, but he spends periods of time catatonic, loses track of hours and days amongst the dozens of separate memory chains, spaces out, and his sleep cycle is completely wrecked - or worse, because of the demands of missions, he is unable to get the sleep he needs, and his brain isn't able to properly organise all the extra memories each day, leading him to show symptoms of major sleep deprivation, hallucinations, etc. Kakashi has to deal with having a genin even more messed up than himself, and strike a balance between letting Naruto use and practise a very powerful technique that could save lives, vs preserving his health and sanity.

You could make an educated guess about just one aspect of it, namely that I haven't read Naruto canon. /According to your own argument/, that isn't complete enough to review anything. /By your own argument/, anything you say about my Naruto knowledge is likely to wildly mischaracterise it and miss all sorts of nuances which, you imply, are important (else why criticise MoR for presumptively missing such nuances of HP?). /Yet you went ahead and made strong statements about what I would be capable of writing./ Based only on educated guesses about a single part of the picture, you felt justified in reasoning about the situation and reaching conclusions.

Your premise, that it is impossible to write something good if you have limited information, was untenable. Working with reasonable assumptions until they're disproved is something we do all the time, and it's frequently appropriate. The premise is even more untenable in the context of fanfiction, which doesn't have to follow canon in any particular way to begin with. It's really not a sound criticism of MoR, not unless you can point to specific examples of things that a) were missed or altered because the author didn't read all of canon, /and/ b) would have improved the story by being closer to canon. If you have those, that's an entirely different matter.

********** Alright, as an example, let's look at the much lauded characterization of Harry in that fic. One of the few objective ways to analyze a character is Brandon Sanderson's [[https://writingexcuses.com/2014/03/30/writing-excuses-9-13-three-prong-character-development/][three prong character development]] method, where each character, has a set of values for the amount of sympathy they should get from the reader, how proactive they are, and their competence. You can use it to define an archetype. The plucky young hero is highly sympathetic, and somewhat proactive, but not very competent. As part of character growth, said hero might become more proactive, therefore becoming more competent.

By this metric, Harry is highly competent, and highly proactive, but is not sympathetic at all. As an aside, if I recall correctly, this is, per Sanderson himself, the basic archetype for a villain.

You can then track how those metrics change throughout the story to show character growth. As far as I recall, from what I literally read years ago, Harry didn't become anymore sympathetic before I quit reading.

As far as I know, that is the sum total of the objective way to analyze a character.

If that type of character appeals to you, or works as a protagonist, is entirely based on your personal life experiences, frame of reference, and general preferences. This then, by definition, becomes a subjective metric.

The fact that a lot of those who give shit to Yudkowsky for being arrogant are just as much arrogant as him never fails to amaze me, too.

That's also your opinion that it's a solid fic. I didn't think it was entertaining at all. Technically it was a well written story. That doesn't make it automatically something enjoyable.

That's like criticising someone for not liking Avatar. It had great special effects, that's undeniable, however that's not suddenly going to make me like the aspects of the film that I don't think are good.

I can easily see them becoming friends after enduring Wood's insanity. Plus Katie doesn't have any connections to the Weasleys or Hermione, which can eliminate the "angry older brother" issues and allowing Hermione to have a limited opinion of Katie rather than having a lot of insight like she does with Ginny.

It also interesting because Katie is friends with Leanne, who is a Ravenclaw in Cho's year. So there you have an opportunity to include Cho in a way that doesn't involve Rowling's pitiful attempts at writing teenage romance.

You don't find it humorous that Susan feels awkward she got fucked at the same house as her aunt, because Susan doesn't feel awkward about it. Neither does her aunt.

You don't even find it enviable that Susan's so sexually laid back, because the person she's laid back about being sexually active is her aunt who's in her mid to late 40's, which nobody wants to hear about the sexual escapades of, unless it was somehow humorous, which it simply wasn't.

And who's to say that aunt and daughter are remotely similar to each other? That doesn't demonstrate similar sexual tastes, and even if it did, there isn't any humour in such a thing being demonstrated.

--------------

Even if there was a joke there, it wasn't very funny. I didn't laugh when I read the chapter. I didn't even think about laughing. I felt the same way about the entire fanfiction - any jokes that were present were ruined completely in their delivery. I read the entire fanfiction and I didn't laugh.

********* Those "exceptions" could go on and on and on to the point that it's ridiculous to call them exceptions. The fact that /you/ don't want to fuck a 40-year-old woman means absolutely nothing about her inherent sex drive or attractiveness.

I've read /about/ Baumeister's findings without having actually read the book, so I can't usefully address his conclusions, but it appears he uses an economics model akin to evolutionary psych theory to shore up old ideas about men's and women's spheres and the supply/demand concept of (heterosexual) sex. I don't agree with that model, but it's not something I want to delve into on a fanfiction subreddit, especially without having read the source material.

As for sex drives - human sexual behavior is far, FAR more complicated and mutable and uncategorizable than social scientists admit with their tidy research papers. Fandom alone is a context that defies most assumptions you see in magazine articles about gender and sexual behavior. And I admit that the whole libido question is a toss-up. I disappeared just now down the rabbit hole of conflicting opinions when I went to see what the internet has archived about it. It's interesting to see how two separate writers (usually freelance journalists) can take the same data and come up with entirely different interpretations.

Said a random redittor about a very popular author who has written many very popular fanfics including this comedy which many people find funny, myself included.

The humour in this fic comes from Harry and Sirius having wacky adventures and a devil may care attitude. From banter and taking the mick out of each other or those around them. Just general light-hearted joshing throughout the fic. I don't think there are many lines you can just point to and say "That's funny."

*** Hey john, I was looking at your post history and it looks like there isn't a lot to feel good or be happy about going on in your life right now, and I'm awfully sorry for that because everyone deserves happiness. I just want to let you know that you deserve happiness. I can see there being a moral conundrum between being catholic and being gay. You know, the catholic god is all about love and forgiveness, and he cares a lot more about doing good things than empty prayers. I don't think you need to be alone, because if god values anything it is love and being good to others, and sharing love between two people checks off both. I decided a long time ago that everyone deserves happiness, and as long as your happiness does not infringe on other people's then you are doing just fine. Old Testament god was an eye for an eye jackass, catholic god is forgiving and loves you for who you are.

Anyways, guys leave this kid alone. And good luck kid, I have get similar depression to you before, where the best part of the day was falling asleep at night, and I lived to eat. I found that running a mile every day kicked me out of it. I would jog as far as I could, lungs screaming because my rib muscles were unused to the expansion, then walk until I could job again. I lost 60 lbs, started eating better, and felt way better about myself. So good luck. God speed. And I hope you find a bit of happiness of your own. And hold onto it Tightly because it and you are worth it.

**** Well to Catholicism, saying that I deserve to date a man is the same as saying a pedophile deserves to date a child. Perhaps I require the emotional fulfillment provided by a relationship to survive but it shouldn't come at the cost of society.

But that doesn't make me feel any less lonely. In theory, if I had friends who shared my interests who would be happy to spend a significant portion of my free time with me, I would perhaps feel less lonely, but I'm uncertain whether that's true.

I'm holding out hope that it is - that I just need friendships to end my suffering - but if that isn't the case I think that'd almost kill me.

--------------

This isn't any different to the things I've said in my earlier posts, but you wouldn't understand how much worse I feel today than in those past few weeks.

I have either lost all optimism, or I have finally realized that basing my entire satisfaction in life off of optimism is not satisfying in the least.

I don't know why that makes the pain feel worse. I didn't think the pain could feel any worse. I don't know whether it'll ever stop feeling worse anymore.

And I feel guilty for not liking women. I'm slowly starting to realize that that wasn't my choice. But I still feel guilty at times and I can't really stop feeling that way, either.

And I feel perverted for liking men and not women who I can have a good, wholesome and pious Catholic marriage with, despite it not being all that perverted. Again, I can't escape the feeling and I don't know how I could.

***** I don't think Jesus ever said a word about homosexuality. I also think that being gay, something people have been for thousands of years, is not at all like being a pedophile. One is preying on an innocent who does not know any better. The corruption of the innocent is wrong, especially when performed by someone who knows better.

Back in the day people were getting married at 12 and dying in their 30s. The Catholic Church has always heavily pushed procreation because people lived such short lives. Almost all people are living to double that age now. Procreation is not so important. In fact, the cost of having a kid is a huge factor towards why people are having less and less children.

Look man, I'm catholic too. You are being told to hate yourself by a group of people who have year after year been caught with their hands in the cookie jar. selling indulgences, the inquisition, the crusades, molesting kids, covering up the molestation of children, secretly killing babies, stealing children from their young mothers, the list goes on and on.

You have to make a decision for yourself. Either listen to these two faced monsters, and hate yourself. Or let yourself be happy with who you are. the catholic message is about love and doing good works. Not hating yourself because of how God made you.

If you believe in god, he wouldn't have made you gay if he didn't want you to be that way. So go and love yourself.

****** "I don't think Jesus ever said a word about homosexuality."

Exactly. Christianity has no tradition of homosexual marriage. Marriage - the sanctification of a relationship under God, due to it being the institution of such sanctification - had always been a strictly heterosexual affair during Christianity's early history.

You aren't a Catholic if you don't believe in the teachings of the Catholic Church, either. That's what Catholicism is by definition, and the proclamations of the Pope when he acts as the head of the council of Bishops are guaranteed by Christ himself to be infallible. "And the gates of hell shall never prevail against my Church" he said - it shall know no victory over the institution. If the Church preached lies, that would be a victory against it.

If you don't believe that Catholic teachings have any authority, it wouldn't even make sense to believe in them. You may as well be a Protestant.

"If you believe in god, he wouldn't have made you gay if he didn't want you to be that way. So go and love yourself."

The same can be said for pedophiles. You just believe homosexuality causes no harm because you don't see any - you believe yourself to the final authority on spiritual matters. You are not God; your beliefs are not infallible.

******* First, pedophiles find happiness at the expense of others, that is morally wrong. People who are gay can find their happiness together with others. There is a significant difference between those two.

Who gets hurt in a homosexual relationship? Two people finding love within each other, how does that hurt anyone? Beyond their inability to have a biological child how are they any different then a heterosexual couple? Is it the loss of potential breeders from the pool that is so terrible?

Those bishops you mentioned committed and covered up sexual abuse within the church. How can you look to them as infallible when you witness the example they are setting for you? Jesus even speaks about how to above all not abuse children.

What about all the terrible popes in the history of the church? Not all of them were antipopes. Hell, one even dig up the body of the previous pope and desecrated it because of his personal feelings towards him.

You know that quote was mangled in translation, what he really meant was that the church will never die, not that evil won't prevail against it.

It boggles my mind that Fellow Catholics will take the word of a loving forgiving god and believe that someone with ultimate power would knowingly allow good human beings to go to hell even if they are not baptized. That someone who speaks so highly of taking care of children will keep unbaptized or miscarried/aborted babies souls from entering heaven. That someone so compassionate that they took the sin of the entirety of existence upon his shoulders and died to forgive us would then turn around and decree that you suffer, that you must be alone, that you are unnatural in his eyes. Come on man, he didn't die for all of us as a whole, he died for each and every one of us individually. You deserve better, and god certainly thinks so too.

Look, I can't make you be happy, only you can do that. All I can tell you is that you can be happy if you want to, but you have to let yourself be happy and fight to find that happiness.

Good luck kid.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

Arthur and Morgana - granted, a bit far-fetched, but opened up possibilities (as explained way later by von Hohenheim) to give him some epic moments (Northern Fields, Ekrizdis e.g.) and a path to him being a healer.

"He taught Mordred" - they learned magic together from Morgana, Salvazsahar only taught him swordsmanship, in which he only was mediocre - Mordred learned somewhere else too presumably, or was very talented.

"He owns Hogwarts which is Camelot" - the two castles being the same is easier than having a whole another castle somewhere, and the old soul-wards give an explanation for the famed strength of Hogwarts' wards, while also keeping a connection to his adoptive father (and the later Founders storyline).

"He is Slytherin and not prejudiced" - Well, one very public quote misrepresented spiralling out of control can do wonders to one's reputation, and not in a good way. There is also the change in language and meaning of words, which actually can happen and has happened, which makes it more plausible (the meaning of pureblood then vs present).

Godric being a LeFay and the founders being related in general - Well, it gives a good explanation why they would work together, gives them more realistic names other than the house names. Him being related to them - He himself doesn't know about anyone but Godric being his relative, since Peverell and Rowena are pure-bloods, and it gives him another link to keep on living (plus plot-Death support).

Him being a legal expert - when you have to sit in the parliament on and off over two thousand years (or even reign), you are kinda forced to learn the laws. If talking about the "hearing", he had plenty of time to prepare himself for it, plus he kinda has a personal interest in all laws concerning Hogwarts, for reasons given above. And since the Wizarding world is slow in changing things, he can pass with his knowledge of etiquette only needing slight adjustments over time. (see the scene with the stone and McGonagall for a Fauxpas). Think of it like Dumbledore: He is a teacher and transfigurations expert, but after fifty years of politics, he is very good at it. Same applies here, and his knowledge is pretty up to date (Sal Malfoire/Sanctuary).

Ancient Magic - like the other commenter said, if you live for 2000+ years and don't pick up a spell or two that aren't remembered in the future present, there is something wrong. Also explained by the author - Roman spellcasting was enforced on Roman territory, and they hunted down the druids/reeducated their children and them. Same probably happened with colonialism since the HRRDN lasted until 1806.

I enjoyed it because of the premise of "you can only travel back, and the future is set in stone". Salvazsahar still tries to change things and make a difference, and now it's in the endgame - all his efforts cumulating.

**** I'm not saying the fic didn't supply explanations, I'm saying the situations and explanations were contrived. I'm not even against OP characters but it's ridiculous to just go from scene of historical importance to scene of historical importance without any real connecting elements. The feeling of the entire fic is that the author had placed they wanted to go, powers Harry had to gain, and the plot (what little plot there was in the historical part at least) was basically to get there.

Oh and I totally forgot more stupidity there with the being adopted but goblins and the special healer thing. Not to mention lords and houses. Were there any OP!Harry cliches the thing missed?

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

** Possibly an unpopular opinion, but.../Hope/ by Jeconais is perhaps one of the worst "well-written" HP fanfics I've ever read. The spelling is typically on-point and the sentences are well-put together, but that's all I can say about it in a positive light. For ease, I'll make a list of my gripes:

*1.* Antagonists are laughably incompetent, yet the author tries to make them seem threatening anyways.

*2.* Harry is so overpowered that any conflict he enters never has any sense of danger, and I can't take any of his enemies seriously.

*3.* Everyone is always around when important things happen.

*4.* Harry Potter isn't Harry Potter. You're reading about another person who is wearing his skin and using his name.

​

Assuming anyone is interested, I'll follow up with a little bit of explanation for each bit. Spoilers ahead, not that this story is worth saving them anyways.

​

*1.* The universe in which /Hope/ takes place is one where everyone except Voldemort (if I recall correctly) survived the war. This is important because it means Snape and Dumbledore are still around, and they are two of our primary antagonists, as if they haven't been bashed enough in other fanfics. It's not even done /well./ Snape is incapable of controlling his emotions, in stark contrast to canon, and both he and Dumbledore are about as subtle as a garbage truck.Speaking of /subtlety/ and the noticeable lack thereof, enter Draco Malfoy! In this story, he's the Quidditch Referee at Hogwarts. I assume the author made this decision so that Draco could be /present/ for things to happen. There's no real reason why Draco would ever want to work at Hogwarts, not that I can see. Also, his family lost all its wealth for some reason. So he's got absolutely nothing to fight Harry with (Harry owns a vast portion of stocks/businesses in magical England) and therefore is a waste of space. His sole purpose is to attempt to rape Gabrielle, just for some shock value and forced drama. But don't worry, Gabrielle is Harry's /Mate/, as per the standard "Veela Mating for life" trope, so she can do things like borrow Harry's immensely powerful magic abilities. So she kicks the crap out of Draco and still has a mental breakdown. More on that later.

*tl;dr:* bad guys are bad at everything, and easy to beat.

​

*2.* The last part leads nicely into my second issue with this story: /Harry is too god damn powerful./ It's occasionally fun to read about him performing god-like feats of magic, of course, but it gets old, quick. He's so powerful that nobody, not even Dumbledore, is a threat to him. He can apparate into Hogwarts, he can use full telekinesis, and he can apparate /other people/. Without touching them, and without also apparating himself! There is literally no competent opposition. His power completely dwarfs that of every other character, which means there is /no suspense./ Ever. As a reader, I always felt certain that Harry would be able to fix every problem, and win every fight. Because he's basically a god. Draco and his little band of Death-Eaters that show up in the finale are only threatening for about two seconds. Then Harry shields the entire Quiddith stands and all its occupants, which a shield that blocks several Avada-Kedavra curses. GG, get rekt.

*tl;dr:* Harry never loses.

​

*3.* In this story, Harry Potter is set up to be an omnipotent, supremely-competent person. He is capable of doing anything and /everything/. And he does! He defeated Voldemort single-handedly, he's the richest man in the wizarding world, he's a star quidditch player who would never lose to Viktor Krum, and he's a demigod. You would think a man like this could handle most problems on his own, right? Nope!Remember earlier when I mentioned how Draco attempts to rape Gabrielle? And how she borrows some of Harry's magic to lay the smackdown on that ferret? Well, shortly after, Harry apparates through Hogwarts (of course he does) to her, and apparates her back to their room. Maybe he's going to comfort her, tell her it'll be alright, maybe even just have sex with her? Nope. He floo-calls (I think) Gabrielle's entire family to come help him comfort her, or something. Because they /all/ need to be there immediately, right? When nothing actually happened. Right?My point is that all our protagonists are always around when things happen. Just so the author doesn't have to write Harry telling them later, or work around the logistics of /Harry not having everything he needs at every moment/. At another point in the story, Harry has a conversation with Dumbledore about something trivial and ultimately unimportant, and when Dumbledore leaves, our /entire crew of protagonists/ walk out of a hidden door in the room, and they were all listening. Boom, everyone's caught up! Even Gabrielle's /mother/ was there. Considering how insignificant her character is, even in this story, she shouldn't have been there. She's not a talented fighter, she isn't any kind of clever thinker or strategist, and she has no political ties. She's just the mother figure to advise Gabrielle when she has issues, or occasionally advise /Harry/ (if we pretend for a moment he ever would need help).

*tl;dr:* everyone is always conveniently present

​

*4.* This is a problem that *most* fanfics suffer from. Harry just... /isn't/ /Harry/. Now, of course, the author has him set up as the son of James & Lily Potter, survivor of the Avada-Kedavra curse at the wand of Voldemort, the guy with the lightning bolt scar, Hogwarts student, friend of Hermione & Ron, etc, etc... But he doesn't /act/ like Harry. He doesn't have the same mannerisms. Harry Potter, canonically, is somewhat standoffish, quiet, and keeps to himself a fair bit. Now, since I'm no author (Yet here I am, writing this beast), I can't accurately identify much of Harry's characteristics beyond those above. Despite that, my instinctual animal brain just doesn't feel like Harry is /Harry/.

A story that I often compare others to is /Vox Corporis/ by MissAnnThropic. I'm not going to get into the whole H/Hr thing, because that's not why I dig this story. I enjoy it because the author absolutely /nailed/ every character. Every single one of them feels like they were written by J.K. Rowling herself. Compare the Harry in that story to the one in this story. They're completely different people.

*tl;dr:* Harry doesn't act or feel like Harry.

-

I have many more issues with the story than what's above, but this is already ridiculously long, I think. And a lot of those issues are with tropes, and not just poor design choices. /Hope/'s story arc is about as flat as the Grand Mesa. Not even the admittedly well-written smut can save this dumpster fire of a fanfiction.

*final tl;dr:* I spent over an hour on this, I am complaining about nothing and have a sad life. Let me know if you think this isn't the place for a review of this length/depth.

EDIT: formatting, for better contrast. Also spoilers, because I forgot.

** Isolation. That or Nightmares of Futures Past.

I was out of stuff to read one day, and decided to go through the top favorited HP fics, one day later I was done with my first Dramione story, and 4 months later I'm still not done with NoFP.

Isolation didn't even feel like an HP fic, just a bad romance novel.

And NoFP? Boring as all hell. I read 1.2M word fics in my free time, and I couldn't even get through a quarter of NoFP.

**** Well, in contrast to hating Isolation and NoFP, I really enjoyed Oh God Not Again, and (if it counts) I'm Still Here.

The first one I read was probably Three to Backstep, and it sucks, but I enjoyed it at the time.

It's been a while (a bit over a year), but I remember linkffn(Paid in Blood by Zaterra02) was enjoyable when I read it, no clue how it stands up now.

Really, I didn't read many Peggy Sue fics when I did read HP, and since I've mostly moved on to Fate/Stay Night, with smatterings of Persona now, I don't remember those that I did read very well.

Marathon Board Games, but the town thinks he fucked the Veela so they make a statue of him as a sign of Virility.

*** The thing with this kind of story is that it was ambitious. Sure, it's extremely dated now, but with the right set of blinders it can still be enjoyable. I just wish people still wrote these fics now, stories like this and Wastelands, Forests of Valbone, etc. But very few people have that ambition to stray beyond the walls of Hogwarts and write something that is magical. Instead we just get more and more fix-it fics and rehashes and people trying to created the ultimate balanced shipping fic that pleases everyone.

**** That's ‘cus no sane person can really use them to much effect. The copy is YOU, so, you don't want to do the dishes? Make a shadow clone. But that clone won't do them either for the same reason You won't. It doesn't want too.

You have to either be willing to do anything, or be completely insane to be able to use them for anything. They're a good training tool as long as you want to train, but if you don't, neither do they.

Plus they split up your chakra evenly between them and you, and That is super lethal to most people. Most just don't have the chakra for that.

The reason it's a forbidden technique is ‘cus you try it once and it kills you. It's only three hand seals. If you're not already a top tier Shinobi (or a Jinchuriki), it's only going to hurt you, and if you Are, it's only a good idea to split your chakra up like that very rarely.
