Read one long ago and I cannot remember if it was good or bad and I am just curious and want to re-check it.

** It fits the The Dark Lord's Equal [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6763981/1/The-Dark-Lord-s-Equal]]

Although it's H/Hr/NT because it's a type of sequel to cloneserpents Shell Cottage story. It also uses a lot of ideas and themes from other famous fics in the fandom.
