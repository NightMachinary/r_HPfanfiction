I was thinking about all the ridiculous things I've read. And I realised I've never come across anything in which Harry sparks someone out for being a massive doylem, followed by getting absolutely mortal and smashing some pasty. etc. Can anyone help me?

*** Someone from Newcastle. It's just a sort of nickname for them; like Mackems for people from Sunderland, Mancunians for Manchester, Scousers/Liverpudlians for Liverpool... [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_regional_nicknames][there's quite a lot of them]]. Although, it's a rather specific request, considering Newcastle is in Northeast England and Harry's from Surrey, which is south of London.

** Meanwhile, I"m just sitting here waiting for the original series to get translated into [[http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/why-harry-may-soon-be-spelling-in-scots-1-1250742][Scots]], but it sure doesn't look like that will ever happen.

** So the Harry Potter fanfic community consists of mostly Americans who write about Harry loving his mom, eating hotdogs, talking about baseball, calling Dean a soccer fan and walking around blocks in downtown London.

And you decide, it would be a good idea, to ask these people for a fanfic where Harry talks in a very specific British accent, without linking to a video or text on what a Geordie accent sounds or reads like.

Really?

I'm not entirely sure if this is a mum/mom joke, or an incest joke.
