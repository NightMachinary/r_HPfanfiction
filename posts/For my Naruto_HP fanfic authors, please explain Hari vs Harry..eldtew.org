*** So if I read you right, Hari in Japanese is pronounced as Hah-ri and in British as Ha-ree?

....it's still looking very similar in pronunciation.

**** The A's are completely different. The one in Hari would be pronounced kinda like "mama" mixed with "Hah" like a sigh. The A in Harry is pronounced like "Hay" or "Day". And the l/r difference adds to it as well obviously.

For a real life example, my name is Arabic and even when I tell people how to say it, they usually say it wrong because they can't hear the difference. Much like the r/l thing, there are sounds in it that are unpronounceable to most English speakers. If I tried to explain the difference between the actual and English pronounciations to you, you probably wouldn't understand, but to me, a native speaker, someone fucking up my name sounds like they're saying something completely different.

***** The A in Harry is not the same A in Day or Hay though. It's closer to being the A in mama if that's the example you want to stick with.

And, I'm Nigerian and my name is never said right by anyone who's not a Nigerian and specifically from my tribe. I make allowances for it because I understand some tongues can't wrap around it.

And after reading someone's earlier post and seeing that the difference in pronunciations isn't so big, I have to conclude that the stressing of saying Hari in Japanese crossover fics seems kind of pointless when they are practically near the same in British English. And yet the other characters don't pick on Hari for saying their name differently. I guess my main gripe is that Hari seems like a douchebag every time he corrects someone on his first name and yet when they say Potter, he's silent. It sounds like the author is just using pronunciation as a way of making Hari seem....edgy?

****** The A in Harry is pronounced nothing like mama lmao. The English pronounciation is Hay-ree. The Japanese word Hari is pronounced very differently, (Hah-/r/ee) like I and many other people have said.

And yeah, the author was probably doing it to sound edgy, but in a timeline where Harry grew up speaking Japanese in a place where everyone else also spoke Japanese, I can see him having problems with how English people pronounce his name the same way some of my irl expat & immigrant friends/relatives do. Keeping Potter as a last name is pretty dumb though anyway.

******* Um, perhaps google the British pronunciation of Harry. Then you'd get what I meant. American Harry is closer to what you're saying is Hay-ree (Heh-ree). British Harry has the ha-sound instead of hay- or heh-

Authors. Lol it's a thing in most AnimexHP fics and it's so cringey.

******** I have an RP accent myself and googled the movie pronounciation to double check lmao. It's a lot closer to Hay than Hah, though more subdued than an American accent I agree. More of an e sound maybe? Japanese is more like a heavy hah.

And I mean, it's your fault for reading Naruto crossover fics lol. They're /supposed/ to be edgy.

********* You're right. It's totally my fault. I just want a little bit of variety? You'd think incorporating a whole new universe would allow for some thing new, but edge is everywhere. The bashing is ridiculous. Even the FOOD gets bashed???

And also, I'll concede to that. I'm not a language expert, so the softer intonations would totally slip by me.

** There's a big difference between an English 'R' and a Japanese 'R' - it's more a cross between R and L. It's instantly obvious if someone I'm talking to has watched the sub or dub of an anime because of the way they say the character's names. I find it entirely unsurprising that Hogwarts students would default to an English 'R' even if they did get the 'ah' vs 'ah' correctly.

I wouldn't say the difference is harsh, but it is very noticeable.

** Hi, (this is completely unrelated to your question, but it's always bothered me) just wanna say that Japanese names don't work like English names. Their names have meanings and "Hari" isn't a Japanese name, if Harry was raised in any Japanese enviroment his name would be different. "Hari" literally means needle. So, don't make "Hari" be a thing cause it literally makes no sense.

*** Yes, there's also that. Though Neji (from Naruto) means screw-

Lol, but you're right. Changing his name to Hari without taking note of the meaning is kind of thoughtless. (but keeping Potter is silly. I've even seen Potteru and Potta for extra Japanese-ness. It's almost kind of offensive to me.)

*** Haru is an actual Japanese name that can use flower related kanji (matching with Petunia & Lily). Idk why more of these fics don't use it.
