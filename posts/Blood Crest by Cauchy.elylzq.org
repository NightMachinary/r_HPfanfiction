"The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings. "

This is one of my favorite fanfictions that I'm reading currently, updates frequently, has great characterizations, dialogue, plot and interesting characters. There are a few OC's but they're well written and fleshed out. It has a very authentic Harry that reminds me a lot of early canon Harry, and then takes that person and puts him in a new situation and develops him in a cool new way.

I recommend this fic to anyone who's interested in reading about a Harry thrust into a darker and more dangerous world, who's intuitive at magic but has to work hard to learn it properly, who is not overpowered but above average when compared to his peers, who is curious and gets into all kinds of interesting situations.

** Seconded! Also the update rate right now is excellent which at least helps me stay invested in the story.
