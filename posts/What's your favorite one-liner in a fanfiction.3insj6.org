  - Then, shortly after we all should have died horrible deaths via bludgeoning, the professors arrived. Typical.

  - "Hold on, you're telling me that -- if you take two extra classes -- the school will give you power over time? Why don't they advertise these things?" I grumbled.

  - "Oh, before I forget. One of your peacocks was being insubordinate, so I killed it. Dobby promised to have it ready for dinner I'm not actually certain if people eat peacocks, but I imagine the taste of victory will override any unpleasant flavor."

  - "I came to a very important realization today," I said. "It doesn't matter what color the Great Hall is during the Leaving Feast or who gets bragging rights for the next year. What matters is that I am the one who decides."

He was always going to be bait, but I figured he'd agree more easily if he thought it was his fault.

  "Greetings," Albus loudly said as the two Potters and he approached. "Lord Black and Lord Black. I'm delighted to see you accepted Professor Potter's invitation."

  Harry could feel his mother's approach and tried to pretend there was nothing out of the ordinary. "Please Headmaster, for tonight, I'm Harry and he's Sirius."

  Sirius noticed Harry slinking away and slapped him hard on the shoulder in a friendly gesture, while adding, "But unless you count his back, he's not really hairy. And I am rarely serious."

  "Oof," Harry groaned, partly from the smack and partly from Sirius' line. "Can't you not crack a name joke, just once?"

  Albus' eyes were twinkling as he added, "If it makes you feel any better, I've never been more than two-thirds bus. Further proof there really is no truth in advertising."

  Jimmy, Harry, and Sirius all turned towards the Headmaster in silent disbelief.

  "I'd only name my child Elvendork if the sun started rising in the west," Sirius said. He tipped back another glass of firewhiskey. "No! Only if hippogriffs start baying at the moon -- or if unicorns start chasing after randy boys--"

  "Or if Lily suddenly turned ugly," James said, wearing a rather besotted smile.

  "You look just like that when you're talking about Ginny," Ron said with a tone of disgust.

  Harry didn't even want to look at Severus. Merlin forbid that the Potions Master be overcome by emotion.

  "Of course," Severus said. Harry was devoutly grateful that his voice was only a little bit hoarse, and only cracked a little.

  "So when he's fourteen and has run away because he hates me, I fully expect you to take him in," Sirius said sternly.

  "Who else would have him?" Severus asked. "Now how about we have a glass of firewhiskey and try to forget that we just had an emotional moment?"

#+begin_quote
  Lily always said she couldn't understand why I would consume 'an addictive psychotic that tastes like cauldron residue.' I never did manage to persuade her that I liked it."

  "What is that?"

  "It is absinthe, Mr. Potter. The taste is from wormwood, among other things."

  "You're serious."

  "It has a worse reputation in the Muggle world than it deserves. It is really not much more of a psychotic than the alcohol it contains, although the stimulants allow you to function much further into drunkenness than with other alcoholic beverages. That is not always a feature." Snape set the drink aside and stood up. "Do you like almond?"

  "If I say yes, are you going to give me cyanide?"

From Bloodmagic, by Gateway Girl. The fic does kind of show its age, but I really enjoy her dialogue. She's pretty good at Sassy Harry.

"Ah," Kakashi exclaimed. "I understand. That's a page from Icha Icha Blushing Maidens. For the chakra paper to turn into that..." he paused. "It means you have the elemental affinity of Hentai."

** From one of my favorite fics:

#+begin_quote
  Draco rolled his eyes and reached into his jacket, pulling out a slim, silver card case. He opened it up and offered Harry a card.

  Harry took it wordlessly. It read, in the very poshest of copperplate calligraphy:

  /Draco Malfoy/\\
  /Toilet Supremo/
#+end_quote

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2304488][Link here.]] It's Drarry, although it's rated M it is non-explicit if I recall correctly.

  It was too late to buy anything new, and Harry didn't think he actually wanted to -- either Draco liked him for who he was, or he was an insane toilet man, and neither option required new clothes.
