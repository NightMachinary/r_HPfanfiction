:END:
Okay so I'm looking for a fic where Harry runs away from the Dursley's when he's 9 or 10. First he ends up with a creepy guy (who makes child porn maybe?) and Harry eventually kills him with accidental magic and runs to London. Then it's a few years on and Lupin is in muggle London and gets pickpocketed and it turns out to be Harry. Harry runs again but lupin finds him again after a bit. He's been living at a pub called the queens arms (?) with a guy named dirty Dave. So Lupin takes Harry in and Harry is really hostile and mean. He's blind in one eye where vernon hit him before he ran. This is during thirty year so Sirius is on the loose and he's actually crazy and he kidnaps Harry but Lupin saves him and Sirius runs off.

The story is complete but I'm not sure what site I read it on. And it's all from Lupins POV I think.

There's also a sequel where Harry finds out he has a STD (hep ?) and starts going to hogwarts. Sirius turns back up (not crazy anymore) and has a secret relationship with lupin but when Harry find out he freaks out and runs away because he's scared of Sirius from the previous kidnapping incident
