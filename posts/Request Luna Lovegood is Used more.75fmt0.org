I love Luna Lovegood, she's one of my favorite characters in the books. Although at times I'm wary of people writing her since she is a rather difficult character to write, some people just don't do her justice.

Which isn't their fault, as she is rather difficult as I said.

But, I'm looking for stories where Luna is written well/believably enough and is used more in the story.

Luna doesn't have to be the main character, I just want her used more in it.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is okay

Would rather not have character bashing

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione as a pairing, don't like either. But any other pairing is okay.


** I wouldn't mind some Luna /use/...

**** The trap of capitalising certain words for no reason. I saw the post title and only came in to see if anyone else noticed that one; was not disappointed.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.
