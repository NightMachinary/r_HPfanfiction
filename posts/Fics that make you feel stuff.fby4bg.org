As the title says - what are some fics that make you feel things? Any emotion is okay, I'm just curious what the more emotive fics people've found are. :)

Any relationships accepted, het or gen or slash or femslash, weird stuff okay, all tropes and cliches welcome.


** This one is skin-crawlingly creepy, also poignant: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11622306/chapters/26132727]])

As is this: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18456680]])

And here's a short one of mine that makes readers cry: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18990763]])

  Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world ruled by the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.

  Regulus wishes -- sometimes, not too often -- that he were like Sirius, able to make things up on the spot. Sirius says he has never seen a single bloody thing in his tea leaves, or his cards, or his palms, in the milky depths of a crystal ball or the glistening entrails of a dead pigeon. He just enjoys telling stories. Regulus sees water. His tealeaves: Dregs of muddy water. His cards: The Queen of Cups, waiting by the waterfront. His crystal ball: Unmoving, opaque water. His sign: Cancer, one of the Water Trigon. His palms: Somehow, impossibly, water. So, yes. He really did deserve that P in Divination. - Or: Regulus thought he knew all the horrors of Grimmauld Place, but on this stifling hot summer night in 1976, the house seems hell-bent on terrorising him in new and interesting ways. It's all Sirius's fault, of course.

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.

Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see.

** Linkffn(1399984) This one is the first fic that made me cry, it's really sad but it has a lot of layers.

Linkao3(285498) It's a series with a lot of good works, they're kind of sad but if I have to chose a feeling is more melancholy than anything else. The best ones for me is "the kids who chose themselves", "no place like home" and "the heir of something or other"

Linkao3(14016627) "Paranoia and puns" is really good, one of my favorites short works. This one is more happy and just makes me feel good. How they portray Cedric is so good and sweet, it just makes you smile

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix

However, when you start accepting this future for what it is and get into the story, it delivers hard on its emotional moments later on, leaving me in tears for some.

This left me in an emotional mess. If you are iffy about the first few chapters, I'd keep reading because everything is not what it seems. The warnings listed are accurate though. The way the plot is constructed is mind blowing and it's a real emotional roller coaster. The ending was poignant and was on my mind days after reading it.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!
