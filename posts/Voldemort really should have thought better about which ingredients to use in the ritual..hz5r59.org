So, Voldemort used in his ritual the bone of his father, whom incidentally had osteoporosis, the flesh of the servant that had passed the previous 13 years in the form of a rat without ever changing back to the point that he /kept/ rat's characteristics while human, and the blood of his teenager, hormone-ridden enemy, blood that also had a powerful enchantment against him... Yeah, it went as swimmingly well as you would expect.


** When he returns he immediately collapses as his osteoporosis riddled body can't support the stress of his rat-like organ system.

He eventually get back up, but the teenage hormones rampage through his body, and combined with his rat physiology, well... let's just say that rats are one of those creatures that live to eat, sleep, and reproduce.
