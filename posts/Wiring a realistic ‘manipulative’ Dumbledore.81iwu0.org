Any tips? I'm finding it hard to write Dumbledore in this way because it doesn't seem realistic enough or it seems too out of character. For reference, my fic's about the merging of the three schools (Beauxbatons, Durmstrang and Hogwarts) that Dumbledore forces to happen (the Imperio curse was my first choice but that's just ridiculous and unbelievable to his character) I've done the first chapter...

(GAH I MEANT WRITING)


** I'd recommend using a high gauge copper wire.

Anyway, standard and friendly negotiation first. You start out by asking why it would be a good idea. Then you ask why it would be a bad idea. Then you ask how you would make the bad parts not as bad. You also look at why Beauxbatons and Durmstrang would refuse that might not be related to the quality of the implementation plan and try to address those problems in the same way.

Once you've done your best there, you determine if that's good enough for Beauxbatons and Durmstrang to accept. If it's not, you look for something lesser that you /can/ get agreement on and get that as an intermediate concession. Like a voluntary year abroad program, or a standardized curriculum.

That's just negotiation: you're trying to come up with the best proposal you can to convince the people to accept it.

Manipulation is trying to change the people to accept the proposal you want. Primarily by changing their circumstances, but you can also potentially expose them to situations that will change their priorities.

For instance, you might pass some legislation making immigration easier, then have some highly publicized criticisms of the legislation saying that top Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students aren't as good as average Hogwarts students. The legislation is bad because it brings in workers who can't really be used. This would be a somewhat fraught path because you're wounding the pride of everyone who attended or supports the other schools. You'd have to follow it up with a sufficiently convincing propaganda campaign.

You might claim that Hogwarts is the safest school. You'll need an actual threat to schoolkids, and then you'll need it to successfully harm kids at Durmstrang and Beauxbatons. Then you show that Hogwarts can repulse an attack like that without half trying. They'll naturally respond by trying to bolster their security, so you'll need to send in another attack after they finish, one that smashes through with apparent ease (even if it's actually quite difficult).

I have a story that's like 10% written where Harry Potter as an evil hegemonizing emperor has seized much of Europe's magical communities, moving them all to Scotland. A similar person trying to expand their empire from Italy or Scandinavia would serve as a suitable threat, with a lot of people migrating to the safety of the UK. This doesn't necessarily unify the schools, but if two thirds of the students have already evacuated and are now attending Hogwarts, does it matter?

** If you want to write manipulative Dumbledore, you just need to look at canon, because he is very manipulative. Just keep in mind that this is only one side of him. He's a three dimensional character with many aspects to his personality. If you focus only on the manipulation, you create a very one dimensional, uninteresting character.

So to look at Dumbledore:

He tends to manipulate people, not out of malice, but out of a belief that he's doing the right thing. Even though he deeply regrets his actions as a teenager and that's a big part of who he became as an adult, he still tends to do things 'for the greater good'. Like using Harry in a plan to defeat Voldemort.

And this shows another aspect of him. While initially he only intended to use Harry for the greater good, he underestimated how much he would come to care about Harry. In your writing you can think of to what extent Dumbledore changes because of the people around him.

Another aspect of him is that he's very isolated and in a powerful, but difficult position. He's so much more intelligent and powerful than others that he can't really relate to them as equals. He's also the first one people go to for answers, but at the same time the first one to be blamed if something goes wrong. That's the consequence of him being so powerful and influential. This also means that the burden of dealing with important things often falls on his shoulders; whether the wizarding world puts it on him or he takes it upon himself because he knows he can do it best.

Next, with Dumbledore's intelligence, he tends to have plans within plans and is usually 5 steps ahead of everyone else and never really tells anyone the whole plan. Like Voldemort, he doesn't want to put all his eggs in one basket. He also has lots of ways to gather information, like Snape, the headmaster portraits, his connections, legillimency, the Order, etc.

Lastly, the friendly, grandfatherly Dumbledore is also very much an aspect of his personality. It's not just a front, although he can use it to manipulate people. He's truly a friendly person who cares about the wizarding world and the wellbeing of his students.

So I guess, if you want to write a manipulative Dumbledore realistically, you could take these things into account. A realistic person is not one sided, so if you want to make him realistic and interesteing, I suggest you make him a multi facetted, complex character who nobody truly understands, but many people admire.

** Stop using some weird, evil and barely thought through plans. A manipulative Dumbledore (the one we have in canon) would never do the kind of things which could stick to him. I know finances are not as interesting as Dark Magic, but someone playing the game would use everything to his advantage, even if it means sitting through boring budget meetings to get all the data he would need to convince the French and (wherever Durmastrang actually is) Ministries that they could +line their pockets+ save a lot of gold if they closed their schools and moved education to Hogwarts instead. And the money saved could be used by the foreign Ministries to finance a wild orgy with three veela clans or that sweet villa on Rhodes (although he would phrase that differently), so of course, all the officials will see the "benefits" of that proposal. Dumbledore would simultaneously tour the other European countries to promote Hogwarts and then he can point out that students from all these countries are also going to Hogwarts, so anyone clinging to Durmstrang and Beauxbaton is missing out on something obviously awesome.

Sadly, too many writers, OP included, mistake manipulative for outright evil and write the stupidest plots as a result. Seriously, half of the stuff fanfiction Dumbledore does are worse than what your average dictator comes up with and more than one crosses lines not even the Third Reich or the USSR under Stalin dared to touch. You know what the Nazis did to increase birth rates? Tax benefits and a few PR acts, not +rape+marriage laws or +rape drugs+ love potions.

*** Yeah I definitely understands what you mean. I'm new to FanFiction writing of course and I've read a lot of fics where Dumbledore is more evil than anything else. What you're saying is much more believable and realistic in compared to my stupid idea. Sorry :(

Luckily I haven't wrote that stupid part of the imperious nonsense in my fic yet so I'm definitey getting rid of it. Thanks for that. I'd much appreciate constructive criticism like this than someone lying to me by saying my idea is good.

I never planned for Dumbledore to become as bad as Hitler tho. Anyway thanks for this and yeah I need to stop thinking ludicrous plot stuff. Honesty really helped.

**** Your idea is not stupid, far from it. Its just devilishly hard to write well, hence the existence of so many cringe Dumbledore bash fests.

Firstly develop his character: What makes him tick? In canon we find that a lot of his baggage lies with Gellert and Ariana. Would changing what happened to Ariana make Dumbledore different? Of course. Those ripple effects would drastically alter him as a character. You can do the same for what you intend to accomplish.

Secondly is it believeable: Does Harry get on a table and yell at Dumbledore in the great hall? If so that's probably bad. Is Dumbledore being utterly stupid all for the 'greater good'? If so that's also bad.

No idea is inherently bad. There are certainly bad ways to write an idea, which is much more prevalent. Hell there is an author that is writing a femVoldemort/Harry Potter fic that is incredible. That sounds like an awful idea but the author is killing it.

Put enough time and thought into it and you can make it work.

********* Yes also Hellblazerfan in one of my favorite book series EVER, Animorphs, it was a serious gritty sci-fi war series against aliens, and the main bad guy alien was a saturday morning cartoon type, BUT the trope was subverted because all his underlings were laughing about him behind his back and neglecting to tell him important things because he'd never listen and just chop their heads off instead. :) So the bad guys could have gotten the heroes captured like a dozen times over, but the bad guys sabotaged themselves rather than face their insane boss! :) It was very cool.

It's worth bearing in mind, however, that Wizarding attitudes towards this are very different than muggle attitudes. Love potions are openly sold in Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes, for example - can you imagine a high street shop selling rohypnol, and advertising it as a "love drug"?

** Firstly I would recommend reading fics that do a good job of it. Believe it or not they do exist, and you can learn a lot from them.

Take this linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches by leadvone)for example. Dumbledore doesn't want to kill kittens, he is the way he is because of extenuating circumstances: [[/spoiler][A ritual that boosts power but you have to sacrifice your true love and swear yourself completely to a cause. He swears himself to the cause of eradicating Dark Lords, and the prophecy names Harry as an equal to the Dark Lord.]] Personally I think this is a great way to do it, the best execution I've seen thus far.

Basically don't bash. Have Dumbledore's reasons be ironclad for his actions. Make sure things are not black and white, grey area is much more realistic.

I also like the Dumbledore in linkffn(Taking Control by fake a smile). I'll also mention the Dumbledore in HPMOR, even though it is hated around here I loved his characterization.
