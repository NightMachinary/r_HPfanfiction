This was a fanfic in the vein of "Harry and friends organize with muggles and muggle-born wizards and use guns, explosives and other military weapons to fight Voldemort". Things I remember:

1) a battle between the soldiers and Death Eaters, with soldiers watching in the dark for the green killing curse flashes and using that to target death eaters

2) Disillusioned broom riders dropping grenades on death eaters

3) Harry and co. have a large ocean vessel (concealed by fidelius charm) that various muggleborn refugees are hiding out on

4) they set up a trap for a group of death eaters, luring them to a warehouse and blowing them up with barrels of high explosive

5) Lucius Malfoy abuses his house elves, and near the end of the story one of them gets revenge when Lucius is shot and returns home heavily wounded, and the elf pretends not to understand what is wrong and allows Lucius to bleed to death.
