I want to know, if there are Fics that Contain Harry and Hermione living together. Either on their own free will or forced through a Marriage Law. The constellation should be like end of the War, so Harry is with Ginny and Ron with Hermione. Although i cant imagine them simply break by living together, but more on a forced marriage.

"Confusing Feelings" and its sequel "Moving Forward" by midnight17516 have this "living together" criteria, although both of them recognize their feelings for each other before they move into the Apartment. So the War is over and the Constellation of the Canon Couples start, but then Harry and Hermione have to marry because of a Law or because some other circumstances that make them live together.

I dont know, if simply living together is a good requirement to quit with the Canon-couples, so i would like there to be no Canon...unless its good written.

I know there is "Love lost Love found", but its actually to late about what im looking for. More like the ones above.

And as far as i know, "The Best Man" by lickintheair04 has this element, although the actually "Live together" thing isnt really shown, rather a very small part of it.

Hmm, now that i think about it: a (post) epilogue-compliant fic that forces Harry and Hermione (despite their marriage with Ron and Ginny) to live together and/or marry, through a Law, would also be ok. But its not a requirement, as i want to have it smooth.


** linkffn(The Augurey) fits this. There are lemons in the later chapters though.

**** It's not exactly. The premise takes one thing from Cursed Child: Voldemort and Bellatrix's daughter (as a baby though). Nothing else is remotely like it, it's starts right after DH and ignores the epilogue and such.

  It's four years after the Trio has graduated from Hogwarts, and they're about to live together again for the first time. But will old friends remain old friends... or will they become something more?

** I'd love to see a proper Harry/Hermione marriage law fic, one in which the story isn't complete garbage. Unfortunately, of the ones that I've come across, they're all really, really bad.

*** I just read a Harry/Daphnee Greengrass Marriage law fic and it was super amazing. It really could have gone Harry/Hermione in it also. And im a marriage law skeptical i wonder if there is a really good H/Hr marriage law contract flic out there that could be just as good. ... humm now you have me thinking

**** I'm penning something akin to a Marriage Law fic though it won't pair Harry and Hermione together but it will feature them. Mostly, the story has to do with the Wizengamot ousting Hermione from her perch of Deputy Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement after Aurors and a guerilla-type gang of youths kill rogue Death Eaters pardoned by the Ministry. But if you find any good H/Hr Marriage Law fics, please share!

** linkffn(Charming by Fuyumi) fits the bill somewhat. Ron and Ginny are not major parts of the story though.
