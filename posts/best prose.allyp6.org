I often can't finish fanfics (even the ones that get recommended again and again) because of poor writing and editing. If you were nominating a fanfic for a literary prize, which one would it be?

Also, is there a website you use that vets the stories by quality of writing?

ETA: thank you for all the recs!

*** well-written, but if it's both poetic and well-written, that's even more interesting! I've lurked on DLP, but haven't looked at the library.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12919788/1/The-Cactus-and-the-Toad][The Cactus and the Toad by mirrormarie]] (the scene below is when Snape attempts Legilimency on Frank Longbottom in an attempt to heal him):

#+begin_quote
  Ragged fragments. Cuts, savage and raw, gouged into thoughts and memories. The mind writhed at his presence, and he held himself still, calm, unmoving. He observed.\\
  Swathes of gray. Webs of thought torn apart like cobwebs, their gossamer strands tangled and frayed, their perfect architecture no longer discernible in the soft, weak tatters that remained. Emotions clung to those tatters, billowing and brief. With the slightest pressure, Severus could have destroyed everything in his path.\\
  And yet, somewhere in that maze of of webs, Severus could feel Frank Longbottom, swaying like a spider from the ruined threads of his mind.\\
  Spiders were resilient. They were used in potions as an element of balance, the balance of a perfect web, of blood and air, of life and death. They created to destroy, and destroyed to create. In an elegant universe, their elegance was supreme.\\
  Severus, though far from considering Longbottom elegant -- he was, after all, the father of /Neville/ Longbottom -- nevertheless acknowledged that there might be more strength to the broken man than the ruin of his mind suggested.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
