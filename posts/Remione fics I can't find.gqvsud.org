These fics are coming up with an error message on ffn for me. If anyone has any idea where else I could find them I'll love you forever because Remione is my OTP and frankly I'm starved for content.

- Sacrifice (don't know the author)
- Shared Destinies by amightypenguin
- The Family that the House Built by whispergypsy
- A Higher Law (don't know the author)

Also if anyone has any recommendations (particularly anything new or obscure that I'm not likely to have come across before) I'll read anything at this point. Thanks in advance!


** Remione ... you mean Remus × Hermione? That's really cradle grabbing (even Remus × Tonks was on the edge, IMHO).
