*To 1940s*: Harry gets paired up with: a) Bellatrix b) Arcturus Black c) Tom Riddle

Most of the time, Harry will be against Dumbledore.

*To Marauders Era:* Harry will try and snuff out the rivalry with Snape and Marauders. There will be some creepy/romantic interaction between Lily and Harry.

In many fics, Harry will be against Tom (but not necessarily with Dumbledore).

Whenever Harry is god-like, he needs to have a Harem. Because that's what gods - who have shed their humanity (and one would assume several human traits like lust) - need.


** WBWL fic: the twin is named Charlus, or John, or Daniel, or James Potter Jr. Of course, it would be Harry/Daphne if not a harem. Harry gets sorted in Slytherin and kicks some random seventh year prefect's or Draco's ass and then becomes the 'Lord of the House' or something. Oh, and not to forget the whole 'baby Harry does not cry in front of Voldemort while the other twin is bawling their eyes out' and the Weasley/Dumbledore bashing.

*** Let's not forget the whole ‘baby BWL is described as chubby whereas Harry, despite being a baby and almost certainly also chubby, is described as leaner and has mysterious glowing green eyes' thing too. Because apparently fatshaming babies is now the thing to do.

And while it's often Harry/Daphne, if he goes over to the ‘dark side' and discovers that the Light wants to ban all powerful forms of magic and all Pagan rituals and that's what the Dark is really fighting against (not for Muggle genocide, duh) then endgame is Harry/Voldemort.

***** Waaay off on The Pureblood Pretense. She's not in a relationship at all, but is besties with Pansy and Draco (though she has friends in all houses), hero-worships Professor Snape and has a great deal of respect for Professor Dumbledore. The basilisk is bound to its master and therefore never friendly although she does pity it for its cruel death, she doesn't even reveal her gender much less flaunt anything, and her secretive habits very much do annoy her friends. They put up with her because they know she's generous at her core, and when the chips are down, she has a habit of saving their lives.

She does become friendly with a local snake through extensive bribery, but never buys Hedwig. And she is unusually powerful, but that causes as many problems as it solves, because it brings her a lot of attention that makes it much harder to maintain her cover.

I'm not sure what you were referring to with "how would your parents feel," but Sirius is highly supportive of her sorting, redecorates the house in green and silver and buys a bunch of garden snakes, etc. Of course, he doesn't know about the identity swap and thinks it's his son Archie who's been sorted into Slytherin. But the point is, he's being a good dad.

Riddle is an interesting one. He's still got a pretty strong evil streak, but eventually turns out to have /some/ sympathetic motivations mixed in with the bigotry. He wants to make pure-bloods marry half-bloods in order to stop a looming population implosion caused by inbreeding, but he still intends to keep muggle-borns and the associated muggle culture locked out. Harry is stunned to realise that he might be both right /and/ wrong, but doesn't join him.

With the vocalists practically sounding the same (for example, a mid-twenties woman from New York), no matter how technically talented they are themselves? Are the tracks produced in such a way that they constantly mirror existing tracks to the point of being obvious derivations, no matter the instrumentals used?

***** Yes. That's how music works. Songs in a particular genre are inherently similar to each other, in some cases even taking the same tune and expanding on it. In jazz there are songs that have been covered thousands of times, in pretty much the same way every time.

The same thing happens in every other major form of literature or art. Mystery novels often follow the same patterns ('The butler did it'). Rom-coms have the same storyline. I couldn't even tell you the difference between Twilight and Teen Wolf. That's how everything in the arts is made.

Even some of the most celebrated works in history are copies. The Aeneid is a copy of the Iliad and Odyssey, Percy Shelley, John Keats, and Lord Byron copied each other all the time (Ode to a Skylark, Ode to a Nightingale, Ozymandias), Edouard Manet's 'Lunch on the Grass' is practically a carbon copy of a section of Marcantonio's 'Judgement of Paris'.

To say that everything that is derived from previous works is inherently bad means denouncing almost every piece of modern literature or art, and also many older ones.

****** There is a massive difference between stories following plot archetypes and stories literally being clones of one another. In your examples, while they follow overarching archetypes and tropes, the blend of plots, locations, and characters are unique to each RomCom, despite following similar or the same overarching archetypes. They're actually memorable. Heck, even if Family Guy and the Simpsons follow similar formulas, they're still unique to be remembered. Now, take Peter Griffin and Homer Simpson, clone them a million times while making slight alterations to them, and then have these new derivations re-enact the same episodes constantly but with minor tweaks. Yeah. In the latter case, the tropes used in Harry Potter fanfiction make it so that fics that use these tropes are rarely memorable, unless there's something unique blended into them (amusingly enough, this logic applies to RomComs, such as Notting Hill and Bridget Jones' Diary) -- and that reinforces my view: Harry Potter tropes create forgettable and cookie-cutter fics because they all are the same or result in the same effects on the story and characters, no matter what it is. They're overused. Stale. The only things that make them stand out that people remember? Unique and non-tropey elements. I could go on FFn right now and pick out a dozen "Indie Harry" fics that are pretty much the same -- all the way down to the infamous Goblin Friend/Diagon shopping trip and 'Lord Potter-KitchenSink bullshit -- on just the first ten, twenty at max pages alone. They're all forgettable rehashes and derivations. Clones that haven't evolved but have degraded. Personally? To me, you don't need to be a good writer. You don't need to be able to write hundred thousand word behemoth chapters. If you try to do something interesting, try to do something unique, you'd have my attention. That's why I especially love author dumping grounds for concepts and ideas that rarely last a chapter or so: some of the most unique plots and ideas come from these 'folders', and almost all of them do not rely on typical cliches. Heck, I was reading one the other day where Luna was the descendant of one of the Senior Partners: the Wolf, the Ram, or the Hart, and she was looking after Harry from the law-firm's influence. It stuck in my mind because it was unique and entertaining. Since then, I've skimmed through dozens of fics that use typical Harry Potter (Indie) tropes, and I honestly can't remember much about any of them. First sign of any cliches? You've got one chance to make something unique out of them, or to completely subvert them. Otherwise, I wouldn't even blink when closing the shit-fic and moving on -- just another forgettable piece amongst other forgettable pieces. Edit: also, Reddit fucked up the formatting. What the hell?
