They all seem to be highly specific, demanding strict adherence to what is basically a complete plotline, or at least the beginning of one. The most famous examples are the ones with the fairy queen choosing Harry and friends to go back in time and the one where Harry ends up in the Ministry of Death after his 10 millionth death or something, but all of the non-mainstream challenges seem to do this as well. Why can't we just have popular challenges that act as a jumping off point for authors? [[/r/Writingprompts]] knows what's up- they encourage prompts that can generally evolve in a loose direction.

So why do you think this is?


** A lot of the "prompts" probably come from people that don't understand what a prompt actually is and merely have plot bunnies they don't want to/aren't capable of writing, so they put up this idea hoping someone else will do it for them.

*** As a related factor, I think people just have ultra-specific +fetishes+ tastes and can't help but request what they'd love to read.

*** Case in point, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/forum/Whitetigerwolf-s-Challenges/83467/][Whitetigerwolf's challenges]], while genuinely good ideas at times (like that one HP/Honor Harrington crossover, now I'm craving me some Fem!Harry/treecat fluff), are not what one would call a prompt.

** I'd like to see more prompts and challenges here. I recently did a mugglenet one that I really enjoyed but that site is virtually dead now. Could we maybe organise a monthly challenge here? I'm happy to help.

*** I'd like to go even further and see if we could get a weekly challenge. Just a short form challenge like [[/r/Writingprompts]], but specifically for Harry Potter.

*** That'd be cool. Having a month-long challenge where the results could be seen at the end of that month might also be incentive to turn in longer one-shots or even multi-chaptered works.

** Honestly this is the one reason I use tumblr. There is someone I follow called [[http://hpfanfictionprompts.tumblr.com/][Harry Potter Fanfiction Prompts]]. They give a one line prompt that you can submit if you like. It's sometimes as simple as giving you a line to use. Others is a simple idea but it always seems to be one line. I love it.

** Also, does anyone notice that most prompts from FF.net are done by Tsume Yuki? Her most recent one is fem!Harry getting cursed into a genie bottle and sent to Narutoverse to take care of Naruto.

Before that was the one you mentioned OP, fem!Harry dying and Death telling her she screwed up and that she needs to marry Hermione.

*** It seems to come in waves. The most popular ones seem to be where the makers of the challenge actually wrote a fic based off of it, like Tsume Yuki and DZ2.

Tsume Yuki is just the most recent wave since she is a really popular author. Which, to be fair isn't that bad, considering she's an actual good author, in my opinion, unlike a bunch of this other tripe. Shame she never finishes a story.

**** Or even gets halfway through most of them. She /is/ a good author, wonderful way with words, but damn, she might as well put most of those stories into two or three plot bunny fics, because that's basically what it amounts to.

She also seems to have a preference for soulmate fics. Not my cuppa, but whatever.

** The point may be that Harry Potter has been around for a while, most simple directly related to HP prompts have been done in one form or another. For example, Snape is Harry's father/mentor is years old and has been done to death, but was a radical idea at the time.

*** It's funny you should mention Snape as Harry's father because the [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Severitus_Challenge][Severitus challenge]]--which may not have been the first instance of this idea but was at least the challenge that gave it the name--was exactly the kind of thing that OP is complaining about.

** I hate those type of challenges. It's not really a "challenge" so much as a writing commission. Like this is what they want to read, here's the outline, go write it. This seems to come from people who read fanfiction, but don't write it. Most writers hoard ideas for their own work.

I like prompts that are more vague and allow me a lot of room to run with it. One of my stories came from a prompt "write about a pregnancy" Another of my stories was "write about a mental illness". I consider THOSE to be writing prompts. Specific enough that there's a theme to all the stories written for the challenge, but vague enough that people can do them differently.

I sometimes participate in forums like Harry Potter Fanfiction Challenges, The Quidditch League Fanfiction Competition or Diagon Alley II on fanfiction.net and I find they're very good at giving challenges/competitions/prompts.

** I remember reading something recently from several years ago. Where the author wrote a post DH dimension travel story where Harry had to defeat another Voldemort. The Dumbledore of that world summoned him. At the very end of the fic he gets pulled into another universe again but it ends there. The author then posted it as a challenge for other authors to continue and write about each new universe he visits. One person responded and it was actually pretty good. I would have read more if anyone else had done it and maybe written my own if it wasn't like 5-6 years ago.
