looking for fics where harry isn't left a giant inheritance/trust fund

lily and james have an average income they were 21, lily was probably in magical uni and james was a cop? maybe? who's been working for less than two years they realistically don't have (a lot) of money saved and don't have life insurance bc honestly, do you think they'd make all this financial stuff accessible to working class student muggleborns

maybe dorea and charlus/fleamont and euphemia allowed some money for their grandchild but harry doesn't have access to this grand “family vault” bc their money has been distributed to other families or something like that but the technicalities don't matter\\
i just want average income level harry


** It is actually quite probable that given the size of the magical economy (one magical per five thousand Muggles), there is just not enough money to go around. Few loonies waste all their money on looking like a nobility (Malfoys, Blacks), but generally Magical Britain should be pretty middle-class: small entrepreneurs, Ministry officials, farmers, and such.

*** I think it's likely to be very unequal. Most wizards as you describe, yes. But we also see wizards exchanging rubies the size of fists at Gringotts and know that curse-breaking can result in substantial hordes of treasure being recovered.

My mental image of the Malfoy vault:

**** Considering that I don't think even the Alladin's Cave was this wast (this is just Hollywood going over the top as usual), I would tend to agree. In my mind even pleasantly rich Potters, wouldn't have to work for the rest of their life, but their children would probably hate them, because not much would be left. Blacks and Malfoys were probably slightly richer, but not this.

However, yes, I cannot change the content of your brain, so let's agree to disagree here.

** I believe in linkffn(Harry's New Home by kbinnz), Harry's family used to be very wealthy, but ended up almost broke from the effort of supporting the fight against Voldemort.

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS!

** the way i imagine it the rich aristocratic wizards like the malfoys make all there money from their estate like most landed gentry and there taxes fuel the ministry. I do also imagine that most wizards do have an estate because it wouldn't be very hard pre statute to acquire one with a cofundus here or there, or even just doing some contracting work for the monarch like the malfoys did.
