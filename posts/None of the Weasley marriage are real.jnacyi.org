Ok, think about it.

Molly Weasley admits to using love potions on Arthur Wesley when she was in Hogwarts. So what are the chances that the apples fell far from the tree?

Let us theorise why Molly did what she did. Molly was always a control freak she needed to control every aspect of her life so it is only natural that she would need some one weaker then her. And checking the people who would have been in Molly Weasley year at Hogwarts almost all men are pureblood this is turn meaning dominant personalities. Thus comes in Arthur Weasley. A timid man (no offence to him). The kind she could control with ease however Molly was a bit of a...for the lack of a better word a slag. And as you know purity is very important for purebloods. And this is where the love potion fits in, Molly slips it to him and voila, Arthur Weasley is obsessed with with her and the rest is history.

Now let us look at William Arthur Weasley and Fleur Isabelle Delacour. Fleur is in all sense of the word a Goddess, with beauty unmatched so how did such a perfect woman fall in love with William (Bill) Weasley? Once again love potions is the answer that come to mind. Now we could theorise that as a Veela Fleur would be immune to love potions but unfortunately their not. And add in Bill coming from a poor family and Fleur coming from one of Frances richest (Fleur is the heiress and as Fleur's husband Bill with inherit the Delacour fortune) and Molly's skill in love potion making and Voila, Bill has a Veela wife way out of his league. Another important point that supports this theory is that Veela, Half-Veela, and Quarter-Veela all have one thing in common, they choose strong Attractive mates. Yes, Bill maybe somewhat attractive but when compared to Fleur it is not even a fair compensation. Talking of strength (magical power), Fleur is a Triwizard champion and a student with straight O*'s, thus meaning she is exceptionally powerful while Bill isn't anything special with graduating with A's and EE's.

Now let us move on to the the marriage between Ron and Hermione. In the cured child, Ron and Hermione are divorced, why? Ron being the stupid oaf he his forgets to give Hermione the monthly dose needed thus the divorce. But as soon as Ron is able to dose her again they are back together. Love potions.

Now moving on to the Harry and Ginny. From the beginning Ginny has had a crush on the boy-who-lived, (not Harry but the boy-who-lived, see the difference? She didn't like the person who is Harry potter just the fame and money and popularity). Yes, there was a time where Ginny dated other boy but she did that in the hopes of getting Harry's attention, get him jealous. The moment this seems to not work she runs off to her mother and gets a love potion and Harry is her's. Solid proof is the Deathly hallows. Not once did Harry think of Ginny during the time he was away. You could argue that Harry had other things such as survival and horcrux hunting on his mind but remember a love potion would make the victim constantly think on the one the potion is keyed to. Let us skipped forward to when Harry and co. Arrived in Hogwarts for the final battle, Harry didn't think of Ginny until she kissed him one again in the room of requirements, how did she dose him? Lipstick with love potion keyed to her. As to why she is after him besides the fame? The money and influence of course. The Weasley's a dirt poor family and Harry being from old money from both his father's side and god-father's sides means he is one of the richest wizards in Europe and not to mention the Potter and Black family were exceptionally powerful political powers. And as the matriarch of the Potter-Black family she could easily make the Weasley family a respectable pure-blood family.

There is one key argument that can be made with this theory. Any child born from a union cause by love potion is said to be unable to feel love. HOWEVER. I theorise that if both parents are magical this effect is negated.
