It's a very good story and updated this morning. It's still /very/ early, so if you're looking for something with a lot of plot to slog through, you may want to wait a while. But bookmark it, because I guarantee it'll be a story to read in a few months.

*Summary:*

#+begin_quote
  When Harry saves Hermione's life they end up in a different world and in the middle of another magical war - but at least they have each other.

** It's a nice story.

But there are two things I don't like about it: 1. Family magic as a plot device to make everyone good and accepting: Harry immediately found powerful people who are taking him (and his “wife”) literally into their families no questions asked; 2. Relationship between Harry and Hermione are given as perfect and again everyone sees them as one made for another; there's no development between them, just ideal sweetness without any other feelings.

I honestly don't get why people push this bullshit into their fics. Maybe I'm the weird one for finding it peak cringe.
