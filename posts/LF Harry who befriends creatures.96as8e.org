There is a fic, and I completely forgot what it was called... anyhow it involved Harry saving the unicorn first year, who has children who love him, and Harry taking the pixies from lockheart and the little dragon from the triwzard tournament and other stuff happens but i just remember that the fic had a bunch of creatures involved in it. Anyone know what it is?


** I believe the fic you are looking for is "On the Wings of an Angel" by MisteryMaiden. It's a Supernatural crossover, and has everything you are looking for - unicorn saving and her foals playing, Lockhart's pixies, the mini dragon... linkffn(10995877).

  All angels know that when they die, they cease to exist. All angel's know that there's no 'after' for them. Just like all angels know that God created more than one Earth. Gabriel's about to find that one of those two facts isn't as set in stone as he thought and that the true answer to one has to do with the truth in the other. Maybe dying wasn't as bad as it could of been.

** Hmm... linkffn(7985679) To the Waters and the Wild has Harry being raised by fairies. He doesn't successfully save the unicorn, but he does try, and he does have a tendency to befriend magical creatures, up to and including dementors.

...Darn it, I /know/ the fic you're thinking of, the one where he manages to pour a unicorn's blood back into it, to the amazement of a nearby centaur, and at the end of the school year that same unicorn returns to show Harry her foal. Is that it?

**** Ah-ha! I found Harry saving a unicorn foal in Chapter 25 of linkffn(7201522) The Wizard & the Lonely Princess. The foal returns in chapter 30. Is this the one?

...Ah, it can't be the one, because that story only reaches to the end of first year; there's no opportunity for Harry to encounter Lockhart's pixies or the Triwizard dragons.

There is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8541055/1/No-Knowledge-No-Money-No-Aim][No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim]], that has Harry developing considerable skill with handling magical creatures...but it also doesn't reach fourth year either.

  We all have imaginary friends when we're young right? Well, as it turns out, Harry's might not be all that imaginary at all... Chapters 9-11Rewritten. Story Complete.
