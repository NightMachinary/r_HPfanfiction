Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New/Completed or not

DO NOT want an OC joining the Marauders, just no.

I want Peter to be in the story more. I understand authors hate him, but he was their friend, he'd be around more often than what some authors do.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New/Completed or not

For other pairings: Am fine with het/slash/femslash/etc

Note: Snape can still get bullied, but the few Marauder Era stories I read, had WAY too much bullying WAY too often, which got to be way too much.


** I only have a Lily/James/Regulus fic, is that something you would be keen on, or nah?

Other than that, I feel like there are too few actually readable Jilly fics so I'm keen to see what others link here

  Lily Evans finds she can't simply sit back and watch Regulus Black get drawn into the depravity and violence of the group calling themselves the 'Death Eaters'. The fact that she keeps thinking about what he would look like as she kissed him awake in the morning was besides the point. ...But while we're on the subject, perhaps having two perfect boyfriends would be even better than one just so long as they don't mind...

** Linkffn(A Walk In Your Shoes by Spirit007) Being pre-HBP, Snape is not a part of the story. Lily and James have an antagonistic relationship at the start.

  Imagine that one person that irritates, infuriates, & insults their way under your skin to the point where each moment with him or her becomes a pop quiz in self-control. Now, imagine that you've woken up in that person's body. For Lily Evans & James Potter, learning to navigate this unfortunate and stressful new reality is truly a walk through hell.
