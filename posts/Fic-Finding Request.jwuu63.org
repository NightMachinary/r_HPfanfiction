I read it not too long ago though weather it was a self insert or time travel I can't remember. The premise was that harry goes to gringotts pre-hogwarts and nearly kills himself taking both the Potter and black lordship. Then goes on to get Narcissa on his side through Andromeda by rescuing her from wat amounts to slavery at the hands of malfoys. If you need more info I'll try to remember.


** Oh and narcissas life as lady Malfoy was.... dark. To be delicate about it.
