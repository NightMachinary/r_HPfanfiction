I can best explain this with a scenario:

Draco: Ugh, must I really go have lunch in that derelict hovel the Weasleys call a home?

Harry/Hermione/Ginny/Luna/McGonagall/Crookshanks: They are my family, Draco.

Draco: /insert derogatory comment on the Weasley finances, home life and breeding/

Harry/Dean/Lee Jordan/Remus/Fay Dunbar: oh, Draco! Just manage! Let's go. /prances off to the Burrow/

Like in any STABLE relationship, when you take you significant other to meet the people you consider family and loved ones, you wouldn't let insults or rudeness be tolerated in private, right? I'd hope? In private, insults should NOT be okay about people you love! That's a huge red flag.

So often I see Harry/Etc. brush off Draco's casual insults of the Weasleys and that doesn't sit right with me. It's actually not charming or healthy relationship behavior at all. Sarcasm is cool but rudeness is actually not okay.

Pls recommend any fics you know that tackle a snarky Draco in a relationship relatively properly. Snarky doesn't have to equal a douchebag.


** So, in other words, you want to see Draco getting his leather pants ripped off? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

*** Looooool, leather pants can stay? Though I personally don't think they fit Draco's character at all

**** It was a reference to this trope: [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants]] named after fanfiction authors turning Draco from a whiny lil racist shitstain into a 2cool4u good bad boy.
