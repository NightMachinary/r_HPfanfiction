It's not really a prompt. But I just want to see a fic that rather than overexplain how Harry survived, just explicitly states that it was a miracle in every sense of the word.

Yes, Lily's sacrifice played a part, so did James', and yes the prophesy is true. But none of these things can fully explain surviving a killing curse.

Lily wasn't the only mother who was willing to die for her child, many had tried before but none managed to save their kids. Many had tried several types to protections but none succeeded.

That's why Harry is so famous. No one had ever survived the killing curse no matter what they did. He truly is the Boy-Who-Lived.


** Imagine Dumbledore and McGonagall sitting in the Hog's Head and discussing this.

*Dumbledore:* I have just been sitting here thinking.

*McGonagall:* About what?

*Dumbledore:* About the miracle we witnessed.

*McGonagall:* The miracle /you/ witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence.

*Dumbledore:* What is a miracle, Minerva?

*McGonagall:* An act of God.

*Dumbledore:* And what's an act of God?

*McGonagall:* When, um... God makes the impossible possible... but I don't think that the last night qualifies.

*Dumbledore:* Can't you see it, Minerva? That doesn't matter. You are judging this the wrong way, I'm afraid. It could be that God stopped the Killing Curse, or He changed butterbeer to firewhiskey, or He found my bag of sherbet lemons. Things like these are not judged on merit. Now, whether or not what young Harry experienced was an "according to Hoyle" miracle is insignificant. What is significant is that I felt the touch of God. God got involved.

*McGonagall:* But why?

*Dumbledore:* This is precisely what is bothering me. I don't know why, but I can't go back to sleep.

*** Well, it doesn't have be miracle in the religious sense of the world (although, that's also very problematic, I am a practising Christian and I have hard time to understand what exactly the word ‘miracle' means ... BTW, Bible doesn't use the term at all, in whole text it is used only once in Ex 7:9 and it is used by the pharaoh about the magician tricks made by his magi). Just, why cannot we say “We just don't know what happened.” I very much like parts of the magic which are imperfect, unpredictable, and slightly weird.

That's the one thing which I think JKR managed to achieve much better than all fanfiction stories did (or perhaps authors of the fanfiction stories never noticed it is there at all): magic in the Harry Potter world is kind of slightly imperfect. Professor Flitwick sometimes blows himself from the stool, transformation sometimes gets all weird, everything is slightly dirty (notice Professor Snape's office in the films). I don't like when the magical world in the fanfiction story is like the German design office: everything perfect, clean, last fashion style, with rulers ordered by the size (eh, doesn't anybody even know what the ruler was?).

** I read a fanfic where Harry tells snaps that when snape asked Voldemort to spare Lily's life it was an informal unveeakable vow and when Voldemort asked lily to stand aside and she didn't, asking instead to spare Harry's life for hers, the vow shifted to protect Harry so lily died and when Voldemort tried to cast the killing curse at Harry it rebounded and killed him because he broke the unbreakable vow. That's the best explanation I've found for Harry's survival of the killing curse

** But Lily is the only mother who was able to cast that sacrificial blood magic ritual. I honestly hate the idea that she had to be given a choice. Why must good guys always rely on some lucky chain of events to diss the bad guys? Why can't good guys be proactive and ruthless at least for once?

**** Canon is very vague about the exact mechanism how Voldemort was defeated that night. At best we readers only get to see Dumbledore's speculations. But blood protection (ward) is confirmed.

Therefore, having Lily performing dark blood magic ritual does not contradict canon

***** No, it doesn't, and the involvement of the little green men doesn't contradict canon either.
