:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
As I mentioned its a ootp fic prior to Hogwarts starting.

Harry and the other feel it's their right to know what's going on based on their previous years and also 'cause it was eventually left to them to solve the problems each year.

McG and the others swiftly correct them from their misunderstandings, mainly how their meddling was unnecessary, even detrimental.

First year trap for Quirrel foiled by harry stumbling onto him.

Second years' failure to ensure the proper professors were involved(Lockhart doesn't count)

So on and so forth.

It was lovely oneshot, hope some1 knows what I'm talking about.


** I believe this is what you are talking about?

*** Whether it is or not, it's well done :). Probably best to use the www version of the URL, though, and let mobile devices redirect if they so choose.
