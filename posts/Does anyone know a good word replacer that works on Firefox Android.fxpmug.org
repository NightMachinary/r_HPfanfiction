** Ironically, I prefer Harriet. I do think I'm in the minority however. I like my fem harry to not just be an OC but rather Harry as a girl and I feel it's easier to connect the two characters together with a similar name.

To answer your question, I'm not sure of a good word replacer, but you could copy paste the fanfic into a word doc. While it doesn't work on PC, it does work on a phone.

** Really? You should really sort out your priorities!

That which we call a rose\\
By any other name\\
Would smell as sweet.”

*** It's just laziness. It's like the whole "stick a to a male name" thing all over again.

*** Obviously not if someone is bothered by it. o_O

It's a perfectly valid preference I think, I am sort of like that with names as well but even more hardcore.

** Oh man I'm with you here. I don't know a good one but if it's a fic you're invested in/already decided you like besides that, you could download it and ctrl-f to find and replace, then read it as a PDF or whatever on your phone.

** Press f12. You MIGHT be able to do a replace all. I'm not sure. If not, let me know what fic it is and I can make an ebook with the edit.

** A flower name makes the most sense given the Evans naming tradition. So any flower you like - I personally like unusual ones like Alyssa, Jasmine, Marguerite (good nickname for this one: Meg, Cassia, Aster. Holly, Violet and Rose seem too obvious, for some reason. And Poppy Potter sounds ridiculous aloud.
