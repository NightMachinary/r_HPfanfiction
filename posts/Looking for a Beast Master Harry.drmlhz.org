FIRST! NO SOUL BONDS OR SUB/DOM OR SLASH!!

Im sorry if this offends but usually if any if the above are involved it usually descends into slash smut and some weird freaky shit that leaves you begging for the invention of eye bleach.

Now as the title says im looking for a beast master harry, essentially harry can control (or subdue ) wild animals (magical or otherwise) and uses them to defeat voldemort or companions.

  Hagrid wins a dragon egg...only what is inside is no dragon. Harry is the first to make eye contact with the creature inside...and ends up with a most unusual familiar. Watch out Hogwarts...things are about to get prehistoric!

  Power Dark Lord knows not. Something unique to Harry saved him from an attack by the worst wizard tyrant in centuries. Albus put traumatized boy in a picnic basket, and left him on Aunt's doorstep in the dead of night, note attached, of course. Riiight.

  Harry didn't have the authority of the Ministry. He didn't have the reputation of the Dark Lord. He didn't have the influence of Lucius Malfoy. At heart, he was a simple tailor. "But anyone who had heard of Harry Potter knew that he was more than just a simple tailor. He was a good master." Abused, wise-beyond-years Harry.

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

** It's not exactly what you're looking for, but “The Art of Self-Fashioning” by Lomonaaeren linkffn(11585823) gets pretty deep into the ideas of wild/animal magic and there is quite a bit of combat using animals. A crackfic that features a ‘beastmaster' Harry would be “Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them” linkffn(8197451) and its sequel “The Handbook of Elf Psychology” linkffn(8509020) by evansentranced wherein a young Harry is led to believe that he is, in fact, an elf and has a host of animal companions. It goes up until year three, but even if you're the kind of person who only reads complete fics, it is definitely worth it as both are complete fics in their own rights, even if the overall story doesn't fully conclude.
