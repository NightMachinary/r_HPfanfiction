Hey there! I am looking for FanFictions wherw Harry is paired with someone and she cheats/betrays him and Harry's (and others) reaction to it. I am looking for a story like one that I read that paired Harry (who was Voldemort son) with Amelia Bones and she, in a fit of sorrow and anger, decided to cheat on him. Also, I prefer it won't be slash.

Thanks!


** It's a one shot that only shows one character's reaction, but what a reaction it is. Caveat Inimici linkffn(5508237)

  Hermione is a sister to Harry, a mother to Rose and Hugo, a wife to Ron...and a Legilimens and Unspeakable. She is also very, very angry. A look at a Hermione who developed the instincts she evidenced with Marietta and Umbridge. AU, but canon-compliant.

*** I recently read this. I don't remember any cheating, just Ginny deciding she wants to separate from Harry.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

** So, the best fic that covers this topic in an actual, realistic way, is A Life So Very Much Less Than Ordinary. Ginny has an affair with Scorpius Malfoy, and Harry sort of breaks down and has to be helped by Luna.

*** So I just finished the fic, and it was written fantastically. I just couldn't seem to get over the hurdle of Ginny not really having to fess up to the consequences of having an affair. Sure she was isolated, but having a 'happily-ever after' ending isn't really the realistic emotions that all of the reviews rave about.

Idk, I just felt like Ginny was incredibly selfish about how she was in an affair, and gave me a sick feeling when everything was swept under the rug because Harry fell in love. And all with that happening in like less than 6 months.
