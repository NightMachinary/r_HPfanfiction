** What a neat idea. It would be awesome to see something like this from the perspective of a character who's immune to changes to the time-line. Maybe a Luna-centered fic where Harry goes back in time and she's the only one who can seem him messing everything up.

I'm going to keep this idea in mind for the next time I feel like writing something.

*** linkffn(3248583) has Luna in a role like this. It's the "groundhog day" effect vs. time travel though.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

** I /really/ want to read a serious take on this idea. Maybe... Hermione trying to puzzle out why Harry is abruptly acting so weird. Or why Draco is suddenly so much nicer to her when he's not paying attention and very obviously only reverts to douche canoe mode when he seemingly abruptly remembers he was supposed to be one all along.

  AU. The best place to start is at the beginning, and Harry supposes it all began with the mysterious Professor H. J. Prewett. Years 1 through 7.

** I've had a similar idea in my head for a while, but wanted it to be done more subtly. Rather than having it be the focus of the story, instead there would just be hints that only the reader would have a chance of understanding, and the PoV character would remain ignorant. An Easter Egg of sorts. I like stories that have hidden secrets in the background, for readers who are careful. The kind of stuff that allows for theories like ASOIAF fans come up with.
