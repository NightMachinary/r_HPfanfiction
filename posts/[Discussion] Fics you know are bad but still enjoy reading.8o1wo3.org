Like you can tell that its poorly written, or filled with overdone tropes, or predictable. And yet you still enjoy reading them, either because they do something that you love reading about or that is unique or whatever.

For instance, I recently read Deprived linkffn(Deprived by Crimson Lord). Its tropey and filled with cliches, but somehow I still enjoyed Harry just not wanting anything to do with Dumbledore and his family. He's not looking for revenge or catharsis, he just wants them to leave him alone.

Let the battle begin.


** Linkffn(Paid in Blood by zaterra02) is my guilty pleasure. The writing is not good but there is just something about it that makes me enjoy it. Harry is over the top powerful and its ridiculous but still something I always come back to. I actually kind of enjoy the plot as well.

  After decades of an empty life and wars that claimed all he ever held dear, the greatest dark lord in living memory and his most loyal servant are finally ready to challenge fate and once again bring down their vengeance upon their enemies. AU, extended universe, Time-Travel, bashing and HAPHNE.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past) feels like this nowadays. It's very tropey (though it was early enough that it might have spawned some of those tropes) and the author really can't stand Snape/Malfoy (they're not even well-rounded villains, just flat evil), but I love seeing idealized versions of Ron/Hermione/Neville/Ginny/Luna.

*** To be honest, I can't help but love the idea of the six of them in this fic. They become such a team, and after everything is out in the open their dynamic becomes so entertaining to read.

They're like the spy team from Mission Impossible (take your pick they're pretty interchangeable, not the original tv show). This works pretty well too:

Harry = Ethan: He's the leader, always in ridiculous situations, confident in the face of danger. Tom Cruise is short and always running (again like Harry!) in his movies, and is generally acknowledged as capable and well known.

Ginny = Julia: Ginny's in sort of relationship with Harry, spends the early part ignorant of Harry's "job," but cottons on over time that something is up. He is always trying to keep her safe, and she thinks thats a waste of time and effort.

Ron = Luther: they meet due to the circumstances early in the story, bond due to mutual positions, and become steadfast friends who bond from conflict. Sticks by him consistently and has Harry's back in whatever he does, and defends him first.

Seriously, its like the the title is Harry Potter and the Impossible Mission.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

** Easily linkffn(Basilisk-Born). Filled with certain consistent horrible spelling/grammar (though I think the author is a non-native English speaker, so I give a bit of leeway here), manipulative GreaterGood!Dumbledore, creature ancestry, nobility, family magic that happens because you are born into the family, lazy magical theory and silly time travel. However, highly entertaining so I overlook all the other crap.

*** I can stomach a lot of stuff, including all the tropes you mentioned, but I can't abide just how long-winded the author is. He takes blathering to a whole other level. Information that could be conveyed with two sentences, he gives in two paragraphs and he does it constantly. Not only that, every few chapters he repeats Harry's diatribes from earlier chapters.

Not kidding, like 40% of this story is repetition in slightly different form. It would benefit hugely from some competent beta work.

** It has to be linkao3(Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven). It was my first experience with the tropes incorporated, but that's about all it was. Weasley and Dumbledore Bashing, 11 year-old politics, Pureblood Culture/Society, helpful goblins, you name it it's there.

The writing itself wasn't bad though, and the last task in the GoF there stood out to me.

** If you're a SSHG fan, it's got to be linkffn(When A Lioness Fights by Kayly Silverstorm)

Pros: Long! Badass Hermione. Harry grows up along the way. Ron is mostly immature but comes around a bit towards the end. Good, developing relationship between Snape and Hermione without unrealistic misunderstandings that are just thrown in for angst. Redeemed Draco.

Cons: Poor grammar and spelling at times, but English is not the author's first language. Wtf, "Hermione the Death Eater" does not make any sense (I skipped over this fic for years because of this, but I eventually gave in when I couldn't find anything else to read). Hermione is too overpowered, without any real basis for it. I'm sure there's more that I'm not thinking of right now.
