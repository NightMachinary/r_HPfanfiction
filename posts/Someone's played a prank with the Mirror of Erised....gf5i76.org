So that instead of showing /your/ desires, it shows the desires of a random person, or even animal, in the building. Harry, the first time he looks through it, sees himself as Quidditch Captain - but for the Hufflepuff Quidditch Team.

When he goes to show his friends, the results are even weirder - but what would they be?

Oliver finally cornered Harry. "Harry, our team is /too/ good. In order to actually showcase our good points to the recruiters, we'll have to train the other teams. We drew lots, you'll have to coach Hufflepuff."

Harry could smell the impending disaster coming, so he tried to avert it. "Really? You want me, the seeker to coach an opposing team to make /us/ look better? I don't even know the rules..."

"It's not that hard. They have books on it. Somewhere... I think..." Oliver wasn't having that.

Deciding to attack from another angle, Harry gives a silent apology to Mr. Weasley. "I'll have to ask Hermione about that. While you're here, acn you tell me how many points a /coughle/ gets you when it goes in the hoop doohickies... I'll have to ask Fred and George about tips on hitting the /buggers/... In fact, that's them right now. Later..."

Internally cringing at the horrified look on Oliver's face, Harry mentally patted himself on the back as he made his escape.

-

The Arthur Defense. It's like the Chewbacca defense, but for quidditch fanatics.

** "You know, what we really want most right now--"

"--is to be able to prank everyone who ever finds this artifact in the future."

The image shifted, their mirror-selves tracing out runes and symbols, wands moving with slow precision. With matching grins, the duo set about performing the most dramatic and overly complicated Artifactus Confundus to have been seen by Hogwarts in many a century.

And when finally, mission accomplished, they looked into the mirror again, they saw something so unimaginably horrifying that they promptly fled and never looked back.

Some desires should definitely remain private.
