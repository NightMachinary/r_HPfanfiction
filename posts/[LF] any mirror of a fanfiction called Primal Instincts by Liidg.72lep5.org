This is an older Bellamione fic that was posted to ffn but has since apparently been purged. It seems like the author wanted to transfer it to AO3 as per [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2838453/Gone86][their profile]] but the fic cannot be found there. The first chapter can still be found on [[https://web.archive.org/web/20151010072125/http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7992483/1/Primal-Instincts][the internet archive]] but following chapters were apparently never archived.
