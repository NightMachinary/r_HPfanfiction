No, not a Harry Potter/Stephen Chow's The God of Cookery crossover(which is a fantastic film, see it now!).

No, Harry revolutionizes magical cooking by combining potioneering elements like silver blades, stirring x times for y minutes, perfect chopping of each food, and so on(but not the more esoteric potion ingredients because no one wants bile in their food unless they believe that bear bile will make their pecker hard again).

His cookbook becomes so popular that he outsells every lockhart book combined.

Thoughts? Suggestions for recipes? I think if i do do the story it'll be that each chapter is an actual recipe with anecdotes from Harry as he created it.


** Valentine Recipe: Chocolate Cake with marmelade filling that can only be eaten if someone else is feeding it to you. Tastes better the more you love the other. Process of making it involves core ingredients of Amortentia.

** God, that sounds hilarious.

Maybe if you take inspiration and parody some of Dahl's candies in Willy Wonka, but in the form of baked goods?

Restorative stew with a little youth potion mixed in? Cheese that makes you charming?

Bacon wrapped in bacon that's wrapped in... You guessed it, bacon! This dish is inexplicably popular to magical food critics around the world.

*** I love the bacon wrap idea.

edit: in fact, at one time I did a weave of bacon, filled it with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and crumbled bacon, then rolled the woven bacon like a wrap. Though I saw your idea in my head more as pinwheels/rose buds of bacon.

I can see a few willy wonkaesque ideas. Perhaps he accidentally makes some sort of cream and accidentally stirs a hair in. When he finds it, he has an epiphany, looks at the various hair restoration potions then combines their stir elements into the making of cream tea becomes hair cream tea.

The restorative stew Idea I like too.

** If you want to go full on crack fic, have Harry's cooking literally end the war when he sends Voldemort and box of cookies or something.

The power the dark lord knows not is... baking?

*** Heh, I think post DH AU that diverges in tent scene. Harry is an independent curse-breaker and Dark Wizard hunter with a penchant for the culinary arts as much as the deadly arts.

**** Fair enough, just make sure to have a really punny title.

Like, 'Sugar, Spice, and Everything Nice' or something.

  *The reports of the Doom level of this cookbook are greatly exaggerated! Harry Potter wrote a book. It's not what anyone expected. He has revolutionized cooking by combining potioneering and cooking by utilizing the skills of a potioneer in a kitchen.

** Maybe an optimized post-Dementor encounter drink? Like it contains Chocolate, some regeneration potion and a touch of Firewhiskey to properly warm you up. Then it becomes the official Ministry regulation to feed the Aurors the post-Dementor potion and Harry makes boatloads of money off it.
