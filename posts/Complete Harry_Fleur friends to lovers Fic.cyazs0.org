:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
About 8 years or so ago I read a fic and have been unable to find it again. I am not even sure if it is multi-chaptered or just one long oneshot. I know it is completed. In the story, which follows canon, Harry and Fleur become best friends. It is very realistic and not forced. It is about Harry with his unwanted fame and Fleur with her getting stares from her Veela traits and then relating to each other. Fleur does get with Bill and is even engaged to him. I know that Harry has unrequited feelings for her but is resigned to her being happy. However, post war Fleur ends up with Harry. I am not sure if she broke off the engagement with Bill or they had been married at that point. I think it was a mutual separation and no infidelity. Anyway, it was very sweet. I don't even remember where I read it. It could have been Livejournal, [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]], or even Archive of Our Own. I don't remember it being overly fluffy/cheesy but my opinion sometimes changes after a reread LOL.


** I think it might be Another Chance by durararaaa on FFN. It does kinda match the situations. It's a one shot fic.

  At some point of our lives we look back and wonder; 'What if I had done something differently back then? How much better would my life have been' That's all we can do at this point right? Sometimes though...sometimes we get a second chance to accomplish that one thing we always wanted to. If we don't recognize those moments, we don't deserve happiness anyway.
