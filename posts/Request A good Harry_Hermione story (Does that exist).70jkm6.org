So here's the thing, I hate Harry/Hermione as a pairing. I see them as nothing more then (unrelated) brother/sister. But, I want to change that.

When I first got into fanfiction years ago I tried reading some Harry/Hermione but it was just so unbelievable that I just couldn't.

I want, no NEED! The characters to be as in character as possible for the pairing to work.

So no Harry is extremely smart, no Harry is extremely powerful. No stories where Hermione suddenly cares about how she looks, I want her and Harry to believable here.

I want Ron to still be their friend, one other thing that turns me away from Harry/Hermione stories is where Ron is so jealous that he stops being their friend. And while Ron does get jealous is believable, I can't see him stop being their friend just because they are together.

Well written characters that are believable to canon, not fanon. No Ginny being angry at Hermione, or if she is then her anger at her doesn't last long. Ginny might like Harry but I can't see her hating Hermione over Harry and Hermione starting a relationship.

Sorry for the long post, but I just want the most believable Harry/Hermione stories that you guys can think of that make sense with their character and canon as we know it without putting the Weasley's or Dumbledore in a bad light.

They can get together before the war or after the war, I don't really care either way.

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if not then a bunch of chapters is fine.


** Check out *Come Undone* linkffn(12393868) It's a great postwar story about Hermione trying to get through a sullen Harry who apparently has left the wizarding world behind.

*The Sea King* linkffn(7502511) is a fantastic one shot. Hermione looks for Harry 19 years after the war.

Also try stories from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/636397/lorien829][lorien829]], especially *Resistance*, *Bridges* and *Shadow Walks* and it's companion *Shadow Walker*

None of these have any sort of bashing.

  After the war, Harry becomes sullen and distant & Hermione is the only one who can seem to get through to him. Then he gets a mysterious new job and disappears for over a year. Hermione refuses to accept he's gone for good and when he turns up again she manages to follow him, only to be pulled into the new and dangerous life that he now leads.

** The best place to start is probably a fic that still acknowledges the canon ending in some way such as linkffn(Time as the Fire by Oddment Tweak) or linkffn(Unlike a Sister by MADharmony). Both are very good in my opinion.

You might also like fics that aren't really H/Hr but sort of lean that way such as linkffn(Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm) or linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks by Paimpont). Again, both are just really good fics.

Other people have linked some of lorien829's works which are good. I like linkffn(Senses by lorien829) but it does some Weasley bashing. Stanrick also writes some interesting H/Hr like linkffn(Favorite Things by Stanrick).

  So no Harry is extremely smart, no Harry is extremely powerful.
#+end_quote

Blindness definitely fails to deliver on those two points. Harry is so smart that he and Hermione publish magical theory papers under a pen-name. Its still sweet, their partnership, but it is sometimes riddled by tropes following a powerful and intelligent Harry.

Also, and this is more of a personal issue with this fic, [[/spoiler][his blindness quickly seizes to be a handicap. Instead of, for example, Daredevil who still can't read letters, see color,... Harry eventually gets all those things removed from his handicap list. It had great potential in its character design early on (blind Harry, traumatized Hermione), but the author seemed to have decided mid-writing that having a blind protagonist is too much of a hassle.]]

***** Huh. Thank you for the warning, I might not end up reading it. (No offense, I just don't care for Super Smart Harry that rivals Hermione, or Super Powerful Harry that rivals Dumbledore)

**** If I remember correctly it pounces heavily onto the trope of the uber-supportive Grangers. Its still pretty good, I'd say, but it has some flaws (that probably weren't flaws a decade ago - look when this was written).

** linkffn(With Malice Aforethought) is a really well written fic that starts off with Ron/Hermione and (iirc) Harry/Ginny. I think Ginny might have been a bit of a shithead but I definitely remember thinking the writing was as close to canon that i'd seen in a long time.

** Potato19 in FF.net has some really fluffy, really good H/Hr stories. It does fall into the trap of overly perfecting the characters at times, I feel, but overall they feel a lot like how they did in the books.

** The only two I can say that I've truly enjoyed are Vox Corporis, which someone has already mentioned, and [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185][Forever Knight]].

Admittedly, it's something you could easily dismiss out of hand as it's a vampire fic (though, not the twilight kind), and Harry and Hermione's relationship starts immediately and without any rigorous justification. However, the story is phenomenal and the characterizations are generally on point; there's certainly no Weasley bashing. I also quite liked the way Snape was written, especially considering that the fic was published before the release of DH.
