The title says it all.

Oh, and thanks to anyone who suggests anything.


** I think the Skitterleap /sort of/ counts: muggle-wizard awareness, a very powerful central goverment with a mysterious leadership, strong military capabilities, etc. linkffn(The Skitterleap).

Most of this is in the background though (which is the way world-building should be when done well).

  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

There's this one, Tom Riddle basically conquered the world, conducted ethnic cleansing on muggles on a truly breathtaking scale, and assigned all land to various wizarding families as fiefs. For example Sirius Black got a large chunk of what used to be London, which by the time of this fic contains a few hundred thousand muggles.

Muggles are basically serfs, wizards lords, all in the name of preventing unchecked global warming XD.

*** Oh drat, someone already beat me to having Riddle gain power because Muggles plug their ears instead of addressing climate change. xD

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.
