** I recall reading a Harry Potter x Lord of the Rings crossover which had a few chapters regarding Sirius, Lupin, Dumbledore, and the others tending to Harry while his conscience or soul or whatever is in Middle-Earth.

But for a Harry Potter whose body is comatose while said soul is in alternate reality? I haven't read before. That'd be interesting.

  Fifth year, Harry's been banished into a painting by the despicable Umbridge. Now he has to find a way back home, and the only way he can do that, is by finding the scattered jewels of the Wizard's Crown. Can his new-found friends help him, or will being with them end his life and chances of ever getting home? Based more on the LOTR movies than the LOTR books.
