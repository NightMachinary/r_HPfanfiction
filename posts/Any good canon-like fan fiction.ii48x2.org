Do some of you have some recommendation for some good canon-like fan fiction? So no ships or big differences from the books maybe something that even fits in the timeline of the books.


** All the stories by Northumbrian (on fan fiction) compile themselves into a big universe set mostly between the end of Deathly Hallows and the epilogue. My favorite is Strangers at Darkeshaugh. It explores the Potter family from a muggle point of you. All the major pairing are the same and the story follows canon, but there is a very important family of muggle ocs which might put some people off. linkffn(Strangers at Darkeshaugh )

** No one has mentioned Floreatcastellum yet? I don't have any particular recommendations, OP, but look through her [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/FloreatCastellum/pseuds/FloreatCastellum&ved=2ahUKEwici5eupr7rAhVFgRoKHUaKCOcQFjAAegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw1Luvm3NWeJ3gidg0PFbutp][account]] , which is full of stories that are canon-compliant, with beautiful writing. I dare say all of them are good.

I know I said I have no particular recommendations but I really love linkffn(The Moon and the Sea by FloreatCastellum). It's short, but beautifully written and heartbreaking. I also love the Colour of Everything. Two of her most popular works are the Theia Higglesworth series and Not From Others.

** It gets super mixed reviews but "Dumbledores Army and the Year of Darkness" by thanfiction is pretty good. Its in the archives (I don't have a link handy right at the moment). It's dark (and a little cheesy to be fair at some points but the general story I think makes up for it) and follows Neville and co. from the DA during DH at Hogwarts. Its canon compliant with the small amount we know happened from the books since the trio weren't there at the time with canon pairings (Neville and Hannah!!!).

**** Yeah the girl characters can be a bit frustrating but I kind of ignore it and focus more on the other stuff, like how they prepped for the Final Battle (which is really what I enjoy the most about that fic).

****** Yeah one death in particular stands out as being especially cheesy (gonna stick with my original descriptor there). Out of curiosity, do you have any better suggestions for a canon compliant fic? I tend to stick to my OTP ship, but wouldn't mind some suggestions like the OP if you have any; I'm working on branching out a bit more. Dumbledores Army and the Year of Darkness just happens to be the only one I've read of that type so without anything to compare it to, I thought it was pretty good.

******** Yeah, I'm a dramione girl myself which I why I sort of like fics that are based on other characters entirely to meet that canon compliance. (Also preparing for downvotes) I'll look into those though, thanks! ðŸ™‚

*** Most of the reviews against it that I've seen seem to be primarily directed at the quality of the author as a person, rather than the quality of the story itself.

**** Yes thats true... I've seen some pretty scathing reviews against the story as well but I personally thought it was well done and I think their feelings about the author effected how the felt about the story.
