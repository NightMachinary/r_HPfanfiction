I'm looking for a fanfiction where Hermione disobey Dumbledore and sends Harry letters during the summer before 5th year. I would like it to be a Harmony pairing but I take whatever I can get


** My fic is pretty close...the only difference being that she goes to visit harry instead of sending letters. linkffn(13577616)

  The summer after Harry's fourth year would have been much better if just one person in his life had disregarded Professor Dumbledore's instructions to ignore him. And if that person was Hermione Granger? It would have been much, much better.

** Dumbledore didn't ask them to stop writing to Harry, but asked them NOT to talk about the Order and Voldemort. Fanon blew that part way out of proportion and escalated into 'Dumbledore not allowing Ron and Hermione to write to Harry at all'.

Even then, canon Harry was so pissed that he ordered Hedwig to peck on their hands.

--------------

Out of many Harmony fics that have Hermione just doing that, two particular ones stand out and do not follow the usual Dumbledore bashing pattern:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11102515/1/Uncle-Quentin-s-Spy][Uncle Quentin's Spy]]: Hermione at first obeyed Dumbledore's order, but soon receives some serious help. They would contact Harry directly. Dumbledore starts out a little slow and hesitantly, but eventually becomes really awesome.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5265558/1/What-If-An-Alternative-to-Order-Of-The-Phoenix][What If? ... An Alternative to Order Of The Phoenix]]: Harry and Hermione stayed in touch throughout that summer. So after the dementor, they, Sirius, and the Grangers all fled Britain. Dumbledore has no choice but to step up his own game, and has done rather well.

**** Honestly, I haven't read Harry/Hermione orientated stories for years (as in like over 3/4ths of a decade) because of how bad they can be. Most rely on Weasley and Dumbledore bashing to push the fic through. I'm sure some of the Harmonians on here could point you to some good fics that have this pairing but aren't shit, though. Maybe try the Harmony subreddit?

** There are plenty of Harmony stories, where she finds out glorious secret (which apparently missed JKR completely), that Muggles have telephones, which no pureblood wizard knows about. Thus for example:

- “Eventful Summer” by Harry50 linkffn(13318258) ... premise is not bad, but eventually it turns out to be completely plot-free and author compensated with smut

- “Who Will Fill a Coward's Grave?” by RobSt linkffn(12117770) ... most stereotypic template-based Harmony possible

---- (added later)

(When I said the most stereotypical Harmony story, sorry, I misspoke, “No Thanks” by old-crow linkffn(2275101) and “Banking on Her” by RobSt linkffn(7392700) are the ones, but neither of them starts with the phone call).

On the other hand, phone call (if not in the start of the story) shows up rather important in “Testing Defenses” by canoncansodoff linkffn(3958679) (certainly not PG-13).

  "Dumbledore said that we shouldn't write to you so that the owls would not give out your address. I argued that you needed your friends as much as you needed the security, but he dismissed my words. Then I thought that neither he nor the enemy would be able to trace phone calls."
