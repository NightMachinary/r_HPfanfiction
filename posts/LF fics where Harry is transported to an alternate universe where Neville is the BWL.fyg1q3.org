I've read one or two of these (I read C'est La Vie a few days ago) and they've been great. So I'm looking for any. Not really fussed with pairing if they're well written, just no Death Eaters or Dark!Harry. Slash is fine too.


** One of my favorite stories is linkffn(Stages of Hope kayly silverstorm)

Now while it is exactly what you asked for it's likely not exactly what you hoped for. I still believe you'll like it.

I messed up the link so here's one straight to it.

**** How about linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon)?

Same concept. Exactly but not exactly.

******* It is a controversial one, however - I've heard it has not aged well.

There's a long review of it [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bfx8ar/fic_review_a_black_comedy_by_nonjon_the_au_in/][here]] that was enough to convince me it wouldn't be to my taste.

******** Great review. I was surprise reading the fic. It kept being recommended on here as a hilarious classic, so I gave it a try. Only to see that most of the jokes punch down. It isn't all bad since the story is pretty good, but the whole comedy aspect of it is a huge turn off.

********* Yeah, I was very glad to come across it - [[/u/draquia]] is a great reviewer, and has definitely helped me to choose to read or avoid some fics with their reviews. In this case, comedy is heavily taste dependent, so knowing in advance that it's a style I don't like was nice from saving me some frustrating reading.

********** I always felt like it was trying to be a satire or crack fic, and the writer mistook satire for dick jokes. His other work was much better. It's just unfortunate that the subplot of them being thieves and working with intricate magic got buried by so much shit. I would love a good heist Harry Potter story

***** I wish this was good. The writing itself is pretty average, nothing to complain about, and it had a neat hook. I dropped it after a bunch of little plots were thrown out there and then never spoken of again. Also, along the way, there were some really iffy â€˜jokes' that boil down to just being bigotry, really. You know, sexism and suchlike. It's really overt too.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** Not exactly what you're asking for, because it's just an AU (that is, no one is transported to the universe), but linkffn(By the Divining Light by enembee) and linkffn(Conlaodh's Song by enembee) take place in a universe in which Neville is the BWL/Chosen One, but Harry is a much more powerful wizard (and indeed, is directly mentored by Dumbledore / Dumbledore's protege.) They're very good, though the promised third part of the story was never written.

  Magic is an eco-system, and the magical world has been culling magical people and creatures for generations. It has finally gone too far - and the collective consequences are finally being felt. When magic starts disappearing, crumbling quietly in post-war Britain, it causes a cascade effect across the wizarding world. Not a single magical child has been born in almost a decade.Twenty-three-year-old Harry Potter discovers this when the wards of Diagon Alley literally come crashing down on top of him. So ends the life of the Boy-Who-Lived. Yet again, he returns to the station between life and death.With a new chance in a new world, Harry - now eleven-year-old Harry Fleamont - is given a chance to figure out how to save his dying world. In a new world that seems much more perfect in every sense of the word, Harry is faced with a growing threat from a much more dangerous Voldemort, and the reality that jumping universes just makes vulnerable and poor wizards who just want to eat a regular meal and afford to buy a pair of Merlin-damned socks.
