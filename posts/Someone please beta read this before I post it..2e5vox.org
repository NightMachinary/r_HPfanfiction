You see, I've been creating this FF for a few weeks maybe, and I finally finished a first chapter. But I don't know if it's good enough, so I thought I should show the first chapter and get a few results for it. I also don't have an idea for a title. The story is about Harry repeating his seventh year thinking of having a normal year after what happened in his last year, then he suddenly faces a werewolf inside Hogwarts. He doesn't know who it is but he keeps on searching for the one with the curse.

Some of the things I wrote might be changed, for example I don't know if there even IS a cinnamon roll in the plump witch's trolley, so don't be too harsh with me.

"Medallions and Brandy bottles"

Harry sat inside his usual train compartment a few minutes after he had boarded the train. He wondered where was Ron or Hermione, his two best friends that were almost nowhere to be seen. He had tried to find them on the platform but was unsuccessful.

Harry was deep in thought when suddenly the door slid open slightly surprising him. He turned around and found Neville and Luna standing at the door with their luggage. Luna smiled at him. "Hi, Harry. May we sit with you here?" asked Luna nicely. Harry smiled back at her.

"Sure. Sit down, guys," Luna sat down first on the left side of the compartment while Neville sat down next to Harry. "How'd summer go for the both of you?" asked Harry, while he helped Neville put their luggage on a shelf above them with some difficulty.

"My father and I went to Italy to visit my aunt. Her husband was Italian and is quite generous, you know. He kept insisting that we should keep eating,‚Äù said Luna. "What else happened?" Neville asked, sitting back down next to Harry.

"Well, there was this one occasion where a rat bit my dad in the ear while he was sleeping. I think it mistook his ear for cheese. Dad was just happy it didn't bite off a part of his ear," Harry and Neville tried to stifle their laughter, and thankfully they were able to pass it off as a cough. "Then we went to this really large stadium," Luna spread her arms to show how big she meant. "And we watched wizards riding hippogripph's around in circles trying to overtake each other."

Harry and Neville both looked surprised and wide eyed. "They were racing on hippogriffs? You're not joking right?" Harry asked, suddenly becoming interested in Luna's story. Luna nodded. "Hagrid would surely love to see a hippogriff race," remarked Neville, while Harry nodded in approval.

"Could you describe to me what do the hippogriffs there look like?" asked Harry curiously. "Sure. I would love to," replied Luna.

"They're much bigger and they have larger wings then the one Hagrid owns. Their feathers are in different dazzling colors; maroon, cyan, sky-blue and gold. The colors are only painted on them, though," Harry had begun to daydream, imagining himself riding a maroon colored hippogriff and flying into the sunset above the sea while racing against several other racers. He hadn't noticed that Luna had already finished and finally stopped daydreaming.

"How about you, Neville?" Harry asked.

"We went to this small island in Asia, the Philippines. The wizards there are quite different from what you'd see here. They were more weird than magical, and once you'd see them you'd think Professor Trelawney's less weird," Neville said.

"How different are they from us?" Harry asked.

"Well, they don't use wands. They use staffs, and they do staff-less magic quite well. I reckon they're even better potioneers," replied Neville. He suddenly stood up and took his bag from the shelf and opened it. Neville began rummaging through his clothes and other stuff while Luna and Harry watched with anticipation. Finally after some time, Neville took out two bottles that looked like used brandy bottles.

Neville passed one over to Harry and Luna, who looked at the bottle that had a mixture of herbs and had a green thick water in it. "What's this?" asked Harry, slightly shaking the bottle.

"The bloke that sold me that told me this was an antidote for every kind of curse you could think of. I asked him how do I use it. He told me to just throw the whole bottle at the mythical being and they'll slowly transform back into a human. The best part is, it'll remove the curse completely," Neville said proudly.

"Mighty useful, if it does work," said Harry skeptically. "Anything else apart from this potion?" Neville wondered for a minute, and then he began rummaging through his bag once more and pulled out a triangle shaped medallion which reminded Harry of the Deathly Hallows sign.

"The vendor said it can bring luck to the wearer in almost every situation," replied Neville. "It was rather expensive though at fifteen Galleons, but I'm still glad that my grandmother bought me one. Said it'll help me in my classes,"

"Does it work?" Harry asked. Neville simply smiled and put on the bronze colored medallion, then he got off his seat and looked under the seat where Luna was sitting. He reached for something and then sat back down on his chair with a smile on his face. "What did you find?" Harry asked curiously. Neville put out his hand and showed Harry three shiny Galleons.

"That's brilliant!" Harry exclaimed.

"It is, isn't it?" Neville said, removing the medallion from his neck and placing it back into his bag. Harry suddenly remembered the bottle he was holding in his hands; he gave it back to Neville but he declined. "Keep it. My grandmother's got a lot of it back at our house."

Harry thanked him, although he didn't really know what he could do with an antidote. He raised the bottle again and looked at the herbs inside the bottle; he couldn't recognize any of the herbs inside the bottle. 'Maybe there were more rare and different herbs in the Philippines than in London?' Harry thought.

"Is throwing the bottle the only way you could use it?" Harry asked. Neville sat back down after he had placed his bag back in the shelf. "Well, not really. You can drink it, but if you're not the one with the curse, the only way is to have someone else throw it."

Harry nodded and put it inside his bag, and then he looked out the window and saw the sun setting. He again wondered where Hermione and Ron were. He turned back and asked both of them if they had seen either Ron or Hermione. Unfortunately, they both didn't know. Harry sighed and stared back at the moving scene in front of him.

At one o' clock, the plump witch with the food cart arrived at the compartment door. "Anything from the trolley, dears?" The plump witch asked, looking at the three of them.

"I'd like some licorice wands and a Chocolate Frog, please," said Neville at once. The plump witch gathered what he had requested and passed it over to him. Neville quickly opened ate his Chocolate Frog and checked who was on the free collectable card. Neville smiled and then showed it to Harry.

"Look's like you're more famous than you already are, Harry," The card had Harry's face on it, wearing a pair of Hogwarts robes. Harry smiled but inside he felt quite embarassed; he wasn't the type of person who liked having his face on card such as the one he was holding. He gave it back to Neville who placed it inside his pockets.

Luna stood up and looked at the trolley's contents and after deciding what she wanted, she said. "I'll have two cinnamon rolls, please," The witch took two cinnamon rolls, placed it in a plastic bag and gave it to Luna.

"What about you dear?" The plump witch asked. Harry looked away from the window and looked to the plump witch, eagerly waiting. "I'll have two Cauldron Cakes and a bar of chocolate, please," The witch took two Cauldron Cakes and a long bar of chocolate and gave it to Harry, who began eating the chocolate.

"How about you, Harry?" Luna asked. Harry looked up and looked at her. "You never told us your summer experience." "Oh, yeah," Harry said, quickly putting his chocolate bar in his pocket. Neville stopped eating his licorice wands and listened. "Well, I've been living in my godfather's house for the whole summer. It was quite sad in there, there's no one to talk to," Harry said. "Well, if you can count the talking paintings. But if you like getting shouted at, that is. And that's it, basically. All I did was stay inside that house, and I think I now know how Sirius felt inside that house."

"Why didn't you just sleep someplace else?" Neville asked.

"Oh, I did sleep someplace else," Harry said, nodding. "But when I came back a week later, I found Mundungus Fletcher nicking Sirius' stuff. I got him out of my house and took back everything he had on him."

"That git really has the nerve to stick his nose into other peoples stuff," Neville said. Harry nodded. Not long after they had finished talking, the door slid open and Hermione, Ron and Ginny came in looking exhausted while they hauled their bags behind them. Harry, of course, was happy to see them.

"Where've you two been? I've been looking everywhere for you," Harry said, standing up to embrace both Hermione then Ron. He sat back down with Hermione and Ron on both side while Neville sat next to Luna and Ginny.

"We've got too many first years this year," Hermione said, after she had finished placing her bag on the shelves. "Every one of them knows you, me and Ron. We couldn't move unless we promise to tell you to have you give them autographs,"

"Yeah mate, it's like a mad house out there. You couldn't move an inch without stepping on someones foot," Ron said, while he wiped the sweat off his brow. "Well, at least they can't follow us here," Harry said.

Ron suddenly looked up. "Did the witch with the trolley pass already?" Ron asked. "I'm starving." Harry nodded. Ron groaned. Harry took his took two Cauldron Cakes and presented them to Hermione and Ron. "Here, take it. I'm not hungry anyway," Harry said, holding the pastry in his hands.

Ron looked absolutely delighted; he took the pastry from Harry's hands and took a bite. "Thanks Harry. I owe you one," Ron said. Hermione, however, didn't take the pastry from Harry's hand. "Why didn't you take yours, Hermione?" Harry asked.

"It's not mine to take, Harry. I'm alright, I'll just eat when we get to Hogwarts," Hermione said. Harry didn't accept her reaction and placed the pastry in her hands. "I'm not taking no for an answer, Hermione, and we're still a few hours away from Hogwarts," Harry said. "Now eat it, please."

Hermione looked at the pastry then looked back at Harry; she smiled at him. "Thanks." Hermione said, as she took a bite out of the pastry.

Three hours later, the train began to stop. Harry looked out the window and saw the station at Hogwarts slowing coming closer and closer. He stood up and took his robe from his bag. After he put on his robe, he picked up his bag and prepared to leave. While he was inside, he could hear the recognizable loud voice of Hagrid calling on the first years.

"Firs' years this way! Form a line behind me!" Hagrid's loud voice said. The other passengers in the train began to leave; Harry and the others stood up and went through the door one by one. They slowly walked in a cramped space of the train, while they tried to avoid stepping on the robes of one another.

Finally, they got off the train and went on the little boats that would magically row them to Hogwarts castle. Harry noticed that most of the damage it sustained during the Second War had been repaired, not a hole in the wall nor a stone missing. They got off the boats and walked through the meadow to walk to the large wooden gates, where it slowly opened. Behind the door was Filch looking the same as he usually was, he held a lamp in his hands and motioned the first years to follow him to their seats.

While Harry was walking to the Great Hall, Hagrid caught up with him looking rather excited like a little child waiting for Christmas. "Harry, would you, Hermione and Ron like ter go and visit me in me Hut tomorrow afternoon? I've got somethin' exciting to show yeh," Hagrid said, sounding extremely excited.

"Sure thing, Hagrid," Harry replied, although he didn't know what was he going to do at Hagrid's hut. "Great!" Hagrid boomed, surprising Hermione and Ron, who were behind Harry. "I'll see yeh all tomorrow afternoon." He went off speed walking into the Great Hall.

"What's he going to show to us?" Ron asked. Harry just shrugged and kept walking towards the Great Hall. END OF CHAPTER.


** This looks a little rough. Sort of too many issues to work with here in any detail. Hold off posting until you take another pass through it. That'll improve things immensely.

I suggest re-reading while looking specifically for correct punctuation around the end of dialog, sentence structure and phrasing issues, and paragraph format.

Compare your writing to the style of a book you like. Look at them side-by-side. See if you can spot the rough patches. I can point out some things I usually look for in my own work.

--------------

Try to find smooth, natural-sounding sentence structures. Avoid hyperbole, redundancy, and inaccurate statements. Say the lines out loud (really!) while editing and proofreading.

For example, take this first paragraph:

#+begin_quote
  Harry sat inside his usual train compartment a few minutes after he had boarded the train. He wondered where was Ron or Hermione, his two best friends that were almost nowhere to be seen. He had tried to find them on the platform but was unsuccessful.
#+end_quote

Look to focus on the most important actions and context. Place those first in the sentences, and the most important sentences first in the paragraph. Use mostly descriptive, active verb structures. Avoid repeating or reiterating the same information over and over again if at all possible.

My final paragraph might look something like this (major additions *bold*):

#+begin_quote
  A few minutes after *boarding*, Harry sat *alone* inside his usual train compartment. He wondered *where his* two best friends *were*. He had tried to find Ron and Hermione on the platform with *no success*.
#+end_quote

Or the more dynamic:

#+begin_quote
  A few minutes after *boarding*, Harry sat *alone* inside his usual train compartment, *wondering where his* two best friends *were*...
#+end_quote

--------------

One popular approach to paragraphs is, every time the speaker changes, someone else takes an action that changes focus, or an action or piece of dialog represents a large advance in time, make a new paragraph. The modern approach is more paragraphs rather than fewer.

A quick example from the end:

#+begin_quote
  "Sure thing, Hagrid," Harry replied, although he didn't know what was he going to do at Hagrid's hut. "Great!" Hagrid boomed, surprising Hermione and Ron, who were behind Harry. "I'll see yeh all tomorrow afternoon." He went off speed walking into the Great Hall.
#+end_quote

to

#+begin_quote
  "Sure thing, Hagrid," Harry replied, although he didn't know what +was he+ *he was* going to do at Hagrid's hut.

  "Great!" Hagrid boomed, surprising Hermione and Ron, who were behind Harry. "I'll see yeh all tomorrow afternoon." He went off speed walking *(phrasing?)* into the Great Hall.
#+end_quote

--------------

I hope that helps. Keep writing. It doesn't really get much easier, in my experience, but confidence and overall skill levels improve steadily with practice. As does how much fun it is to write. Make sure to read and re-read your own work until it looks perfect to you. That's what really matters.

** [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] has done a nice job of pointing out ways to improve. I'd strongly urge you to take his (?) "read it out loud" advice to heart, particularly with dialogue.

I'd add that as you reread you should try to make sure that everything you write, every sentence, description, bit of dialogue, /everything/ is accomplishing something for your story--preferably multiple somethings at once (e.g., a spot of dialogue that advances the plot, fleshes out a character, and hints at something important to come). Beginning writers are often urged, "Show, don't tell," but the corollary is that not everything needs to be shown. If something mundane can be safely summarized or omitted, then showing less is better.

Case in point:

#+begin_quote
  Luna stood up and looked at the trolley's contents and after deciding what she wanted, she said. "I'll have two cinnamon rolls, please," The witch took two cinnamon rolls, placed it in a plastic bag and gave it to Luna.
#+end_quote

This seems unnecessarily cumbersome. Do your readers really need to know that Luna stood? That her standing went 'up' as opposed to sideways? Is her looking at the trolley important? Do we need to know about the plastic bag and that it was handed to Luna? (Incidentally, you use 'it' to refer to two rolls, so there's a wrong pronoun.)

Readers subconsciously trust that what they're being told in a story is important, otherwise you, the author, wouldn't have chosen to put it there. Give them too much chaff, too many irrelevant details, and it will break this trust. This is particularly crucial in the opening paragraph, when you need to hook your reader.

Writing is hard, but take heart--with practice and attention to detail, you can improve dramatically. Some of the most celebrated fanfiction writers out there (jbern comes to mind) wrote some pretty dodgy prose when they were starting out.
