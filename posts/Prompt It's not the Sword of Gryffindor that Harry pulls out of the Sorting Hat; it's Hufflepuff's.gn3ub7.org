"No, my boy, you're not like Voldemort. Take a look at that fine sword." Dumbledore said, though his characteristic twinkle was marred by a slight look of confusion. Harry did so, and noticed for the first time the name inscribed on the blade of the amber encrusted sword.

"Helga Hufflepuff"


** Why wouldn't it be the Spear of Hufflepuff?

**** A spear is a symbol of unity, cohesion and society. It's most effective in groups and formations. Headcannon is that Hufflepuffs are the pillar of wizarding society. The wizarding world is a society of me's and I's so they decide to make the less selfish decisions. Everyone looks down on them, but they are the most group orientated.

** I always headcanon Helga as a badass Viking shieldmaiden that could mop the floor with Godric if she wanted to. I love fics/prompts with a more martial take of her.

** “Hat...you're saying there's a Spear of Hufflepuff? Then why the bloody hell did you give me a sword? Maybe I wouldn't have gotten stabbed if it was a spear.”

“Well you're a lazy Gryffindor aren't you? Maybe if you were more hard working I would've given you the Spear. Besides, it was for your own personal growth, and plot purposes.”
