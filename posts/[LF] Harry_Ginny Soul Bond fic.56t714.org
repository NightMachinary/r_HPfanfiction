I'm looking for a specific Harry/Ginny Soul Bond fic.

In it was where the two were soul bonded, and they had worked at one stage to make a Philosophers stone under the guidance of Flamel. Molly was killed by Voldemort when he Kidnapped the baby of Harry & Ginny. Their baby was also one of Tommy boys Horcruxes. Part of the bond meant that one of Harrys eyes was the same colour as Ginny's and vice versa


** Sounds like linkffn(5435295) because of the Molly bit. Not sure about the others, though, been a while since I've read it.
