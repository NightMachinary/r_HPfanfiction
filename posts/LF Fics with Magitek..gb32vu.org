  "Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognising it. On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation."
#+end_quote

Even canon kind of takes the piss out of Muggles in ridiculous ways. Kind of stupid really. One, it implies they have their wand on them or are well versed in wandless magic, two it implies they know the spell, and three it implies it wasn't children that were caught. A child untrained in that spell would be burned alive, rather than some kind of weird fetish thing that the wizards of the time had.

You get fics which glorify Muggles as being way above Wizards (If it was a Stargate Crossover it'd make sense, given that with Asgard tech, they ARE way above Wizards as they reach levels of matter fabrication) and you get fics that are just Muggle bashing "Nukes won't affect us, we have shields" forgetting that even if they had the shields, Wizards aren't immune to the radiation if they ever slightly step out of the shields, and shields (in canon at least) aren't permanent.

I want to see a fic with balance. A Protego can stop a Shield, but Wizards are still careful because a bullet you can't see coming or in an area you aren't shielding can still kill you. Where each side has its own ups and downs, so someone (Ideally Harry, i hate OC Main characters) decides to go for the Magitek option and combines the two.


** So, first things first: Wizards don't have technology, by definition.

#+begin_quote
  From Google (Oxford), technology is:

  #+begin_quote
    the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry.

    machinery and equipment developed from the application of scientific knowledge.

    the branch of knowledge dealing with engineering or applied sciences.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Also, if magic is supposed to be superior, then why would wizards make Muggle technology viable in a Wizarding environment? If Wizards can modify Muggle technology that can be used for them, then by that same logic, technology can/will be made that can be used against them. Unless you're going the AU route, in which case you can remove all "magical technology" (trains, buses, cars, cameras, wireless, gramophone, etc) from the HP setting entirely.

Yeah...this middle-of-the-road view isn't going to fly with either side (though I do agree with you). The wizard-wankers that say 'Muggles suck' forget that the wizarding world uses many Muggle inventions (car, bus, train, radio, etc), they're benefitting off of the SoS far more than Muggles are, and that even canon acknowledged if wizardkind didn't marry Muggles, they would have died out. The Muggle-wankers forget that wizards have too many tricks up their robes (Veritaserum, Polyjuice, Obliviate, etc) to really predict, and could make you question everything about your life and experiences.

*** Basically expanding on stuff like the Knight Bus, the Train, etc. Where Wizards (or a Wizard) decides to basically do the same thing but with modern tech as a minimum would be awesome, and going full Final Fantasy 6 or even crazier and going full Nanoha. Reinforce/Will of the Book of Darkness from Nanoha is pretty much a Magical AI supercomputer in awesome cute girl form.

Even by standard logic, Guns fire Faster than Spells, but in terms of killing you CAN survive a Bullet but not an Avada Kedavra (unless you're Harry) so what if you made a Gun that fired Avada Kedavras. Harry isn't exactly a Jedi that could dodge bullet speed spells, especially the fastest bullets which are slightly over Mach 4, or even AK47 level of Mach 2. Imagine if you made a Gun that could fire a loaded spell at full auto.
