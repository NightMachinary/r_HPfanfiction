Is there any scenes in the books that show case his power better than this very scene. I mean you've got to understand that he did this casually. He casually created hundreds of sleeping bags, again CASUALLY created HUNDREDS of sleeping bags. Seriously, how OP is that.

Similarly, he could instruct House-Elves to make the sleeping bags beforehand, and bring them all in at his command.

If he were that powerful, conjuring so many real objects at once, the question begs why he hasn't used any of that skill in combat (eg DoM Battle).

*** So currently Dumbledore is powerful enough to create hundreds of sleeping bags out of nothing, can beat Voldemort who used the dark arts, and also rituals to strengthen himself(I think, fanon or canon?). He beat Gellart who was using the Elder Wand, a wand famous for being unbeatable. Don't forget that the Dark Arts are naturally stronger since their designed to kill people.

Why did he die again. There is no way that Dumbledore shouldn't have noticed, and resisted the curse. Again the plot comes out the strongest.

a) he's been looking for that ring all his life, and he can't have been thinking clearly. (Imagine finding something that you've dreamed of for years and have thought impossible..)

b) who knows what he faced to reach that point. Think mind-potion in the cave. That was one Dumbledore was willing to bring a /sixth year/ on... I'm fairly certain the shack would have been a hundred times worse.

******* Again I gotta call bull. Dumbledore while he may have been vulnerable, did not get to his age through merit alone. He is quite intelligent, and wise. Someone of that age, wisdom, and power should not have fallen too such a curse. Even with the knowledge of how he's been looking for it his whole life, he was still in a place that Voldemort trapped holding what he believed to be a Hocrux. The impression I got of Dumbledore tells me that he would never have fallen for that. I guess until JK releases a statement one way, or the other, we gotta agree to disagree. Not that I disagree, I just think it was due to the plot more than anything else.

******** Of course it's due to plot, everything in the book is due to plot.

- 3 first year should not be able to win against a troll, or pass the protection meant to stop a Dark Lord.
- Even with a Phoenix and a shiny sword, a 12 years old boy should not be able to kill one of the most dangerous monster known to wizards.
- Same boy should not be able to repel one hundred dementor alone, especially when one was enough to knock him out just weeks before, and with a spell he "mastered" for the first time.
- The dark lord should just kill his "nemesis" once in his power, not make a long ass monologue before giving him a chance to "duel", where some bullshit story about brother wand will give the hero an opportunity to escape.
- 6 barely trained teens should not be able to sneak into the best guarded department of the ministry, neither should be able to resist the team of highly trained terrorist who waited for him there.

Without the plot, Harry Potter would have died when Voldemort struck him.

​

But even by accepting that "it's for the plot", Voldemort death is acceptable. The man did say that, being more intelligent than most, he does least mistakes, but the one he does tend to have worst consequences. You can't be perfect all the time, he found an item he thought he would never see, carrying the answer to a question he wondered most of his life, and probably enchanted to entice people coming near it, and lowered his guard.

The Elder Wand is not just a magic stick making someone invincible, it may be stronger than a normal wand but it doesn't mean that any spell cast with it will be invincible. It's just a bonus, not a god mode.

And even if Dumbledore could have theorically survived (I don't see why amputating the cursed limb would not have worked), he chose to die in a way that ensure his pawn was in place for the final act (and this plan really only worked "because the author said so" compared to his death).

I also don't see how Dumbledores inability to undo a curse means his knowledge is insufficient, even merlin probably couldn't revive an AK victim and this curse seems to work by spreading death so it likely bears some resemblance to an AK in which case the fact that he managed to even get it contained is extremely impressive

In relation to Dumbledore, while I may be willing to believe that he could "bow" to a curse due to his emotions regarding certain things(like his sister), I don't believe he'd bow to one when he is looking for a Horcrux, in a place that Riddle himself placed traps in. I honestly think that Dumbledore would have a strong enough sense of mind to resist any compulsions, because of his knowledgeon how insidious Riddle can be. It seems OOC that he'd not.

  Why did he die again. There is no way that Dumbledore shouldn't have noticed, and resisted the curse.
#+end_quote

How could he resist the ring curse? If you are poisoned you can't resist the poison. If you are stabbed you can't suddently invalidate the stabing by sheer force of will. Ring was likely enchanted with compultion charm like say a confundus charm. Voldemort was highly knowledgable in many areas of magic, some even ancient and long lost like Harry's protection.

#+begin_quote
  "His mother left upon him the traces other sacrifice. . . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it... but no matter. I can touch him now."
#+end_quote

Or like the ritual he used to come back to life

#+begin_quote
  "I knew that to achieve this - it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight"
#+end_quote

He is very knowledable in many areas and since Dumbledoor does not practice Dark Magic, it is far to say that he could have lacked knowledge about some spells or simply had no way of fighting them off. Remember, he needed Snape, a practisioner of the Dark Arts, to delay Voldemorts curse.

Anyway, what kind of compulsion magic could Voldemort have used? Maybe something similar to that potion he used to protect that Horcrux(The locket) in that cave. Just instead of causing you to remember terrible memories it could instead force you to remember good ones. The magic could make Dumbledoor believe his sister is still alive and he needs to put on the ring to get her or something like that.

  However, Dumbledore recognised the symbol of the Deathly Hallows on the ring's black stone and recognised it as the Resurrection Stone, something for which Dumbledore had searched for the greater part of his life. Hoping to revive his dead family members (particularly his sister Ariana Dumbledore), he disregarded the ring's status as a Horcrux and put it on.

I just wouldn't add /"...can beat Voldemort who used the dark arts.../" when the whole plot of the story was that they made Harry + Co into child soldiers. I can't and won't give him that. Yes, he was detrimental to keeping Voldemort in check throughout the second War, but it wasn't Dumbledore the prophecy warned about - doesn't take away his magical ability, but it was the Potter's/Longbottom's that he had feared the most because of that damn prophecy. He only wants Dumbledore dead because he's a nuisance to his cause and because he's mentoring Harry.

Just so everyone who reads this is clear, this isn't me /"hating"/ on the eccentric Headmaster, I'm only giving him credit for the things he did. He didn't - but more importantly, *couldn't* kill Voldemort otherwise a lot of people would still be alive. Was the magic he used impressive? Yeah. But he's way past his prime and Vlody went up against him and the order enough times for the Potter's and Longbottom's to go up against him thrice.

I'm just bringing up a theory to explain why your argument could be invalid, if you agree, great. If not, oh well. It's a theory. Not a scientific report essay. Your argument is already based on opinion, facts won't really help. Any argument that is made can easily be explained by ‘oh, it's plot.' Harry was apparating before he even knew what magic was, he learnt a highly advanced patronus charm in his third year... why aren't you calling /him/ powerful? Everyone was more powerful in the earlier books, and that most likely includes Voldemort. There's ‘nothing' to support this (except all of the evidence to the contrary, such as how Voldemort was able to duel Dumbledore, how he was able to fly broomless, how his name is still really feared, how he was able to implement an isle-wide taboo, etc.) but there's nothing to contradict this either. All you have is ‘I know Dumbledore is strong and I think Voldemort was weak,' and sorry if I don't think that wins you the debate by default. I can say the Dumbledore conjuring those sleeping bags was for ‘plot' too. (And P.S. how do we know the elves didn't do it?

*********** Firstly,I never said Voldemort was weak, only that he's not as strong as Dumbledore. This is backed up multiple times in the book, especially the whole Dumbledore being the only wizard Voldemort feared. Yes Voldemort is a powerful, and impressive wizard, but I don't think he quite stacks up to Dumbledore, but I never said he was weak, so please don't put words in my mouth.

Secondly, there's plot, and then there's "plot". One of them is used to help move the story along, the other is used as an excuse so that you don't have to explain how it worked/happened. Plot, Harry successfully using the Patronus out of desperation, and fear after learning it for months. "Plot," Dumbledore being cursed by Voldemort's Hocrux, because reasons, when someone of his age, and experience should mean differently. You see what I mean.

Thirdly, i'd love to see stuff from an adult DE perspective, and i'd love to see more of Voldemorts power, and genius in general. Sadly though we can only work with what we've got, and that's all i'm doing.

Lastly, the difference(as i've said earlier in this post already, although not this chain) between his summoning of the food, and his conjuring of the sleeping bags is in the way he does it. He uses his hands to summon the food(which i'm assuming is meant for a signal, if not that's an impressive feat of wandless magic), where as he waved his wand to conjure the sleeping bags. Both feats were done differently, so it would make sense that how they come into existance is seperate from each other as well. Just using common sense here.

I'd argue that Harry's Patronus was part of the “plot” as well. Really, the entire time-turner thing was quite “plot”-like, but I digress, that's not really the point.

All of those are good points, and what I was hoping for instead of the “so still nothing” comments. I hope we can discuss like this instead of with one-liners. :)

“Durr, if it's not literally handed down by a god, it's worthless”

The wand is pretty clearly a unique and extremely powerful magical artefact. Nobody is denying that. The notion that it has a narrative-editing power to ensure that its owner could never be defeated in battle under any circumstances is infinitely more of a stretch than “it just makes your spells way stronger”

Reparo is simply an example that proves that the Elder Wand is special. In terms of what we have /proof/ of, which does not count the who-knows-how-diluted-by-time fairy tale, we know it makes spells more effective. There is no /proof/ that it magically makes you immune to defeat. There is direct counter-evidence to that.

  At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him, were standing beneath him. It was as though freezing water were rising in his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again. ... Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head ... a woman ...

  ....

  “Lucky the ground was so soft.”

  “I thought he was dead for sure.”

  “But he didn't even break his glasses.”

  Harry could hear the voices whispering, but they made no sense whatsoever. He didn't have a clue where he was, or how he'd got there, or what he'd been doing before he got there. All he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten.
