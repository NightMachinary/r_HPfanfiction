** There was a similar request a couple of weeks ago. Here's my response (be aware that the links may not work as hpfanficarchive may still be having trouble).

I think what you're looking for was in the series called The Witches Secret Trilogy by Rotary File.

Hp and the Witches Secret

linkffa(87)

Harry Potter and the Dark Lady

linkffa(86)

Harry Potter and The Corvinus Strain

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.
