So, a common question in the history of HP fandom was, "if you use multiple wands, will your spells be more powerful?"

And the general answer was, "No, of course not, that would be silly and overpowered, and also why wouldn't everyone do that if it was the case?"

And then...

#+begin_quote
  As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took the chance: He leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco's grip, pointed all of them at Greyback, and yelled, “Stupefy!” The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground.
#+end_quote

So, yeah.

There are a million different ways to fanwank this so it's not stupid- maybe the spell wasn't actually more powerful, maybe using multiple wands adds a LITTLE bit of power, but not enough to generally matter, maybe Harry was just super stressed and pumped with adrenaline, giving extra power to the spell, maybe Harry is just Really Good at Stunning?

But yeah- is there any Word of God from Rowling on this?

Or alternatively, maybe it's exponentially more difficult to cast, maybe it's required you be attuned to all three wands which is actually very rare and the spells are actually far less stable. The stunning spell might have succeeded in stunning in this case but typically they'd be far harder to control.

*** Yes. That is what happens.

The purpose of this post is to find out if there is any explanation beyond the surface explanation.

Because the SURFACE explanation is, "If you hold more than one wand, you can easily cast more than one spell/the same spell at extra power."

Remember, Harry doesn't get tired or anything after casting this triple spell. That's generally not how magic works in HP- you don't have "mana reservoirs," magic doesn't really make you tired like that.

So, if the surface explanation is true, it makes every single wizard in the world an idiot for not wandering around with a bunch of wands duct-taped together.

So, either every wizard in the world is an idiot (which, to be fair, isn't a huge jump), or there's a better explanation (or JKR screwed up and hasn't retconned it).

**** If you want an explanation:

probably control.

Wands aren't only used for fighting and often need precision to be usefull.

And in fighting situations you want to be able to target things far away. It could be used as a shotgun alternative, but I think very often if you work in a team you will probably lose too much precision. And might acidentally hit an ally. Also it's not clear how easy it is to get an additonal wand. While one wand might be cheap additional wands might only be sold under certain circumstances as they can only be used for fighting.

**** Ignoring the Doylist nonsense, you could say that Harry cast three Stupefy spells from the three wands at the same target. This might prove an effective technique in limited circumstances, like dragon-handlers having a pepper-box of cheap wands as their backup when a dragon gets feisty. Most other times, having three different wands trying to initiate the same effect wouldn't be complimentary. Imagine trying to cut something and always getting three slices at once. If three different wands tried to fix the same glasses, it might tear the frames apart. Three wands all trying to animate the same puppet could end up with multiple personalities.

**** Perhaps they already have this.

If you tape 3 wands together and then put them inside a bigger wand it would basically be a multi-core wand right?

Instead of making three separate wands perhaps put three cores in one wand for the same effect. It's essentially 3 wands that are thinner than normal and each shaped like a 1/3rd crosspiece of a whole wand. Use some wood glue to hold them all together and sand it so you can't even tell it's three different pieces.

**** eh, wand motions with three wands duct-taped together would be horrible, I'd imagine. Stupefy and other point-and-cast wouldn't be that bad, but others defo would be.

**** Wasn't that the moment that Harry got the Elder wand? (Or am I mis remembering?) If it's the part with the Elder wand that could technically explain it. The Elder wand being more older/powerful would then proceed to connect with the other two wands and hit Greyback.

We unfortunately don't know much about wand lore, I always assumed though that the older the wand was the more powerful it was. Which if it was the Elder Wand could have connected with the others as I stated. (Could be possible).

** If using more, bigger, multicore, super rare, ancient, etc... wands made a difference then Voldemort would have done it far sooner than hunting for the Elder Wand during the Deathly Hallows.

He said best, the exceptional wand doesn't allow exceptional magic, the wizard who is exceptional does.

If using multiple wands at the same time drastically increased spell power then many more wizards would be doing it, Olivander would be selling multiwands.

Nope, just more fanon bullcrap.

*** It's not fanon, though. It happened- Harry held 3 wands, cast Stupefy, and hit Fenrir with a supercharged spell. Canon even calls it "the triple spell."

Agreed that it's dumb, though.

**** Harry was an inexperienced teenage wizard, a better explanation that the power boosting effect is an aspect of Harry's lack of mastery and that as he gained more experience and finesse it would diminish as he was able more fully channel his magic through one wand.

And yet Harry used Reparo with the Elder wand on his old Holly wand, when he wasn't able to do that with the other replacement wand he had (can't remember what was made of) *

Maybe it's unpractical for the common wizard. Maybe it's ridiculously expensive. Maybe it required materials no longer available... You could probably explain it in a million diffferent ways.
