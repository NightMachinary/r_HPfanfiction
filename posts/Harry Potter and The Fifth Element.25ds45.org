Is there a sequel? What happened to the author? This is a repost, but only because when I first posted, no one answered. I really loved that book and I recommend it more than any other fic I have ever read.


** Hi,

I haven't read the story but I just googled a bit. Did you read the story on fanfiction.net? Then you might want to read the last chapters [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/bexis/HPATFE.html][here]].

Otherwise he seems to have it abandoned (no updates after 2012 is quite some time).

** I think it crumbles underneath its weight by the end of it, but it's still one of my favorite stories. As far as I know, Bexis isn't in the process of writing a sequel.

On the contrary, Bexis has picked up Paracelsus' Coming Back Late a continuation called Coming Back Later

I don't think I've ever made it to the end, but this pretty much captures my sense of the story when I abandoned it. It seems a polarizing piece, with folks either liking it a lot or not much at all, with very little middle ground.

** I've read 80% of it.

Since you've already read it, would you mind explaining what you liked about it? I don't read fics that have infidelity in them, so once a certain scene happened I stopped reading it.

*** Well, honestly I just thought it was incredibly in depth, and at the speed I read, it was refreshing not to go through something in a few hours. I also like Powerful!Harry, and I love H/Hr, And I have a weakness for well written smut (sorry folks). All in all, I just loved the whole thing, and I really enjoyed how Harry grows up overall into a awesome kickass hero

**** Thanks for such a thoughtful response! I'm glad someone was able to appreciate it. You could really tell Bexis put an awful lot of thought into each chapter.
