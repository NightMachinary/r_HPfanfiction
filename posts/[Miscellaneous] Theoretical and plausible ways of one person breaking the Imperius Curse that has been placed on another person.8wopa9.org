Okay so I was thinking about plausible and logical acts that might be able to do this, forcing the caster to have to reapply it. One way I thought of was, if you hit them in the head so hard that they get knocked unconscious for several seconds. Their being unconscious would mean the curse would have nothing to keep influencing, because their brain and stuff isn't active, right? It's like being short circuited. That would lift it from them?

A more extreme version of this, and one I think more likely to work, would be to purposefully induce death in them and then revive them after a brief time. Like people whose hearts stop beating but doctors still bring them back successfully.

Of course you would have to KNOW that they're under it 100% or you'd be going around causing brain damage and possible death in people you care about for no real reason - or for an imagined, mistaken one.

Do you think these two methods would work? Are there any other plausible ways of doing this that anyone can think of, besides having to rely on the theoretical willpower of the victim to throw it off themselves, or the tried and true method of depriving the caster of their wand and/or killing them? Thank you! :)


** The Cruciatus curse should be enough. The Imperius floods the victim with happy feelings that encourage the behavior the caster wants of the victim. By casting the Cruciatus, the victim's head will be forcefully cleared of any happiness or pleasure, including the influence of the Imperius. This may explain why Voldemort was willing to use it on his minions- if they're screwing up, it's worth checking to see if they've been doing so by someone else's orders.

** A better question would be is there a limitation to placing the imperius curse on someone, then forcing that person to use imperius someone else. It calls into question why Yaxley needed to personally imperius Pius Thicknesse.

My suspicion is that someone under the imperius cannot themselves use the imperius on someone else. Partly because otherwise this creates a number of issues, the funniest being if you imperius someone and make them cast the imperius on you. How does that work out.

****** Hmm...I imagine it gets harder and harder to control through relays like that, as Malfoy would be doing twice the effort to keep both spells up. And even then, Katie was controlled for only a very short time. I imagine Rosmerta was fairly weak-willed, as that's the only reason i can think of for Malfoy being able to use the Imperius curse on two individuals at a time, one with a decently strong will, through a goddamned relay system.

**** It's canon, actually - its revealed during the Gringotts break-in that the Thief's Downfall removes the Imperius Curse.

In my stories, during a war, the Ministry often has all travel to it routed through the Floo Network, and there's a Thief's Downfall installed at the fireplace exit, where everyone has to pass through. Cuts down on infiltration by Imperius Curse or Polyjuice Potion.

** I don't think so, no.

Concerning the first, the Imperius Curse isn't just a temporary thing; once it's cast it lingers just about forever, until it's lifted by its original caster or said caster dies. There were literally dozens of people who had been Imperiused for months or /years/ to one level or another who "came to themselves" on Halloween 1981 when Voldemort was... indisposed.

Cardiac death wouldn't work either, I think. From a magical standpoint, "death" is when the soul leaves the body and either Moves On or becomes a ghost; the body's state is somewhat secondary. I'm sure there are spells to restart a heart a few seconds after it's stopped, yet that doesn't at all count as an exception to the "Magic cannot bring back the dead" rule.

A better bet might be an additional mind-affecting spell or potion to increase the victim's willpower. After all, with enough focus and willpower, it is absolutely possible to resist orders while under the Imperius, it's just that most people don't have the nerve or mental discipline to pull it off. Magic can muck about with people's minds in a variety of very deep-running ways (Amortentia, Wit-Sharpening Potion, Memory-Charms), I'm sure something could be pulled off to temporarily allow a non-Occlumens to allow on nothing but resisting.

There's also the loophole-y way: place them under a second Imperius Curse, with "Stop following all previous or future orders given under the Imperius Curse" as your sole directive.

*** :( Grrr. Thanks Achille! I guess you're right that neither unconsciousness or cardiac death would work, because you're right people WERE under control for literal months and years on end, and so logically they had to have been going to sleep and waking up every night, and the curse never had to be reapplied so....grrrrr.

That's what makes it so scary though!!! It's forever, it's flawless, and you can have multiple people at once!

Which is what I'm taking to an extreme in Fight For Rights... :) But I was HOPING to find a way to logically still be able to remove it without having to locate and kill/disable the origin point that is the caster. Grrrr.

But your thoughts about other mind magic subverting or overriding it is a good one! Like what if you gave them love potion that was as potent as Ron's mistaken one, and then they'd probably be obsessed with you to the point of obeying you instead of their Imperius directives/direct mental commands? Also adding your own Imperius to override the other person's might work, but you'd have to be more mentally powerful than them right? So your commands would be the ones being obeyed instead of theirs?

** So here's a thing that's not too clear from canon: can any witch or wizard terminate a spell cast by another witch or wizard? Back on the old old old TV show "Bewtiched", there were some sticky situations caused by the fact that only the witch or wizard who'd cast a certain spell could end it. This resulted in hijinks when Endora would cast a spell on poor Darren and disappear, leaving Samantha to deal with a husband who thought he was a chicken or whatever until Endora had decided that he'd suffered enough and reappeared to end the spell.

If someone were under the Imperius curse, what's to prevent another witch or wizard from simply using /Finite Incantatum/ and ending it? I can't think of any canon reason why only the caster can lift a spell, but honestly it's been a while since I've read the books and I may be forgetting something. Alternatively, there's also the Thief's Downfall waterfall in Gringott's--that gets rid of the Imperius Harry had cast on their goblin guide. I wonder if the waterfall (downfall) or the water from the falls itself is what causes the dispellation?

Also, you could make up a potion that does such a thing. Suspect your mother has been Imperiused into making brussels sprouts with dinner? Sprinkle some "Imperius Away" potion on her to get her to snap out of it!

I think the trick with Imperius is to make it subtle so that the victim's friends and acquaintances don't even suspect that something is wrong and thus don't try to dispel the spell.

#+end_quote

This is a general problem I have with the HP world. Everything is easy and simple with the magical system JKR has set up. There are no limits, wizards never run out of power, spells cast by one can be canceled by another ... on and on. So many times I'll be chatting with my beta, all excited about something I've come up with and my beta will point out that Harry could simply X or Y with magic and I'm like, "Well, back to the drawing board."

In fact, I'm kind of struggling with that right now in my current WIP. I have an idea for what I want to have happen at the climax, but there are SO MANY ways that it can magically be circumvented that I'm taking my time and thinking about ways that magic won't work so easily for this.

At the same time though, it's your world you're creating an you're free to make up your own rules for how you want things to work. I do think it makes a certain sort of sense for the Imperius Curse to only be able to be dispelled by the original caster or some third-party means such as the Thief's Downfall. I also like the idea of a potion, but it can't be a simple potion--more along the lines of Polyjuice, but maybe not as complicated as Veritaserum or Felix Felicis.

****** My guess is that it would require a more specialized counter-curse that requires special skill/training to be able to cast, maybe something mind-magic related or something to do with countering dark magic that's trickier that normal or somewhat obscure. Otherwise the mass-use of the imperius during the war would never have worked as people would just cast finite at each other all the time just in case.

**** When you get right down to it, love in this instance is just a way to augment the victim's willpower. However, it shouldn't be a catch-all. The feeling would have to be strong enough to overcome the euphoria effect and the victim's attention would have to be brought to the feeling somehow in the first place in a manner the imperious cannot simply override.
