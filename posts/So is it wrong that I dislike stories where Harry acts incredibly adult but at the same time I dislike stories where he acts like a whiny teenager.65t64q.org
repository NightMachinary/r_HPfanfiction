So I finished linkffn(3388784) Harry Potter, Sirius Black's God Child and it's one of those stories that really bothers me, Harry is incredibly bitchy in the story and one would say he acts like a normal teenager in it, but even then there are things that he does like throw temper tantrums and such that I don't think harry at 15/sixteen would do. I don't know It just bothers me just like harry being more adult in stories (especially shitty independent harry stories) bother me. what do you guys think about Immature or mature harry? how would you write him?

(Written on my phone sorry for grammer)


** I'd write him as I see him in canon: a fairly self-sufficient kid. He's not an adult, and he can be self-involved. However, he's not a normal kid either. Throwing tantrums and slamming doors was never going to get him anywhere with the Dursleys. That's just a desire for attention, and that's not Harry's style. Getting mad at every little thing was going to leave him angry and restless all the time because the Dursleys were constantly offensive. Harry learned to let most things slide off his back and he's great at showing his exasperation with smartass comments.

So a Harry that can get frustratingly mouthy when he's having a bad day? Sure. A Harry who struggles with authority? Perfect. A Harry who can get terse and unresponsive about his problems? Very likely (though canon Harry really connected with Sirius.)

But a Harry who gets huffy and whiny about small things, gets judgemental in a Petunia-like fashion, refuses to hear the answers or explanations of friends/family, or who spends his days acting like a passive-aggressive ass is just not in character.

Sometimes fanfiction is weird. They'll write young children way too old, and introduce a lot of infantile/childish tendencies into teenagers and/or adults.

*** Like, I get that in the books harry gets pissed, like blows shit up levels of pissed, but even if you look at him destroying dumbledores office, that's more him being overcome by rage and grief not him throwing a tantrum. even in the story that I linked they say "Your always so closed off" and that is true of canon harry, his personality is introverted and he doesn't like showing "weaker" emotions like sadness and angry to anyone unless pushed far enough like with Malfoy or Umbrige. but in the very same story Harry is slamming doors and throwing tantrums because Sirius got a girl Pregnant when in canon I'm pretty sure he'd be delighted to find that out.

Canon Harry and Ron were completely oblivious to girls until at least 3rd year

*** I liked the take on that quote present in a certain fic, where Ollivander said that and then proceeded to explain that it is either controlling yourself and it and doing great things, or succumbing to it and doing terrible things.

It certainly is like that with fanfics too, those who succumb to their writing create crap and those who get over themselves and their problems and control what they write can and sometimes do create great things.

** I have always preferred mature Harry, and to be honest, I think it fits cannon him more than Immature Harry. I mean in my view, his childhood would of FORCED him to self learn, adapt, and grow up. Although to be fair, this could easily be turned into the opposite in fan fiction, portraying him as emotionally and mentally stunted, and as such, super immature. It all depends on how you interpret his situation in childhood.

But the above brings up the simple fact that Harry did not have a normal childhood, and as such, will likely not behave like a normal child his age would behave.

Of course that brings up the fact that fan fictions could portray Harry as having a normal childhood with both James and Lily alive.

Or him growing up amongst Goblins.

Or in outer space.

At the end of the day, fan fiction is fan fiction and you can really tweak it almost any way you want.

So there is not really an answer other than, what each individual person prefers. In my case, as stated, I prefer mature independent Harry (who may act a little more adult like), and I absolutely hate weak, immature, or childlike Harry (This is actually somewhat true with all characters, outside maybe Luna, and is likely a big reason I hate Ron).
