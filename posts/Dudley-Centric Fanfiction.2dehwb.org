Does anyone know any Dudley-centric fics? Preferably anything about him having magical children?


** This is a great one-shot about him: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172226/1/A-Hero][A Hero]]. I don't want to give away the plot but it's amazing. Not about him having magical children or something though.

  Dudley Dursley lived a very normal life. But when an all too familiar letter makes an appearance on his son's 11th birthday, Dudley must seek the guidance of a cousin he hasn't seen in 19 years. Who else but Harry Potter?

*** The only thing that bothers me about this is that Dudley isn't fat anymore in DH, so all the references to losing large amounts of weight don't make sense. But it is a fun read.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8369495/1/The-Cupboard][The Cupboard]] by FranticArmoire is pretty good, 12.5k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  What begins as a simple trip to retrieve extra cleaning supplies for his mother turns into something more for Dudley, something even he can't explain. He still hasn't forgotten what the Dementors showed him the previous summer, and he's beginning to think that maybe they were right after all. Oneshot.

This one is not really Dudley-centric, but centers on the younger sister of one of his friends: Ecmm's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244417/1/Hocus-Pocus-Adele-Polkiss][Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss]], 33k words, complete.

** I know this is a couple days too late, but I have a couple Dudley-centric fics I thought I'd share.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7721379/1/The-Burn-of-the-Phoenix][The Burn of the Phoenix]] by laughandlove. This somehow still manages to be Harry-centric even though it's from Dudley's POV, and it's also really sad. "...Signifies a new beginning. Harry dies in the Final Battle. Dudley attends his cousin's funeral, quickly discovering that there was much more to Harry's life than he ever dreamed. Can regret give way to a fresh start? Canon, aside from Harry's death."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7099115/1/Business-Trip][Business Trip]] by Remasa. "Dudley Dursley is sent on a business trip to New York City. On the plane, he meets a certain arrogant wizard. Can each survive without killing the other? No pairings. One-shot."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5650766/1/Unexpected-Encounters][Unexpected Encounters]] by Corey Lin. "Five years after the defeat of Voldemort, a chance encounter on a London street opens new possibilities for friendship and shows just how much one man can change. Written after HBP and is not DH compliant. Now completed!"
