Fics with a good, not ooc, Remus where he gets a lot of "screentime" (pagetime?), not necessary from his perspective, but fics centred around Harry or Hogwarts post-marauders usually don't really have him around enough. The era doesn't really matter, as long as it's not Cursed Child. Also it doesn't really matter from whose perspective it is, I'm not picky


** The bureaucratic error is a fic where Remus goes back in time to when he first started teaching. It's a fun fic, fairly light hearted, well written and recently updated.

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. He's going to need his old friend Sirius to help him with this one.

*** I'm mostly up to date with it, but in one of the last chapters Umbridge shows up and starts talking about Remus' dad and his job, kinda implying stuff about Fenrir Greyback and I took a break. I'm bad with confrontations... It also has fic recommendation under most of the chapters, so that is nice

  "Penny for your thoughts?" said a voice in the dark.One minute Remus had been alone in the garden, leaning against the Weasleys' broomstick shed, facing away from the Burrow and that peculiar limbo between Order meeting and wedding preparations. But then he lit up, and the flame briefly illuminated the face of Hermione, now lounging next to him. Remus allowed himself a deep drag before answering, "Life's but a walking shadow." She'd get it.Her frown confirmed that she did. "Macbeth sort of mood?" she asked.Macbeth sort of world, Remus thought.

** The Uncle linkao3(839169) is a oneshot with a...rather different take on Remus. In particular, he has an AU backstory (his parents abandoned him once he became a werewolf) and becomes a crime lord after graduating Hogwarts. Manages to be quite fluffy and lighthearted despite this.

**** I've got a fic or Series which i would highly rec you. It's wolfstar but Remus is a bit darker, just in a sense that he is battling his own demons and it's Sirius' pov. There is smut but the characters are so well written that I have to rec it here despite it might not being exactly what you look for. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9809804]])

In this WIP, Remus plays more of a supportive role but there are 2 chapters from his pov so you might be interested. Linkao3(The Master of Death by Quine)

  “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war.
