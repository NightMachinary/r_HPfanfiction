:END:
Looking for a specific Star Wars crossover with Harry as the main character, I'm afraid I can't remember much about it apart from the fact that he clones himself multiple times, and becomes one of those clones when he dies. I think he has his own planet or something like that?

All suggestions are appreciated!

  A small change in Harry's battle with the Basilisk had him slowly absorbing Voldemort's memories from the Horcrux in his scar. Follow Harry as he makes preparations to leave the Wizarding world behind for good and embark on a long and exciting journey into the unknown. Little does Harry expect to be launched into a world of false gods and spaceships. Smart/Powerful/Grey Harry.

*** Quite sure it's Star Wars, I think one of his clones he becomes after one of his deaths ends up joining the Jedi Order.

I'll be sure to give this Fic a try still!

EDIT: Can't spell.
