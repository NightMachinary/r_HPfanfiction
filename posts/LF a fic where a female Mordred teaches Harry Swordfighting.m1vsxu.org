:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading this fic a long while back where Mordred teaches Harry how to swordfight. I'm not sure but I vaguely remember Mordred being a ghost or a portrait too. I don't think this is an explicit /Fate/Stay Night/ crossover fic but since I had read it before I knew about fate, I may be wrong

I don't remember if she actually trains Harry but she is a ghost here and he later summons her during the fight against the basilisk, it was a good moment.

  Herwald returns for his 2nd year of Magical Education. And all he has to deal with is centuries of prejudice, an incompetent DADA professor, an overeager House Elf and an ancient monster that's awoken hungry from it's 50 year slumber. No worries, right?

***** This isn't the fic either. My past self would've stopped reading it due to how much of a major element the fate is in this fic. Although thanks for the rec, I've been looking for good HPxFate crossovers for a while and this seems fun :)

****** WELL, I don't really rec Quartemass stories, they are all pretty much the same honestly. betrayed/Manipulated!Harry goes to fate and romances main heroine, all the good guys team up together and the fic ends without resolution.

but the first one I linked is decent, it is Harry in Hogwarts with an Einsbern background but it is unfinished.

This one is probably the best one. It is a Harry Potter wizards in a Grail War. Harry's characterization here is 10/10.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...
