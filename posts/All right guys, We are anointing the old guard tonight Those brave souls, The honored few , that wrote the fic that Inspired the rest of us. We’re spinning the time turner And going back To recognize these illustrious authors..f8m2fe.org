We all know them and Have read their works to some degree. Let's start with the classics And then open the floor for suggestions On who should be listed among these respected and brave souls:

Let us begin with Poison Pen by GenkaiFan on ffn.net The grandfather fic For all authors daring to have Harry channel his Slytherin side

And of course Oh God Not Again! by Sarah1281 From the same site. The work is the gold standard for a time travel Crack fic. It has influenced more than one parody author.

Up Next is the work that's a little newer but absolutely brilliant: It set the bar for an alternate Universe/time travel fic at level not seen before it .Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is by Tsume Yuki is a story everyone can enjoy.

The last two on this list fall into the same category, They are well written stories that inspired many A Smart Harry premise. RuneMaster » by Tigerman and Calculation by fringeperson

My apologies, The last on the list is a work that has sparked hilarity and great debate within the fanfiction community a work That is equal in both its infamy and It's literary Excellent. I speak of course of A Black Comedy by nonjon.

I now open this list for Debate and suggestion. We are honoring the authors that inspired so many of us , it start typing a our own stories. While none of this could be possible without the Books written by J. K. Rowling. We are Nominated the old guard of our Community . The authors that took inspiration of Rowling Brilliant creations and Put their own twist on them. What author inspired your Appreciation for fanfiction?

*** Like- ever? I'm pretty sure it predates the internet. I think Star Trek had fanfiction as early as the '60s. Yep, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction#Star_Trek_fandom][Wikipedia]] confirms that:

#+begin_quote
  The modern phenomenon of fan fiction as an expression of fandom and fan interaction was popularized and defined via /Star Trek/ fandom and their fanzines published in the 1960s. The first /Star Trek/ fanzine, /Spockanalia/ (1967), contained some fan fiction; many others followed its example.
#+end_quote

Otherwise, the oldest HP fanfic on fanfiction.net is from September of '99. That's before Goblet of Fire was even released. Though I don't know if there are other sites with fics older than that.

*** Technically a lot of literature can be classified as fan fiction, because the concept of copyright is relatively new.

here's something I found on [[https://tjmystic.tumblr.com/post/141003600885/so-when-i-was-doing-my-thesis-on-whether-or-not][tumblr]]:

#+begin_quote
  So, when I was doing my thesis on whether or not fanfiction should be considered a legitimate genre of literature, my advising professor asked me for examples. I gave him the generic ones, of course - “Pride & Prejudice and Zombies” is a horror fanfic of “Pride & Prejudice”, “50 Shades of Grey” is an erotica fic of “Twilight" - and that seemed to make him understand what fanfiction is, but not how it's useful. So I thought about it, and, after about a minute, I said, “Paradise Lost is basically a fanfiction of the Book of Genesis. And The Divine Comedy is an epic self-insertion fic for Catholic doctrine. So, basically, you were teaching us fanfiction last semester.” I had never before seen a grown man's eyes widen with such fear, incomprehension, disgust, awe, and understanding.

** The Life and Times by Jewels5. Even though it probably will never be finished, it is still one of, if not the best Marauders-era Jily fics that I keep coming back to, and it leaves off at a point that doesn't feel so jarring. The writing style is beautiful and Jewels5 doesn't shy away from juggling a large cast of vibrantly complex characters who are trying to deal with their teenage drama while Voldemort rises in the background. It's an excellent depiction of the first war and the tensions that laid the foundation for Harry's generation, without falling into the same traps and tropes that so many other Marauders-era fics fall into.

**** To be fair it would be halved in length if you took out all of the condescension and preaching. There is actually an audiobook version. I freely admit I would have abandoned the fic if it wasn't for the audiobook.

​

Though I think the problem is people often fall in extremes like love/ hate. I read it and I liked some of the ideas, disliked others and was bored by yet others. I liked Hermione and Mcgonagall and the mock battles. I really, /really/ disliked Harry. This must be the most obnoxious version of him I've ever seen. So he's read a few science books and thinks that makes him wiser than adults with decades more experience than him. And anytime someone dares to disagree with him he throws a tantrum. Though I find it funny that normal home life and childhood produced a more whiny and irritating Harry than the abusive Dursleys.

Like, this lad has known about magic for two days, and he sees fit to mouth off about it to a man who has studied it for close to a hundred years? Get the fuck outta here. He doesn't even read his fucking textbooks.

What really broke me though was how much he hates magic and everything to do with it. His first reaction to anything cool isn't "wow, how does that work?", but "What the fuck, that's impossible, I hate it!", as seen when McGonnagal transforms into her cat form.

HPMOR has a plethora of serious problems (eg [[https://danluu.com/su3su2u1/hpmor/]] ), but Less Wrong actually does a pretty good job framing that condescension as a character flaw that Harry must overcome over the course of the story---Harry suffers setbacks due to dismissing and looking down on other people from the get-go, and each of those setbacks becomes a learning experience for him.
