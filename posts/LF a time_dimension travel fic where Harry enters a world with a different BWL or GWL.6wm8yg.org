Really the main title has all my criteria, but I usually do prefer a confident or adult Harry and for it to be complete. But that's really neither here nor there.

The few I can think of like this would be linkffn(The nightmare man), linkffn(on a pale horse), linkffn(altered destinies), and linkao3(3390668) C'est La Vie.

I guess now that I think about it, there are a good deal of stories like this, but I'm always looking for more. Any help would be appreciated.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

***** Thanks for the suggestion, I just read this and it was fantastic. This is more or less what I wished 1-800 Rent-a-Hero would be like. Where Harry is summoned by the Order, in rent a hero and others, I always felt like Harry got over what they did to him and aligned himself with the Order too easily. In this it felt more realistic sort of because of how the Order was just as much an enemy to Harry as was Voldemort.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
