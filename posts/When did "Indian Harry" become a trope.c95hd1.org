I'm not opposed to the concept, as such, but I do find it exceedingly odd.

I understand the basic logic behind race and gender bending, making a character fit for you to feel represented by/empathise with better or to add racial/gender themes to a work that doesn't make much use of them.

I just don't understand why /Indian/ Harry, specifically, is seemingly so much more common than, say, Caribbean Harry or North African Harry or the like?

Anybody got any theories?


** Indian is the most common non-white ethnic group in the UK.

Also, a lot of great fanart of Indian Harry has made the rounds on Tumblr over the past few years, which influences how some people in the fandom picture him these days.

** I think it's probably easier to feel plausible with the connection to the empire and involves the least changes to his appearence as described in canon. It really is just skin tone. Many people of Desi descent also have quite anglicised names so that fits too.

I also asked someone about it recently, because I never really got it either and they suggested it also adds a further dynamic to why the dursleys hate him so much - he ruins their picture perfect white family and is so obviously different. Attitudes to South Asian people can be extremely negative in many parts of the UK.

For me I'm never going to imagine him that way but have seen some lovely fanart of it.

The problem is that it fundamentally changes the relationship they have with Harry in a weird and detracting way. Any story like this will just spiral out of control and become a race thing... I just don't see any other outcome.

** The reasons you mention in the OP are most of it. Aditionally, Harry having an ancestor from India could make sense due to close ties between India and Great Britain during the time that India was a British colony. In modern times, people of Indian descent make up the largest non-White ethnic group living in the UK (2.3% of the population).

*** Pretty much the same thing that black Hermione. Rowling had the subtility of a sledgehammer when it came to describe her character, if she did'nt say Harry or Hermione were "dark skinned " pretty much everytime they described them, they are White. As most of the thing, people do anything in their Headcanon, but please dont argue it's canon afterward (especially if only to make them Dursley even more unpleasant people, they are bad enough in canon, no need to make them the british branch of the KKK of the Evil incarnate ).

***** Sometimes it feels like Rowling want to pander all the minorities in existence, even if it means breaking her own universe.\\
For me she is the prim example of author who should not be left unsupervised on Twitter. I thought the rule "show, don't tell" was a basic one in litterature. If she wanted to precise the ethnicity of a hero, she had 7 Harry Potter books (not to mention all the one on the side) to do so, I don't want to hear about it years later on twitter.

This apply for pretty much all the aditions she made to her universe, she saw us Ron and Hermione "happily" married 19 years later in the epilogue, yet tells us the couple would need therapy (while at the same time accepting Cursed Child as Canon who make both of use miserable when not together, but Hermione the worse one). From what I understood they pretty much retconned the character of McGonnagal to make her 20 or 30 years old, just because idiot film maker wanted to make a fucking cameo with her character (on this point, Defense Teacher Dumbledore? He was the Transfiguration teacher in canon).

The only thing I "accept" is the Gay Dumbledore, and just because I feel like she "showed" it enough in canon, (though the fact that the love was not unrequired, and the relation "physical" were not in canon).

Then I saw the comments and was like "Ooooooh!"

Honestly never read and Indian Harry fic, but I can see the logic behind it. Physically at least, the characteristics fit. I can see a cool fic where he explores his Indian heritage after the war.

Oh man, now I want to read up on traditional Indian magic. Never really been into race bending but that would be a fun idea to explore.

No, physically they don't fit at all. If Harry was of mixed race, he would not look that similar to his father.

**** Eh. Debatable. When you have a couple who's mixed race it's possible for one kid to come out looki g just like the lighter colored parent, and another kid who is a carbon copy of the darker parent, or have a kid who is a little like both. It's kinda like a grab bag with genetics. Ya never know what you're going to get.

India is a huge country, with a lot of variation in eye color, skin tones, and even hair color. If Harry was mixed race, with his father being partially Indian, it's very possible he could have fairly light skin from his mother, or even father depending on where his father came from.

Not only that, but red hair and green eyes are HIGHLY recessive traits. Harry looking like his dad isn't surprising just from book descriptions. Black hair is typically going to get passed down before red hair.

Yes, if both parents are mixed race this would be possible. But not really if only one is and the other is white. Skin color is determined by several genes which don't operate on the dominant recessive model. Instead, it's more of a combination where every copy of a gene contributes to overall skin color.

Not really. Any eye color but brown (overwhelmingly dark brown) is very rare in India.

Harry having green eyes is in fact a very strong argument against his father being of Indian ancestry, due to how rare such eye color in in India.

****** The Potters are a old wizarding family who have been in Britain for a long time. If they were Indian, James Potter would likely already be mixed race himself.

I'll secede the point about the eye color.

As for the likelihood of the Potters being Indian, I agree. It's not likely at all. My arguement was that I think it could make for a fascinating exploration into the Potter family as there are a lot of cool things you could do with it. Harry doesn't know a whole lot about his family, and it would make a coll story of him delving into his family's history and orgin after the war ends.

** I'm not sure on the /Indian/ Harry per se, but one argument that I remember taking note of (I think) on Tumblr in favor of biracial Harry was his emphasis on Voldemort's pale hands when seeing through his eyes. The thought of course being that if Harry's hands were similarly pale-skinned, it wouldn't be nearly as remarkable for him.

Personally, I like the idea of POC Harry. I think it adds nuance to his relationship with the Dursley's, and to the love-then-hate relationship the press and the Ministry have with him. I especially like the idea of Desi Harry for some reason.

Harry is described as burning up even under the English sun, so this is hardly likely. It's clear that when Voldemort is described as pale, he's paler than normal skin coloration. This is confirmed by the fact that he's also called "bone-white".
