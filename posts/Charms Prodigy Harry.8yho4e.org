** linkffn(harry potter and the boy who lived) has Harry as a prodigy in everything, charms included. He's shown doing charms stuff that would have been hard for 4th year Lily Evans and Arthur Weasley remembers doing in his OWLs as an end of 1st year project, for example.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
