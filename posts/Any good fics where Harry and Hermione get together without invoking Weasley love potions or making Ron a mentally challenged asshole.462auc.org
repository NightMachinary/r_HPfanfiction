  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

** Yes! They're hard to find---most of the ones I like came out before DH---but they're out there.

/[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7149][Three Seasons to Closure]]/ is a great, slow-moving H/Hr romance that you may have missed because it's only on Portkey and FictionAlley.

Both of Full_Pensieve's novel-length fics have a really interesting Ron. (The one in YoR is frequently a jerk, but he has his own arc---he's not a jerk specifically for the purposes of getting Harry and Hermione together. One of my favorite characterizations of him, full of anger without it destroying the canon character.) Those are both on [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net/][fanficauthors]].

linkffn(With Malice Aforethought) is one of my favorites from the years when everybody was trying to write a Book 6 as they thought JKR might, and features some novel Harry/Hermione ideas.

Finally, linkffn(A Local's Guide to Life in London by Significant Owl) is a short story that I've always loved---really polished and quiet and funny.
