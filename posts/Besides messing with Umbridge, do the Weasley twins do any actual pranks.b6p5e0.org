I remember after Dumbledore leaves the twins raise absolute hell. But other than that, do they do any pranks that are mentioned in the books?

Also, why do fanfic writers always write super elaborate pranks that the Marauders pull? I don't remember any actual text evidence for them specifically pulling pranks. Although if someone can show me something, I will stand corrected.

I'm pretty sure James and Sirius just hexed people for shits and giggles. And just duelled Snape a lot. And they explored the castle/wilderness a lot after becoming animagi.


** I love these sorts of posts which re-examine the original books and make me seriously question what actually is canon vs fanon. I'd been so used to thinking of the twins and Marauders as pulling pranks all the time that I hadn't even considered that it isn't really canon!

** Haha, at one point they charm Percy's Head Boy Badge to say “Big Head Boy”. That still makes me laugh out loud every time I see it.

** I think that both the Marauders and the Weasleys were prone to getting in trouble for being where they're not supposed be. Hagrid mentions having to chase them away from the Forbidden Forest and there are a few mentions of them knowing the castle better than anyone else. I took that as they snuck out after curfew to go exploring.

You're right though that for some reason fanfiction writers take this to another level of them pulling elaborate pranks all the time. Although the Weasleys did develop a lot of products that could constitute as pulling pranks (ie trick wants, canary creams, etc), I think you're right that there wasn't much mention of any pranks in the first few books.

It is mentioned that Sirius tricked Snape into seeing Lupin transformed in the Shrieking Shack, "for a laugh" so I think some people have interpreted that as he did other things at others' expense because he thought it would be funny.

** there was a thread about this in the past that listed some of their actions: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7p83zy/why_do_people_assume_the_weasley_twins_are/]]

they were also born on april fool's. in a series with werewolf remus lupin, snake lady nagini, herbology professor sprout, etc., i think that's suggestive

i think people extend that to james and sirius mostly because they're compared to the twins

** Fanfic writers write super elaborate pranks because they're absolutely ridiculous. They've convinced themselves that Fred and George are some kind of pranking duo even though the number of pranks done by the Weasley twins can be counted on one hand with fingers to spare. It's the same thing with the Marauders.

They charm snowballs to hit Quirrel in the back of his head during Christmas, they spell Percy's Head Boy badge to say Bighead Boy (which is actually funny), they give ton-tongue toffee to Dudley.

The swamp thing against Umbridge is more of a big fuck you to her insane educational decrees rather than anything else. It doesn't read like any of the ridiculous pranks that ff authors come up with anyway.

Fred and George (and the Marauders) have a penchant to cause trouble. But ff authors, for some random reason, have collectively decided to associate causing trouble solely with pranking. Getting into physical, verbal, or magical fights with other students, talking back to teachers, breaking curfew, being in areas that are out-of-bounds, skiving off classes, sneaking off to Hogsmeade, getting drunk or providing alcohol (or drugs and potions if you want to go that way) to other underage students - all this comes under causing trouble. None of it can ever be called pranking, not by anyone sane anyway.

** In the prisoner of Azkaban, when Harry sneaks off to Hogsmeade, McGonagall says that James and Sirius could give the Weasley twins a run for their money. This is said in reference to pranks.

** Part of this is the genre. In British boarding school fiction, like Enid Blyton, pranks are an integral part of school life, with certain characters being the most active. For example, Bobby in the St Clare's books would play at least one prank per book, normally small juvenile things such as replacing chalk with identical plastic versions that don't write or stink bombs.

When I read the HP books I related the Weasley twins to these characters and extrapolated from their personalities and the pranks that ARE mentioned that they were doing more that Harry didn't see as he wasn't in class with them. Generally, pranks are played only in class because there is a captive audience, it disrupts boring learning, and the target can be the teacher who is seen as fair game. This is where many fanfiction authors fall down - if a prank is played on fellow student not in a position of power (Percy was a prefect, Montague was trying to take house points) then its bullying.

This is why a lot of people see them as pranksters - because you're supposed to think that.
