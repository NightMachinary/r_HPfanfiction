I feel like Harry and Hermione developed a sibling-like bond. Romance between them always feels weird to me.

** Difficult to pick, I actually want both, if they agree.

If not, I prefer Hermione myself, but Ginny is a much better fit for canon Harry.

Then there is the relationship with Ron to consider. If picking Hermione meant a break of the Trio, then I would settle for Ginny. Relationship drama is the last thing I need in fighting Voldemort and his minions.

** Hermione all the way. Ginny always felt forced. Hermione always felt natural. I never got the "sibling" aspect people bring up. I dont think its like that at all personally from reading the books (at least before JK wrote in "Harry's Ginny" to pair with him).

However, as much as I am a Hermione fan, my favorite pairing is often actually Harry/Luna and to some degree I think Harry would have been happiest with Luna down the road.

*** u/Deathcrow:

  Ginny always felt forced.
#+end_quote

I think one of the main reasons for that is the epilogue.

I have no problem with them getting together and being attracted to each other... I can even say that for Ron/Hermione, even though that's even more nonsensical, but teenagers are kinda beginners in finding good partners and make bad choices.

re: epilogue: That everyone marries their first serious girlfriend/boyfriend is just dumb though.

Harry/Luna is pretty great. Lunar Harmony is even better.

**** I agree. They also need to remember that Ginny was a bit of a piecemeal character thrown in by JK without enough significant development to really know for sure if she would be a good fit. Hermione on the other hand is more of a known entity, spending significantly more time around Harry and with significantly more canon character development.

You can like Ginny or Hermione more, but its quite hard to compare the 2 directly via canon.

**** I've read that before and its basically worthless. It, just like everyone's view is a single persons opinion. While it may attempt to "back up" its position with evidence, in reality, it simply utilizes quotes out of context, and from questionable locations and periods in canon time to infer opinions that are often flat-out guesswork at best.

It is literally of no more value in proving whether Hermione works or not than my opinion that it would work.

The best part about it is the exact same process the author uses as their basis, could be used for Ron with identical conclusions, and even as it pertains to Harry and Ginny with similar conclusions. Aka, none of their relationships would work according to the author.

****** I actually agree with that. Let's be honest here, JK did some terrible work in terms of relationship development. Its very clear from the start she lacked forsight when it came to pairings as the kids aged up and had to do some quick work to "try" and figure it out without screwing up the Golden Trio if you will.

In my view, the best way to look at pairing potential from canon is to look less at silly things kids say and not at JK's "romantic" plot aspects, but rather instead dive into the more subtle behavior aspects of each character. Paring by psychology if you will.

** Without a question Hermione. Ginny holds very little appeal to me (maybe if I knew her better).

But if I were Harry I'd put romance on the back-burner and solve my Dark Lord problem first. Not to mention that Harry - after the terrible upbringing with the Dursleys - still has a lot of growing up to do in regards to emotional intimacy.
