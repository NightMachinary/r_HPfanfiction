I'm trans so I have a pretty good idea of what not to do in regards to trans issues but I haven't read every trans related story and I wouldn't want to because a lot of them are terrible imo, which is why I'm writing my own which will hopefully be a longer length and quality (and actually finished!) than even the good/decent ones, so what I'm asking is, what tropes and other things should I avoid that ruins other Harry Potter fics though anything that could help.

It's going to encompass the whole series so from pre-first year to post-war but not much in either direction. I'm already planning on avoiding awful name changes (Probably gonna leave it Harry, MAYBE a slight change but not full-on Harriet or god forbid Harlow) and instant gender change potions. And don't get mad, I did enjoy the one where she changes her name to Harlow... up to that point.

Any suggestions welcome, I need all the help I can get.

*** Awesome thank you. Yeah I am gonna take advantage of polyjuice potion but it's not gonna be an easy way out it's gonna be something they can use briefly as a shortlived refuge in life and takes a lot of effort to get. Im liking the idea of Harry getting Pansy's hair for the potion in second year (or maybe taking the cat juice instead lol). One thing I hate in even the trans stories ive enjoyed is often times realistic social aspects are ignored in favor of these guys are completely accepting, these guys don't like you until you save their life, and these guys are Slytherins so screw them (except for the few slytherins who are apart of the secret gender non-conforming society Hogwarts has for some reason).

** unrelated to the thread, but it's kind of annoying that people /still/ anally downvote threads/comments about trans or gay stuff
