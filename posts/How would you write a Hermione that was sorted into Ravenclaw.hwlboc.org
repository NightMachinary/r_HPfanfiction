*** Yeah, I've never bought into the idea that Ravenclaws would be super jealous of a talented peer anywhere between Percy/Hermione talent to Dumbledore/TMR and it's my biggest gripe with HP and the BWL.

It would be her personality that causes her to be an outcast, specifically social ineptness and smugness. And while that made them avoid her in Gryffindor, canon and Pottermore suggests it would put a target on her back Ravenclaw.

** In one sentence, happier, with more friends, even more of an overachiever, possibly a bit of a "Queen Bee", but also more status-conscious and less eager to rock the boat.

I get the argument that early-canon Hermione's poor social skills are going to be damaging to her prospects in any house, but consider:

- Harry and Ron's (mis)beaviour really did bring out the worst in her; she would be a far more tolerable around people with whom she had something in common and who wouldn't push her buttons; and there would be more such people in Ravenclaw.
- In Ravenclaw, all it would take is one or two classmates with whom she could nerd out, and her social circle would expand from there---even while her social skills improve with practice. Notably, her actual socialising with Harry and Ron is very limited, and she would get a lot more practice in Ravenclaw.
- Hermione is a valuable friend to have for a Ravenclaw, and that is something that would become apparent very quickly.
- Hermione's personality type is not uncommon, particularly in Ravenclaw, and so Ravenclaw as an institution---home to creative types and paper-pushers alike---would know how to integrate people like her.
- Hermione is, in fact, a very gifted child who is fortunate to also be a very disciplined and persistent. This means that even if she inspires jealousy from others in her year, there is little they can do but learn to live with it and try to ride her coattails.

I think it's a mistake to draw parallels between her and Luna. They are completely different people, opposites in most ways, with different personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. Luna is flighty and imaginative; Hermione is grounded and knowledgeable. Luna is generally content to keep to herself; Hermione is actually quite outgoing (even if she is bad at it). Luna passively accepts bullying; Hermione tattles or retaliates. The social difficulties, if any, that either would face would be categorically different.

But, at the same time, having friends to whom she can relate---and no Gryffindor habits or imperative to stand for what's right---would also make her far more reluctant to rock the boat. While she will probably retain enough righteousness to refrain from bullying Luna personally, there is a good chance that she won't take steps to protect her. (If she does try to take Luna under her wing, she will regret it, because she and Luna /will/ clash, but it could make for good comedy.)

She might also be more careful about advocating for House-Elf rights, unless she can convince her friends to join in in earnest. On the other hand, she might just have a bunch of long debates with her friends about the issue, and they would the come to some sensible consensus.

** Depends on the context, the viewpoint character(s), the AU elements, etc.

Hermione's major character flaws (at least at the start) are her obsession with following rules & authority figures, and a very strong belief that "true fact" = "written in a book". Those can variously clash, fit in, or be irrelevant to the other Ravens depending on how you characterize her yearmates and the house as a whole.

At the same time, if Hermione outshines her peers hard enough, she might have to deal with jealousy from them (as they presumably have Invested a good part of their Identities with "academically excellent")

How Hermione develops from there can vary wildly as the butterflies accumulate...

Also, we might have to assume headcanon about how canon Hermione felt in Gryffindor to generate the changes (for example, we could assert something like "Hermione had a lot of trouble connecting with her female peers in Gryffindor, as they had too little in common (well, the male ones too, all she had to bond with Harry and Ron was shared trauma). As such, she was very isolated (even after befriending them). In Ravenclaw, she is not so isolated (so, for example, the first Halloween might not end with her crying alone in a bathroom, even if Ron still belittles her for helping him).

*** Mate, you need to read fewer Indy!Harry Manipulative!Dumbledore fics.

Early-canon Hermione only looks obsessed with following rules and obeying authority next to Harry and Ron, who are pathologically incapable of either, even when it's a very good idea. For example, "Don't wander around an unfamiliar magical castle at night over a matter of preadolescent honour" is a great rule, especially since you might run into a hungry cerebrus. Hermione, on the other hand, actually thinks about the consequences---such as being expelled from the only place where she, a Muggleborn, can learn magic.

When the situation calls for it, whether it's setting a teacher on fire, petrifying a classmate, or brewing a semilegal potion from stolen ingredients in order to abduct and impersonate three of your classmates in order to question a fourth one, Hermione is downright eager.

On that note, an authority-worshipper would fit right in Ravenclaw all too well: perhaps nominally it's a house of creativity, but in practice, all the magical innovators we see are Gryffindors and Slytherins; and Ravenclaw is largely a house of paper-pushers, with Luna being the odd one out.

**** I... have read very few such fics, as they tend to contain other tropes I don't much enjoy.

That which I said more or less represents my initial feelings about Hermione when I read the books for the first time, which went on to form the basis of my primary reading of canon.

Also, by sheer chance, I read books 1 and 3 prior to 2, and those two far more often than 2, which also skews my primary perception of Hermione.

That said, even in book 7, she was far too unwilling to steal and kill for my taste.

***** Your complaint about Hermione being unwilling to steal and kill applies just as much, or more, to the rest of the trio. I would have /loved/ to see her written as the anti-hero of the group---more so than she already is---but that's not the story JKR wrote.

Basically, Hermione is just as willing to break the rules, but she is not as impulsive about it. Say, Harry is angry, so he uses the Cruciatus. He is about to be discovered by a Death Eater, so he casts the Imperius. Draco is about to cast the Cruciatus on him, so he casts the Secumstempa. But, he doesn't, say, practice using these spells ahead of time. Ordinarily, he is /too/ moral and merciful, to the point of refusing to use the Stunning Spell on a broom-riding enemy because they might be under Imperius.

Hermione, on the other hand, weighs the consequences before she breaks the rules---whether it's kidnapping her classmates, organising a militia in a school, disfiguring a classmate, or jinxing a Quiddich player. Her most impulsive act of violence (that I can recall) is sending the birds to attack Ron.

Hermione does /talk/ about the rules a lot, but, well, it's good to know what the rules are before you break them.

********** I deeply distrusted authority figures, especially educational ones. Until proven otherwise, every teacher and administrator is assumed, at best, to be incompetent and indifferent.

I had a terrible temper, I'd have attacked Ron (Levitate him, bashing his head against the ceiling repeatedly springs to mind) rather than running away to cry (then and now, I love teaching and have a tendency to lecture that is even greater than Hermione's). Probably Snape too, although his more subtle sarcasm would have gone right over my head.

I'd very possibly have literally tried to kill in blind rage both Malfoy (mudblood comment in 2nd year at latest) and Snape ("I see no difference"). I'd probably have, unfortunately for me, succeeded, too, at least in Malfoy's case.

As I've said elsewhere, if 11-year-old me was SIed into canon Harry Potter, I'd be dead or in Azkaban by Halloween.

*********** Thanks for elaborating! I think I get where you're coming from, and I take back and apologise for the insinuation that your view of Hermione was tainted by fanon.

I think that Hermione's reaction to Ron's words was very situational. In general, Hermione is outspoken and aggressive about what she views is the right thing. She ran off crying because,

1. What Ron said was true.
2. Ron didn't actually intend to bully Hermione; he sincerely didn't expect her to overhear. In fact, he was understandably reacting as a child would to being harrased by a classmate for two months.
3. Hermione had, in fact, been thinking that she and Harry and Ron were friends of sorts. Hectoring and unsolicited advice is how early-canon Hermione expresses friendship; and if she hadn't been thinking of them as friends, Hermione wouldn't have assumed that refusing to talk to them would be any kind of punishment.

Ron's words rapidly disabused her of that notion; Hermione had been shown in that moment that instead of befriending Harry and Ron, she had antagonised them. Worse yet, she didn't have the insight to even begin to understand why. This would be particularly intolerable to someone like her, who would have been accustomed to breaking down problems and systematically planning and executing solutions. Here, she didn't even know where to start.

And *that's* something to cry all day about.

** Unfortunately for you, I can refer you to the existing one, linkffn(Hermione in Ravenclaw by snow42). You would have seriously different dynamics in between The Trio, snow42 is right, that they may get together a way later (no troll), and the relationship would develop a way slower (not enough contact).

Yes, she would be probably be extreme loner, but on the other hand, it would be probably more acceptable among Ravens (there is nothing wrong in being introvert there).
