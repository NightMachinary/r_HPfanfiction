Can be about Hermione reacting to learning how the ministry works or Draco finding out about traffic lights, anything where characters take the reader on their learning journeys.


** I hate to self promote (I say, happily self promoting), but one of the main threads in my WIP is Dudley reacting to the wizarding world as he encounters it more as an adult.

Still a WIP, but I'm working on the penultimate chapter right now (and procrastinating doing so by posting this comment...)

  JK Rowling once said in an interview that she thought about having Dudley have a magical child on platform 9 3/4s at the end of book seven, but decided that no magical blood could survive contact with Vernon Dursley's DNA. In a long list of ideas she got wrong about what should happen to her characters post-canon, I've always thought that this was pretty near the top.Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he has an encounter that will uproot the course of his life, change his relationship with his cousin and his parents, and introduce him to some really fun new alcoholic beverages.Mostly non-ship focused, but there are plenty of relationships happening in the background. Despite my reservations, this mostly takes the Harry Potter epilogue as written, but makes a few significant changes the plot revolves around.

*** One of my favorites too. There's a short part in Coven by naidhe that's kinda similar, where Pansy runs away from her family and spends the holidays in the muggle world, I liked that too. Those two were what got me to write the request for more.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
