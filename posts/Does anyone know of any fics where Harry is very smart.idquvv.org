Or interested in studying or reading or whatever? It doesn't have to start in his first year or whatever. I just want to read a fic where Harry does really good in his classes other than averaging around an E. He only gets one O in his O.W.L.s even though he should probably be good at Charms (as most spells used in Defense are charms) and maybe even Transfiguration. I'm also interested in fics where he maybe even takes Ancient Runes or Arithmancy.

Thanks for any recommendations!

  Harry Potter wasn't stupid nor naive. He grew up having to look out for himself. Why would that suddenly change in the Wizarding World? But a snake in lion's clothing wouldn't reveal itself until it was to late to stop him. He wanted freedom, and he would get it. No matter what Dumbledore, the Ministry or Voldemort might think.

  "From his own experience, Harry knew that luck had never been on his side. At that moment he decided that he wouldn't rely on luck to solve his problems, he had to become smart, beyond the norm and talk his way through life. That's the only way he could survive."

  What if Harry woke up to his underperforming before his third year and decided to take his studies more serious? What if he was more observant and also decided to find out how Hermione got to take all classes offered? What if he took things into his own hands properly for once and didn't mess around so much? The answer: A wizard awakes to his true potential.
