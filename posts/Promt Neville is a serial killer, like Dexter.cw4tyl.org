If you saw the Dexter TVshow, then you remember why he became a psycho. His mother was violently killed and he witnessed that. Neville has a similar story: his parents were tortured to insanity, and he might have witnessed the whole process. That psychological trauma twisted him, like Dexter was. When he was 5 years old, "cousin Algie" discovers his nephews psychosis and decides to train him (for some reason it isn't curable by mind healing). The shy and plump half-squid is just a mask designed to mask Longbottoms true nature. The only person, who saw right through the disguise is Luna. But she decided to help her friend, rather than stopping him. So Neville kills pureblood bigots with impunity. And to make the deaths more insulting he uses muggle tools and scientific discoveries (imagine a grenade that emits harsh gamma radiation).

Additionally, I'd suggest that Harry and Hermione are the ones investigating the strange murders of purebloods. Either they are aurors on duty, or just concerned teenage students, it doesn't matter.

P.S.: please kill Malfoy and in Snape ;)))

  Disclaimer: I own nothing. Monsters exist in ordinary people. Ordinary people like Neville Longbottom. Warnings for very AU, dark! Neville, torture, and character death.

** Neville could be turning the bodies into fertilizer, using them to grow the plants in the Hogwarts greenhouses.

** Neville, do you happen to have some information on, y'know the purebloods? We are kind of trying to find out why and how they got killed.. We are very close to finding the murderer soo..

I responded by saying ''No, Harry, i'm sorry.'' But apparently the innocence look was ruined by my a bit glossy and crazy looking eyes. Then he performed legilimens on me, and somehow slipped past my defences.''

I raise my wand and say ''I'm sorry Harry, i really am, but this has to be done. Besides, now i can practice my obliviate'' I said with a smile. I intended the smile to get Harry to relax, because obliviate works so much better on relaxed victims. But it had the completely opposite effect. I really thought that people relax when smiling.. Oh, i'm getting carried away, he's escaping.

''Obliviate!''

** I like this. The only wrench I see is "Obliviate!". One spell and bye-bye Dark Passenger.

** What if he was like Kira Yoshikage. It would make for a good fanfiction.
