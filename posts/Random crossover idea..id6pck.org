Harry/Dresden Files crossover. Could be either a merged universe or a character somehow got transported from one universe to the other, though my preference is the latter, as the two have different enough magic systems to be fairly hard to merge well. Could be a prompt if someone wants to run with it, or just a basis for discussion.

During year two, while Harry is hiding in Borgin and Burkes, he accidentally bangs into a shelf, and a human skull falls off. Harry catches it on reflex- and the skull starts to talk to him, promising to serve Harry if Harry helps it to escape. Harry sneaks the skull out, and keeps it with him through that day's adventures, with Hagrid, the Grangers and Weasleys, the Malfoys, and Lockhart. That night, back at the burrow, Harry takes out the talking skull, who tells Harry that he was stolen by Mr Borgin, and that he is a spirit of intellect who has to serve whoever possesses his skull. His name is Bob. Yup, Bob the skull, former lab assistant to another, considerably more dangerous wizard named Harry.

Harry, seeing a parallel to Dobby, is uncomfortable with owning Bob, but Ron, who walks in part-way through this conversation, points out that such an entity could be dangerous, especially in the wrong hands (no doubt he's heard stories about dangerous artifacts from Mr. Weasley). They can't turn Bob in without exposing Harry for theft, and they can't let him go free. The only option is to keep him a captive, though Harry promises he won't make Bob do anything as long as he doesn't cause trouble. Bob offers to give Harry information in exchange for keeping him on a longer leash, and also because he has nothing better to do, and his years serving a professional busybody with a hero complex have rubbed off on him. So that year, Harry takes Bob to Hogwarts.

So, Harry now has his own powerful spirit advisor capable of possession to go up against Diary Riddle, and to help him in future adventures. Of course, Harry and Bob won't always see eye to eye- while Bob's personality is shaped somewhat by his skull's owner, so he'll be a bit more like 12 year old Harry Potter and a bit less like teenage Harry Dresden (and therefore less sex-obsessed/pervy than cannon, because you just flat-out couldn't have cannon Bob in a school full of teenage girls), he'll still be Bob. Bob is an ancient, highly amoral spirit of intellect, and he'll often be pushing Harry to do the more ruthless and expedient thing, rather than be the hero.

Hermione will likely distrust Bob at first, but be tempted by the extremely deep and detailed knowledge of magic that he possesses. If Bob's services are fully used, none of them will ever fail a test again. Dumbledore will likely suspect Bob, and I can see him sneakily confiscating Bob one night to examine him, but returning Bob after realizing that he's more of an asset than a threat (maybe asking Harry if he can borrow Bob sometimes to consult as well). Some other possibilities:

Bob is a disembodied spirit, so he can't directly attack a person (other than trying to possess them, which someone trained in Occlumency could probably resist). However, he has been shown to be a powerful combatant against other spirits. He can take on Diary Riddle or other Horcrux projections directly (or possess the Basilisk). Not sure if I'd have him able to outright destroy a horcrux though- that could make it too easy. Peeves would definitely be running scared, though. Might be able to affect Dementors too, if they're more spiritual than physical presences (they might also be extremely dangerous to him, since they eat souls and memories, and Dresden spirits basically are made of and gain power from memories). He'll also be an excellent spy.


** Awesome Idea... I would Love to see this done.
