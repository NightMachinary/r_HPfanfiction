Primarily things like Ginny tagging along with them.

Bonus points if Neville and/or Luna go too.


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=27958]["Harry Potter and the Deadly Heller"]] is a crossover with Buffy the Vampire Slayer and has Ginny awaken as a Slayer and go on the Horcrux Hunt

**** Ugh, I am almost done with Prince in the Dark Kingdom. 1.2 MILLION words. Holy shit. Least it was good for the first 110 chapters or so. Now it is a bit odd.

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

** Shameless plug for an old story of mine. What you're looking for takes place in the second half of this story, but it does happen. Ginny goes along with them.

**** The trio and Ginny go to Hogwarts until Christmas break, and then they basically go on the Horcrux hunt. Ron and Hermione become a couple early in the story, and Harry and Ginny get back together. Voldemort doesn't control the Ministry, nor Hogwarts. The Horcruxes are the same, and some plots of canon are the same, but there are changes. I hope you enjoy it :)

  She was framed for the murder of her best friend's parents, and her other best friend's brother. They placed her in Azkaban at the age of fifteen, and when they discover her innocence a year later, she's back and not taking anything from anyone. And maybe, just maybe, she'll get the girl she was in love with all along-that is, if she can forgive her.
