** lol, I want a (crack?) fic where it actually is the best school.

Beaxbatons teaches flowery magic, ettiquette, and dancing. No real magic, maybe personal care if household charms. Their dancing instructor is known for teaching the students certain... other moves and positions. Each student must try and please the giantess headmistress at the end of each year, and those that fail are turned into beautiful ice sculptures.

Durmstrang believes pain is the best lesson, and all their teachers are adept at torture. Charms teacher enchants items to attack the students on a daily basis, and loves to levitate people out the window, overlooking a deep cliff - students have been accidentally dropped, when distracted. The dark arts teacher ritually curses them with various curses, his favorite is turning the contents of their bowels to cockroaches after lunch, and treating them to dementors before and after each break. The healer just casts the tickling and cheering charm in great excess, although sometimes she overdoes it with one or the other - the best outcome in such a case is insanity.

** This is the case in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8643565/1/][Blue Magic]] It is due to the other schools being worse though, something about hogwarts prevents accidental magic. This is important because the the lack of emotional maturity and lack of control over the magic that teenagers have can be catastrophic. (accidental magic is triggered by strong emotions) So all the other magic schools in the world have to drug their students into a stupor to prevent it.

***** Well, it is technically possible, but why? Historically Britain was piss poor until the 18th or even 19th century. There's no gold, not much riches or it's population isn't that much denser from the rest of the world. Mind you, we're not comparing Brits to some 3rd world but continental Europe. There's no reason of such state of affairs other than blatant britocentrism on the part of the author

*** My headcanon is that the British Isles are in fact a population giant when it comes to wizards. The rest of Europe is satisfied with two schools the size of Hogwarts, All of sub-saharan Africa with only one,... for reasons unknown, the British isles have nearly 10% of the world's wizard population, and a muggleborn birth rate that dwarfs any other place in the world to boot.
