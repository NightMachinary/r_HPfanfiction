Please do shamelessly self-promote. I'm asking for it.

Basically, I want any fic of yours that is very much alive, whether you just recently posted a chapter or have a chapter that you're working on right now. Any genre is fine.

I ask because I just recently posted a chapter of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12610360/1/We-Harry-Potter][my own fic]] and I want to see what the rest of the community is passionately working on.


** I currently have three WIPs (oops?). Updates have been a bit slow to them recently because I've just started a new job, but all three are alive! I'm currently working on a chapter for volume 4 of the Chessmaster series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn). My other two WIPs are slated for updates soon as well. linkffn(Purple Like Violets by Flye Autumne; Requiem by Flye Autumne)

Sequel complete.

If you want an in dept review let me know and I will give you one but as of now I'm tired and have more fics to read. Anyway, is Severus going to painted in an unfavourable light?

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

** I'm currently working on Ciricnus, a fic set in 1984 in which Sirius's mother, Walburga, gets him out of prison and secures him a trial - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23559502/chapters/56518936]]

And I'm also working on The Dog Days of Summer, a fic set in 1970, which follows a summer adventure of Sirius and Regulus at their family's country estate. Magical creatures feature heavily in this one - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21737692/chapters/51857092]]

Ciricnus is definitely a more in-depth, emotional fic, whereas Dog Days of Summer is far more whimsical and just an amusing story to write, and, I hope, to read :)

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24304897/chapters/58589047][Reformation]]

I'll be updating the next chapter this week or next week.

Summary: (or what happens when Tom Riddle realises the potential of mind control)

"You may think that the best kept secret on Earth is the concealment of the magical world from the muggle one, and you would be wrong. Millions of witches and wizards know that secret. No, the best kept secret on Earth --one that only a select few know-- is the concealment of the muggle world from the magical one." - Arcturus Black

Seven years after he left the magical world, Sirius Black's grandfather contacts him to say that his brother has gone missing. Sirius reluctantly agrees to work with his family to solve Regulus' disappearance by helping decode his brother's journals. Meanwhile, ex-werewolf-soldier Remus Lupin is hired as a personal assistant for Black Enterprises, Narcissa Malfoy tries to convince her sister Andromeda to run for the House of Commons, and Harry Potter is bewildered by the appearance of a stranger at Number Four, Privet Drive.

Very AU. Divergence after Tom Riddle's graduation. (rated M for coarse language (courtesy of Bellatrix and Sirius) and brief descriptions of violence)

** linffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13586585/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Enigmatic-Professor-Riddle]]) is my first and currently only piece of fanfiction. It revolves around an AU where Tom Marvolo Riddle didn't go all dark and become Lord Voldemort - he instead chooses a slightly different approach to achieve his goals. This means that when he asks Dumbledore for the post of DADA professor, Dumbledore is quite happy to accept him.

Now as Harry begins his first year, Dumbledore is dead, Minerva is Headmistress and Tom is Deputy Headmaster.

Do let me know how you find it!

** That's an intriguing metamorphosis! I haven't come across a story with that premise yet.

I'm working on two stories currently and updating them regularly.

The first is a very, very long fic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16269131][Basilisk Eyes]] by Hegemone | T | [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16269131][AO3]] | [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13160266/1/Basilisk-Eyes][FFN]] | [[https://www.wattpad.com/myworks/208609546-basilisk-eyes][WATT]]. Harry is blinded by the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets and while the story is primarily about how he adapts and the friends he makes along the way, there are threats and Harry isn't the only one with a past that haunts him.

linkffn(13160266)

The second is a collaboration with BrailleErin called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22106113][Harry Potter and the Forgotten Lady]]. It is the third in the series. The first two were written by BrailleErin and are posted in full on ffnet (and she's posting them gradually on AO3). The first two in the series are: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6554218/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6673903/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Blind-Seer-of-Durmstrang][Harry Potter and the Blind Seer of Durmstrang]].
