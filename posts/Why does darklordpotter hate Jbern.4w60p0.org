** 1. What is with you and making posts about DLP?

2. They don't hate him. His works haven't aged well, and having people constantly call them the best in the fandom when there are others that are obviously better is irritating as all hell.

3. No, seriously, what is with your hard-on for DLP posts? Just, stop. None of us here like you anymore because of this shit.

EDIT: Forgot words.

** Ignoring the fact that this is a trolling shitposter, you do realize Jbern is a DLPer himself, right? Still even posts there occasionally (though mostly just to shill these days).

** I'm really impressed that you keep getting the same 3 DLP users to post in every single thread you make about them.
