I've read a few, but they're always unfinished and abandoned-since-2005. I especially like the ones where his parents hate him for some time (maybe AU Harry is a death eater, or AU Harry is dead, and they're like “how could someone portray as my dead son”) but they find out about all his personal baggage (orphan, abusive relatives, trauma, sad, dead people, blah blah blah, I think you get the memo) and he becomes part of the family.

Thank you!

All the best, Ela.


** The best one I know is How Like Home: linkffn(13507183)

Harry follows Sirius through the veil and ends up in a No-Voldemort AU with no way to get back. The Other Harry still exists, though, so the "you're not my son" angst is diminished a lot. Recently updated.

EDIT: Bot took longer than 50 minutes to pick it up, so direct link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22810651/chapters/54512623]]

EDIT2: Different direct-link since the fic's got 2 more chapters on AO3.

*** It's very well written, but I had to give up on chapter 3 once Harry started to have "they're mildly concerned about me, must be because I'm a pathetic nuisance" mental monologues.

YMMV, but it's not for me.

**** Just read it and I agree. I also found myself skipping over a good chunk of every chapter, because nothing ever seemed to be happening. Like why did I just read Harry despairing about what to choose for breakfast for paragraphs on end? The fic does focus heavily on Harry's relationship with the other dimension's Potters though, if that's primarily what you're looking for.

Does the relationship ever evolve beyond Harry mistaking their concern for annoyance?

****** Mmh in the fifteen chapters so far, not really. He does have the passing thought now and again that they probably really aren't like that at all, but these thoughts are promptly dismissed.

** Stranger in a unholy land, Dimension traveler, Keep your distance, The World's Gone Crazy, Stages of Hope, In Search of a Family,

these are one of the few that i can think now, unfortunately most of these are incomplete, but in this type of story is almost impossible find a complete story.
