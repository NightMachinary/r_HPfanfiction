So there is this fanfic I remember where Harry meets a physical manifestation of hogwarts in the room of requirement. Don't remember what name she is given. Also he meets the Founders through their portraits. Hogwarts trains him regularly and he sees himself improving, however, when talking to Godric he says that it isn't possible foe the woman to be hogwarts herself. He talk about a student in his time who was very powerful and somehow he binds her soul to the castle.

Can anyone help me out finding this fic? I hope I haven't gotten two fanfics mixed up here...

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
