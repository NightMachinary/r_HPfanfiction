Inspired by the "What if Vernon didn't hate Harry" thread by [[/u/ValirysReinhald][u/ValirysReinhald]]

For those unfamiliar with the concept, from Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  Tiger parenting is strict or demanding parenting. Tiger parents push and pressure their children to attaining high levels of academic achievement or success in high-status extracurricular activities such as music, using authoritarian parenting methods. The term "tiger mother" (虎妈 or "tiger mom") was coined by Yale Law School professor Amy Chua in her 2011 memoir Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. A largely Chinese-American concept, the term draws parallels to strict parenting styles typically enforced throughout households in East Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia. Since the rise of Amy Chua's memoir and the tiger mom phenomenon into the American mainstream during the early 2010s, the tiger mom has been a caricatured figure in modern Chinese society as well as in Overseas Chinese communities around the world. Chua's rise to fame quickly popularized the concept and term "tiger mother" spawning numerous caricatures while also becoming the inspiration for the 2014-2015 Singaporean TV show Tiger Mum, the 2015 mainland Chinese drama Tiger Mom, and the 2017 Hong Kong series Tiger Mom Blues. The stereotyped figure often portrays a Chinese mother who relentlessly drives her child to study hard, to the detriment of the child's social and physical development, and emotional well-being.

Tiger moms can definitely be abusive.

****** What you copied from Wikipedia is the essence of psychological abuse by the parents. I don't want to say that all those "tiger moms" do it on purpose, but it is definitely abuse. The way you want the question to be understood, indicates that this way of upbringing is acceptable, which it is not. Especially because most of those parents do not act like that because of their children's potential but want to project their children's future accomplishments onto themselves.

Whether it is a cultural thing or not, it is cruel and can definitely be labeled as abuse.

** For one thing, I don't think she'd let him go to a boarding school. If she were muggle, she'd likely browbeat Dumbledore into giving her a position on staff so that she could keep an eye on the kid. If she were a witch, she'd likely home school, and be an even bigger giant pain in the ass.

These types have no empathy, no human emotion. They view their little children as automatons, or some kind of reflection on their own abilities. Eventually the kid learns that not everyone is a fucking soulless monster, and cuts them out.

Oh, I know, I was raised by one, and now we're estranged.

I didn't say Harry wouldn't be emotionally/psychologically broken, though.

** I'd actually really want to read this. It sounds really fascinating. Honestly, it makes me crave a story where the dursleys are a full on "Tiger Household" and Harry is like the sterotypical top student from an anime, (Super smart and athletic with the odd sprinkle of emotional dysfunction) and He maintains that attitude throughout his life. I can picture Harry and Dudley being really close brothers in this setting with Dudley being a five man band style big strong emotional guy while Harry is the laser focused lean smart dude, while Vernon is a caring but somewhat distant stern father that nonethless fervently desires the best for his children and Petunia is (as the prompt says) a tiger Mom. Super stern and no nonsense when it comes to mischief and messing around, but super supportive whenever the boys do well and always pushing them beyond their limits.

The sort of thing where if anyone insulted Petunia in front of Harry or Dudley they would totally demand an instant apology (on pain of a beatdown) but at teh same time if someone insults Petunia to her face then the boys will just make sure any and all bystanders out of handbag range cause they know that their Momma doesn't take crap from anyone and could take on the gods themselves with her purse of ultimate doom.

** Having a tiger mum sucks ... I'have experienced it firsthand. But when you are in an environment where every single parent does this it became normalised where in western culture this would be widely condemned as abuse. But tiger mums do still love their children by the Chinese saying 打是爱骂是疼 which translate to basically use the rod to love the child and scold him to love him etc. It is a thing that should be changed but would probably not due to Asian culture. I have seen some who became very successful and some who gets broken by this type of parenting so it mainly depends on the child. In my opinion this type of parenting would be much more beneficial for Harry as children under the age of ten needs to have the discipline and drilled to be hardworking at everything he does to meet the challenges that Morty poses to him.
