** I'm shamelessly promoting myself üòÅ

How about a character/plot driven Harry/multi story with no smut whatsoever, that exclusively pairs him with older witches?

Harry/Black sisters

Harry/Fleur

Harry/Tonks

Harry/Minerva

Harry/Surprise

  A month after Dumbledore's death, Harry is depressed and wallowing in grief at Privet Drive. One night, shortly before his seventeenth birthday, Fawkes appears in his room, and whisks him away to a hidden stronghold. There, our hero meets the spirit of Godric Gryffindor, who takes Harry as his apprentice. Harry/Multi. Powerful, not godlike. Intelligent Harry. Ch 2 is NOT missing.
