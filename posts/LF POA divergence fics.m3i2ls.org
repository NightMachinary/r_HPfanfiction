Just fics where the ending of poa is different and this actually affects the rest of the story, maybe Sirius doesn't get saved or pettigrew doesn't escape or any number of different scenarios that actually impact the story going forward No bashing no over the top Indy Harry no slash


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22220911]]) Sirius is exonerated and adopts Harry. Lots of divergence, for example because Pettigrew doesn't escape, Harry isn't entered in the Triwizard Tournament.

  In which Harry goes to live with his godfather in the summer of 1994, Peter Pettigrew goes to Azkaban, and a lot of things change.
