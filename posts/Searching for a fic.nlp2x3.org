:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm searching for a fanfic I read years ago. The key things I remember are: -Harry was a mage -They used ley lines in the story and using the ley lines there was this meeting of the mages at Stonehenge that included Harry, Dumbledore, Voldemort, and others.

I also believe that at some point during this fanfic Harry and a group of others banished all of the dementors behind this giant sealed rock. But that is possible a different fic and I'm conflating.

Thanks in advance!!


** Hi! I think it may be The marriage stone! linkao3(10065443) It's a snarry fanfic, I remember reading it a couple of years ago and I really enjoyed it! It contains both the scenes you mentioned! Harry and many other powerful witches and wizards (Voldemort included) gather at Stonehenge on a magically charged night (Stonehenge was built on leylines) and Harry manages to imprison the Dementors underground (where the originate from) by sealing the exit with an enormous rock!

#+begin_quote
  To avoid the machinations of the Ministry, Harry must marry Severus Snape, who reluctantly agrees to protect the Boy Who Lived. But marriage to Snape is only the beginning of Harry's problems. Voldemort is on the move again, and before too long Harry's marriage may determine the fate of the world.
