** Where are your recs OP? I've been staying way from a ton of genderbent stories that are in progress and incomplete, so I'd have to say Amy Potter is Batgirl, cause I have a soft spot for humour. I liked Philosophize's other fics well enough, but I found them a bit clingy about the rails of canon, and didn't care for the [[/spoiler][weird spiritual love based rituals and some minor bits of unnecessary drama]].

I also read and liked the Black Princess series by Silently Watches when I was starting out, but now it feels super edgy and a bit cliched(WBWL+ manipulative Dumbledore). However, I'd rather reread the entire series than read Lily Potter and the Witches of Salem, which is just way too over the top with the smut. I still can't believe that a person can be /this/ into women.

Favourite fem Harry is The Pureblood Pretense series, and favourite femslash is Murder Most Horrid.

*** Okay I'm going to rant for a bit.

I agree with your assessment of the Black Princess series, but I found it super edgy from the beginning, and it was something I tolerated because a curbstomp is fun to read sometimes, and the magic system was interesting enough.

I just really wish the portrayal of Light vs Dark was done better. It's a trope I already don't like, but can be well executed. I want to see Jen fail and/or lose something precious to her because of her Dark/Black leanings, or someone from the Light triumphing because of their principles. We see Jen do some awful things, but the author never condemns it as a fault, but presents it as natural, inevitable even, and that the Light are fools for not seeing that.

The most recent chapter did it in for me. [[/s][Spoiler]].

It's been a while since I've read the entire series, but this was the impression I got. Rant over. Sorry about that, but after that last chapter, I really needed to vent.

**** It was my first WBWL and second manipulative Dumbledore fic, so I found the ideas new and more forgivable, so I was less harsh. I liked the various gods etc that were present as well.

I agree that she needs to fail at least once, and the people on the Light side need to reap the rewards of their allegiance, or be shown actively worshipping and acting rather than reacting.

However, I think the author does present her as evil straight up and unrepentant about many of the horrible things she does. He doesn't really justify it, she's just being pragmatic for the most part. IMO she is sort of like a teenage Henry Kissinger.

She's already lost quite a bit. [[/spoiler][She knows (now) that she was foolish in pledging herself to Death, and she does wish she hadn't done it as a kid. she's already paid the price with a lifetime and afterlife of service, which is a massive sacrifice. Not to mention second thoughts are at best useless, and at worst lethal]]She's too far gone to back out without consequences worse than death, and she's resigned to that. She decides that she may as well do what she wants in the meantime, and stick to the few principles she has left, whether good or bad.

***** I'd like to see her pragmatism backfire at least once, and sure, she's lost a lot, but nothing that truly shakes her, and makes her change as character.

Maybe that's the fundamental issue; Jen is Jen, almost exactly the same from the first chapter to the most recent. Nothing that's happened has ever caused her to even reconsider her principles, fatal consequences or no.

My main issue is the portrayal of the light. It's tediously one-sided, and the author's attempts to redeem them (with Lily, mainly) are transparent and falls flat.

That touches on the main reason why I just can't read most Dark!Harry fanfiction. The authors almost always seem to give tacit approval to what is happening. It's the worst when the protagonist - clearly speaking as the author - goes on a long rant on why being good is bad. No decent 'evil' characters think of themselves as evil (except maybe Voldemort, but he's insane, a caricature and not a protagonist).

I have absolutely no problem with dark/evil fiction in other works. GRRM for example does a wonderful job with his extremely objective writing. I'm free to form my own opinions without the author trying to nudge me into "see?! Being a ruthless asshole is totally awesome". Another good example is Breaking Bad, where Walt gets more and more despicable as the series progresses, we see most of it from his PoV yet it's always very clear that the authors are in no way applauding him.

In Dark!Harry there always comes a point where he (or she) does something truly unforgivable (like killing innocents in cold blood) and then rationalised it somehow ("I had no choice"), yet the story frames it in a way where this is a convincing argument instead of a sign of the character going insane. Maybe they fall in love with their characters too much (like the people responsible for "Dexter").

** The Long Game linkffn(11762909) and To Reach Without linkffn(11862560) by Inward Transcience both feature fem!Harry femslash.

The first is vastly AU, with excellent world building, though the exposition is quite heavy, and Charissa is an incredibly interesting character. The second follows Harry after an spurt of accidental magic turns him into a girl. Melantha Black is exhaustingly angsty, but after getting over it, is a fun character to read.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

  Peeves, though he was nasty about everything else--ickle firsties and orphan girls--got it immediately. For all six years of Harry's Hogwarts tenure, he dropped water balloons on the heads of anyone who misgendered her. Professor Binns never quite figured it out, but he didn't know any student's name. Nearly Headless Nick gallantly and somewhat awkwardly called her lady and tried to hold open doors for her, despite the fact that he couldn't open them. Snape called Harry "Mr. Potter" for all seven years that he was in Harry's life. Around year three, Ron stopped counting the detentions he got for his increasingly sarcastic responses to this.

  She was framed for the murder of her best friend's parents, and her other best friend's brother. They placed her in Azkaban at the age of fifteen, and when they discover her innocence a year later, she's back and not taking anything from anyone. And maybe, just maybe, she'll get the girl she was in love with all along-that is, if she can forgive her.
