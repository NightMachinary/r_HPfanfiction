/Harry and Draco meet in Madam Malkin's and instantly take a liking to each other./

/Just kidding. They don't, but Harry does get sorted into Slytherin, and they do become extremely good friends./

I devoured this fic. I don't normally read a lot of Drarry, but I wanted something new. 200k words and an incredibly slow burn. Harry is sorted into Slytherin, but we skip the rehash of the first few years. There are a lot of what ifs that are handled incredibly well and an amazing overarching theme.


** Binged this. Loved it! Any similar recs?
