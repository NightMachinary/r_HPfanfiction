***** A lot of people claiming it's a shame the woman got treatment and can no longer hear trees talk. Talking about how modern medicine destroys our link to the spiritual realm, talking about how people are too quick to squash out anything that doesn't fit societies definition of normality, talking about what if she were actually right, and was just better tuned into nature than us, etc etc.

I imagine they were removed because it's pretty dangerous stuff for a bunch of laypeople to be talking about. And some of it was joking around, so it probably broke the rules about the serious tag.
