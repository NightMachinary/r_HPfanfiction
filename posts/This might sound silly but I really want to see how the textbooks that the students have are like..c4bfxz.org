I've already gotten fantastic beasts, Beedle the Bard, and Quidditch through the ages, but I wish there was something like a potions, charms, or transfiguration textbooks. I wonder if there are any good fanfics like that? THank you.

** Textbooks are probably quite a lot more like storybooks or journals than muggle school textbooks. With the much lower population and a way lower amount of books printed, the book authors would probably have a much lower budget compared to the price of the books than with muggle textbooks.
