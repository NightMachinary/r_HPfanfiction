Looking for Mentor!Snape or Snape as a father figure fanfictions. Would be cool if Harry was sorted into Slytherin but not necessary. Thanks in advance!


** My personal favourite: A New Place To Stay by DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan. I like the stories of Debs in general :) all are on ao3 and ff.net.

** Linkao3(amethyst) The start of the A Very Slytherin Harry series.

Linkao3(Harry Potter's Second Chance) Probably my favourite fanfic ever.

Linkao3(A Brother to basilisks) This is so so good.

#+begin_quote
  Rev. version 2014 PLEASE READ! This combines ALL of the stories in the original Second Chance series: Harry Potter's Second Chance, Second Chance Take Two, Second Chance The Death Eater & The Rat. This is AU. Many chapters have had additions to the text or re-written to fix problems such as plot gaps, grammar, and punctuation. Takes place after Goblet of Fire. Harry de-ages himself, and Snape adopts him.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.
