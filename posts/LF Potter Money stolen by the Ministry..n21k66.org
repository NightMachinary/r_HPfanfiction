I just had an idea and I ask if there is a fanfic out there that use this idea : many fanfics show the Dumbledore the Weasley, or even Hermione stealing Harry money but what if they did nothing for once but the Ministry taking advantage that Harry was absent from the wizarding world and without anyone to defend him, froze, seize or literally steal the Potters accounts and properties. Be it by arguing successfully that he was raised by muggles and so unfit to the estate, or whatever other ministry made reasoning.


** Linkffn(Renegade Cause by Silens Cursor) Has something like this. The Potter vaults were sealed by the ministry after the first war and no one quite knows the real reason.. Mystery.

*** That one is excellent, the family vaults are sealed because of the Potters involvement with Nathan Cassane ( and his special ops group), after their involvement is public, even their own Judge could only make it that the vault could be unsealed by Harry James Potter.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

** Well, my fic mentions in passing that the Potter house in Godrics Hollow was turned into a monument by the ministry. And it contained most of the family belongings, except for the pile of money at Gringotts.

** The Ghost of Privet Drive - the Potter Estate goes into Wizard Probate, which is as bent as a nine bob note and is robbed blind by the pure bloods who run it.
