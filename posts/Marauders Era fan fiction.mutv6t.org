I am totally and completely in love with the marauders era! I recently have been reading a lot of timeturner fics but I can't find anymore!!!

I will read any marauders era fic and any ship either canon or original character or anything else!!!

Any recommendations would be really appreciated !!!


** - “Flowers by the Wayside” linkao3(23090008) ... story in progress, regularly updated, and really good
- “The Winds of Time” linkffn(6531542) ... one classics in the Marauders' era timeturner fix-it stories
- “Severus Snape and the Art of War” linkao3(18697885) ... another one, but very very very long (517,975 words), not boring, but really exhausting
- “Puzzle” linkffn(6622580) ... one of the best fanfiction stories of all, but very different from all others
- “Reboot” linkffn(9552519) ... another fix-it classic, very stereotypical Harmony, but not that horribly written (Dumbledore bashing, but not crazily so).

#+begin_quote
  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.

With his adult knowledge on the upcoming war hidden inside his 15 year old body, he finds his way back to Lily, and his new position in the wizarding world.[Story related warnings can be seen on the first page. NO character bashing!]

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY?? Spotify playlist:https://open.spotify.com/user/htl2006/playlist/3z2NbLq2IVGG0NICBqsN2D?si=Liyl_JKJSx2RUqks3p50kg(Compiled by amazing reader, JustAnotherPerson) DISCLAIMER: I do not support JK Rowling's disgusting transphobic views.NOTE: I AM NO LONGER READING OR REPLYING TO COMMENTS ON THIS FIC

** I'm linking Marauders era fics that solely involve the characters from that era, but I can also add some time travel back to the Marauders era fics if you're interested.

I highly recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24620707/chapters/59480275][*The Last Enemy: The Howling Nights*]] *by CH_Darling*, which is a new ensemble, canon-compliant Marauders Fifth Year fic. The Sixth Year fic will begin posting in June, and the series will go through the end of the First War. It's very clear how much effort and thought CH put into mining every detail she could from canon to figure out the characterizations. The Whomping Willow incident and its aftermath were beautifully written. I also really loved how she wrote the whole process of the boys becoming animagi, and it provides some of the best humor in the story.

These two are both about the summer Sirius left home and moved in with the Potters. They're pre-Wolfstar and very good.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11344203/chapters/25387245][*The Dog You Feed*]] *by JanuaryGrey:* When Sirius ran away from home he went to live with the Potters, but before he made it there he wound up lost, alone, and hurt in Muggle London. With James out of the country, Peter stuck at home, and Remus trapped by the full moon, it's Lily Evans (who hates his guts) that Sirius is forced to turn to for shelter and more advice than he could have bargained for.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12540852/chapters/28558256][*They're Hiding Inside Me*]] *by TheDivineComedian:* It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.
