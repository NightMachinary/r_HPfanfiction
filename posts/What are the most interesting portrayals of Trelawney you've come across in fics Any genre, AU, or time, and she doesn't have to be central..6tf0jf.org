I've come across a few myself but I'm painfully aware that it's probably only a drop in the ocean of fics that are out there. I definitely remember one that paired her with Mrs Figg of all people! On that point, don't get me wrong, I'm not looking for Trelawney centered or paired stories specifically, just a discussion/recommendations of fics where the author does something interesting with her character.


** My version of Trelawney that I'm working on is a proper Seer, but is very jaded about her Art after she couldn't prevent the death of her late husband. She feels her Sight is more of a curse than a blessing, and drinks to forget. Seers are at risk of being targeted by unsavoury characters, so she stays on as a teacher under Dumbledore's eye to stay safe, but has lost her interest in teaching since her husband passed.

*** I have a similar-ish take on Trelawney as well! She doesn't appear until chapter 8 of my fic (pre-written, just not posted yet) but she will have an important role linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn).

  Imagine Harry Potter raised under the guiding hand of Sibyll Trelawney. He arrives at Hogwarts versed in the higher arts of Divination, Arithmancy, Numerology, and Palmistry - you know 'real magic.' Prepare yourself for one humorous ride.

** You know what would be interesting? Trelawney portrayed not as a fraud, or a tragic character, but as a powerful player. Like, if Divination actually reliably works, it would be really powerful - sensory abilities and predicting future always is. You could make her a smug, seemingly omniscient Magnificent Bastard type, like Gaen Izuko from Monogatari or Tattletale from Worm.

** In linkffn(8257400) Trelawney doesn't appear herself, but when Harry learns of the prophecy, he demonstrates to Dumbledore how she theoretically could have faked the prophecy to get a nice cozy job. It's never said explicitly if the prophecy is fake, but I thought it was a nice touch.
