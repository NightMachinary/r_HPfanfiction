OBVIOUSLY SPOILERS ------------------

---------------------

The ending really surprised me. The entire last half surprised me.

I didn't expect Katie to die.

I didn't expect Harry to die before having a daughter.

I didn't expect Ron to die.

I didn't expect Hermione to die - trying to kill Harry.

I didn't expect Dumbledore to die by Harry's hand (even though it was obvious and planned)

I didn't expect Harry to get expelled

I didn't expect Harry to absolutely mutilate Malfoy and hang him in the Great Hall.

Damn this was a AMAZING story. Anyone else have any thoughts they'd like to share?


** I mean, the title alone should tell you what to expect. I personally found the story hard to read because it felt like I was trudging through chapters upon chapters of stilted, boring writing, and I'm talking about more than that one dumb line that always gets brought up. It's just hard to take seriously as a story, and that kind of ruins what the author set out to do.

**** Hermione doesn't get bashed a ton, Harry just isn't her friend and treats her coldly.

IMO the bashing is pretty light compared to other stories where the Golden Trio is broken.

Katie is a bit annoying, even at the end, but... I still liked her character.

IDK. The author did things I liked and things I didn't like. Overall it was good.

I've seen worse life and relationship decisions made in real life. Still infuruiating to read about though. We, or rather I, tend to read fanfiction so I can get away from that stupidity. Not see it played out all over again. SMH.

  The original epilogue to A Cadmean Victory before I decided to make the last chapter the epilogue and leave things hanging. Obviously it's just a single chapter and scene, but I thought I might as well share it as a separate story for those who wanted to see my version of the ending.

** Besides the whole Katie part, I enjoyed it all the way up to the last few chapters of the story. Seems like everything became very rushed and tbh I didn't like the relationship Harry had with Fleur. I liked reading about it, but something just seemed off the whole time.

That being said, check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10461539/BolshevikMuppet99][this author]]. Start with his first story and make your way through them all. Sounds like they'll be right up your alley.

***** Thanks!

Also, I never google any words that are in the title of a story, because it might give away details or give a hint to the events, which obviously it did here. TBH though, a lot of stories have titles that either don't relate to the story at all, or have a double meaning.

Thanks!
