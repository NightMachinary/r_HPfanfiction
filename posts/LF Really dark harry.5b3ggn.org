As the title implies, looking for dark, possibly insane Harry. Completed or in progress, I am not very regarding toward relationship, but it cannot be the main focus in the story.

If he can keep his allegiance a secret, and still lead a "normal" life for a while, that's a nice bonus to add.

Among the fic I've read:\\
* Paraselenic\\
* Death of Today\\
* A nightmare Man\\
* Birth of a Nightmare Man\\
* Descent into Darkness

Thank you very much

On another note, I'm also looking for a specific fic who takes time to set up as many cliche as possible, before unveiling them one by one. Saw it on this sub a few days ago, but can't find it.


** linkffn(10685852)

Also, why does it seem that harry always seems to bang voldy when they are both evil or he raises him? I can't get over that bit and cannot read those fics for the sheer rapieness of the story, its honestly disturbing in a not good way.

**** I read Paraselenic when I really was not into slash, and just skipped the lemon scenes. It went rather well and I did not miss many things, or, at least, nothing centric, as it's not quite the focus of the story.

Death of Today and Descent into Darkness have the relationship a bit more centric to the plot (a lot more in fact), but Par

*** I can get over Slash if it's done well (Paraselenic was done well, Falling into Darkness, I managed to get over it. And Death of Today is so far from Harry Potter that I can't even imagine Izar as HP) But raising Harry and then fucking him? Yea... no.

And Yeah, I know of Pale Horse, it's amazing, I just wished the author would update faster :(

You might like linkffn(The Nightmare Man), involves a very dark, insane harry who allies himself with Voldemort, but there's no slash involved.

** With respect to evil Harry stories, you might enjoy some of the following stories. They mostly focus more on psychological, character driven horror than outright blood and gore. They're also relatively quick to read, so you shouldn't have any issues digesting these stories:

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3375683/1/Gaslight][Gaslight]]/ by BellonaBellatrix | linkffn(3375683) : A post-DH Ginny-centric story of psychological horror and suspense that explores the phenomenon and concept of "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting][gaslighting]]," where Ginny's grasp of reality is progressively assailed, as primarily seen through interactions between Ginny and Harry.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/982805/1/][Ruined in a Day]]/ by Net Girl | linkffn(982805) : A sixth year and on oneshot that explores Harry's psyche and relationships as he becomes colder, more ruthless, more Dark over time, goaded on by forces both external and internal. This is the the first part of a series of oneshots that explores Harry's descent, followed up by /[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/998830/1/][Sea of Sin]]/, /[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1012428/1/][Black Celebration]]/, /[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1053367/1/][Examination of Conscience]]/, and concluded with /[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1327830/1/][Through a Glass, Darkly]]/. These were written prior to the /Order of the Phoenix,/ but I think if you enjoy reading Dark Harry stories at all, you will definitely enjoy these.

/[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=750393&postcount=73][Intoxication]]/ by nos tres reges: A portrait of a deeply disturbed Harry, who stalks and obsesses over Daphne Greengrass. While the pairing between Harry and Daphne is front and center here, it is used to explore and develop Harry's burgeoning darkness. Unfortunately taken off of FFN, so you'll have to download the attachment in the link provided. (You may need DLP membership, which is free to obtain)

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11564067/1/The-Last-Enemy][The Last Enemy]]/ by Luolang | linkffn(11564067): A post-DH divergence oneshot that attempts to sketch out a route through which Harry, via his canonical character traits, hopes, dreams, and fears, might descend into darkness on his own terms. /Disclaimer/: I wrote this story, as you can see.

**** I had partially written a follow-up multishot to /The Last Enemy/, where Harry comes back to Britain as a very changed individual after several years. It would be a Hermione POV though, with Harry acting as the main antagonist. (Though Tom significantly features as well...)

However, I ultimately nixed the idea because I feel that /The Last Enemy/ largely accomplishes what I intended it to: it shows a somewhat plausible path by which Harry could turn to darkness through the very traits that served him so well in canon: his love for others, his determination, his "saving-people-thing," etc.

It might be interesting to read about Harry's journey into darkness with Tom, or his plans when he returns to Britain, but I felt that such a story wouldn't have much of a point or focus behind it. The ending to /The Last Enemy/ was deliberately left open-ended in that the actual nuts-and-bolts of the plot itself aren't as important to the story as exploring the themes aforementioned and any addition to the story would probably be beating a dead horse at best.

That said, I have planned out and likely will write a trio of oneshots in the future that explore similar themes, sort of spiritual successors to /The Last Enemy/ instead of a proper sequel, so you may want to keep an eye out for that at least.

** Applying the /Dark!/ treatment to Harry is a very delicate procedure. linkffn(Lesser Evils) succeeds where many fics of its kind fail. Aside from being well-written, it approaches the more sinister leanings of Harry's personality without morphing into the unrecognisable suave psychopath that thousands of stories attempt to emulate.

I do want to say that Paraselenic is one of my guilty pleasures. There were a few parts that didn't really do it for me but I had this huge phase where I loved vampire!Harry more than anything else in this world.
