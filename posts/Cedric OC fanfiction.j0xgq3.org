:END:
Hi all, years ago I read an amazing fanfiction on FFN about a girl ( I believe her name was Amber) and she was a member of the golden quartet. Her wand contained a special phoenix feather which gave her extra strong magic and strong abilities.. it's a Cedric OC story. I can't find the fic anymore.. does anyone know where I can find it?
