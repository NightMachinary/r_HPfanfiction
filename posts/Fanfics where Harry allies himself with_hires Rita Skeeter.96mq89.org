** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past]] It doesn't happen right away, but Harry strikes a deal with Rita where he gives her exclusive interviews, as long as she prints the truth. It's a Harry from the future, so he's a lot smarter and more powerful then he should be.

*** Yeah, I was a bit surprised by how cooperative Rita was about things like writing for the Quibbler, given her canon reaction to the idea. But given the differences in their interactions, I let it slide as plausible. It's an awesome fic.

BTW you can get a better link using linkffn and then the title in brackets.

** There is this very strange fic. It's a bit disturbing and not consistent, but it developed Rita Skeeter into a different path than most authors do. It has a lot of problems, but I like the originality.

  If there's one thing Rita Skeeter is good at, it's sniffing out a story, and when she sees a downtrodden Harry Potter at King's Crossing, by Merlin does she find a story! One that will change the face of the Wizarding World, Harry Potter, and even Rita herself. Harry was always more Slytherin than Gryffindor, really, and with someone to grow those traits...they won't see it coming.

** Prince of the Dark Kingdom has Harry and Rita as allies, but you have to read like 700k words to get to that part.

** If I remember correctly it happens in "Midnight Gold The Rise Of The Forgotten Lord" in a very intersting way. Sadly it's abandoned.
