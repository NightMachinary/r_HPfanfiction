Well I'm honestly just looking to see if there are any out there? I've looked but only seen a few crack fics in not just the hp genre, but in others too. I'm looking for them because well.... I'm trans I want to see if there are any fics because I want to. So really any fics that fall into one of the above, but I'd like it a lot of anybody has any recommendations where Harry is the main character and while I know it's not this Fandom does anybody have any idea if there are any in the Narutoverse?

What are your thoughts on this types of stories anyways?


** Pureblood Pretense series. One of my favorite active fics at the moment; AU where fem!Harry pretends to be a male pureblood in order to attend Hogwarts. Really explores some neat ideas about potions and magic in general.

** Ah, finally found the one that tacles this Topic best I think:

"Red Headed Stepchild". Very mature, slow-burn, and with an emphasis on the psychological Impact as well as the reactions from society.

***** As as non trans person and Sirius/Remus super fan I liked it.

I felt that Sirius was a little /too/ accepting though? Like, it was very sweet that he wasn't pushing Remus into anything, but I feel like it would be a little more realistic (if only for the character) if it showed him being a little frustrated from time to time.

Good fic overall though.

** Transgender is part of the plot of "Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool".

I think it's also a Topic in "Holly Evans and the Spiral Path", though it's been a while since I read it.

There's also "Harry & the Mysterious Curse of the Girl who lived". Crossdressing qualifies there I think.

"Effects and Side Effects" has a Harry who gets turned into a girl, not certain how much of an Impact this has though.

Also, check: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2ch650/looking_for_transgender_harry_fanfics/]]

** The ones I've read and like have all been linked here (all three of 'em!), but it brought up a thought about cross-dressing!Harry. I don't think it would be much of a stretch for Harry, canon childhood or not, to see all the magical folks running around in Dresses on his first trip to Diagon, decides that if he's gotta wear a dress, he'll wear the PRETTIEST dress at least. This is backed up by Hagrid, who wears woodsman-style clothing and an enormous (if-not-cow)leather jacket, and Dumbledore, who always wears the brightest, most colorful, or most /magical/ dresses of any wizard, and he is apparently the Greatest Wizard in the World. If those two can be on the extreme ends of the spectrum for clothing, from Manliest Attire to Prettiest Dress, and Harry who at 11 years old cannot even begin to grow enough of a beard to emulate Hagrid could decide to take a leaf out of Dumbledore's book and then head to the muggle world for something that isn't hideous.

Or as the HP as Harveste Addams did, and that there are so many places to hide knives and weapons in/under a dress, and stylish jewelry can contain any number of magically concealed/transformed things.

** There are lots of Harry as a girl, almost never by choice, sometimes from the beginning so its not even a transgender just a gender swap. I think the only reliably transgender fic you will find will be written by transgender.

Unfortunately I have no interest in the genre so I can't name any authors...

For Naruto, almost every overpowered Naruto talks about his henge being an actual transformation and he usually abuses his female form at some point or another. If you look you will find plenty of Naruko fics. I've read some of these and they were entertaining. Still not really trans though...

I've not seen crossdressing main characters in any fic unless you count a ninja trick or polyjuice, not as a lifestyle choice.
