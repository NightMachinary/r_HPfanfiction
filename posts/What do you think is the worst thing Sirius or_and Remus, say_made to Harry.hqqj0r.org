I was thinking about Harry, Remus and Sirius relationship. In canon and fics.

I read some fanfics where was a lot of Remus/Sirius bashing that let me wondering. How bad uncle/godfather/his father friend really were Remus and Sirius?

Pd: ehm... I think that my syntaxes is atrocious today, sorry. English is not my native language.

They weren't bad. Like, not bad at all. There's a reason that canonically Harry doesn't have a problem with either of them (temporary frustration at Remus when Remus screws up aside). Harry called for them, and only them, alongside his parents when he himself was facing death. There's a reason for that: Harry loved them and considered them part of his decimated family of origin.

Remus-bashing fanon has decided that he somehow had an obligation to barge uninvited into the life of a child whose guardians did not want anyone of his "kind" in their life. Oh, and he should do this while living an impoverished existence with a barely controlled chronic illness. And the child has no idea who he is. And the child's parents never gave him any title or rights with respect to the child. And the child is supposed to be hidden from the wizarding world, rule enforced by the most powerful wizard in modern history who has a spy parked in Harry's neighborhood.

Remus' worst sin was not revealing that Sirius was an animagus or the existence of the tunnels into Hogwarts. It was a breathtakingly cowardly and selfish decision. He didn't do that AT Harry, though, and the lasting effects turned out to be positive. I guess it's a corollary that he tried to guilt Harry into not risking his life needlessly by invoking the names of his dead parents... but I don't think that's very bad either. He was, you know, trying to keep Harry alive and guilt was the only weapon in his arsenal.

Remus wasn't close to Harry the way Sirius was. He was a good teacher and was forging an adult friendship with Harry at the time of his death. He had no obligation to be more. He was Harry's father's friend.

As for Sirius, I suppose if you favor the movies over the books (I don't) he didn't know who Harry was. If you favor the books over the movies, Sirius clearly DID know the difference between Harry and James and was insulted when Molly implied otherwise.

Sirius' worst sin was losing his head and tracking down Peter instead of telling the world what Peter had done, resulting in Harry going to the Dursleys. And let it be said: up until the end of Harry's third year, Sirius honestly believed that Harry was happy with the Dursleys and would want to live with them given the choice.

After Azkaban, Sirius put Harry first at every single turn. He put his life in danger and lived off rats in a cave to be close to Harry. He imprisoned himself in a house full of reminders of his abusive childhood to support Harry. He listened quietly when Harry needed to talk something out. He admitted his own faults when he fell off the pedestal Harry had placed him on. He trusted Harry enough to let Harry trust him back. He went running to his death in an attempt to save Harry's life.

Remus was sometimes a self-pitying coward. Sirius was sometimes reckless and bitter. They were both funny and loyal, smart and loving, and capable of tremendous feats of physical bravery. They weren't bad to Harry. Bashing is just bashing, whether it's Molly doling out love potions, Ron unable to string two words together, Remus abandoning Harry for shits and giggles, or Sirius refusing to recognize Harry as a being independent of his father.

*** I largely agree with you, but in relation to Sirius I will add:

He was horrible to his house elf (actually kicked him).

He was emotionally manipulative to Harry at one point saying "James would have thought it fun" when Harry (responsibly) refuses to go to Hogsmeade.

He is rude and immature with Snape (and Snape is back, but still).

I like Sirius and I think he loves Harry, but I do think the books imply that Sirius sees Harry as sort of an alter-James. He says" he's not a child" at one point in OOtP but Harry is only 15...he is a child. And as exampled above, he sometimes wants Harry to behave the way that James would.

Quote from JKR:

I see Sirius as someone who was a case of arrested development. I think you see that from his relationship with Harry in 'Phoenix.' He kind of wants a mate from Harry, and what Harry craves is a father." [Read the whole quote from the Leaky Cauldron, 2005]

**** In fairness he's a 15 year old who's fought the dark lord more times than anyone in the room, he certainly doesn't need sheltering from what's going on.

Oh and Kreacher was honestly just a horrible person for the entirety of Sirius' life, of course he was horrible to him, this is the elf that parroted the mother he ran away from as a teenager and would have gladly sold the entire order out to Voldemort if he'd been allowed to.

** Sirius: "you're less like your than father than I thought..."

Remus: “Don't expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you take Sirius Black seriously. But I would have thought that what you have heard when the Dementors draw nearyou would have had more of an effect on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry. A poor way to repay them --- gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks.”

I'm less forgiving of Remus due to the fact that he was hiding that the mass murderer was a fucking animagus.

*** Yeah I'm sure it was for “plot reasons” but it was literally one of the dumbest and most negligent thing ever thing ever.

It worked out since Sirius was the “good guy” all along, but Remus actually thought he was a murderer out to get Harry and still withheld the information.

** Remus:

Oh boy, there is a lot you can say here, but I think that never being there sums it up pretty well. Neither before Harry came to Hogwarts, nor during his 7 years there. And guilt-tripping Harry about his dead parents while never mentioning what he knew about Sirius more than cancels out any good "karma" he might have earned that year.

Sirius:

Honestly, I don't see anything for which you can really blame him. Pettigrew was still around and on the loose, say what you want but he was dangerous (just ask the Muggles he blew up with one spell). So hunting him down was not stupid, Sirius left Harry with someone he trusted and being unlawfully incarcerated isn't something any sane person would blame you for. And during Hogwarts (basically GoF), he did more than anyone else for Harry despite the warrant for his immediate execution. If you really want something, not jailbreaking Harry from the Dursleys, but that would not have been a good life for Harry.

*** I can forgive Sirius for anything because despite being deeply traumatized and almost completely broken he managed to gather enough of his mental facilities to go after Pettigrew because he was worried about Harry. He could've escaped years earlier but he only did so after realizing Wormtail was hiding in Hogwarts with his godson. Not only that, this man came back into the country he was being hunted and lived off of rats (poetic justice) in order to be there for Harry during GoF. He also managed to communicate his Harry using like tropical birds. He also bought him a fire old despite being a known fugitive. Yeah Sirius had some flaws, but he loved Harry and tried his best to care for him. He's the closest thing to a dad Harry got, he wasn't perfect but who has perfect parents?

Remus tho....I could go on for hours on how I hate that coward

** Yep, Remus never being there, always having excuses, playing the victim constantly. Can be a coward and prefer to leave the hard decisions to other people as to avoid any responsibilities. I do love him but I usually pretend he has a better relationship with Harry though. In the 3rd book, when he shames Harry by saying that taking risks is a poor way to thank his parents for their sacrifice has always made me so angry. Like, I would have snapped right back at him to keep his opinion to himself, that children who lose a parent do not "owe" them to be perfect constantly. It's about living their life to the fullest.

Sirius fiercely loved Harry I think, no question there. But I think he was deeply traumatised by James' death (imagine being 21 and finding the corpse of your best friend). And he never had time to properly mourn and grow up. His mental development wasn't going yo happen in prison.. So the worst thing he did to Harry was, in my opinion, that he never truly knew him or got to know him for who he was. It was always about James.

** ok, so Remus, never ever checked on Harry when child. Sirius is excused because of Azkaban, but even then... he chooses to go on a revenge hunt instead of taking care of Harry. it is also obvious that Sirius could have escaped for quite some time. but he only chooses to because of Wormtail. it was never his main objective to even meet Harry. even after he escapes, he isn't trying to contact him. he is only after the rat the whole year. the only time is in privet drive before the knight bus comes. Sirius also calls Harry "James" and pretty much pretends he is James. he is also buying his love (firebolt). also, not to Harry, but if you need bashing material, he is terrible to Kreacher. I always found it funny that the quote: "if you want to know what a man is like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals." is his, because ... Kreacher.

ok, now I'm not sure, it could be from fanon, but I think Harry had to practically beg Remus to teach him patronus and he was never behaving as his friend. I don't remember them exchanging any letters at all. he was owling with Sirius, but Remus?

eh, Sirius has much more bashing materials. but I don't think there even was a Remus and Harry relationship unless you count the patronus lessons. and those were more teacher/student.

Wrong. Canon is pretty clear that Sirius had basically given up due to dementors and needed to see Pettigrew to have the motivation to suffer through the escape. He thought that Harry was safe, his job complete.

No other adult does lift a finger to help Harry, I find it odd that you mention this as something against Sirius.

The unlawfully incarcerated and tortured man vs the walking pity party is not even a contest.

Which is the reason you can take a big dump on Lupin based on his canon inactions without even coming close to bashing.

**** I don't know why everyone assumes he went after Wormtail for revenge! He kept saying “He's at Hogwarts.” I thought in the books that it was pretty clear he went after Wormtail because he was worried that the rat had access to Harry. Yeah he wanted to kill the traitor, but he only cared to escape and do so because he knew Harry was in danger. The first thing he did after escaping was go to Privet Drive to catch a glimpse of his godson! He also watched the Quidditch game where he fell, knew it was partly his fault and made up for it with a broomstick that must've been hard to buy as a wanted fugitive. After he sends letters to the kid using tropical birds! Then he moves back to the country where he's being hunted and lives off of rats in order to be there during goblet of fire, despite the fact that he knew they couldn't meet much in person. He also bought a present while being a fugitive! Yeah Sirius made mistakes, and Grimmauld place made him stir crazy (it was basically another Azkaban for him). But the fact is he was the only adult who put Harry first. He was the only adult that truly loved Harry with his whole heart. Yeah Sirius had his flaws and serious issues, but he loved Harry and for that I can forgive anything

**** I mean, Remus even tries to abandon his own child, lol. but he is in all a pretty shitty person, not only with relation to Harry.

I don't know, I don't like any of them much. Sirius mostly because I like Kreacher and tbh, he wasn't really that much present in the books either. of course, any of his flaws can be excused by his mental health after Azkaban. it was just too bad for Harry to lose a parental figure.
