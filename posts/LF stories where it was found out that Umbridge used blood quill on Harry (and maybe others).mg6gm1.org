And maybe stories where people realized she was the one to place the Dementors at Harry's relatives?

  One-shot. Takes place in the middle of OotP. Over Christmas holiday at Grimmauld Place, Harry finds himself unable to keep the nature of his detentions with Umbridge as secret as he would like from the adults who care about him.

  Harry doesn't want anyone reporting what Umbridge is doing to him in detention. But that doesn't mean Hermione has to just sit by.

** One of the Jacobapples fics has this: Harry grabs the quill during detention, holds it above his head and sprints for McGonagall with Umbridge chasing him through the halls. He ends it with a home-run slide under the desk in the transfiguration classroom. I think it was 'Easier Than Falling Asleep'?

I'd link it from FFN, but the formatting is garbage because laziness. If interested, grab it from [[http://ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=jacobapples&sort=title][HERE]] and pick the older version to get actual chapters.

** There's one I read part of where Harry tries to report it, only for the Ministry to twist things around. They claim Harry's been cutting himself, and use that plus their earlier claims of mental instability to lock him up in Saint Mungo's. He ends up getting aid and support from /Lockhart/ of all people. I think it was called something like "The Dark Mark wouldn't match her pink cardigan."

It was pretty dark, mostly notable for deconstructing the "Harry reports his torture and it fixes everything" trope.
