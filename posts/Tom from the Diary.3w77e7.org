** Not using the bot due to Spoilers: [[/spoiler][A Black Comedy by nonjon]].

That's the obvious one. It's my favorite story hands down.

** - It happens in linkffn(10402749), I believe.

- IIRC, it also happens in the second story of the linkffn(9045882;9672145) duology.

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.

** It might not be what you have in mind exactly since it is ridiculously AU and it doesn't address the 'war era', but linkffn(Ice Crux; Dawn Crux) is a two-part story where this is kinda featured at some point. A soul-fragment Tom---though I am not sure if it is the diary one or someone else---eventually comes back to life and... stuff happens.

About the story: post-war dystopian world where Voldemort has won. It starts off a little bit like Prince of the Dark Kingdom but then veers off. First chapters are a little awkwardly written, however the writing gets better. Finally, it is labeled as complete, but the ending is very very abrupt.

All of my notes on this might not be exactly spot-on since it has been ages since I read it, but it is a pretty good story as far as I remember.

Has Diary!Tom featured as a main character IIRC. Haven't read it in a few years, so I don't remember if the story had ever got to the war yet, but there is Tom at least.
