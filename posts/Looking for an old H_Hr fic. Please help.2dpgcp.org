Hi everyone,

I've been searching for a H/Hr fic I read a few years ago. I can't seem to find it and was hoping someone would recognize it:

- Post war
- Harry left England after the war and became an auror of some some sort (I think)
- Hermione's life is threatened and Harry comes back to protect her. She's slightly upset to see him because he had left with not much of a goodbye.
- I remember a specific scene in the beginning where Harry is in the dark at Hermione's apartment and scares her accidentally.

**** Just finished reading it. Okay suspense/tension, but unfortunately it is apparently only part 1, and no signs of part 2. Also Hermione is too week, bursting out crying every chapter.

**** if it is, I'm much better at this than I thought lol. you're very welcome. I know there's another similar Hermione-goes-to-uni-and-Harry-disappears fic out there, though I'm not sure I'll find it even if I've already favorited it.
