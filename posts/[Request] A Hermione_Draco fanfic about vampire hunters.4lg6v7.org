Hello, first time here. I read this Hermione/Draco fanfic many years ago. I remember some of the plot, but not the author and title. After Hogwarts school years. Draco and Hermione are both vampire hunters. Hermione's hair was red-ish, because she drank a lot of fire whiskey with the Weasley Twins, who are her new best friends. She shoved Harry and Ron in the Black Lake, many times. Lucius Malfoy is like the king of vampires or something, but he is the villian. There is a book of importance. Draco and Hermione trapped between two invisible walls in Hogwarts. Something about Hermione saying she would rather have a root canal then be with Draco, and Draco did not know what a root canal was. Hermione and Draco team up, killing vampires, falls in love, and have a daughter in the end. I Googled for it, but I can't find it. Maybe it doesn't exist anymore. I hope not, it was really fun to read. If anyone have any ideas I would be most grateful. Thank you :)


** This sounds super fun! I hope someone comes through!
