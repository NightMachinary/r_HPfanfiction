I had a thought where Harry would be the bookworm, Ron would be the one with issues, and Hermione would be the loud one. Alternatively, Harry could be studious and Hermione could have been abused.

Just putting that out there.


** Personally I'd like to see the Hogwarts gang turn into the SOS Brigade. Harry would be Haruhi, the insane and brash leader with phenomenal cosmic power that drags everyone else along. Ron would be Itzuki, enthusiastic on the outside, crippling self doubt and Harry worship on the inside, and the only one with easy access to magical knowledge. For Hermione we have Kyon; the exasperated everyman who isn't fully in on the madness but is secretly super into it despite the facade, and really wants some magic to play with.

Of course we still need our fanservice girl, which would of course be Ginny as Mikuru. Bonus points if she is actually a time traveler who is trying to avert catastrophe. And because they're both odd and withdrawn, Lunu can be Yuki. Extra bonus points if all of Luna's canon fantasy trips like nargles and heliopaths turn out to be real but this time she's trying to keep it all hidden least harry find out and destroy the world.

** I think someone linked a fic here a few weeks ago where Ron was the bookworm (Percy is his idol), and Hermione is the popular girl. Let's see if I can find it again

**** I can't find it! I've gone back ten days here. I wish I saved it! Basically, Ron is a bookworm who wants to leave Britain for an ICW internship with the MACUSA. Hermione is on the Quidditch team and everyone has a crush on Harry's sister, who is beautiful, smart and popular. Ron is practically obsessed with her. It wasn't my type of fic so I tapped out three chapters in. In my search I found a Ron is the Boy Who Lived fic linkao3(8158447)

  What if Ron was the know-it-all bookworm while Hermione was the lovable prat? In a world without Voldemort, seventh year Ron Weasley is on a mission to enjoy his last year at Hogwarts while trying to ask his crush out. Hermione Granger wants to do well for her NEWTs and ask her crush out. Can they help one another? Non-canon obviously, with some characters being OOC. Chapter 18 up.
