Reading about SI helping the characters and trying to prevent deaths and sorrow is noble and all, but... not gonna lie, I'd just try to take over the world if I finally found myself having magic.

Any SI stories where whoever enters the Potterverse more or less ends up becoming a Dark Lord? I remember an amazing fic about someone waking up as Voldemort, but it's not finished and wasnt updated in ages.

Thanks!


** I'm planning to have mine gradually develop from "gotta stop Voldemort" to "wouldn't it be nice to rule the world?" to "yeah, it totally is nice to have complete control" but given my current writing pace we'll probably get there by 2100.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

After all, someone has to deal with any new (or old) up and coming Dark Lords and the British Wizarding World.

** Oh, I know this one story where the MC pretty much changes his brain with magic to get telekinesis and perfect memory (obviously) and magic eyes too I think. Anyway, he goes on to find hermione and for some reason a rando OC.

I don't remember what happened during school years, something about the MC making a thingamabob that collects gold from the sea.

It also shoe-horns the jurassic park book into the hp world so the rando OC actually has something to do. a.k.a. clone dinos in a magical submarine.

By the end of the story the MC pretty much owns australia and owns the best internet/tech provider. He also made a dimensional portal where he steals tech from other worlds. I remember he stole the tech from the movie chappie, then he goes to the GATE dimension and that's where I dropped it.
