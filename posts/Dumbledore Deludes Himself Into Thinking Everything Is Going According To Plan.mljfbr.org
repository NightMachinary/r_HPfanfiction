So basically Harry is going dark/hates Dumbledore/is not a hero/is not selfless or all of the above but Dumbledore convinces himself Harry is a hero/the savior/etc.

If Harry doesn't save the stone Dumbledore assumes Harry is very smart and knew the stone wasn't in danger. If Harry goes to save the stone but the stone is missing Harry destroyed it because he knew that was what Dumbledore would want (but what really happened is Harry took it for his own use or couldn't get to it because he didn't want it for the right reasons).

If Harry makes friends with Malfoy and seems in agreement about muggles infecting wizard society etc it's because Harry is trying to get close to the enemy and not because he really hates those muggles Dumbledore left him with.

Basically anything that seems to indicate Harry isn't going down the path Dumbledore planned, the headmaster brushes it off in the most delusional way possible. Extra points for Dumbledore doing the same with other character “Snape doesn't hate teaching or children he's just trying to uphold his cover as my Death Eater spy despite me never telling him to be mean to children and the fact that if I told him to be nice all he has to do is tell Voldemort I was going to kick him out of Hogwarts otherwise. Oh Severus you kill me when you say you hate Harry Potter! Hahaha.”


** Don't know of any Delusional!Dumbledore fics that fit your description, but I do know of a hilarious Delusional!Grindelwald story.

Reformed, Returned and Really Trying is fucking hilarious, and oh boy is Gellert delusional. It's amazing, give it a try.
