** Either a snake or dead loved ones. I have no idea how I would defeat it though.

** My mother. I don't know how I could imagine her to be funny in any way. I have never understood how anyone could do that for their honest to god worst fear in life, and I have never liked the boggart concept because of this. If I could imagine she was dead or something instead of /trying to make her funny,/ then I could easily defeat the boggart of her. So I guess if I was a witch faced with a boggart I would just throw a Killing Curse or a Blasting Curse at it.

** I would love to read a story where someone can make their boggard disappear. Or simply make their bow and retreat.

I think I would laugh uproariously if my boggard just made a bow and retreated to be honest.

** It would be a version of me, though what exact version, showing what exact fear, I honestly cannot say; I did narrow it down to a few possibilities, but in the end I just cannot imagine them actually happening, not with full consequences of that happening, and as such cannot get from few to just one.

And I have no idea how I would, or even could, deal with any of them since I see no way of linking any of that to anything funny. I guess I'm someone who sucks at facing boggarts.

** We've been shown that a boggart can get pretty fucking specific with both physical and abstract concepts. The moon for Lupin, or Molly's dead children, for instance.

Honestly, though, I doubt most people really /know/ what they're most afraid of. It's such a difficult thing to think about. There are a lot of horrible things or situations that I can imagine, but I'd be hard-pressed to narrow down which are /worst/, let alone I even /thought/ of it.

I imagine boggarts are some horrible mockery of the Mirror of Erised. It drags the true answer from your subconscious - your understanding or forethought of it being entirely irrelevant.

Sincerely, I believe this is one of the best concepts that Rowling hit upon in her series. It was the perfect time to introduce them. Third year, just when the series started to take a darker turn. She wrote it perfectly - plenty of the students didn't even know what their forms would take, even if Ron's fear of spiders was pretty obvious ahead of time.

** Probably my grave with the death date marked that day. Just change the text to something funny I suppose.

Years ago I used to have a extreme fear of needles but I got over it, so other than death in general I'm not really scared of much.
