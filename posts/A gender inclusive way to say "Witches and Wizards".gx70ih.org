Hi all, I'm wondering how one might say "witches and wizards" without falling into binary gender norms of "women and men."

Any ideas?


** You could use the term mages.

*** My problem with this is that "magicals" includes goblins, veelas, and other magical people. We need a word that means "just witches and wizards".

I like "magicians" for that.

** Mages is probably best. If you think about it you have

Witches and Wizards

Sorcerers and Sorceresses

But you just have Mages

And if I recall the Wiggles term was from a fic that had Harry decide if the wizards wanted to use Muggles instead of something less offensive that he would refer to Magicals as Wiggles.

From Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  Thaumaturgy is the purported capability of a magician to work magic or other paranormal events or a saint to perform miracles. It is sometimes translated into English as wonderworking. A practitioner of thaumaturgy is a "thaumaturgus", "thaumaturge", "thaumaturgist" or "miracle-worker".

(Of the others, I don't like wix either. Magician would be my choice for non-gender-specific while still being humanist.)
