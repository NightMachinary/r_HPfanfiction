** Umbridge is lawful evil, Bellatrix is chaotic evil, Voldemort is evil evil

Dumbledore is chaotic good (no-one is convincing me he is lawful with that scene when they came to arrest him lol)

I'm stuck on Hermione. Despite her original passion for following the rules she does a lot of illegal shit, including trapping a PERSON in a JAR, so maybe ruthless good if that's a thing.

*** Hermione and Dumbledore both follow their own strict moral codes, which makes them Lawful. The fact that those codes don't always perfectly align with the actual laws of a corrupt society doesn't detract from that.

**** I see, I may have misunderstood what the alignments meant! Fred and George are chaotic good then, for sure. Hermione is probably lawful neutral.

I still think Dumbledore is chaotic good though- his legendary flair for the dramatic, he ran an underground resistance group, he is a rebel in general.

**** Agree with you on Hermione. I think Luna was too involved in the conflict to be Neutral, she took part in the battle of the Department of Mysteries after all.

Controversial take but in the context of the war, maybe Snape was true neutral. Switched sides when it suited him, doesn't actively seek to better or worsen the world.

** Harry is nowhere near chaotic stupid. The only character in the series who might be is Peeves, but he's probably more of a Chaotic Neutral.

By that definition, I'd say that almost all of the good guys in the series are Lawful Good. Maybe Neutral Good in some cases, but probably still leaning towards Lawful. The Twins are probably the biggest exception, as they are solidly Chaotic Good. Luna might also be Chaotic Good, or at least Chaotic-leaning Neutral Good.

Voldemort and most other Death Eaters probably fall somewhere in the Neutral Evil to Lawful Evil range. I would probably put Voldemort closer to Neutral and Malfoy a closer to Lawful, but you could probably make a case either way. Bellatrix, of course, is Chaotic Evil.

Snape is confusing because his alignment shifts, he doesn't always act like his true alignment anyway, and he's probably just generally too complex to fit nicely into a box. I'd probably lean towards Lawful Neutral if I had to pick.

Umbridge is Lawful Evil, but Fudge is probably Lawful Neutral.

*** I would have a hard time placing anybody under Voldemorts control, like Lucius, as Lawful Evil. Although true that we don't get much information about what they do while his minions it's not that big of a stretch of the imagination that they throw around Unforgivables like candy.

**** But Lucius is also, if not actually part of the government, at least closely aligned with it. He seems to be the type to be mostly interested in political power and ruling over others. Just because he doesn't follow all the laws doesn't mean he's not Lawful. Especially since he's more likely to find ways around them and to avoid getting in trouble for breaking them than to just ignore them.
