:END:
I am looking for a story I read a while ago. The things I remember from it are:

-Harry was very powerful

-Harry and his girlfriend (I think it was Daphne) are younger versions of Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel that later travel back in time

-The philosopher's stone is a magical fusion reactor

-Harry learns to manipulate time by the end of the story

-I think he also used the heat of dragon fire at one point as a power source for alchemy

I would be really happy if anybody knows which story I read. Any suggestions for stories with only some of these points are also welcome.
