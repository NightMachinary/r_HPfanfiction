I just got the sudden idea of writing and reading a Fanfiction with Harry and Gang time-travelling into the past and founding Hogwarts. Maybe having befriended the Original Founders and travelling with them and seeing them die before they managed to finish their dreams made them built Hogwarts in their honour.

Seen any Fanfic that is similar to that?


** I haven't seen any fics like that before but I have some questions about which characters would be who? My first instinct is

-Harry (or Draco)/Salazar

-Hermione/Rowena

-Ron/Godric (though, Neville could fit this role as well)

But I can't think of who would fit into the Helga character. I just can't see Ginny in that role, Luna oddly enough fits closer in my head than her.

**** Well, if we're bringing that into the mix then Neville could be Helga, and in all honesty, it kinda works.

***** Well, yes, I had been thinking of Harry as Salazar, Hermione as Rowena and Ron as Godric. I haven't thought of gender-bending anyone but if I would have to, it would be Neville as Helga. Luna as Hufflepuff? That something to consider since with her background of being bullied by the other Claws it would fit for her to accept the rest ðŸ¤”

****** I'll probably use Neville though, since he seems to fit that role more. I'm not a fan of gender-bending though >.<

Or luna.... Argh, I'll think about that, for now I'm on a hunt for such a story. Or a similar one

Though I already got a reason in my mind for why Neville will turn into a girl if I go that way

********* I mean... not necessarily? If he is ftm trans and male presenting, but everyone around him (not counting the other founders) refuses to accept him as male, then he could be remembered in history as female. However, the situation would get complicated and could be hard to write.

******* You could also make Helga's gender historically inaccurate! Maybe Helga was a manly man, but due to their name it got lost to time and confused as a woman.

** linkffn(10756667) has Harry be a reincarnated Salazar Slytherin. For that matter, linkffn(10709411) by the same author is somewhat more similar to your request, though Harry is the only time-traveling founder. linkffn(8550820) has the entire gang travel to the founder's era due to the Department of Mysteries fiasco, though they themselves are not the founders.

  The Sorting Hat needs a vacation after it was forced to sort a special student. Sadly, Albus isn't happy with the idea. Luckily, there're always old... friends (?) who are willing to help out. If the Hat had known, it would have stayed home... AU Reincarnation-fic.

** The closest fic that I have read to your prompt is linkffn(Courage and Cunning). Salazar became immortal and polyjuices himself as baby Harry to destroy Voldemort, but then accidentally gets amnesia. Just a warning though, it has been on hiatus for several years, and the author hasn't updated since 2016.

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...
