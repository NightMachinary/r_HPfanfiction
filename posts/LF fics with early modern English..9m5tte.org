** The Founders, in as much as they spoke any variety of English - which is assuming facts not in evidence, as two of the founders have decidedly not-english names (Gryffindor is a variant of a welsh name, and Salazar is /basque/, not even native to the British Isles) - would have spoken Old English. Early Modern English is after the Great Vowel Shift, and from the Founders' time you have to get through several centuries of Middle English before that even starts to happen.

(In fact, from their names alone, I suspect that the native languages of the founders would have been Basque (Slytherin), Cumbric (Ravenclaw, assuming it's a toponymic surname from what nowadays is called Ravenglass), Bilingual Mediaeval Welsh/Old English (Gryffindor, with his Anglo-Saxon given name and Welsh surname) and Old English.(Hufflepuff, although 'Helga' could be an immigrant from just about anywhere west of the Urals and north of the Rhine). They probably had to communicate in Latin day-to-day, just like most educated folks did at the time.

  I don't know when the founders were born and what languages they spoke but it makes sense to me to use early modern instead of today's English as they were before our time.

I know this isn't what you are asking for, but your words made me extremely curious, so I went and did some research.

Hogwarts was founded in 993 AD.

Godric Gryffindor grew up in what is now the West Country region of England, but at that time was part of the kingdom of Wessex. People there spoke the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Saxon_dialect][West Saxon dialect of Old English]]. Salazar Slytherin came from a "fen", which people assume to be somewhere in the eastern part of England, so he probably would have spoken the West Saxon dialect as well.

Helga Hufflepuff came from Wales. People there spoke [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Welsh][Old Welsh]].

Rowena Ravenclaw came from Scotland. People there spoke [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Scottish_Gaelic][Gaelic]] for the most part, except for southern regions that spoke the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumbrian_dialect_(Old_English)][Northumbrian dialect of Old English]]

 

Just as an example, here's a transliteration of "The Lords Prayer" from the West Saxon dialect in that period:

#+begin_quote
  Fæder ure þu þe eart on heofonum,

  si þin nama gehalgod.

  To becume þin rice,

  gewurþe ðin willa,

  on eorðan swa swa on heofonum.

  Urne gedæghwamlican hlaf syle us todæg,

  and forgyf us ure gyltas,

  swa swa we forgyfað urum gyltendum.

  And ne gelæd þu us on costnunge,

  ac alys us of yfele.

  Soþlice.
#+end_quote

As you can see, words spoken by the founders would be unintelligible to modern-day English speakers. Even their written language is made up of letters that look more like Tolkein's Elvish than the English letters we know. For an example of their alphabet, check out the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowell_Codex][Nowell Codex]] from c. 975--1010 AD.

*** *West Saxon dialect*

West Saxon was one of four distinct dialects of Old English. The three others were Kentish, Mercian and Northumbrian (the latter two were similar and are known as the Anglian dialects). West Saxon was the language of the kingdom of Wessex, and was the basis for successive widely used literary forms of Old English: the Early West Saxon of Alfred the Great's time, and the Late West Saxon of the late 10th and 11th centuries.

--------------

*Old Welsh*

Old Welsh (Welsh: Hen Gymraeg) is the label attached to the Welsh language from about 800 AD until the early 12th century when it developed into Middle Welsh. The preceding period, from the time Welsh became distinct from Common Brittonic around 550, has been called "Primitive" or "Archaic Welsh".

--------------

*History of Scottish Gaelic*

Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig [ˈkaːlikʲ] ( listen)), is a Celtic language native to Scotland. A member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish. Most of modern Scotland was once Gaelic-speaking, as evidenced especially by Gaelic-language placenames.

--------------

*Northumbrian dialect (Old English)*

Northumbrian was a dialect of Old English spoken in the Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria. Together with Mercian, Kentish and West Saxon, it forms one of the sub-categories of Old English devised and employed by modern scholars.

The dialect was spoken from the Humber, now within England, to the Firth of Forth, now within Scotland. During the Viking invasions of the 9th century, Northumbrian came under the influence of the languages of the Viking invaders.

--------------

*Nowell Codex*

The Nowell Codex is the second of two manuscripts comprising the bound volume Cotton Vitellius A.xv, one of the four major Anglo-Saxon poetic manuscripts. It is most famous as the manuscript containing the unique copy of the epic poem Beowulf. In addition to this, it contains first a fragment of The Life of Saint Christopher, then the more complete texts Wonders of the East and Letters of Alexander to Aristotle, and, after Beowulf, a poetic translation of Judith. Due to the fame of Beowulf, the Nowell codex is also sometimes known simply as the Beowulf manuscript.

*** Thanks. As others have pointed out, they would have not spoken early modern English. so I'm going to remove the post as I don't want people just telling me the same thing over and over. Thanks for your help.

**** I thought your request was interesting, since I'm also curious to see stories with the Founders speaking in more archaic terms regardless of whether it would be historically accurate. Unfortunately, judging by previous recommendation threads like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9llsws/best_founderera_stories/][this one]], those kinds of stories seem to be rare.

** To you and only to you. Early modern English comes about five-hundred years too late for the Founders to have spoken it.

Their actual language was more likely Old English/Anglo-Saxon. If you want to know what that's like, read the original lines of Beowulf. That poem was written right around the time of Hogwarts' founding.

Actually, considering Hogwarts' location they most likely spoke Gaelic if they weren't Pictish holdouts still.
