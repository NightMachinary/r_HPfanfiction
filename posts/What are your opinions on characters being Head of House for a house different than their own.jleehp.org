I'm going to be working on an HP fic for NaNo in a few days, and I can't decide on something, so I'm curious to see how well-received the idea of characters being the Head of House for a house different than the one they were in school is.

The main two I've seen are Harry teaching and becoming Head of Slytherin, as an attempt to help Slytherin's reputation, and also help teach the kids that they don't have to be brats (IE act as a good influence), and Neville becoming Hufflepuff Head, due to him being Professor Sprout's kinda prodigy, so he takes over for her when she retires.

Do these kinda things annoy you and feel out of place? Or do you think it's okay, so long as there's a reason behind it?

** I've come across it a few times, and as long as it's well defended and not considered a normal thing, I think it's fine. Like, if it's pointed out that it's /not/ normal for a gryffindor student to be head of slytherin, but we're doing it because be x, y, z (so like your neville example). Bonus if there's a reference to it having happened in the past with a different house, for precedent.

When it's kinda random, like "oh, btw newest professor has to take on extra duties and since Horace only agreed to teach, that means you're head of Slytherin now, Hermione." It just doesn't really fit and can't be justified away. Unless the story as a whole is meant to be absurd.

Basically, have a reason, use that reason, and readers will probably be fine with it. If you wanna do it for shits and giggles, you do you and just have fun with it.

** As a fellow HP fanfic writer I say go for it, everybody has aspects of each house within them. And of course everyone changes as they grow older. Your idea sounds neat and I'd be interested in reading your story!

**** Plz where can i find the story you are writing. It sounds very interesting. Is it a Time Travel Fic?

***** For clarity, the examples I give aren't actually relevant, I gave them to avoid spoilers for my own. But no, it's not time travel; part of it takes time in Marauders time, and then there's a timeskip to the first two years of Harry's time at school.

It's not finished yet, I'll be working on hopefully completing it during NaNoWriMo. I'll definitely be posting the link on this sub when I'm done though.

** It depends on your story. How important is house affiliation to the plot and story. Are we talking about politician Slytherin kids? Then it wouldn't be advisable. Are you talking about ordinary kids? Then the house of the teacher should be irrelevant. Basically if you amp up each houses' traits, then you need a teacher who can understand them.

Personally I think it shouldn't matter if the teacher is from a different house.

** I don´t like it and I feel like it just wouldn´t work well, but it´s not like I wouldn´t read it just for that as long as it has a reason that makes sense and I like the fic overall.

** I don't like it. Feels like it goes against the whole point of Houses--trusting your House, having them as your "family" while at school--and the tradition of it. I've seen it in a few fics, and it just pulls me out of the reading when I come across it.

** Not really a problem I guess, my take is that while it would be tradition for the head of house to be a former member it would be perfectly acceptable for someone else to take the position depending of the circumstances, like, if your only staff-member able to take the position that was from that house happened to be a former war-criminal who never matured emotionally beyond 4 years of age.

** In the original series we only see professors who have graduated from their respective houses be Heads of their houses but, despite this being the typical preference in fics, I don't think it's a stated rule so you don't have to circumvent any canonical information. I would assume that when the Heads of houses are selected, the people awarded the position will typically be ethical and of moral integrity high enough not to hold petty school grudges against the house they are assigned to.

** Given the presentation in canon and my canon-preference tendencies, I suspect I would personally like it only in whacky fics like (mild spoiler but it is for the fic's epilogue/ending) Seventh Horcrux.

**** That would be to your advantage I think.

A lot of AU fics make the mistake of not having all their AU elements relate to the central concept so the reader's never sure what is and isn't like canon. This isn't going to be very relevant if, say, Hogwarts is a spaceship or something... because the AU is so divergent why would the reader think anything is meant to be like canon? But if my Azkaban escape WIP were to feature, say, Neville, head of Slytherin, I would expect a hypothetical reader to be confused since that's got no connection to "Harry and Ginny are framed for murdering Ron and Hermione after the Triwizard Tournament" which is my fic's point of divergence.

** Go for it.

I always kinda imagined a Wind Shear sequel where Dumbledore offers Harry Head of Slytherin, and Harry just starts laughing and walks out of the office.

** While I personally don't see it a lot in the books, Houses are supposed to have their own values and traditions, and I don't feel that someone not from the House would be good Head of House considering that.

That being said, if it's well justified, I wouldn't mind a lot.
