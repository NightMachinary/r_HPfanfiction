I recently got into podfics, and am looking for good ones in the HP fandom. Hit me with ones you'd recommend! Thanks.


** Just discovered these exist today! So nice to have someone read to me, conjures good childhood memories :)

** Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents On the Run [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21274127]] A great story and a Great Podfic, her Draco is AMAZING and she sets the tone well as a podfic. Defo suggest if you're looking or a Podfic.
