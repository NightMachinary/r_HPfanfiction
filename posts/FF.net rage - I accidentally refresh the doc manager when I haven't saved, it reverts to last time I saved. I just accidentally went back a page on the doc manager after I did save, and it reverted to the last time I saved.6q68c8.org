*** It's totally the opposite for me! I find Word far too narrow, I like having the full screen width on ff.net. I guess it's just more that I've been using it for years now, and while other options are probably better/more practical I have a good /feel/ for writing on ff.net. The pacing of words and sentences is very important in my writing, and I just feel like I have a better idea of how many words to put in a paragraph on ff.net than on Word.

Plus, when it comes to editing I like having the 2nd draft above a horizontal line and the unedited material below it.

Switch to web layout under the view menu/tab or just use wordpad. Basically anything except typing into an input form field on a website.

TL;DR: Libre is better because it has way more dev activity.

** Yeah writing in the ffnet doc manager is just asking for trouble. I'm surprised you haven't encountered problems like this before. Like everyone else I strongly suggest you use an actual word processing program.

** Why don't you write it on open office (or other similar software) and then upload your work? I'm genuily curious, is the doc manager from ff.net good? Or better than a "professional" software?

*** Like I said to the other comment, I've been using it for 6 years and I'm institutionalised to it at this point, I have a /feel/ for pacing and structure in the doc manager I don't have on Word. I like the full screen width of the doc manager, the formatting is easier/less fiddly than Word and I like chucking everything that needs edited beneath a big horizontal line and deleting it bit by bit as I redraft it above the line.

I do have stuff saved as word/odf documents, and have done a bit of writing in that in the past.
