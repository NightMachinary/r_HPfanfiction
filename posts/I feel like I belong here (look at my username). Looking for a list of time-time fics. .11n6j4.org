Hello there. Why have I not noticed this sub before? This is home. I've been an active part of ff.net for nearly 10 years. I remember when you could pay for ad blocking.

Well, I read most anything. I read most ships, canon, non-canon, slash, het. My favorite thing is time-travel. I feel like I've read them all. I've tried browsing a few C2s to find fics I have not read, but there is a lot of confusion in there.

I'm hoping, dear fellow redditors, that someone here loves TT as much as me and has a good list going, or knows a few great ones.

I'm also up for any suggestions. I keep a list of ones I've read/am reading/need to start, so I know if I've partaken in it or not. I have read many-a-fic, and have even re-read stories by accident, in my 10 years.

I hope you all are well, and I have plenty fics to share back. ^{_^}

*** Read that one the day I joined here. I loved it! Needs.moar.fics. lol. I would love to see this idea be laid out as a full fic. I have never come across this idea before. I even re-read it so I could spot the twist, and it's very funny to see the little hints I glossed over.

** Have you read [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Wastelands_of_Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]]? It's a very good long peggy sue fic that's complete (282,000 words), and has an actively updated sequel (59,000 words).

TVTropes has a good fanfic recommendations page with a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterPeggySue][Peggy Sue section]].

** You could try mine if you want but it's still in progress (and I know how much some of you hate that...) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8348025/1/The-Fairy-Godmothers]] It's a Hermione centered fanfic in the Marauders Era. I'd be happy if you gave it a try though ^{^}

**** Thanks, I'm a bit smug myself about this story. I'm thinking about it at all hours and writing it down whenever I can, so don't worry, it'll often be updated :) won't tell you who she ends up with though,that'll spoil everything. Thanks for reading ^{^}
