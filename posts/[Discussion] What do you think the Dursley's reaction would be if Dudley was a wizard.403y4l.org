So, I was thinking that for my first fanfic story, I would write an AU where Dudley was magical. I thought that instead of Dudley receiving his acceptance letter at 11, Mcgonagall would observe him performing a bout of magic and Dumbledore would have to talk to the Dursleys instead of just leaving Harry there. But I can't figure out what the Dursley's reaction would be. Thoughts?


** Petunia loves Dudley unconditionally. She would still love him, but probably try to ignore his magic, like she already ignores his bad behaviour.

But I think Vernon has higher standards. He wouldn't ignore Dudley's magic. I think a magical Dudley would lead to divorce between Petunia and Vernon, and then better treatment of Harry.

Though I always wondered where Vernon's obsession of "normality" really came from. I always thought that ultimately came from Petunia.

*** Vernon takes his queue on magic from Petunia. If Dudley was magically Vernon would love him anyway, and almost definitely accept his magic. He wouldn't just be accepting of Petunias opinion anymore, but his own opinion of his son.

*** Petunia loved Lily. Lily was a bit unfeeling towards her, what with the letter business, and stuff. Plus, Lily was pretty, smart, and her parents possibly showed (un?) intentional favouritism towards the witch. I think that eventually drove them apart, and James wouldn't have helped any more than that "dreadful boy" did.

It's pretty common for families who've crawled up out of the lower class into the middle to be extremely OCD about appearances and fitting in. It tends to pass down to the next couple of generations, so I always thought the Dursley line was like that. James being James wouldn't have endeared himself to Vernon at all - no doubt he was horrified at the thought of the effect he'd have in a small town, and clicky social circle.

So I imagine yes, her love for Dudders would overrule - and she'd jump at the idea of an extension of herself becoming better than her rival sister, and her child.

Vernon would insist that Dudley learn to control it, in order to hide it, but that he live a Muggle life. They wouldn't divorce, due to appearances, they'd just live a miserable life.

**** Transference. Petunia fell out badly with Lily by the end of Hogwarts, and she resented her badly for most of her childhood anyway. I guess being stuck with the freak child was her chance to exercise all the resentment she felt at being the normal, plain daughter. Apparently James and Vernon fell out badly, and Petunia left their first meeting in tears. All the frustration and bitterness she poured out onto Harry.

And Vernon was what his wife made him. He never got to see the good parts of the wizard world, and I have no doubt he had a very distorted view of them. Helped by Potter Sr.

** On the one hand, you could have them hate it and hate Dudley, in which case you could either have them treat him badly alongside Harry (the common "beat the magic out of you" trope that gets thrown about, though whether you go that far or stick closer to canon-level abuse is up to you) or they could disown him. If they're learning this the day Harry's brought to them, you could have them refuse to take Harry and also demand Dumbledore take Dudley away as well, or just refuse Harry and then give Dudley up to Muggle social services.

Or they could have a sudden revelation of "shit, either I accept magic or I hate my son and I'm not going to hate my son", in which case they may also chose to treat Harry differently. Just one of them could accept Dudley, creating a strong point of contention and maybe even lead to divorce if the unaccepting party refuses to change their views.

Third option is they insist it can't be true and spend the next ten years refusing to accept it, blaming all Dudley's accidental magic on Harry, and only finally acknowledging it when his Hogwarts letter comes. Or maybe not even then--you could write a story of teenage Dudley demanding to go to Hogwarts and the conflict this creates between him and his parents, while maybe improving his relationship with Harry; or even a story of him being forced to Muggle school and the troubles that are caused from being an untrained wizard.

It's just a matter of what you think would be better for the story.

*** Thanks, those are pretty much the options I'd thought out. I mainly find myself leaning towards either both Harry and Dudley being disowned and taken somewhere else by Dumbledore or them accepting both Harry and Dudley, leading to a healthier relationship between the two boys either way. Though, now that I think about it, I could really see Dumbledore forcing the Dursleys to raise both of the children unwillingly. Do you have a preference over which you would read, assuming you'd want to?

**** I don't think Dumbledore would force them to. Don't the blood protection spells that keep Harry safe at the Dursleys entirely depended on Petunia /willingly/ taking him in, even if she treats him badly? Refusing to take him entirely and being forced would make the spells useless, in which case I think Dumbledore would prefer Harry placed somewhere else.

It's just struck me that another possibility is the Dursleys giving Harry and Dudley up, but then regretting it. It'd be interesting to see them struggling to overcome their prejudice so that they can get back custody of their child. (I wouldn't want to see "oh, we're sorry, we'd like our kid back now" "okay sure here you go".) Lots of potential conflict with Dudley trying to understand why his parents gave him away and then changed their minds, wanting to go back to them but also having trust issues and still loving his adopted family so feeling guilty about leaving them.

But overrall, I think I'd prefer Harry and Dudley accepted and raised by the Dursleys. I'm more interested in seeing the different relationships between everyone in that setting than I am in seeing Dudley and Harry getting along in another family. I think the biggest intrigue in this story would be the altered family dynamics, and they're not so important when you take Harry and Dudley away from Petunia and Vernon. Even if they accept their son is a wizard, it's still going to be difficult and there will be moments when they really wish he wasn't, especially at times when they're confronted with it so obviously in outbursts of accidental magic.

** I think it would be similar, Vernon and Petunia would love and spoil their magical child and see him as something even more special because of it and find some other reason to hate Harry. Possibly the boys wouldn't even know they were magical until they get their letters. Instead of running from it, they'd allow the boys to get their letters and make a bigger deal out of Dudley's than Harry's. They'd buy Dudley the best of everything in Diagon and get Harry second-hand things (assuming no one comes along to give Harry the key to his vault). I think the more interesting thing would be when they get to Hogwarts and Dudley, who had been told he's something special all his life, realizes that he's at best average and faces discrimination from people like Draco for being a muggle-born. Meanwhile Harry is still Harry and is treated better for it.

EDIT: I mean that as in Harry is still Harry-the-Boy-Who-Lived and a halfblood so his status and popularity in the wizarding world is much greater than Dudley's.

** "SIDS" would happen. Very tragic. This is after they storm Lily and James demanding they remove his magic.

What house would he be in? I can only think Gryffindor. Not smart enough for Ravenclaw or Slytherin, nor ambitious, plus Muggleborn. Not loyal or kind or generally well dispositioned enough for Hufflepuff, but seems to have the same potential for decency most people do, under the spoiled parts. I think he could have made a decent Griffin.

Hmm it's never appealed to me, but now I'm intrigued. Seven years to change 11 years of ruination.

** I think it depends on when they find out. If they're told when they receive Harry that Dudley is magical too, they'd probably think it was a trick and refuse to believe it. If you follow canon until Harry's letter arrives, and Dudley gets one too, I think they'd treat both boys about the same as they did in canon. By that point, their mistreatment of Harry is self-sustaining and not based on logic. They can't just turn around and say "Welp, sorry about all that, we love you now".

They'd justify their treatment of him in some way (e.g. they got stuck with him and he's not their kid) and spoil Dudley. Then when the inevitable happens and Harry is treated better at Hogwarts, they'd blame Harry for poisoning people against Dudley and use that a reason to continue hating him. Potentially, depending on how much of a spine Dudley has, he may beg his parents to take him home (which they would agree to, with Vernon exclaiming about finding a better school to send him to all the way home). Or he'll turn bitter because of the bullying he suffers or suck it up and ask Harry for help/become a halfway decent person, etc.

Lots of ways it could go, really.

  Despite the Dursley's best efforts, they are unable to stamp the freakishness out of Harry Potter. Much to their horror, the dreaded Hogwarts letter comes for Harry...and their son as well. What will happen when Dudley goes to Hogwarts with Harry Potter, intent on telling the wizarding world how terrible their saviour truly is?
