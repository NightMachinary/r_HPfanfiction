:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Unfortunately I don't remember too much about this fan fiction. However I do remember that at one point, Harry is with some order members and they find out Death Eaters are attacking Hermione and her family. The order goes to help and they tell Harry to stay where he is. He manages to get to Hermione's anyways though and he sees Hermione and her mom about to get hit with an Avada Kedavra and jumps in the way. He gets hit and they thunk he is dead at first but he ends up surviving. I am almost entirely positive this was not a Hermione/Harry story. Sorry I wish I could remember more about it but does anyone recall what story this was?


** Just read this fic like last week, but I've also read a few other fics in that time so I hope I'm not mixing it up ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I think this is the correct one though

  PostOOTP, Snape blows his cover as a spy to save Harry from Voldemort. To win the war, even those who loathe each other must unite, and many lessons are learned in the process. COMPLETE!
