I am looking for a fanfiction I read awhile ago where Harry was raised in sunnydale and was friends with xander and willow before or around the same time as buffy came. He doesnt know he is a wizard or the chosen one until Wesley comes into the story and informs Giles. I'm pretty sure it was a buffy/harry pairing fanfiction.
