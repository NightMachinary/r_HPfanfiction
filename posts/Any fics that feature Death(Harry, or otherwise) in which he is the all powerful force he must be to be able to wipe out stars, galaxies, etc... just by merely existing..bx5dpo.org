I always read MOD fics that usually have Harry only more powerful on average, sometimes powerful enough to contend with the heavy hitters of Marvel, and DC. The problem I have though is that their should be no competition. Death in any universe that has death is depicted as an all powerful being. A being that even the gods themselves cannot escape. If they're gonna have Harry fill that role, understand what such a role entails.

So yeah, looking for a fic in which Death is a being that no-one, but the most crazy, or fool hardy challenge.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** You might enjoy a one-shot of mine, if you haven't read it already. It is a crossover with the first book of the Incarnations of Immortality series, On a Pale Horse. You should be able to follow most/all of it even without having read any of Incarnations series, but you'd probably enjoy it more if you've read both series.

(You can also find it by the same name at AO3, if you prefer). Hope you like it!

  Harry Potter has lived a full life. But coming back to life is not without consequences. Because when is it ever easy being Harry Potter? Certainly not when Fate has taken a personal interest in your life. Oneshot!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina][Deus ex Machina]] This series is amazing. I love it. If you look at it find the rest. There are at least 3 maybe 4 parts in it. Mostly by the same author.
