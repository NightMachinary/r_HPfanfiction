  What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13255607/1/A-Mentor-s-Burden][In which Tom Riddle becomes Dumbledore's biggest and most devoted fan.]] -- Naidhe's A Mentor's Burden.

For Delphi... there's this fanfic where Delphi is using time travel to fix the plot of a CC or something. It takes her a bunch of attempts and there's a log of them. I can't remember what it's called, though. I'll see if I can find it, I first came across it on this sub, iirc.

EDIT: Bad Oracle. I'm not actually sure if I've read the main fic or not (and consequently if it's a humour fic), but the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16134098][log is what you're looking for/]]
