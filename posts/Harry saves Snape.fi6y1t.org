I previously looked for fics where Harry saves Dumbledore, but this time I'm looking for fics where Harry saves Snape from being killed by Voldemort


** You know I have to mention [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This Means War by Jeconais]], right? I heard a lot of complaints, that its dealing with homosexuality is not up to current standards, but I was laughing for long time over it nevertheless.

** Does that alternate universe mentor-Snape one count? He technically saves him from both sides there, but they also save one another too. (It's that one where Snape has a secret hideout that he considers to be his sanctuary, yet gives it up to help Harry with a plan).

** I think I have read one like this and Snape does get like a girlfriend or something and starts to mellow out? :) It was a super long time ago and I do not remember the name though! :( Also I think he helps Longbottoms from coma?
