Aw Man, I have to write a description. The title says it all. Do i really need to go on.


** Aww man no, that would be horrible and pointless because ultimately we still got only one of The Twins left and then this brilliant fan-theory I read also gets the shove.

When George lost an ear, I knew Fred was doomed. Why? All the Weasley names except for Ron are either the names of a British king or queen or an Arthurian name (and Ron brings Harry into the family, and there have been 8 â€˜Harry's on the throne; nine if you are a die-hard Jacobite). King George III was deaf in one ear---and he became king because of the untimely death of Prince Frederick.--hellogiggles.com

** I've read a fic like this but I don't remember where or what it was called :/

It was one where they had a twin ability to switch bodies, and they could do it by accident or on purpose. They did it so much they couldn't remember which body/name was whose anymore into their teens, since until the ear injury they'd always been identical anyway.

When the killing curse came hurling at Fred he accidentally switched from the fear/shock, so George died in that body in his stead and it tore him apart because he felt like he'd killed his brother. Or the other way around, it was years ago since I read it.

And then the fic continues in the years after, when even hearing his name hurts because it's the wrong name? I think that was it. But nobody know so he can't tell anyone, because they never told anyone they could actually switch bodies.

And then one day he blacks out or goes to sleep or something and he wakes up in this empty, peaceful non-corporeal existence and he doesn't have a body, and then it switches back again and there's a message on his arm in sharpie from his dead brother. It's so heartbreakingly bittersweet because he can't say anything back, but George leaves him little messages.

I don't remember so much of the rest but I remember it happens more times, once every few months or years maybe, and eventually he tells people and Molly gets to talk to her other son again and they have a heart to heart about it all and stuff. It's such a good fic. They kinda get to grow old together, even though they can't see each other directly George can see glimpses of Fred's life, of the family he builds, etc, and Fred isn't afraid of death when it comes because he's already seen it so much through George.

It ends with them seeing each other again, Fred finally joining George after a long life. Super sweet ending, such a lovely bittersweet fic. Guess I'll have to look for it later.

*** Found it! It's from a tumblr post, not a full fic sadly. Also, upon further inspection I may have mixed it up with another fic/headcanon (that I may or may not have imagined). However, link below to the original thread:

*** They swapped just before they picked Harry up and then everyone knew George was traveling with Lupin so George was the one who lost an ear and they just never corrected anyone.
