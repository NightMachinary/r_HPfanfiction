#+TITLE: Are there any fics at all that have both a part-human OC playing a large part, as well as a good storyline? This has gotten me curious.

So part-human characters can be fun, they /can/ be when they are done correctly, just like very thing else. /But/ pretty much every fic out there that features them is too focused on showing off the (often Mary-Sue-ish) character to get anything done with the plot.

Has anyone found a good one that has a story an a part-human?

Or is anyone willing to write one?

On a (not really) side-note; are there any with harpies in particular? (you know, tht part-bird, part-human, all-female race from greek mythology)
