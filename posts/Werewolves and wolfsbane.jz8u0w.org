I see so many fics about how wolfsbane is poison. I think that wolfsbane just suppress your wolf. Greyback for example is like what happens when your wolf takes control and you are suppressed. All the werewolves in his “pack” so to speak just agree on a common goal. Remus lupin for example was according to canon and fanon a prankster and happy at hogwarts I think that him and the wolf agreed and were in unison and that he was just happy to have friends that accept him. Sometimes he might have even been looking forward to the full moon. But after James and Lily's death he was disgusted at the “wolf” for the suspecting him and thus became moody and all no one likes me cause I'm a werewolf hence why he ran from Tonks.

Sorry for bad grammer.


** Fanon generally calls it a poison because it is a poison. Obviously the potion, properly brewed, isn't fatal. It lets a werewolf keep his human mind. Nonetheless:

Chemotherapy is a useful poison too. Poison and “medically helpful” aren't mutually exclusive.

** Wolfsbane definitely did something to him while he was working at Hogwarts.

On the day that Sirius found Wormtail, we see Remus before the moon. Perfectly healthy. Then we see him the following afternoon. Still pretty healthy. This was a full moon without the final dose of wolfsbane where he roamed free in the forest.

But throughout the year, when he was taking wolfsbane, he was regularly too sick to do anything. During the first Quidditch game, he was too sick to teach on Friday and too sick to go to the game on Saturday. That leads me to think the full moon was on Thursday night, and he was sick the next two days.

My guess with Greyback is that if you align yourself with the wolf's natural instinct (turning humans is probably akin to mating), you have control. Because he was able to get into Remus's bedroom, bite him, and get out when Lyall attacked him. As a full wolf. Not the weird biped wolf of the movies. A wolf looking werewolf. That would seem pretty difficult of a chore if wolf and human weren't in agreement. So people like Remus, who do not want to bite people, wouldn't be able to use the wolf's body in the same way Greyback can
