idk i always loose it and i dont know how to find it and i cant bookmark it


** I'm sorry, but I'm quite confused by what you're actually looking for here. Do you want tutorials on how to use the bot, or a list of the stories the bot linked, or something else entirely?

*** the person who created the fanfiction link bot made another bot where you could put the link of a fic in it, and it would give you reccomenations based on that fic. its on a different page, and i wanted to know if the link to that bot could be put in a sidebar. sorry if i confused you

**** Ah, okay. That clears things up nicely. No worries - this is the internet, misunderstandings happen. :)

If you want a change like that made, I'd recommend messaging the mods directly. There should be a big blue button in the moderators section of the sidebar that'll let you ask them if that's possible.

If they say no or don't respond, you could always bookmark the page (if you're on a PC or phone browser). Or save this comment, since I've linked below. The other link is a similar thing that you might also find useful. :)

****** Sure. :)

Ah, okay. Yeah, bookmarking is probably the easiest action, unfortunately. Could just make a 'this is my stuff, bugger off other people' folder, I guess. :D

That's understandable, but if you want a change made to the sub itself, the mods are the ones who have the power to make it happen. We users can't edit that sort of thing. It's worth a shot, especially since the creator of the Bot is Tusing, one of our mods. If anyone was going to agree to sharing it, it's them. :)
