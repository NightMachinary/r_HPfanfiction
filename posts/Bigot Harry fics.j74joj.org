Can anyone recommend any fics where Harry discriminates against muggles or creatures for whatever reason being raised by blood supremacists, he has a bad experience with a creature, or just issues from the Dursleys? Thanks in advanced.


** Like as in Harry's the antogonist? Or the plot's about him learning the error of his ways?

  You live among monsters, you become a monster. Fuelled by intense hatred for muggles, Harry takes a vow to become a name that the muggles would lean to fear. Will the Butcher rise? Or will he find it in his heart to forgive them?
