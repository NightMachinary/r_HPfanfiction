** Cool idea, despite 17 YO Voldemort's looks he would really have reasons to be angry, his new form would not inspire half the fear his former one would and frankly, who would take a 17 years old trying to start a revolution even slightly seriously? And if we just tweak a bit with the rules on the trace Voldemort could have to deal with the underage wizardry laws again, can't imagine him liking this. And there is also the fact that any enchantments, potions and rituals he may have done in the time since his 17 and â€˜81 would be just gone (this one is more fanon than canon, but still).

*** ........ I can already see it: Dumbledore takes Tom to a history museum, where Tom climbs into a tank and argues about getting out of it
