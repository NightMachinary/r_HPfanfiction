Lily Potter was considered to be one of the brightest witches of her age, however even she can't defeat fate after setting up aseries of protections for her baby boy runes/charms/potion etc, something goes horribly wrong after stepping in front of baby Harry to take the killing curse, her soul is ripped out... and forced into baby Harry.

The next day she wakes up and realises she is now possessing/is now her own child after being dumped on her sisters doorstep she swears vengeance on all of those that failed or manipulated her and she's not afraid to step into the darkness to do it.

*** I imagined Lily's parents having an issue with her dating outside of her race, but James is blissfully unaware that muggles are strange about it.

**** Lily's parents 'are you not concerned about our daughters skin colour ?' James "she looks fine to me, you folk thinks she looks a bit sick ?'

Lily's parents 'what about the differences in race ?' James ' oh we generally don't do races anymore, lily can be quite the sore loser'

***** 'You don't have a problem that she's...' they didn't finish the sentence so James did

'Muggleborn? of course not!'

'we meant black'

'oh, wait' he turns to Lily who just has her head in her hands to hide her laughter 'you didn't tell me you were related to Padfoot!'

**** Wizards have somehow managed to progress to a post racial society super early on--magical America had a black female president in the 1920s at an age when neither had full voting rights in the non magical world.

****** In my country one of the first attempts to institute a voting system (ironically while still keeping the king as the highest authority) was set to be by the wealthy of the voters (measured by the agrarian production) I think it didn't went through, but am not sure.

**** Meh, it's perfectly fine if someone is into that, but I always disliked racial/sexual/religious exhibitionism, in or outside fics. There is a fine line between being assertive and aggressive. And "black* person" consists of two parts, "black*" and "person". I prefer to focus on the latter.\\
(*color variable)

So, I'm with James on this one.
