What are those tropes you've seen too many times and just hate?


** Soulmates, A/B/O, or whatever fics are now calling the trope where *every* woman is just /obsessed/ with boys and can't help but suddenly become sex-obsessed with them...

**** "Alpha/Beta/Omega"

Comes from Supernatural fandom IIRC. Everyone is born one of those three things with dumb (and not even scientific) comparisons to pack animals like wolves.

Alphas are strong and dominant, Betas are subservient to Alphas, Omegas are constantly in heat and need to breed with Alphas.

You'll never guess which Dr*a*co and Hermi*o*ne are routinely portrayed as...

**** It's a stupid sex thing based on shoddy research. Original wolfpack social research was taking a bunch of wolves from different packs and locking them in an enclosed space together. The researcher published his study of wolves being terrified and threatening each other and published it as the be-all, end-all on wolf social dynamics. The basic theory was that there is some alpha wolf that forces all the others to obey and the beta wolves, who fight among themselves. (In his defense, he later realized he was wrong and has been begging publishers to stop promoting it.)

Fanfic authors seized on it as a sex thing and turned it into the glorious alpha who magically makes all the omegas want to have sex with them (the fantasy generally maps alpha=male and omega=female, but not always) just by being near. It's a rape fantasy dressed up in prettier terms.

I'd actually read a/b/o that isn't plain aphrodisiac rape and instead dealt with a society where people go feral on a fairly regular basis, but generally the deep worldbuilders with decent plots don't run in the same circles as the shitty porn tropes. Deal with trying to maintain a society when a good 25% or so establish territory and get uncomfortable with each other entering.

Â°Weasley bashing expect the twins even though they're like the easiest to bash.

Â° Every boy other than Harry being an undateable prick in order to provide fodder for da harem

Â° The weird obsession with purity you normally find in Slytherin!Harry e.g. Ginny is a slut for having the sheer audacity to date TWO boys

Â°Muggleborns destroyed with FACTS and LOGIC

Â° Slytherin persecution complex

Â° Every Ravenclaw being a sociopath who exist solely to bully Luna

*** what do you mean slytherin persecution complex?

also, the twins are not the easiest to bash. the easiest to bash are Ron, Ginny and Molly. And, it does make sense for some muggleborns to be debunked with facts since they can't know everything about the wizarding world and certainly not more than people who've grown up in it

**** The Slytherin persecution complex is when fics act like Slytherins are second class citizens constantly oppressed by the Old Goat TM and the rest of the school. Typically accompanied by Snape/A Prefect giving a speech to the first years on yadda yadda united front and blah blah house customs.

** Magic is only intent. In that case, Luna Lovegood on drugs is the best wizard alive. Go read or watch the countless works where magic is only intent. And why the hell do they even bother going to Hogwarts to study?

You can cheat magic with science. That's not HP magic. Go read Dresden or watch The Magicians.

Bashing. Boring and a sign your fic is trash.

Wizarding world is backwards. Someone has a poor grasp of the complexity of the world.

Purebloods were right. Intentions or not, I'm not interested in reading a story that excuses the analogue of racism.

Voldemort or Draco or Lucius or Snape or Bellatrix with Harry. Let's not pair the hero with the racist killer because the racist killer was hot in the movies.

Secret ancient magic/forgotten magic/asian magic/wandless magic is the best. If it was so good, people would be using it all over.

I've seen it portrayed as not necessarily being better, just different and not something people organize against. Like a bike rack. People expect bike thefts to come from saws, so they buy good locks and chains. Then someone waltzes up with a massive drill and steals the entire bike rack. Stealing the bike rack isn't better than getting a really nice angle grinder, but nobody's putting up defenses against it.

*** I respectfully disagree about the bashing part. I do think there are some that aren't written very well and come off as rather cartoonish with awkward dialogue; but there are some that pull it off well and it takes skill to twist a normally likeable character into a jerk that we're supposed to hate. Just my opinion anyway.

** ((Yes I know I'm kinda picky))

- soul bonds

- a/b/o

- marriage contract

- harry (usually) being super involved with politics

- characters having multiple bf/gfs

- kids being married at 11 (I've seen with harry/hermione. They'll have a dorm to themselves)

- oc being daughter/niece/sister, etc of (insert character)

- not sure if this really counts as one but shopping scenes. The ones where Harry gets a new wardrobe, bunch of books and (usually) a pet snake

- fics focusing on daphne greenglass

-long giblin scenes

- making the female characters have zero flaws but the guys are bumbling idiots

- I dont really mind bashing except when it comes to Percy/Seamus/Harry/Colin

- Harry having like 3 parents (it'll be a threesome pairing of, for example, Lily/James/Snape)

- Harry's name being Hadrian (I can ignore it if it's just mentioned) or changed completely

- Harry being a gary sue. Usually he's ridiculously smart and can do all this impressive magic and acts like a jerk

- dont know if this counts but making male characters (specifically Harry) girlish or weepy

- creature inheritance

- Malfoy is a misunderstood character and suddenly is nice
