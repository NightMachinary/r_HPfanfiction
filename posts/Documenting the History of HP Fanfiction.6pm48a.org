If there was, hypothetically, a book (or even just an article) on the history of /Harry Potter/ fanfiction, what would you want to see covered in it? Should we be seeking to put together such a history, so that we may preserve the memories of the fandom's veterans while they are still here?

Some questions to consider (I invite you to add your own):

- When did slash pairings first become popular in fanfics? What about harem fics? Which stories were responsible for laying the groundwork for both these tropes?
- For that matter, where did the popular cliches of Immortal!Harry, Weasley-bashing, Dumbledore-bashing, etc. originate? Can we narrow any of them down to any one particular fic?
- What phases has the fandom gone through in the past? Were there any tropes that used to be really popular, but which have now died out?
- "My Immortal" - because, for better or for worse, it would be impossible to document the history of fanfics without discussing this one. What was its overall impact on the fandom and on the fics that came after it?

Given that nearly a million /HP/ fanfics have been written so far (and that's just counting what's available on FFNet, AO3, and HPFFA), putting together such a book or article would be a monumental undertaking. But perhaps our discussion here will provide helpful notes for somebody someday.


** I got into HP fanfic in my early teens, back during the three-year-wait between the fourth and fifth book, and I definitely remember the fandom being very different.

- Dumbledore-bashing was nearly non-existent. Dumbledore in fanfics was usually positively portrayed, even if he tended to not do a whole lot other than be in charge whenever the good guys had meetings, and play matchmaker for his students and teachers.
- Likewise, Weasley-bashing wasn't nearly as prominent. The Weasleys were generally accepted as good people, and Ron didn't get a lot of hatred (though a lot of fics did end up killing him off so that Harry could angst about it). Ginny's name was almost uniformly believed to be "Virginia" and she was portrayed as shy and unassuming. (I remember feeling vindicated when book five showed that she only acted like that around Harry -- I still remembered Ron's comment in the second book that it was weird to see her act that timid,)
- Yule Ball fics were quite prominent for a while, because a lot of fans had misunderstood and thought the Yule Ball was an annual thing at Hogwarts for fourth-years and up.
- For a long time the popular theory was that Harry was the Heir of Gryffindor, and that the last book would feature him team up with the Heirs of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff to take down Voldemort. It was widely accepted that Susan Bones was the Heir of Hufflepuff, and that was why we saw her Sorting in the first movie.
- Fics where Hermione showed up back at Hogwarts for her fifth year and had become immensely hot, after having grown tits and/or some American cousin had given her makeovers and introduced her to Hot Topic, flourished. The phrase "Hermione had changed a lot over the summer" was infinitely quoted and mocked, as was the classic "she had grown curves in all the right places."
- Fics where Hermione turned out to really be a pure-blood witch whose pure-blood parents had tragically died and she had been adopted by Muggles, were extremely common too. Her Muggle parents sometimes turned out to be abusive, but not always -- in any case, when she found out her true heritage she always embraced it wholly. Usually this was done as an exuse to pair her up with Draco Malfoy, but again, not always.
- More Hermione: Fics where she became Head Girl in her seventh year were common -- for some reason being Head Girl meant that she no longer slept in the girls' dormitories but got her own "appartment" in Hogwarts... that she shared with the Head Boy. Who was usually Draco Malfoy, and this was always a thinly-veiled excuse to have them end up together.
- Lots and lots of self-insert exchange students from America.
- And lots of female Defence teachers, usually extremely competent, smoking hot and usually hooking up with either Snape or Sirius.

*** Some very detailed notes for posterity. Thank you.

I haven't been reading HP fanfics for as long as some people have, but I do remember Yule Ball fics being quite popular when I first got into fic, so clearly, /that/ stayed trendy for a long time.

Also, going back and reading some early Harry/Luna fics, I see that there was a lot of fan speculation as to what Luna's father was like, since Xeno wasn't introduced properly until the last book. As a result, there were a lot of amusing OCs created: some authors correctly assumed he was absent-minded, while others thought he was actually /less/ odd than Luna, and that Luna's eccentricities came from her mother instead. (Which doesn't make sense - it's like they forgot Xeno edited /The Quibbler/.)

As far as Dumbledore-bashing goes... it seems to me that the rise in popularity of that trope has gone hand-in-hand with the rise of Snape-defending, ever since the last book when we finally learned both characters' backstories. In fact, it's rather surprising how popular Snape/Hermione pairings have become recently. Although clearly, judging by how far back Draco/Hermione goes, there's a long history of fic writers wanting to pair Hermione up with a "bad boy".

**** There has been Snape-defending from the very start of fanfiction, though usually it was more fangirl squeeing about how hot and sexy Snape was. Fics back then tended to tone down his nastiness quite a bit, and very many of them included an OC to be his love interest, such as the many female Defence teachers.

Luna, after she was introduced in canon, very quickly became the darling of the fandom and has pretty much remained so ever since. There was in fact a rather notable surge of Ron/Luna fics, in the time when Ron was still fairly well-liked by fanficcers... Luna was the perfect love interest to give to Ron, so that Hermione would be freed up for Harry. (Besides, the scene at the Hogwarts Express where she says she wouldn't have minded going to the Yule Ball with him, and then laughs hysterically at his joke, was enough for a lot of fans to cement the pairing.) As Ron's popularity sank, though, Luna's default pairing (aside from Harry) quickly became Neville.

One interesting fic to read if you want a closer look at the HP fanfiction scene pre-OOTP is [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=656&chapno=1][The Tough Guide to Harry Potter]] at Sugarquill. This is a parody of "The Tough Guide to Fantasyland" and essentially an alphabetical lexicon over characters, tropes and cliches that were common in HP fanfics back in 2002.

Some gems:

- Arabella Figg varied hugely in description since nobody knew whether "Mrs Figg" was the same character as the Arabella Figg mentioned by Dumbledore at the end of GOF. Everybody agreed there was a connection, but quite a few people thought "Arabella" was a hitherto unseen younger relative and a witch.
- Every single animal except Crookshanks had a tendency to be revealed as having been an Animagus in disguise all along.
- Harry was actually less likely than Hermione to be the main character of a fic (though I do think the fic underestimates his popularity among fans when it calls him "rather a secondary" character).
- Nobody knew if Blaise Zabini was a boy or a girl.

But a lot of things remain unchanged. For instance, Draco Malfoy still has the "bad boy" thing going for him, Hagrid is still often given a smaller role or not included at all, Sirius's characterisation still swings between several extremes (the petty bully, the fun-loving goof, the man who hangs onto his sanity by a thread...) and Slytherin still tends to be viewed as the "cool" house.

And ironically, now we have the theory that Crookshanks was actually Regulus Black (despite the fact that Kreacher /saw/ him die - but since when have /facts/ ever gotten in the way of fan theories?). Back in the day, I myself wondered if Trevor the Toad was going to turn out to be Umbridge, but JKR had already used that plot twist with Scabbers/Wormtail in PoA, and I didn't think she was likely to do it twice.

*** Yule Ball Fics reminded me that there was a period where Sex Ed class fic were popular. The premise often involved Hermione being horrified to learn that her classmates knew pretty much nothing, and pushing the staff to introduce a mandatory class where pairs of students were required to take care of the magical equivalent of those electronic babies. They were almost an excuse to draw weird ships out of a hat, but I remember Ron/Pansy being a very common side pairing.

**** I remember one where Snape ends up in charge of the sex ed lecture due to losing a coin toss with McGonagall. He covered the material correctly, but he clearly didn't enjoy it.

One quote I remember: "There are three methods of stimulation: manual, oral, and sexual. For best results, use in that order."

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.

** I started reading HP fic around 2000, and slash fic was already around, although I can't speak to how prevalent it was at the time because I wasn't seeking it out. I also wouldn't call slash on its own a trope, and its popularity within this fandom can't be tracked back to one fic the same way the "Draco in leather pants" trope could potentially be.

If you're at all interested in diving into the history of slash, though, start with Star Trek (specifically Spock/Kirk, which is often cited as the origin of the term), and the physical zines which were published in the 70s. IIRC, slash writers for Man from Uncle were really prolific as well.

Honestly, a lot of the fandom history and fanfic history goes hand-in-hand, and has already been documented on sites like fanlore and the now archived Fandom Wank. But if you want an Adventure, track down the Msscribe story. That's a fun read.
