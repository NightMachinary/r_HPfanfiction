I'm going through a time travel phase and I'm desperate for fics (doesn't have to be time travel though, I'm fine with anything :))

For some reference, here's 2 of my favorite fics (not much, but hope it helps):

When a wizard wishes upon a star:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23221393/chapters/55595515]]

Resurrect the living:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13978644/chapters/32183310]]

-Preferably no Weasley or Dumbledore bashing

-Slash is okay

-I don't like Harry/Hermione, Drarry, Daphne/Harry, and Harem

-I love fics with Tom Riddle in them (doesn't have to be Tomarry)

Thank you so much in advance!!!


** linkffn(11233445)

linkffn(4068153)

linkffn(10610076)

linkffn(4536005)

linkao3(Into the arena with your head held high)

e: this is why i don't link ao3 fics. How the hell did the bot think I wanted a Captain America fic when none of the words matched. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4472270/chapters/10164680][Here]] is the correct fic.

#+begin_quote
  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  “I was going to kill you,” Grindelwald said nonchalantly, twirling the wand in his hand. Harry's blood ran cold, all too aware of his own vulnerability. He inadvertently recalled the row of followers in the back of the dungeon, their reverence and fear of the lord undeniable.

  "What changed?" Harry asked, quiet but daring. His heart was beating loud in his chest, adrenaline beginning to pump through his veins. Grindelwald's piercing eyes finally turned to him, tracing his features unabashedly. “Your resemblance to the Potters.” At the mercy of the powerful Gellert Grindelwald, an amnesiac Harry Potter reluctantly accepts to assist in the lord's search for the Hallows --- by spying on the heir to the Cloak of Invisibility, James Potter.

  "Make no mistake", hot breath against his ear, a whisper resembling a scream in the eerie silence of the mountains, "your pain, your blood, your life are mine. I will be the one to make you beg for death, just as I will be the one to end your pathetic existence. What pleasure will await me, as I watch your worthless lungs draw their final breath, your weak heart struggle to keep you alive, as you succumb to pain and nothingness. Your end is near, Harry."A not so typical Do-Over Fic.

** I have read many, MANY, time travel ffs. My favorite are:

Linkao3(Carpe Noctem)

Linkffn(A slytherin through time)

Linkffn(The bureaucratic error)

Linkao3(Yesterday is Tomorrow (everything is connected))

A slytherin through time has my favorite characterization of the Slytherin house. Best thing? Just because Draco time traveled it doesn't mean he isn't a git anymore.

Edit: i wasn't talking about the Carpe Noctem the bot linked. I meant Carpe Noctem by LeEspionage. How do i change it...?
