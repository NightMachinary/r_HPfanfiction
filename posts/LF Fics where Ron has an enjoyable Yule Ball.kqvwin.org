So, I just finished another Harmony fic where Ron had a miserable Yule Ball experience and it occurred to me that I've never actually seen a fic where Ron actually has a good time at the Yule Ball with a partner. I don't care whatever else is in the fic, but I'm hoping y'all can help out with fics with that element. :)

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** You should look under the Harry/Ron tag on AO3; I'm pretty sure I read two or three fics where Ron and Harry went together and both had a good time. :)

  What if Fleur had accepted Ron's invitation to the Yule Ball?

** Linkffn(Or The Look Or The Words)

I hope I've linked that properly, but if not it was recced in a pretty recent thread too asking about the Yule ball. Basically Harry and Ron go to the ball together.

*** I have no idea - the bot hasn't summoned yet, but that could be anything. Either way, I found the other thread (Did not notice that before I made mine - woops!) and bookmarked the fic from there. Thanks for the rec!

** linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) has him ask Hermione in a better way than running out of people and then remembering she's a girl. It's rather long, though (the Ball is chapters 60 and 61).

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
