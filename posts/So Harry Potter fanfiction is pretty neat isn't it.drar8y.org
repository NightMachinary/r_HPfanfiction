I'm just putting this here so that I can better understand the mechanics of posts. There are a few things i've noticed others do that i've never done, and I thought i'd finally get around to figuring all these things. So discuss away, but this is basically a "how do I do all that stuff" post.

Edit: So i've seen posts that have hidden their upvote/downvote thing. How do you do that?

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Some lesser known commands for the bot.

ffnbot!directlinks will link every fic that you have a link to in your post, so if you have a link in your post you do not have to do the "linkffn" command.

#+begin_example
  If you do a trail of ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ before a word it disappears, so if you put a command after that in your post it is visible to the bot, but invisible to everyone else. 

  For example if you do ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ffnbot!directlinks it will link all fics linked in your post/comment while not affecting the aesthetics of it.
#+end_example

Use linksub() with a link to a past reddit thread in the parentheses to link every fic linked in the thread. Good for common requests, just do that command with a few past threads on the subject and everyone is happy.
