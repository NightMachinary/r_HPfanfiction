For those of you who don't know what "isekai" means, it's basically accidental travel. This is a manga term. The MC is either reborn, transported to a different world, or reincarnated in a different body. I think I have seen similar tropes in HP fics before.


** Isekai tensei is pretty much your standard self Insert premise. Honestly can't say any stand out as stellar.

On the transportation side, you are basically looking for 'hp universe summons help'. Usually the victim comes from HP AU or a crossover, but sometimes it is someone from "a world without magic"

Honestly this is a lot less common in HP fanfiction than other fandoms. Likely because it is easy to integrate someone with modern life experiences into the setting as a muggle.

** In addition to What's Her Name in Hufflepuff, which someone else recommended, and I agree is the best SI in the fandom, To The Next is decent.

linkffn(12560378)

There was also a good one where the SI was Vincent Crabbe's sister called scourgify, but it hasn't been updated in years.

  "To the well organised mind, death is but the next great adventure" --- Albus Dumbledore. Pretty words, yeah, but she didn't expect them to be so damn literal. Sorta-SI/OC.

*** Just started reading To the Next, and it's really good so far. I've read What's Her Name in Hufflepuff and I love it. I guess SIs are my thing. *shrugs*

** What's her name in Hufflepuff is a good SI, mc is just an ordinary woman who falls through a mirror into the hp world I think.

Never linked a fic before but linkffn(what's her name in Hufflepuff)

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.
