#+begin_quote
  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Life never stops trying to tear her apart, but as everyone soon learns, Iris Potter bites back. Five unique tasks. Animagus and eventual reasonably powerful fem!Harry. Fourth year.

**** I didn't view it as aloof or anything, but that might've been because I also wasn't sober when I looked through this thread last night. I was just pleasantly surprised to see my own story at the top. But thank you :)

** The first two tasks in linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) are somewhat different. The first task is about navigating the unseen with ghouls and demiguises. The second task is like a quest where they rescue a captive after passing through load of obstacles like wyverns and runespoors.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  One shot, AU of GOF. Here's the story I wish I had found when I read GoF or GoF fanfiction. New, harder tasks. Observant!Smart!Harry. On the outs with Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, and Hogwarts in general. No pairings.
