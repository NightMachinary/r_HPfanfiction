The Trio was only able to bind his soul to another object. A few years later, that piece of rock got close to the sunken wreck of Bismarck, and the zombie battleship BismarckMort arose from the abyss. Far more people died in this war.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.
