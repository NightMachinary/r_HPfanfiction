This doesn't seem to be much requested - sorry if it is a common one but . . .it was wanting to read more about Sirius; how damaged he must have been, and how ill-equipped to deal with life altogether in the time between his escape from Azkaban and him falling through the Veil, and also to read a story where the poor beggar actually, you know, /does something/, that led me to discover fanfiction in the first place. Because I couldn't find much of what I wanted, it ultimately got me into writing too.

There must be something out there for me! Romance is fine but not (sorry if this offends you) Sirius/Hermione which I find quite repellent. Sirius/Tonks is heartbreakingly sad though I find it very believable. Wolfstar is all right in very small doses, and I like OCs. I have the attention span of a gnat, so I'm unlikely to tackle anything much over 90k words.


** Goodness, this seems to be a really unpopular theme! That makes me rather sad, as I feel he is so underdeveloped in canon. I know Sirius is a popular character. Don't people want to explore this, or is it just unpopular on this forum? In which case, is there a better place for me to go?

** Sirius/Tonks or Wolfstar aren't canon compliant though, unless I'm missing the point.

*** You could easily write stories for them in a way that doesn't contradict canon though. There are long periods of time when we don't know anything about what they are doing.

**** Much appreciated! He's one of my favorite characters to write, probably because we're a bit similar in the way I react to long periods of confinement or isolation.

  What makes one a monster? What makes one a hero? Nothing really; we're all evil burkes and the faster this whole train crashes, the better I'll feel about it.

** This is a nice little story; starfishstar writes mainly Remus/Tonks stories and this is from Remus's point of view but it's a rather moving point in time between two men who are trying to rediscover the ease they once felt with each other, and a new sense of shared purpose. linkffn(10268550)

  Twelve years is a great deal left unsaid. "Lie low at Lupin's" is only the very beginning. (Part of a series with "Skellig, Azkaban, Albion, Ã‰ire" and "Cast Your Soul to the Sea," but also stands alone.)
