No romance of any kind.

Harry can be in any house, the fic just needs to be focused on the Dark Arts.

Not the Dark Side political faction, just the dark arts.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** The Art of Self Fashioning

In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

------ it's about the darker side to transfiguration and honestly Harry is just a very unsettling individual in this. I didn't like him until a good ways in but couldn't stop myself from reading on.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

*** It's just that the classification of dark arts in this story is more centered on the idea that it's illegal rather than immoral (mostly just because it's dangerous as a side effect of how unique it is)

**** On the other hand, I do remember it being labelled as dark in story. The dark part is the human transfiguration which is also seen as unethical at points. Especially when it comes to transfiguring somebody else.

***** Yeah, it ain't cannibalism and extreme bdsm is all. Also the whole transfiguration of other people is more like just a normal curse since it is more to do with forcing a change of state on the person that the target should theoretically be able to resist if they themselves are powerful enough. Real dark arts curses in canon seem to include a lot more pain and gore and have more to do with creating an intentionally flawed state i.e. broken bones, poisoned blood, magical disease, etcetera.

****** Don't mean it ain't dark/unethical, if it isn't viewed as such, good chance the reader is quite desensitized because of the higher tier stuff.

I'd liken it to human transmutation in Fullmetal Alchemist (excluding the branch directly tied into bringing back the dead)

******* Except that with magic it's reversible, which, that being impossible in FMA is what really drives home the unethical part. In the art of self fashioning, since it's magic, a sufficient sense of self should be able to resist. And again, it isn't necessarily permanent. Like any other human transfiguration. Applied differently it could count as a teaching aid. On a slightly different note, you tell me, is it ethical to cast even a cheering charm on other people against their will, Or densaugeo and tarantellegra ore even furnunculus?

******** Although, the reason Harry didn't succumb to the animal was because of Regulas' intervention. Continuing on that path with no inner voice telling him to be human would have lead him that way. That would have been irreversible also the changing of a person's body without consent like he would have done to his parents is entirely unethical, especially when there was no way of knowing if he would have been succesful.... Especially since he wouldn't have been with this first methods and I think Minerva and the surrounding character's reactions put into perspective what the wizarding world deemed it as

Also we talk about dark magic being addictive and what not. Some authors say that it is, some not. Some say that it is addictive to some people while others can handle it fine. In all cases it is still defined as dark magic.

Either way, we are talking about a branch of magic that the fanfic author invented (I believe) which the author decided was dark magic. For all purposes, in the fic, the magic is dark as the author said so. Even if this disagrees with some cannon reasoning - it's fanfic. Authors rules.
