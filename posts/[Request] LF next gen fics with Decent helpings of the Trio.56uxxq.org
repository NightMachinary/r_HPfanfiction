I've gone through some of the old next gen threads and bookmarked the more promising stories, but I'd be grateful for specific recommendations of next gen fics with good helpings of the adults.

I loved Now or Never by queenb23 and am so sad it was never finished. I'm currently reading and enjoying loveadubdub's Lessons Learned.

Thanks!


** Ahh I was just going to recommend Lessons Learned! The sequel has more trio stuff than LL and especially has a lot of nice (not romantic!) moments with Harry and Hermione.

I also love [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7737991][*Put Your Guns Away It's Teatime*]] and the sequel that is a WIP [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7882474/chapters/18003613][*Put Your Curse in Reverse*]] by Frombluetored. They are more Harry/Ginny than trio, because there are not any POV Ron or Hermione chapters IIRC, but Ron and Hermione are main characters in both and the next-gen dynamics are really good.

*** Thanks so much for the recs! I've been jumping around, flipping back and forth among 3-4 fics, and now I think I'll try to stick with Lessons Learned to get to the sequel. Did you read loveadubdub's Lost prior to Lessons Learned? Wondering if I should backtrack further to get the full story.

The frombluetored fics are also in my to-read list, but I really appreciate the details you gave, which make me even more enthused to read them.

Much appreciated!

**** You really don't need to read Lost but you can if you want. There's more trio stuff in that and a lot more Ron and Hermione POV. There's also a prequel to Lost, from just after the war, but I haven't read it yet because it's incomplete and seems abandoned.

The frombluetored stuff is awesome, you'll really like it. The only negative is that after reading the fucked up family dynamics in the Lessons Learned-verse, her family dynamics seem almost too good to be true and everyone is too perfect. BUT I think that's actually a little more true to canon, and I like reading about how happy Harry and family are that I don't care if it's unrealistic.

***** I actually read Back to the Beginning years ago and really liked it. (I rarely read unfinished fic, but I was already a fan of the writer from another fandom, and I love her unique takes on characters.) I hadn't a clue there were technically three sequels, though I wasn't really into next gen stories at the time.

Thanks for the additional info! I usually eat up angst in fic, but I definitely prefer seeing the adult trio happy too. I think it's just right.
