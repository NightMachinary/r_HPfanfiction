What do you think would be more painful for Professor Snape? Having the child of his one true love be:

- A carbon copy of James, with Lily's eyes? The very face of his teenage tormentor given the eyes of his beloved, her eyes judging his every move from the face of her child.

O R:

- A carbon copy of Lily, with James's eyes? The very picture of the girl he betrayed down to the finest of details... bar that one "imperfection", the eyes of his enemy where hers should have been.

I personally think the latter, I think seeing "Lily" around class would be constant torture, as I think Snape (in a twisted sort of way) could pretend that she would have been the child he and Lily could have had, if not for James's eyes. And I think seeing James Potter's eyes in Lily's face would disgust him more than vice versa.


** Yeah, seeing James Potter's eyes on the girl he loved would definitely be more painful for him. I honestly think he'd probably treat that fem!Harry much worse than he did in canon, since she would look exactly like Lily but with that tiny "imperfection" (his bully's eyes) so Snape would hate her with the heat of a thousand burning suns.

** Option C: Kind of like Two-Face, with the right side of his head a carbon copy of James, and the left side a carbon cope of Lily

** The problem with "Rose" Potter (assuming the continuation of the Evans tradition of naming daughters after flowers) is that Snape would definitely groom her to bang either the second she passed her OWLs or the second she graduates.

*** no. i don't think Snape's love for Lily was anything sexual after she died. i don't think "snape only wanted to bang Lily". i deny to think like Voldemort did.

can't a dark man have at least one good thing in his life? it gave him the power to continue to spying. he was a bastard, a cruel man, there is no doubt in that. he shouldn't be allowed to near children. (he probably never wanted, that's on Dumbledore).

and it is disgusting to assume Snape would do such a thing-!

this is a book. JKR wrote Snape that way. No need to think Snape being a pedophile or Moody seeing students' underwears with his magical eye (as he did saw Harry's socks)

*** I wouldn't put it past Snape to... try something. But I also think he's filled with enough self loathing (as well as hatred for how she was born) that he wouldn't groom her as he wouldn't think himself worthy of her.

In the worst case, I think his conflicting feelings would be buried under the surface for years until he lashed out at some later point in "Rose's" teens. It would be interesting to explore the narrative consequences of something like that, even though it's vile to think about.
