It was raining (?) when Sirius find Harry and at first he didn' notice Harry is Harry

Lily and james was alive and they were thinking Harry was dead i think?

I remember at first Harry stays with Sirius for a while and dont want to live with his parents

I don' remember where I read it but it's AO3 or FFN

there was a lot of angst

And that's all what I remember about it.Sorry I know that my english is suck so ignore it pls


** It's on FFN! (I'll go look for it, but I'm usually super slow to find anything).

Edit : Right, so, I think it's this one : Love and Love Again. linkffn(7624618).
