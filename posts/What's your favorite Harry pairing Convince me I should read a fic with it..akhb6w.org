** Harry and Fleur, weird one I know. (I might prefer Harry and Hermione but I'm not gonna say the same one everyone else did)

There are a few barriers of course age being the biggest, not that it matters post Hogwarts. Here is why I like them.

They can both be seen as an outsider amongst the school regardless of their abilities. Harry is good at defensive magic and of course saving the school on a yearly basis. And no matter how much he excelled people would still turn on him like the drop of a hat. He always felt different and wanted to be like everyone else but he never could shake something that wasn't up to him.

Fleur (mostly in fanfic because she doesn't get much screen time in canon) is seen as an outcast due to not being entirely human. She presumably would feel like an outsider compared to the rest of the school and people would have concentrations about her. They can both be seen as outcasts that always wanted to fit in. Both of them could be seen as hero's (her beauty making her seem like an angel and Harry's life making him seem like a knight) and at other times they could be seen as evil (Fleur as some sort of siren seductress and Harry as the heir of Slytherin or evil)

Both of them could find comfort in each other and what they share in common while learning how to cope in different ways. Harry was never good at coping with adversity growing up although there's an argument to be made that he improved a lot. While Fleur dedicated her anger into studying and becoming a great witch. Both of them wanted to prove themselves in different ways, Fleur by winning the tournament and proving her peers wrong and Harry by trying to prove his worth to justify his parents sacrifice.

That's my take on it, let me know if it at all made sense!

** My favourite one is Harry/Hermione by a small margin. It's probably the pairing with the most content written in all of FanFiction. I like this pairing a lot since it's as close to canon as you can get without actually being canon. Transitioning from the established relationship into a romance is incredibly natural and easy. This ship also fits very naturally into basically any story type (time travel, post war, Hogwarts, pre hogwarts, etc.). I particularly like the shorter to mid length fics (10-60k) post Hogwarts fics with this pairing.

*** I feel like it is the most probable pairing if you give the war some real psychological impact on the cast. Because for a few months, it was Harry and Hermione against the entire world. It would have been an experience which changed then for life, and they had no one who could relate. Harry had no family. Hermione might have irreversibly erased herself from her parents memories. And while Ron was certainly part of the hunt, he had a family he could return to. Even if 3/4s of the Weasleys died, he would have more left than Harry and Hermione. The same degree of loneliness would be incomprehensible to him, much less to anyone else who wasn't there.

*** Too bad its so hard to find good or new Harry/Luna fics that don't go into the plotline of having Luna being a seer or not be used as a plot device. A fic where she's either close to canon and she actually see creatures that no-one else does, or grown-up and lost/ isn't deluded with her creatures, even if they were real at some point.

Idk how to explain what I mean, but fics like Quidditch World Cup, Unspeakable Beauty and the Luna from HP and PoS are great examples for what I meant, both types of Luna.

I'd argue that no one from the established female characters could believably fall for a racial motivated terrorist. Therefore you take the girl who tried to surrender Harry and the guy who racked up an impressive war crime tally before turning 17 and stick them together. The other options were Millicent Bullstrode and Marietta Edgecombe.

** Harry/Tonks.

It comes with the potential for a delightfully imbalanced relationship without reaching "creepy" because their age difference isn't that great. I'd argue that Harry would need someone a little older/more experienced in life to cope with what he had been through. Yet at the same time, in OotP Tonks shows that she has the unique ability to lighten the mood even if everyone was gloomy about Voldemort. Harry would need someone like that.

To the World Harry might be the Chosen One /Man who won, but I think that he would need someone with whom he could drop the act and be just Harry, a young man with the weight of the world on his shoulders.

Despite all of this I have to admit that most stories do not handle this pairing well. Far too often they make Tonks completely submissive as soon as Harry asks about "Her REAL self'. Because most of the time it assumes that the whole Tonks personality os just an act.

** My top 3:

1. Harry/Hermione - prior to HBP and the insanity that came along with it, she's the only one who understands Harry. She draws him out of his room when he's moping after the snake attack. She's very loyal to Harry and they have a true partnership. She isn't afraid to tell Harry what he needs to hear.
2. Harry/Susan - she's lost family to Voldemort, too. She's impressed by Harry's skills - i.e., the Patronus - but she isn't in awe of them. She's a member of the D.A. She has family connections.
3. Harry/OC or Harry/name-based OC - you can develop them however you want.

** Harry and Tom (or Voldemort it depends). I know it's a bit off the rocker but I stand by it. There are so many ways to go about it and it's exciting to me. For it to work it has to be certain plot devices active to explain all their differences or change the dynamic around. For a fic to be good the writer has to be good and when it's done right it's so satisfying. They have something to struggle for, for differences to work out and that can make it fantastic. I love some confusion and the mess it makes. There is a lot of bad stories out there so it can be hard to muddle through, but the good ones are heart-tugging.

Im biased because the first fic I read of this pairing (linkffn(one hundred and sixty nine)) is my single favorite fic of all time. Sirius and Hermione and both clever, funny, nice, loyal people with an utterly ruthless edge when the people they love have been attacked. But where Hermione is cautious and by the book, Sirius is tempermental and reckless. Overall, I think they compliment each other well.

I don't love Harry as a romantic lead. I think that he's (for a variety of reasons) either terrible at it or entirely out of character.
