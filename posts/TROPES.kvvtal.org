tropes

what are your favorite book troupes for fanfic

mine:

enemies to lovers: I need them to want to kill each other for most of the book with little hints of sexual tension. I love when they go from hate to a friends with benefits to hate to love. I love that lolll

slow burn: this goes hand in hand with enemies to lovers and every fanfic I read. I hate hate hate when they start dating or confessing feelings in chapter three like what about the chase, the want, the stress I need it

pining: I love this sooo much. it's so good when you're reading from the main pov of the oblivious person but still in a 3rd person pov because you know what the hurt facing and the glances mean and it just stresses you out on when they are going to get it. I love a Drarry fic like this and it's always harry as the oblivious one lol

fake couple: THIS IS THE ONE!!!! when they hate each other but they need each other to complete their own personal needs and as the relationship continues they start to complement each other in a sense that they begin to mirror behavior and become more aware of the other person and they get scared that they start to like each other so they push away and then they start to come back ughgngng I love it


** Found family is my go to trope. I love people taking care of each other and being there for each other.

** If we're talking romance, I have a thing for friends to lovers. It's not very dramatic or anything, but it's just so soft and nice and strangely satisfying. (Most of the time, the transition is so slow and organic that the characters barely notice it themselves, and that's so nice, too, when otherwise stories use the same cliché drama to form relationships).

*** I am a sucker for a good friends to lovers I love when someone has to point out that they have feelings for the other person because they just assume their chemistry isn't based in attraction

** I quite enjoy time travel fics. I am especially partial to Hermione going back in time and having to live her life in the past.

I also like when an adult gets de-aged. I read a Snape one where he gets de-aged and put back into Hogwarts to live his life again.

** u/turbinicarpus:
#+begin_quote
  enemies to lovers
#+end_quote

As long as the enmity goes both ways. If both give as good as they get, it can work well. If one is consistently the bully and the other is the victim, no.

** Enemies to lovers Forced proximity (have to go on long mission alone together, must hide out together, arranged marriage, anything isolating and forced to work together)

Found family

Revolution/resistance/war/espionage

Slow burn romance

Enemies to lovers/rivals to lovers that involves a lot of witty banter and sexual tension

Anything mystery/crime/murder mystery/mafia

Anything horror

Forced friend group (like ppl who normally wouldn't be friends or are all in different cliques for sone reason are brought together...all have detention at same time and witness something that now only they know about or all end up on a trip together where shit goes down and now in dealing with all that become close friends because they share secret/have to deal with it...like the tv show how to get away with murder where 5 interns with nothing in common get wrapped up in a murder)

** Yesss, these are good. It's allll about the pining.

I really like soulmate aus even though it's hard to find good ones. If done right it can lead to a lot of mutual pining and eventual fluff. I think my favorite soulmate fic wasn't even a romantic one though, but a platonic one with the protagonist bonding with all their friends

** •Coming of age: There's something special about following a character as they find themselves and become comfortable in their own skin.

•Friends to lovers: Honestly, that "Oh shit!" moment when the realisation of "I love my best friend" hits, is cathartic. Extra enjoyable if they were fake dating.
