I know that JK Rowlings The Cursed Child did not go over well with many Harry Potter fans.

So I was wondering if someone Re-wrote it/ made a fanfiction about it maybe the entire plotline from Harry's perspective/ what Harry was doing during that time.


** There are plenty of fics that rewrite the story of Harry's family, from peaceful family life in linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) to Harry being widowed and raising the three children alone in linkffn(Grow Young With Me).

But if you were asking for a plot that's more similar to CC (long-distance time travel that messes things up and has to be repeated to fix them), except written better, there's linkffn(Backwards with Purpose) and more especially the sequel, The Book of Albus. Book 1 was ok and is necessary to understand the plot, but book 2 was what really impressed me.

It may not seem at first like it involves Harry's children, but be patient.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

*** I second the recommendation on Backwards with a Purpose: The Book of Albus.

I didn't know that something could make the time travel genre more interesting.

But you do have to read the 1st book to fully appreciate the 2nd one.

** I don't know of any particular Cursed Child rewrites. There's really just not that much I'd consider salvageable from the story between the plotlines and the characterizations. Filtering fics by Next-Gen will get you more stories with characters like Albus Potter.

For Dad!Harry you can't go wrong with Grow Young With Me or Dudley's Memories and its sequel Snape's Memories

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".
