Back in early 2005, prior to the release of the sixth book in the series, a friend of mine "acquired" a "leaked" .doc-file with a copy of the book, which we later noticed was complete fanfiction. The author tried to make it seem like it was the real deal though. In it, Harry was the Half Blood Prince and became a hippogryph animagus. Totally different from canon. I can't remember most of it, though.. But when I read it, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Has anyone else read it? And if you have, do you know where to find it again?


** I REMEMBER THIS. You are not alone, I totally read this too, thinking it was a really weird 'real' leaked copy. Can't remember much of it now...I hope someone finds it!

**** It definitely was! It's how I got into fanfiction. Back in late 2002 everyone was slitting their wrists waiting for OttP to come out, so as an industrious young man, I searched Kazaa (old p2p file sharing platform), finding a pdf of the Psychic Serpent, named HP & the Order of the Phoenix. I think I still have that pdf in an old hard drive.

Also kind of ironic, I ended up enjoying PS a lot more than OttP.

***** I think it was how a lot of people got into fanfiction, including me. I saw this thread and thought "oh, this is the following generation's Psychic Serpent"

I only noticed it wasn't the real deal when I read the actual book's blurb.

** Ok, I found it. I don't actually know the name of the fanfic, but from my brief research, the name is actually "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince". The first chapter is called "Funeral" and his animagus form is described as "Harry's gryffin was a half lion and half bird creature, possessing the greatest attributes of both; it was truly a beast to behold." My PDF copy has the name of the author at the end, (HarryWriter) which corresponds to an FFN profile ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/208020/HarryWriter]]). There is one story there, which is just a first chapter preview of the first fanfic the guy wrote, and there's a link in there that goes to where the guy has the rest uploaded. I haven't actually checked that link, so I don't know what it actually leads to.

-edit- FWIW, I came across this pdf the same way many probably did back then. I downloaded pdfs of all 7 books, and for whatever reason, this one came as the 6th book. I didn't even notice it until like 4 years after the fact that I didn't have the real 6th book.

*** I also have a copy of that PDF lying around. Searching for the first paragraph, it is referenced [[https://cuppacafe.com/hp-and-the-half-faked-book/182][here]], also I found a (plagiated) fanfiction called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2762176/1/Surprises]["Surprises"]], which has only 16 chapters.

But you also find this fanfiction called [[http://www.fanfictionworld.net/hparchive/printentirefic.php?psid=51619&chapterid=51725&all=1]["Hary Potter and the Ring of the Ancients"]], which seems to have the first 9 chapters in the archive. But googling for the title you find [[http://www.angelfire.com/planet/matrix-darkside/E-Books/Harry%20Potter%20&%20The%20Ring%20of%20The%20Ancients.pdf][this PDF]], which seems so have the complete text and 32 chapters.

**** This is the one! You guys are amazing, and it's great to hear other people remembering this too. Just had to read the first chapter about Dudley being a wizard, which I remember shocked me but I really liked it back in the day. I really hope it's as great as I remember =)

Much appreciated, all of you!
