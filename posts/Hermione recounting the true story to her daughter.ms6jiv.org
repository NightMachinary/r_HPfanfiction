:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Read a great harmony fic a couple of years ago. In it Harry sold the rights to his story to JK Rowling in order to fund the war effort, starts very similar to canon but begins to diverge as JK took creative liberties in her books. It's told as a series of flashbacks and letters as Hermione recounts the true story to her and Harry's daughter. Anyone know the one I'm talking about? Highly recommend to any harmony lovers!
