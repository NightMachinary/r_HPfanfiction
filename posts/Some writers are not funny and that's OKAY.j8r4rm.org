Major pet peeve! I hate when very good or even just decent writers ruin their own works with humor that just doesn't land. It's very annoying to have to read whole paragraphs of random witticisms that are just not funny, outright offensive or just....bizarre. I understand that people feel like they have to pull out the joaks when writing the twins or the marauders or even harry himself but if it isn't their strength it doesn't work by oversaturating the story with bad humor. I feel like the original series did this well, there were some very memorable funny/sarcastic oneliners but it wouldn't have been the same if harry was cracking jokes 24/7 and that is with rowling being someone that writes humor pretty well. What is "funny" is subjective and all that but i'll give the biggest eyeroll (and probably exit the story entirely) to a character making 10 lame ass jokes in a row and everyone around them dying from laughter.

I feel like a better solution is just....not writing humor if you know it isn't your strength. Making the marauders or whoever else casually funny rather than standup comedians and most of all, not describing how everyone in a 10 feet radius heard their super awesome joke and is laughing super mega hard.

***** Oh. I have read this before and I will just click out. I've been getting into the star wars fandom lately and in this I have seen one fic where obi wan is basically just tortured over and ove. All. Most got eaten by a bear, which is when i clicked off of it

It is very annoying and just lazy writing at some (most) points

** Sure, don't write the same joke over and over, but /do/ use fanfiction as a fun writing practice -including writing jokes!

*** absolutely! I just think it's a pity when very good writers force themselves to write humor because they're writing a canonically funny character

** This! I found a original fic once, of a chick getting teleported with a truck to a garbage dimension. Author absolutely loved having the mc talk to herself, sprouting idioms, doing references (im like Switzerland, im neutral!) And it wasn't really funny, seemed to just be a odd coping mechanims.

Then the author introduces an alien. And the mc KEEPS sprouting nonsense! It was so cringy. Especially because the alien DIDN'T treat her as mentally ill. At no point did the alien trwat her as less than sane. Even when 85% of all conversations was the mc saying references the alien had no way of understanding.

I gave up pretty fast once i found out that it was a permanent personality trait. And the author found himself to be "hilarious"
