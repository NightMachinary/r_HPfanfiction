Around a month ago I submitted this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/92r0cm/when_you_find_that_perfect_fic_and_it_gets_updated/][post]].

Yesterday the rewrite got abandoned after 1 chapter! Author decided to write his own series instead, while giving no info where to read it.

At least the original story is still there, right? [[http://imgur.com/zwqzz3X.jpg][Right?]]

** At times I have been tempted to rewrite some of my work, but I never have because I absolutely know I would do this.
