** Better be Gry....You are the official custodian of the Sorting Hat and your duties include but are not limited to spellchecking the Sorting Hat's Song, dusting the Sorting Hat, giving it company by wearing it all the time and listening to music and last but not the least, checking for the Sword of Godric Gryffindor to ensure the goblins haven't stolen it.

** Some people think that Mr. Potter is nodding in agreement to something the old hat is saying. Others think he is attempting some sort of ritual. Still others think perhaps he has fallen ill.

Nope. He's just bopping to the beat.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/][*/Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/980211/enembee][/enembee/]]

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
