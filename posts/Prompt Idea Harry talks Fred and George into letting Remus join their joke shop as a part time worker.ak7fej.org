I love Remus Lupin, and always felt bad that Remus struggled so much because of him being a Werewolf, well what if Harry helped Remus out, and what better way to get a previous Marauder work with the Weasley twins?!

It'd be perfect, because the twins would know that Remus is a werewolf and would need time off work during the full moon. Plus he worked with James and Sirius with their prank ideas.

Not too picky with anything else, can be a drabble, a oneshot, a multichapter; whatever.

If there are any pairings; though I don't know why there would be, but if there are; no Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione or Harem Harry.

No character bashing.

No Harry is lord heir to whatever.

Other than that go nuts. Feel free to link the story once you get the first chapter up.

Even if it's an AU where everyone is alive is fine.


** I've actually seen this in a fic before...

Didn't this happen in A Black Comedy? Harry and Sirius invest in Fred and George's joke shop, and get them to hire Lupin.

I might be misremembering, but I do remember such a fic where Remus is hired on at WWW.

*** Yep, Remus was +working+ playing solitaire at a tech support company before Sirius and Harry got him a job where he could actually use his talents

** Is this assuming all of them survived the war? Their joke shop was only running for like a year while during that time remus was working full time for the order. Undercover no less.

*** Could be a decent story to tell if Remus has survived but Fred and Tonks didn't. Maybe Remus just starts helping out George more as a way for both of them to cope/mourn together. Over time they heal some, George asks Remus to replace Fred at the shop, because If anyone were to replace him he'd love it to be a Marauder.

A cool love twist would be to make Verity part of the story, but she's older than typically depicted, closer to Remus's age (or not, he already pulled young tail with Tonks).

** Would he be working in back, like developing new products? If he worked where people could see him, that would hurt their business. People wouldn't want to shop at a store staffed by a werewolf. Think of the children!

*** lol; I doubt that'd be too much of a big deal (at least for Gryffindors, and maybe Ravenclaw and Hufflepuffs) as quite a few people seemed to really love Remus.

***** To fair, Lupin did endanger the students, and him forgetting the potion was irresponsible and could have easily ended in somebody killed/turned. Even if some people weren't prejudiced against werewolves in general, they would be completely justified in wanting Remus out of Hogwarts after that.

**** I mean, remember how ron, a gryffindor acted towards remus after finding out he was a werewolf? He freaked the fuck out.

And we never really saw him in the "real" world. He says to harry in book 7, you've only seen me around order members. Others can barely speak to me.
