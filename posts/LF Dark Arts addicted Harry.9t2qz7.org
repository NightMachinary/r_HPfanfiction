Part-read a fanfic a while back where harry used some dark magic and ended up going too deep, getting addicted and being forced to learn the dark arts.

Dumbledore had to arrange for him to be tutored in them reluctantly.

Sorry it's not too much to go off of but I really wanted to find this again.

Will update if any more of it comes to mind
