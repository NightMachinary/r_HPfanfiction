** Could be a fun prompt, if nobody's done it yet; Dumbledore decides that the 'power he knows not' is an Obscurus and has been deliberately trying to make Harry one. Sticking him with the Dursleys, mind rapes with Snape, all the deadly threats year after year with no support or aid, basically the worst bits of Manipulative!Evil!Dumbles.

Whether this is a full fix or just an angry rant from his portrait after his death belongs to the writer.

** It's been a while since I read this, but I'm pretty sure (female) Harry is an obscurial in it. It's not a major theme though.

** linkffn(Harry Stark and the Spirit of Iron) is a crossover with this as one of the elements. It has sporadic updates and is actually quite decent, at least so far. Cheers

  Magic and technology. Polar opposites for some, and yet for one boy living on the streets ... maybe they can be something more. Follow Harry as he is taken in by the famous Tony Stark and starts to combine his own unique powers with technology in ways that make him more than just a wizard, or a thief, or a prodigy, but instead make him ... an Avenger. Harry/multi.

This also has Newt! To me that's a positive, not everyone would agree, of course.
