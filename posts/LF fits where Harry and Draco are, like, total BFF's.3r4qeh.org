  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II in progress.

This one has a fairly friendly relationship between the two from what I can remember. It's pretty popular though, so there's a good chance you've already read it if you're looking for this kind of stuff. Warning if you haven't read it, it's got a fair bit Potter bashing (its one of those twin of the boy who lived is shipped off fics. It's got a great Pettigrew though iirc. Dude's a fucking genius.)

*** Whaaaa? That story is great, but Harry and Draco are by no means friends. They pretty much hate each other.

  What if Harry were a Slytherin? What if everyone thought his twin brother was the BWL? What if someone tried to do something creative and innovative with the two most overused cliches in HP fanfic? AU, currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NOTE: There will be NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year.

** Try [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/507700/chapters/893666][The Handbook of Elf Psychology by evansentranced]]. The HP & DM friendship takes a while to appear, but their interactions were great.
