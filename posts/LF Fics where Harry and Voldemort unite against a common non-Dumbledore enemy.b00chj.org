Dumbledore can be an obstacle but he can't be the big bad final boss. I don't mind if Harry's in his own time or traveled back to “fix” things or what have you. I'd prefer there not to be plot-regurgitation but it's not a requirement.

OP!Harry, Dark!Harry, bashing, slash and crossovers fine. Please no mpreg, pottercest, harems, gender bending or smut/romance-centric plots. Thank you!


** I recommend checking out the recs in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9pch9p/any_fics_that_feature_harry_and_tom_riddle/][this thread]] from 4 months ago.

Aside from those, you might like the following fics:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10490069/1/Of-Kings-Of-Pawns-and-Of-Men][Of Kings, Of Pawns, and of Men]] is moving Harry and Voldemort towards a high-stakes conflict against Grindelwald. (In progress. The fic seems to be pre-slash HP/LV at this point.)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]] has Voldemort and Harry as reluctant allies against several powerful threats. (Complete. No pairings.)

  Harry wakes to find that he is now in Tom Riddle's body. The Dark Lord? He happens to be doing an unfortunately good job of impersonating the Boy-Who-Lived. Dumbledore's disappeared, and Voldemort doesn't hesitate to let Harry know he makes a weak replacement. Naturally, Harry has no choice but to prove him wrong. Also: Grindelwald escapes Nurmengard and a new war ensues.

  Part 1 of 'The Wandering Devil'. Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. Harry and Voldemort took oaths to end their long and bloody war. Over a century later, a convoluted plot forces the two (slightly out of practice) immortals into an adventure together.

**** Sort-of. The Ministry is much different than it was in the books by that point. Harry and Riddle are forced to work together at the beginning of the story because of the oaths they took to ensure the ceasefire years ago. Harry's part of the oath requires being somewhat beholden to the Ministry, though that changes later in the fic.

Because magic? If it can seemingly violate conservation of energy, then why not some "mere" biological limitations? If all the bones in someone's hand can be vanished by a flick of a stick and regrown by a potion, and people can transform into other people or into half-human half-beast hybrids, then why should mpreg be the only thing behind the demarcation line of the impossible?

*** There are some fics that make mpreg seem somewhat realistic for the wizardjng world such as the use of specific potions and whatnot but even those I'm just not that fond of them. The completely random mpreg stories are quite annoying or just crackficcy enough to be hilarious because they are specifically picking fun at the trope.

*** My issue is with the fallacy of the word itself. Female of any species are those capable of "giving birth" or laying eggs. When a person can give birth, they are, by definition, a female.

**** Male seahorses give birth. In fact, most of the family of Syngnathidae have it where the males give birth. The process is basically opposite of male humans injecting seed to meet the eggs with females injecting their eggs to get to the male seed.

Females do tend to give birth, but it seems very arbitrary to say that birth giving is the sole identifier of gender given that biology is extremely flexible. It might be more accurate to say "those who create the eggs are by definition female", but that has issues too as there are plenty of people who we would agree are female who don't have the organs to reproduce nor the eggs that would do such a thing. My mother is one example as she had surgery to prevent further pregnancy. There are plenty of species, most famously Clown Fish, that become female later in life even if they were born male. Given this, what attributes would you say are necessary for someone to qualify as a female?
