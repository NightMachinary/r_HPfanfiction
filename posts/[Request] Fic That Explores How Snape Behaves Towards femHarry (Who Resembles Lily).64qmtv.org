Based on the books, it seems as though Snape's main motivation for despising Harry was how he resembled James. Any fic recommendations that explore this?

Just to be clear, if the fic is pedophilloic / ships Snape with any student, time travel or otherwise, I am not interested.

*** Hmm, I suppose that's reasonable, though I still think Snape's hatred was so immediate and visceral because when he looked at Harry he saw James.

**** Hmpf...he's just an out of control child throwing a tantrum in an adult's body...I don't really like Snape, I think someone (Note: I am talking about Dumbledore!) should have really told him to grow out of it.

I have been bullied in school, too and the only thing I'd do if I had to teach the children of my tormentors would be to keep an extra close eye on them to make sure that they aren't fucking bullies (and if they are: To stop them being bullies)...I mean look at Harry, he's nothing like James, the only similarities are the looks! James was a brash, out loud and proud bully while Harry is kind of withdrawn (he only has 2 close friends after all!), he is shy, he is lazy (even James did better at school than he did and was an ace in transfiguration!) etc. so not even close to James at all - hell, Harry didn't prank anybody while at fucking Hogwarts at all!

***** The character Snape represents is downright asshole. He is nowhere near suitable to be a teacher. While I genuinely get his side of story but wholeheartedly despite the character for bullying 11-12 year olds.

***** Dumbledore tried.

#+begin_quote
  Snape was pacing up and down in front of Dumbledore.\\
  ‘-- mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent --'\\
  ‘You see what you expect to see, Severus,' said Dumbledore, without raising his eyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today. ‘Other teachers report that the boy is modest, likeable and reasonably talented. Personally, I find him an engaging child.'

** Never-ending Road and its sequel No Journey's End [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12181631/1/No-Journey-s-End]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8615605/1/The-Never-ending-Road]]

"A while back, I wondered what might have happened if, instead of being stuck with a child whom he viewed primarily as James Potter's, Snape had to protect a child he considered predominately to be Lily's."

Author claims it will eventually end up with hpss, though it is not there yet. If you want, you can just try the Neverending road - it is marked as 'completed', it has 600k words and there is no romantic relationship between Snape and Harriet (or any other student).

  This is a different Harry Potter story, in it Harry Potter isn't the only famous Potter in the Wizarding world. No, his twin sister is also famous, her name is Brenda Lilian Potter. This is mostly her story from the point she and Harry got their famous scars. There is some spanking of teens.Disclaimer. Thank you JK Rowling for creating Harry Potter.
