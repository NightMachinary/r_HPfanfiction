Hello,

I recall reading a while ago a particular Harry/Ginny soul bond fic in which the bond activates when they touch innocently (as in, not particularly intimately) on platform 9 3/4. I don't remember the name, or even if it was any good, but I seem to recall that particular scene being rather well written. The fic in question was certainly at least 60k words long, and more likely than not, completed - those are the filter settings I usually use on FFN. It was... probably not by Epeefencer - something about his writing rubs me the wrong way - but if it was, do tell me so I can move on with my life.

I know soul bonds are not thought particularly highly of, especially in this community, but they're a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine, so do please indulge me. On a similar note, if you have any other Harry/Ginny soul bond fics you think are any good, feel free to share - I personally prefer them to be fairly long, though.

Thanks,

LordJackdaw

** I love soul bond fics. I am absolutely attracted to horrible fanfiction and read them all.

The fic I think you mean is [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833][Meaning of One by Sovran on SIYE]]. Its on "One day I swear I'll come back to finish this hiatus" after finally finishing Book 2 from a horrible cliffhanger. I think it might even be the Ur-Example soul bond fic, if not it is definitely the codifier and maker.

Other ones that are decent: linkffn(soul nexus) linkffn(Error of Soul)

Best one imo: linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond)

I know I've read more but those are the ones I remember as standing out, for one reason or another. I've read so many terrible ones. Amp has probably my favorite Dumbledore ever written.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

  Ginny Weasley was not all right after her first year - she pushed away everyone and everything that was important to her in her guilt and depression. But then, someone literally walked into her head and life and changed everything. A HG Epic, Harry PoV.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.
