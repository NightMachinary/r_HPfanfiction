What if Harry Potter had a brother? What if he had a person to look up to, someone who stood up for him? Read on as Charlus Potter takes the Wizarding World by storm.

One of few OC Mc stories I could find. Please suggest more if you have.

What I really liked was author is spending time to build the character relationships, and also he isn't simply making MC too OP immediately. It seems a bit natural, and it is one of the best big-brother fics I have read. Also important to note is that Dumbledore is good, so it has none of the extreme and cheesy bashing yet.
