While I was searching for random fanfics to satisfy my need for badass things, the thought of a crossover with Warframe crossed my mind. Combining the Void ability and magic together? Oh hell yes, and I found this little one-shot while searching for this particular crossover and I think I hunger for more.

  For 12 years, she has been forced to watch, prevented from going to him, prevented form caring for him, no matter what happened. She was barred from seeing him. But now, she simply doesn't care. The Wizarding world will fear the wielder of flames... for her wrath is terrible, and her love knows no bounds.
