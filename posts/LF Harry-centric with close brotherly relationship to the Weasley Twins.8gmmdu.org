I'm really interested in fanfiction that has Harry and the twins with a brotherly relationship - closer than Harry's and Ron's. And if there is one where Harry has a better relationship with them and the older Weasley children, that'd be great too. Thanks!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11857153/1/Unspeakables][Unspeakables]] by Ebenbild is definitely another fic that is highly amusing and surprisingly well written. Despite the kind of crackish feeling in the beginning of the story, it really does get serious. Basically, Harry and Percy time travel.

  Despite the Dursley's best efforts, they are unable to stamp the freakishness out of Harry Potter. Much to their horror, the dreaded Hogwarts letter comes for Harry...and their son as well. What will happen when Dudley goes to Hogwarts with Harry Potter, intent on telling the wizarding world how terrible their saviour truly is?

  Twenty one years after the war, the Death Eaters strike back and the Weasley, Potter and Lupin families die. Thank Merlin, Harry knows exactly what to do. "An' in the Minishtry... er... th' Depaaamen... er... Demammend... er... y'know... the mishterious thingy!... there'sh a roooom! A room foa time!" Oddly enough, this time Percy is along for the ride. Unspeakable! Harry and Percy, time travel.
