I have something in mind right now ... uhh so if a half-blood married a Muggleborn what would their child status be?


** Halfblood. You need four magical grandparents to be considered a pureblood.

** half-blood. This is what I hate about this system, because you can be a half-blood so many ways

** If you've got two Muggle parents you're a Muggleborn, if you've got four Magical grandparents you're a Pureblood. Everything else (assuming the parents are all human) is Halfblood.
