A Cadmean Victory

I loved the more adult and dark harry approach without going overboard on just dark magic, even reasoning for him to use it and so forth, was a good read!

The Accidental Animagus

I didnt like the writing style SOOOO much in that one, but the approach of an harry that can actually argue and think for himself was cool :P also all that political investment was cool but a bit overboard.


** If you like that two fics, you should also like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185;11910994). Both are 600+k words long, have tons of politics, and feature quite ruthless protagonists.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
