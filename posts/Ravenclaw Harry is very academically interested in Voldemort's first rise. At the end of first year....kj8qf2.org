When Quirrel removes his turban, Harry is very excited instead of being scared. He pulls out a well-worn notebook full of questions, ranging from the technical ("Is the Dark Mark really a modified Protean Charm, or a unique thaumaturgic creation?") to the legal ("How did you avoid paying taxes on your imported illegal potions ingredients that you disguised as a shipment of citrus fruits?"). Voldemort is powerless against the blitzkrieg.

*** 'Look dude, me being a darklord was due to a strange loop hole in Hogwarts law at the time. it turns since my last name was riddle I was counted as muggleborn student, and it turns out at that time Hogwarts had laws that did not allow muggleborns to teach.\\
however it does allow darklords to teach. so I figured I would apply for the legal status of darklord. How ever my legal skills are terrible and I failed to realise that applying for legal status as a darklord was basically a trap for idiots as being a dark lord is illegal. so I figured if I am going to go to Jail anyway why not go in style

**** Because she is. Since I'm on mobile Andi don't know how to use that spoiler thingy, SPOILER ALERT

First of all, a certain level of ravenclaw-ish behaviour is required if you are going to be a dark lord. And second, Voldemort teaches Harry fighting all year long, and yes you can say she wants to recruit him and blah blah blah, but IMO she kinda enjoys sharing her knowledge with a committed soul, like Harry. And let's not forget that, in the end when she confronts her, she even uses that as means to teach Harry. In second year, she answers every question he asks , and in many occasions, in less than five minutes. She also shares her rather vast knowledge about Chaos magic, which I think only Dumbledore knows about,oh and don't get me started on her book in speaker's den.

SPOILER ALERT finished I guess I suggest it to anyone who hasn't read it, beautiful world building and great characterization all around. Linkffn(Harry potter and the ashes of chaos)

***** I liked the non-Harry POVs in year one, but that's getting hella tedious now. A lot of shit we are privy to that would serve the story better if they'd happened off-screen.

Sometimes, it's nice to wonder.

It hasn't quite reached Prince of Slytherin levels, but I suspect it's something the author aspires to. Oh well.

I really don't care about Ginny and her issues in Slytherin house, nor do I care about Charlotte Weits or Slater, or that Cuffe kid. If I want to read Ginny make her way as a Slytherin, there's a very, very good story that does just that, and it's a lot better.

At any rate, I've no idea what the elder Weits is doing, and I'm a lot more interested in her than her little sister and bloody Ares Black. Did we need a whole scene with Lucius deliberating before he decides to invite Bellatrix and her husband for dinner? Fucking hell.

I wanna read HP, and I only care about secondary characters insofar as they have a direct impact on HP.

** Voldemort took a breath, purged Quirrel from his body and took it over in a gruesome display of black magic. Then he conjured a chair and sat down.

He never got to be a teacher, but he still liked teaching. Dumbledore won't be able to get into the room anyway.

"I can't answer any questions about legality, because I obviously don't really care about that sort of thing. Now what was your first question?"

"The Dark Mark."

"Ah yes. One of my finest creations, if I do say so myself. You're in first year, so you likely haven't stumbled upon spell creation yet?"

Harry looked puzzled, "No, I haven't."

"That's alright. That part of the library only reveals itself if you get an O on your third year charms exam, or if you take spell creation for your NEWTs."

He drew Quirrel's wand, and extracted the unicorn hair from it, twisting it idly through the air.

"The Dark Mark started as a protean, but I think at this point you could call it unique. You see, the protean normally only links two objects to each other, and does so in a collapsingly fractal manner. This is because the two objects cease to be two, and instead become the same object. It has to do with the unique position of both objects in the resonant arcane frame."

He twirled the hair between two fingers, focusing intently on it. It began shriveling into itself.

"The protean charm erases the arcane position of both objects, and creates a new one in their stead, then links the two unbound objects to this singular. In so doing, you essentially create an object that exists at two spots at once."

The boy was nodding along, and a glance with legilimency showed that while only in a rudimentary way, he did understand. Most curious.

"So what I did was create an object, but only in concept - the symbol the dark mark takes. It's not a real 'object', not physical, but in the arcane frame, it still exists as an object. This is, fundamentally, also how the Taboo functions. In my experiements, I discovered that every object is simply a shadow, a mere echo of the true idea of an object, and that these true ideas exist within an arcane frame-space overlaying the one we can comprehend. In essence, any object is an echo of an ideal, projected into the comprehensible frame and then echoed further into the physical world."

The hair was almost completely black, now, burned and shriveled.

"What I therefore did was establish that an ideal form for the dark mark existed. I then used spells you wouldn't comprehend without a hefty amount of psychic surgery to pull this ideal from the overlying framespace into the one humans can comprehend. Then, I created a protean linked to this object, but not an ordinary one - this protean is a thirteen-seven, which means it can be linked in thirteen groups of seven."

With the hair fully blackened, Voldemort ran his fingers over the rosewood of Quirrel's wand, every brush turning the vibrant wood grey as ash.

"This was the base shape of the mark, but the big downside of what I did was that I cannot alter the object in the arcane frame by altering its expression in the material world."

The wood now looked old. ancient, even. Voldemort drew the blackened hair out into a long strand.

"I needed a way to alter the mark. So I placed it within my own soul."

He drew the hair through the wood once more, and the new wand sparked slightly.

"And from there, altering all marks was as easy as placing an enchantment onto my own soul. The enchantment on the mark could always be better, more streamlined, but I'm satisified for the moment."

Twirling the newly corrupted want at the mirror, the surface suddenly rippled, and flowed through the air into a flask the dark lord had taken from his robes. He corked it, and stood up.

"Well, boy, I do believe your headmaster is getting desparate out there. Work hard, get smart, and maybe one day you'll be as great as I. Adios!"

And he broke the wand in half, releasing a cloud of ash into the air. When it cleared, there was an ear-splitting crack and the door exploded inwards. Albus stood, in the broken doorframe, looking at Harry's baffled face and the empty mirror, and swore.

**** Great twist!

--------------

Voldemort appeared in his lab, the body of Quirrel almost torn at the seams. Well, that's the price one pays for doing an ash-travel through siege wards.

He uncorked the flask and poured it into his pensieve, then entered it like one would any other memory.

The surface of a mirror is an incredibly arcane object - it can hold spirits, contain energies and open portals - and most importantly, it could theoretically be used to store objects of immense magical power without creating an energy field as blatantly visible to any wizard as the sun.

But - what's this? There was nothing?

Voldemort checked his memory for tampering, and found none - the stone had definitely existed within the mirror, and as he'd taken the mirror surface, he'd also circumvented any enchantment placed on the frame, including the one that had blocked his attempts to retrieve it. So where was it?

He exited the pensieve and re-bottled the mirror surface, then delved into his own memories of the last five minutes.

Telling the boy about the mark, drawing out the wand, and... what was that?

Accessing only his memory of his sixth sense, he observed with growing, seething anger that the source of magic concealed within the mirror had jumped outwards, towards the boy, landing in his pocket.

How had he missed it? Had he been so engrossed in the explanation and corrupting the wand?

"I'll get you next time, Albus! Next Time!" he shouted into the chamber.

**** Spellfire and battle reverberated through the castle. The floor he stood on quaked as gaping holes were blasted into the walls. His steps almost lost hold as he scrambled from the distorted half life that was Voldemort.

His spare wand was in his trunk in the Ravenclaw Tower - hugely necessary in a fight with Voldemort. He could fend him off for a while, but Voldemort was gaining. In hindsight, he may have realised there was something suspicious about Voldemort having done something out of his rang of comprehension.

The boy was relieved to have reached the eagle doorknob. There was enough time to answer a riddle before Voldemort could catch up. His hands frantically banged the knocker three times, prompting the eagle to wake up.

"You shall now answer this riddle."

Instead of proceeding to recite a riddle for solving, the eagle's wrinkles stretched and swelled into a shape that vaguely resembled a head. As the facial features became more and more defined, his eyes widened. He turned around to see Voldemort nowhere. When he turned back, it was clear to him. The riddle he had to answer was Tom Riddle.

He racked his brains for any kind of answer, and then it struck him like lightning atop a lightning rod.

"Forty-Two." His lips curled into a satisfied smile.

(P.S. I don't know how the eagle doorknocker actually works, so I made the missing bits up)

*** I've never actually read The Count of Monte Cristo, but that sounds like an interesting premise. However, I would point out that the element of surprise can take many people off guard. In this example, Voldemort is expecting Harry to be terrified (normal reaction from most people) or to suddenly turn into a Gryffindor (which is a Potter trait). Perhaps the last thing on his mind is the possibility that the boy might be so thoroughly OBSESSED with him! As well as shocking, Harry's interest is fanning Tom's extremely overgrown ego. Canon Voldemort would practically be preening at the curiosity and interest shown in his history, his deeds, his magic.
