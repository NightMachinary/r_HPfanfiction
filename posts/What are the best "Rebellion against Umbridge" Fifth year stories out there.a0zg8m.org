I am looking for any stories where there is a big rebellion against Umbridge during Harry's fifth year.

Harry x Hermione romance would be a bonus!


** *The Meaning of Mistletoe*

It doesn't happen in the first book of this four part series but it's pretty wonderful when they rebel against Umbridge, it explores muggle political views and concepts etc. That fall into the hands of purebloods almost accidentally. If I remember correctly. The students start making their political parties/factions and everything.

Sadly not Harry x Hermione though

*** Draco Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherins becoming Marxist revolutionaries is an amazing idea that more fanfic authors should embrace. They rebel against their parents and Voldemort not "out of the goodness of their hearts", but because they realize the point system is designed to keep the students divided and controllable, and their ambitious little hearts are set on seizing the means of wizarding production. Having socialist, feminist, creatures rights and muggleborn rights committees learn to work together was excellent

Seamus showing people "why there's no snakes in Ireland" is another inspired touch!

*** I was going to suggest this fic. It has a lot of scenes that you can definitely see teenagers reacting that way, and also I love the characterizations in it, even if they're a bit sideways from canon they're still wholesome.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** I've always wanted to see a malicious compliance umbridge fic. Umbridge uses a hammer when a scalpel would be better, so it seems like it would be really easy to drive her nuts by following the decrees to the letter.

Like #68 banning the DA

#+begin_quote
  "All Student Organisations, Societies, Teams, Groups, and Clubs are henceforth disbanded. An Organisation, Society, Team, Group, or Club is hereby defined as a regular meeting of three or more students. Permission to re-form may be sought from the High Inquisitor (Professor Umbridge). No Student Organisation, Society, Team, Group, or Club may exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor. Any student found to have formed, or to belong to, an Organisation, Society, Team, Group, or Club that has not been approved by the High Inquisitor will be expelled."
#+end_quote

You know what also meets that definition of a student organization? Curfew. Meals. Classes. I bet she didn't explicitly authorize those.
