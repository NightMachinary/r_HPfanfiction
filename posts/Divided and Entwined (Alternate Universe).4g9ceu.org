With "Patron" finished after 61 chapters, I started a new weekly story. It's an Alternate Universe where Fudge is not ignoring Voldemort's return, but trying to appease him. Another divergence to canon is that a lot more people don't mind sacrificing mudbloods to avert a war.

** I do hope you don't allow some of the negativity that you receive to get to you. I am all for promoting your own work. Regardless of if I enjoy your work or not, I think it is important that we as a community, encourage more material. I just hope those lurkers who have considered writing do not also get discouraged. Everyone has a niche they enjoy, some may not like yours but clearly many people do.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

It always irked me that Muggleborns were just waiting to let themselves getting slaughtered in book 7.

*** I just don't understand why it matters to you. Hell, we are apart of a dying fandom. I'll happily support any writer who can piece together a coherent story with plot. There is nothing wrong with promotion of their fic and I believe comments such as yours can go a long way to dissuading writers that may just lurk around here. We should be encouraging new material, not bashing on the author. This is a fantastic community and I would like to keep it that way.

*** Is that not one of the purposes of this subreddit? To help everyone find new content? and the author isn't making any money of his stories so there's not really an issue there either.

**** He promotes his stories in just about every recommendation thread that's tangentially related to maybe a paragraph in one of his stories. Hardly fresh content. Yeah, one of the purposes of this subreddit is to promote, but this guy does it to the point where it's just annoying and spammy.

***** I actually like that, and people don't seem to care so much when I recommend one story in five different request threads because it's related or fits in them all. While I'm not the author, how do you guys /know/ that? There's really not much of a difference between me promoting the same story five times and someone else doing it with their own, except some strange idea that authors shouldn't rec their own things (which I do see elsewhere as well).

I had seen Patron recommended or posted a few times, and it finally made it onto my follow list when it was posted in a request thread that I was actually interested in.
