I read a lot of FF so I thought I had covered most of the good old stuff, but this subreddit has been a recent and pleasant surprise for me (very good recommendations!).

I love fics where Harry is morally ambiguous or conflicted, and I particularly like ones which overtly or implicitly explore the similarities between Tom and Harry. Preferably no slash in the main pairings. Slytherin!Harry, time travel and AU are all welcome. I also like the ones where Tom is a mentor or guiding influence on Harry.

Some that I've liked previously:

Any and all suggestions welcome, thanks.


** It's been a while since I read any of them but you might like these.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3646122/1/First-Impressions][First Impressions]] : A short one-shot about Dumbledore delivering the Hogwarts letter to Harry (who is eerily like Tom Riddle).

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2837735/1/Temptations-of-a-Dark-Soul][Temptations of a Dark Soul]] : The Horcrux in the scar causes Harry to get Tom Riddle's memories. The fic is mostly about Harry struggling with his morality while trying to survive.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning]] : Dark!Harry time traveling to his third year to try to save the world from the hellish future. Harry is pretty morally ambiguous and dark but in a different way than Tom Riddle.
