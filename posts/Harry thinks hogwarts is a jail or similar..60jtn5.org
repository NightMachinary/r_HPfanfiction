I'm looking for those stories where harry does everything in his power to leave hogwarts including, but not limited to

-Not participating in classes.

-Ignoring rules and detentions.

-Actively angering the proffesors.

-Ignoring how the student body sees him.

And anything else you can think of. I always found the 'harry doesn't care' stories interesting.

Edit: Basically i'm looking for a disrespectful harry who doesn't take crap from anyone. Whether the disrespect is deserved or not is not a problem for me.


** Certainly part of linkffn(handbook of elf psychology), sequel to Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them.

Though he comes and goes at will, so he can't consider it much of a jail.

  Sequel to Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them! Harry is captured by wizards and brought to a castle. The wizards are obnoxious, but there's a lovely wood nearby which is quaintly named the "Forbidden" Forest. Harry thinks that's adorable.

  It has always been said that magic and technology did not mix; too bad no one ever mentioned that little fact to young Harry Potter. Add in one mad genius bent on destroying the lives of ten thousand people by trapping them inside of his online virtual reality game and you have the makings of a very dangerous brew. HP/HG

** There's also linkffn(do not meddle in the affairs of wizards by corwalch), though I wouldn't say he didn't care in that one. Seething fury would be a little more accurate. But he's trapped at Hogwarts, refusing to attend class, being insolent and disrespectful of pretty much everyone...

  Harry was sent to Azkaban after being framed for murder in the beginning of his 6th year at Hogwarts. While there, he unlocks the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not". What will happen once his former friends know he's innocent? Watch the fun.

  This is a series of oneshots that involve Harry believing that everyone in the 'magical' world is insane. Starts with Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall getting Harry, instead of Hagrid, and goes in random order from there. Involves much sarcasm from Harry. Feel free to adopt.
