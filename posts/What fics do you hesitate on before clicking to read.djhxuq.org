I've read what you guys don't like in fics. (Personally, A/B/O, Harem)

I've seen what you guys like. ( Remus loving with a good bond with Harry.)

But what are those fics that you hesitate to start reading? Sometimes if a fic is too long I may avoid it. One that I hesitate strongly is MPreg, it has to be written just right and not be a big plot or happen to the MC for me to read it.

So what do you hesitate to read? What stipulation have to be in place for you to read it?


** - Misspelling in title or summary. I've seen fics that have bad punctuation in the summary, and lo and behold, the fic itself has no punctuation either. Example: the summary for Historical Importance of Runic War Warding.\\

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    "After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

The fic itself is an exhausting slog of run-on sentences caused by no punctuation, to no one's surprise.

- Alphabet soup in the summary. HP/GW/AD/NL/DM/RL/AM/DG.

- Tiny chapters. See a fic that's 300k words. I'm interested. Chapter total: "500". Nope. I am aware that some authors do writing challenges and push themselves to upload ~1k chapters every day, and this is normal in the Asian novel world, but I can't get into tiny chapters because their format creates pacing issues in the form of a cliffhanger -> resolution -> new cliffhanger cycle.

- On Ao3, "Author has chosen not to use archive warnings" instead of the regular G, T, M, or E rating system. I only see people do that when their fic goes full on explicit gore, underage, or non-con territory.

**** I'm not entirely sure. I just haven't liked Ron and Hermione very much for a while now. I partly blame fanfiction for this with the character bashings and why I find them to be annoying and unbearable.

Worse subconsciously I began to be slightly discriminatory against muggleborns (again blaming pureblood society fanfictions for this change in mindsets) so I just can't read anything that has Hermione paired with a Slytherin or someone who believes blood purity. (Draco,Theo Nott,Bellatrix,Tom Riddle/Voldemort etc)

Same goes for Ron and Neville just cant. They'd have to be very OOC before I think about continuing reading or the premise would have to be really good and I just skip all the parts I don't like.

As for Harry he's my baby I just can't now I've always wanted him in Slytherin or with a Slytherin and it was one of the first types of fanfictions I read and enjoyed esp with one's that are Blaise x Harry, Daphne x Harry and of course can't forget Draco x Harry. Maybe it's because I had already been introduced to these types of pairings early before my opinion and perceptions changed after years of fanfics so maybe that's why?

** Title: Generic words (Second Chance is an example of instant nope) or one that explicitly states the exact nature of the fic (ex. Dumbledore's Apprentice - I wonder what the fic is about?).

Summary: Got a lot of things here.

- If any sentence starts with a what if or has more than one what if in the whole text.
- The word "reimagined" or any variation of such.
- Any Dark!/Super!/Genius!/etc. tag added to the summary. The only possible exception to this is stating the pairing or lack thereof (and even then its not a good sign).
- Bashing mention is an instant no.
- Grammar or misspelling in the summary is a pretty good indicator this writer does not care at all.
- Something along the lines of "Discovers a new magic or book or secret that changes everything."
- If you're taking the time to complain about what was wrong with canon in a 100 character summary, that tells me pretty clearly how much you have thought about it.
- I could go on, but you get the idea.

Text:

- Chapter to word ratio has to be at least 1:3000, since shorter than that runs into serious other issues in my experience. Caveat for this is that humor/comedy does not require this.
- 1st person writing. If its really good I will make an exception, but otherwise its often more disconcerting than anything.

Don't get me started on that. I enjoyed one scene with him in the entirety of fanfics, and that was him getting Harry an RPG for the first TWT task because he made his money as a black-market arms dealer. I can get behind him if you go into crack territory, but not in a serious fic.

Hermione is often very ooc which bothers me much more than Harry being ooc. And other characters often get dumbed down to make the protag look good.

Same for Slytherin Harry stories even tho I do like the concept.

Good Tom Riddle or morally ambiguous Riddle type stories. I dont hate the concept but its often also Tom Riddle shipped with Hermione or Harry and honestly not a fan of either.

Any major character shipped with a relative minor character who was never expanded on too much if at all.

Harry/Daphne Greengrass or Harry/Hannah Abbott for example.

They can be good but they can also be self inserty more so than characters that are fleshed out more in canon.
