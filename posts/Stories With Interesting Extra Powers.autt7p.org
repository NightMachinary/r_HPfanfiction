We see in canon that some wizards possess special and even unique powers most others don't, whether because of heritage, chance, circumstance or all of the above (Seer sight, Parseltongue, part-Veela allure, etc.) What are some stories that explore this concept or have some cool extra powers (not God-mode) or even odd ones which can be used in unexpected ways?

(Most have probably already read the "Harry can see the history of any object he has touched" story though...)


** I have never heard of that story before, although, wouldn't it kinda give away pretty much everything? Like, as soon as he touched say... The sorting hat, or just the desks in the classrooms, even something as simple as a handshake. He would be able to know pretty much anything, instantly. That would make for a pretty low stakes story wouldn't it? And that's not even getting started on the cloak, that's a can of worms I ain't touching.

Also, here ya go. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3655940/1/Harry-Potter-Dark-Memories][Dark Memories by Blueowl]]

Also this one kinda applies, but it's questionable. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts][The Mind Arts by Wu Gang]]

*Edit:* I don't mean to hate on the memory fic, in fact I am very intrigued and would not be opposed to a link to it. I can just see a lot of way that would get out of control really quickly.

*** OP is probably talking about linkffn(Barefoot by Zaxaramus)

It's powerful but I don't think it's as much so as you seem to be imagining. He doesn't get every bit of information that happened in the presence of the thing he touches, just the things directly related to the object. So touching a desk might tell him how old it is, where it's from, how many times its been damaged and repaired, how many different students sat there, etc. But it won't give him an instant copy of every class that the desk was there for. It won't tell him the identity of everyone who sat there.

Also it doesn't work on people.

  Harry has the ability to learn the history of any object he touches, whether he wants to or not.

** There's linkffn(Breath of the Inferno by Primordial Vortex) - A couple of students have unique inherited abilities. Harry's is that he can turn into a massive fucking dragon. Like the size of Smaug from the movie.

Wizards are generally more powerful in that fic, from what I remember. So while his dragon form is an enormously powerful ability, it's not an auto-win in every situation.

  [RE-WRITE PENDING] Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly At Hogwarts]] - It's next gen, so not sure if you're interested... The OC (Dudley's daughter) is an empath and painfully (literally) over-powered. It's among my favorite series because the author does a very good job of recreating that feeling of learning magic with Harry.
