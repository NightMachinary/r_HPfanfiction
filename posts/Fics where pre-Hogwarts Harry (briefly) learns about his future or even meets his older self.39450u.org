** I like Harry Potter and Fate's Debt, but be warned, it hasn't been updated in 7 years. Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2479927/1/Harry-Potter-and-Fate-s-Debt]]

  Eleven year old Harry Potter is waiting to leave for Hogwarts. While he is waiting for the Dursleys to wake, he finds a letter addressed to him... from himself. It has a simple message: Get to know Ginny Weasley.
