Does any have some realistic fanfic? Where people act realistically and rationally, and the adults are not incompetent.


** In my experience, people being incompetent, stupid and irrational IS realistic. ;)

** TBH if the adults were competent, the entire plot wouldn't ever happen? I mean gee whiz we got a room o death better tell literally everyone in this school full of children about it!

Giant snake in the corridors? What snake? Obviously it was a spider, duh! Let's arrest the nearest non-full-human!

And of course Sirius doesn't need a trial, he's obviously so guilty that lets throw him into literal hell prison. What? He broke out? Better send LITERALLY SOUL-EATING DEMONS to hang out around the ONE SCHOOL THAT HOLDS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CHILDREN IN THE COUNTRY!

Hey, an ancient tournament for STUDENTS that was discontinued because of THEM DYING? Let's rev that right back up!

Oooh, somebody saying that the terrorist that ALMOST KILLED LITERALLY EVERYONE ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO is back? Let's totally ignore these allegations and instead start a smear campaign on a fifteen year old boy! That'll make my government look SO GOOD.

So you know how Voldemort was Tom Riddle and basically collected cool stuff and jammed bits of his soul into them? Let's spend a WHOLE YEAR explaining this to the ONE PERSON WHO AS FAR AS I KNOW IS OBLIGATED BY THE LAWS OF MAGIC ITSELF TO KILL THE WANKER in really abstract terms. And only after I KNOW I AM ABOUT TO DIE.

Yeah lets skip school and run around the country for the next year, trying to stab Voldemort in the soul. It's not like, you know, other countries with militaries that might even be remotely interested in stopping the psychotic dark lord exist.

  Sequel to The Chessmaster: Black Pawn. AU. Tensions continue to rise both inside and outside Hogwarts with the announcement of the International Scholastic Quidditch Tournament.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  The war didn't end when Harry and Voldemort fell. Hermione refuses to feel helpless any longer, and goes back in time to remove the scar that an unloved Tom Riddle left on the wizarding world. Tangled in the pureblood sphere, will Hermione just become another cog in Tom Riddle's plans? Final pairing is a secret! But not a Tomione. Lestrange OC. Parent!Hermione Child!Tom. COMPLETE!

  You came, you saw, you survived. But at the end of the day, you're still children. It doesn't matter how many battles you've won, how many Dark Lords have been triumphed, or how many personal travesties become medals of honor. You deserve better; the Sun is out now.

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

*** HELLSTRIKE I will read your story because it sounds so interesting and yes refreshing! :) I love realistic and reasonable characters!!! Also yes it's something I've never seen before with Andromeda and also Lisa Turpin's name from the sorting! Also thank you for saying there will be no bashing because bashing is senseless.
