This is based off my head canon for how the stone works( pretty much makeing a philosopher's stone Is hard but useing it is easy)

If you use the stone on lead it turns to gold

If you use the stone on water it makes elixir of life

So what would the stone do if you were to use it on blood, a persons physical body or a persons spirit/soul?(which a what I assume Voldemort was going to do in first year)

Like what if Harry accidentally used the philosopher's stone on himself after getting it out of the mirror in first year ?


** In most legend, the Philosopher's Stone is either the actual elixir of life itself, or is in some way related to the method for making the elixir. I don't recall ever reading anything (canon, fanfiction, or actual alchemy papers) that mentions that it transmutes water into the elixir. From the various writings and legends about it, the stone has a wide variety of properties, including being used in the making of homunculi. If you've ever watched or read Full Metal Alchemist, this is where direct inspiration for how their Philosopher's Stones work. So perhaps using the Philosopher's Stone on a human (whether alive or perhaps even a corpse) would create a homunculus, though whether it would be in the original sense of the word, Latin for "little human", as in a small human kept in a flask to keep it alive and as special abilities (though traditionally made from sperm), or in the more modern sense, an artificial human, proper sized.

*** I am not a fan of full metal alchemist.

The reason I think that useing the philosopher's stone on water gives elixir of life has to do with water being seen as life giveing liquid and so the philosopher's stone Enhances these properties when used on water.

I forget we're I Read the idea first but it stuck with me but the threory has to do with the stone being said to fortify the spirt/soul. So if the stone were to fortify the spiritual concept of water which is a life giveing liquid it would become elixir of life. If you get what I mean?

**** I think your headcanon is a rather simplistic view of how the Philosopher's Stone works. If we're going for symbolic meaning in terms of connections to life, it would make more sense for it to transmute blood to the elixir, since blood is traditionally more connected to the idea of the essence of life. It also adds a human connection. More importantly though, the stone is thought as the pinnacle of an alchemist's quest for knowledge, hence the "Philosopher's". To just transmute water into the elixir seems so simplistic, so far from the mysteries and complex knowledge that is just doesn't make sense. Even more, alchemy uses the four classical elements, fire, water, earth, and air, so it is strange that only one of the elements is used.

***** True another thing the stone is said to help create is panacea(the cure all)

I was think that water creates elixir of life and blood creates panacea but the panacea only works for the persons blood that was used to make it.

Earth seems to be covers by the stones ability to transform metals into gold.( although I would hope it could do other things. Like would useing it on steel transform it into mithiril?)

I wonder what useing the stone of air and fire would do?

** Funny thing is in England it was published as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and in the US it was Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone

I've never seen a fanfic that features both of them as being different things.

Might be neat for Flamel to claim that he never successfully created a Philosopher's Stone but he believes the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the components needed.

That is, the Sorcerer's Stone can't actually turn metals into gold. It only has the elixir of life function.
