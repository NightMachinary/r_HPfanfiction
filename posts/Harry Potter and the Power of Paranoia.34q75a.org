** All the fun of of your standard Indy Harry, but with the added bonus that it's all in his head. See Harry Run. Run Harry Run. <Commence blind panic amongst genuinely concerned OotP>

... Dumbledore is now trying to circumvent Harry's Fidelius charm, and has concluded that since the other champion's hostages were their dates, /clearly/ Ron was the BWL's date to the yule ball... and is interrogating Ron about what he finds attractive in boys. Ron, needless to say, isn't taking this very well.

*** That last was the best part of the fic, really. Came out of nowhere and wasn't harped on. Smoothly done.

** It's a really nice premise, that runs out of narrative steam almost immediately. It gets a lot of goodwill back with the wonderful central pairing, but throws it right back in the reader's face by making one of fandoms most brainless ideas (I.e. wards, warding) central to the plot.

Here's my impressionistic review:

“THIS IS FUCKING STUPID... i can't wait to see what happens next ... FUCK YOU.... hey, great, there's another chapter.”

** Ignore the "characters are canon" and "no bashing" thing. That just means they aren't Martians wearing people's name tags on their skin suits, and no one shits themselves in the Great Hall. The thing is pretty Dumbledore bashy as well. The paranoid turn is very well done, though.

But there's a lot of bad or overused tropes. Modified magical vow schlock*, Fidelius conceptual abuse, the Maximum Fun USA where everything is better, and "silly Dumbledore, horcruxes are studied in first year magical medicine."

Still. Last month was slow for good new fics. This is very readable and well enough written not to offend even my rarefied tastes. Certainly isn't overly macho blah like a lot of Harry breaks away fics turn out. Well worth a read.

*** When the healer removed the horcrux, he did not think or know it was a horcrux, he thought it was a simple case of bad possesion by ghost. Which seems more common and mundane , and probably touched upon in medical training. It was just Harrys luck that it worked.

Yes the Dumbledore bashing is there, as is Britain is stupid, but I don't agree with the Maximum Fun USA. It's different, different practices, different modus operandi. I can see how it would be different and more modern then the European counterpart as it is a younger country.

Sadly the Fidelius is central part of the story so it seems clichéd(blame Harry Potter and the Power of Time) but without it the fic wouldn't work.

Many people say that the first half of the story where Harry runs away is riddled with the usual clichés, but it's not true. That is the point of the fic. Harry seas many things and in his heightened paranoid state thinks the worst possible things. So from his point of view, everything is out to get him and big conspiracy against him while from the other view a bunch of determined adults trying to protect a kids innocence.

The best part of the story is the H/L pairing , there are not enough of them and the ending. It was pretty unique ending for Dumbledore the only thing missing for me is an epilogue of what happened to Harry.

In conclusion I wouldn't call it a genius of a fic, but it's a nice read.

**** *Some spoilers here.*

--------------

In /Power of Paranoia/, Harry isn't a horcrux at all. That's just the trope, that his curse scar is easily medically treated and Dumbledore was too evil/stupid to get Harry a magical medical checkup to take care of it.

--------------

Magical Britain is Stupid is another dumb trope this story uses. It needs a lot of support to make any sense and we don't get it here. A reason is needed that other, better ways of doing things don't get adopted in Magical Britain. Especially when the fic shows intercontinental travel as being so trivial for rich and powerful people.

Non-magical Great Britain is a world power, top of the stack for hundreds of years, multicultural and internationally entwined. Why would their magical world be so backward and crapsack compared to everywhere else? It /could/ be explained why the magical US of A is so much better (along with Magical Australia, which is suggested as being still not quite as good as the US), maybe something involving WWII. But it isn't really explained in this fic, as it usually isn't.

Magical Britain is declared as worse and other places are declared as better. The only hint as to why is that Magical Britain's Hogwarts is a crappy school, which is solely because Dumbledore is evil/stupid, and that's destroyed their entire society. Which almost works, I guess. But I've made it sound more reasonable than it is usually presented simply because /Power of Paranoia/ tries at least a little to explain. The story never actually comes out and says that, and it isn't even directly implied. I'm reading into things a bit to explain possible author rationales*.
