** Do you think that's weird? There are 100k+ words fics based on Hedwig/Harry. I mean seriously what are you going to write about them for 100k words?

Harry: Hedwig my love you are looking radiant today.

** I'm of the opinion that it's because of their actors. Emma Watson is attractive, so was Alan Rickman. (RIP) Also Rickman's portrayal of Snape toned down a lot of the outright nasty aspects of his character.

(Edit to clarify: Yes, IRL teacher/student relationships are skeevy af but this is the internet where ABO fics are apparently popular enough to keep making, so...yeah. People will write what they want, and trying to make sense of why or how they justify it seems like wasted effort to me, honestly.)

** Because this is fanfiction, where writers can do whatever we want. If you don't like it, don't read it.

While I don't ship them particularly, I can see how it could work, once they're both adults, possibly involving time travel. They have things in common. They're both smart and cruel. Neither believes in wasting time on hair care.

** I'm not a big fan of this pairing, but I can understand some of the rationale, so I'll answer.

They are both smart and would each presumably find intelligence attractive. Snape does not suffer fools gladly and would not want an airhead by his side. Hermione would not want someone threatened by her intelligence or ambition.

Age is also less of an issue as time passes. The (former?) teacher/student angle can be icky, but that doesn't stop fanfic writers of other pairings.

It really depends on if the author can craft the story in a believable way with in-character portrayals.

** while I don't ship this, there are countless of worse ships out there.

how about Hermione/Voldemort. you know, Harry/Tom at least make some sense, but hermione, that's terrible.

I guess, if someone wants to ship one of the golden trio with Snape and doesn't want slash, or gender bending, then Hermione is the only option. and how is that even statutory rape when she is already of age, unless you read pedo fics. it's just age gap.

while the ship doesn't make sense in canon, people are allowed to ship whomever. otherwise we would only have canon ships.

**** You've clearly had some bad luck. I'm assuming you didn't seek out any more fics of the pair due to this incident. We all stumble upon wtf fics, but as someone who has read Snape/Hermione fics, I've never read any where Hermione was underaged. She's either in her 20's, a few I've read in her 30's, a few where she has turned 18.

****** Honestly, I don't know what's more worrying:

- the fact that some people are outing themselves as specifically looking for pedo fics (I've literally never seen one, with any character, so /only/ running into them has to be deliberate)

or

- the fact that some people are proving themselves incapable of thinking of the characters as adults, which means that when they're reading even basic, same-age ships like Romione, they're picturing kids/teens during the sex scenes...

or

- the fact that some people don't understand that the target demo of the series are children/teens, and some teens like fantasising about older partners; so do some adults - it's clear the author is almost always projecting on the younger partner (would be fine if they were projecting on the older one as well, it's fiction)

What's FlowerPot? Is it Fleur/Harry? Do people legit have a problem with a... 2-3 year difference???? I mean, I've seen people get ridiculous about Krumione, calling him a pedo for dating a girl who is 2 years younger, so ðŸ˜‚

***** If I were into that why would I make a post calling it out? I literally have nothing to gain from it. I've seen a couple dozen H/S fics while browsing my ships (Harry/Luna and Harry/Daphne) and most of them show Harry at around 3rd-5th year. So unless all of them aged Hermione up or de-aged Snape, that means Snape is dating a 16 year old

****** Why /did/ you make a post calling it out? And only Snamione, not Snarry?

Honestly, your question is very male - gee, /why/ would young girls (the ones who write young Hermione) use the only developed female character to project on and use as part of their fantasising about an older man who is a pretty stereotypical Byronic hero? Likewise for a young Harry - plenty of young gay boys would be interested in that.

And yes, again, the vast majority of those fics feature an adult Hermione, sometimes as old as 40 (or more), frequently involving her hooking up with Snape post-Epilogue, or even when her children are adults.

So, again, if you're only seeing pedophilic scenarios, with Hermione/Harry younger than 16, that's on you and whatever tags you're searching.

** I don't understand why we can't just let people enjoy things? It's fanfiction. It's supposed to be somewhat unbelievable. Both are written as particularly clever individuals and I can see how some people pair them together.

Personally I have never come across a fic where both parties weren't fully consenting adults. Most hgss is time travel anyways so the age gap isn't really a thing.

Just my opinion. You're entitled to your own.

  how would that work

The very point of fanfiction is that you can change ANYTHING YOU WANT. You're referring to canon, but while we're at this, how is Hermione/Snape less realistic than Hapne, Drarry, Harry/Tonks or even Dramione? Because in canon all of those don't make sense. In fanfiction they can, because you can change things to make them work. Simple
