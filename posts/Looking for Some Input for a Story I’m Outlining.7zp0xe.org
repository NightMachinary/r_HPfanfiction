So lately I've been brain storming ideas for new stories and I came up with, at least to me, an interesting line of thought.

I often enjoy stories that have many “slice of life” moments as I feel they flesh out a character's personality, especially if you're opting to create your own characters.

Furthermore, I've found that many stories featuring Harry or other characters playing quidditch professionally or focusing on some other repeatable task (career, hobby, etc) helps push a character's motivations, diverge from canon where needed, and provide opportunities for world building.

In this same vein, I've considered using American Baseball, as such a medium to push plot points as described above.

How would you feel if you read a story with this as a background element instead of something like quidditch? Would that be pushing too many “Americanisms” into a setting that's predominantly British in background?

Curious to hear your thoughts.


** Why would you use American baseball? It's not just Americanism, it's also very muggle, not to mention an incredibly boring sport (unsuprisingly a personal opinion).

Quite frankly, Baseball would irritate me so much, I'd just not read the fic at all. I'm following the HP fanfiction community for /Harry Potter/. Magic is kind of an internal part of it all.

I actually love baseball, but I have to agree with the fact that it would be /too/ muggle for the wizarding world. Why not create a new sport similar to baseball, but with magical elements in it?

But how important could this sport be, even in a slice-of-life fic? Quidditch is the most popular sport not just in Britain, but also in Europe and many other Asian countries, whereas Quodpot is the most popular one in North America. Having canon characters involved in a new and unfamiliar sport would be quite OOC.

** The only issue I foresee with that, is how would you show a sensible shift to baseball? As a British native, I can tell you for a fact that there is isn't much attention on baseball at all, our most popular sports are Football (soccer) and Rugby, with a bit of Tennis when Wimbledon rolls around.

It would be difficult to create a shift in Harry's or any other characters' interests, unless you were writing for a character that was from the USA or a country that has a bigger following for it.

I like the idea of pushing character development though, so many fics seem to skate over it and dive straight into the action or romance, few of them take proper care to make their characters complex and interesting.

Best of luck with your fic, I'll do my best to keep an eye out for it.

** Thanks for the input everyone! To answer a common question, I was considering something other than quidditch just because quidditch has been explored so extensively in this fandom. That being said, the canon rules of quidditch might have enough room for expansion that maybe I'd be better off putting my own twist on it, then starting from the ground up with a new sport entirely.

What about */Quodpot/*? It's canon, and I only remember one fic that gave some kind of game plan for this sport.

** Yeah I would find that super off putting to be honest. I have played baseball once - an American teacher was visiting our school. It's just not a thing here, the chances of a Muggle playing it are slim enough let alone a wizard.
