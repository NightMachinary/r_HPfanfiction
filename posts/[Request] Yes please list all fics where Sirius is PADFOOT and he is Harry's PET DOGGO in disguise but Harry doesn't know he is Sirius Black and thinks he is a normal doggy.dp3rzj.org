Yes please see the title! :) :) :) :) I want to read lots of PET DOGGY SIRIUS fics! But it is also okay I guess if some fics you recommend have Harry knowing his pet is Sirius too, if there are not that many where Harry does not know or at least does not find out until later in the story! :)


** So not Harry, but Katie Bell adopts a mangy dog she calls Princess on a Hogsmeade trip in 1993.

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

** While it doesn't last for that long, The Dogfather definitely has a chunk of this. It's also an excellent "Harry raised by another family", where the family are just pleasant mundane muggles.
