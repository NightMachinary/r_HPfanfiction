Help me. I'm tired of feeling sorry for his ass when he can be portrayed as a someone who isn't crying lamely over Lily's death but trying to make her death worth it.

I've read too many Snape/Lily fics. I need to get back to reading the cold, cynical, and badass stuff.

Help.

Me.

Please.

I beg of you.

üò≠

By the way, I request that your recommendations not have anything with romance, and if there IS romance, could it be limited to the canon ships? Thanks.


** I really liked Snape as the badass spy in The Secret Language of Plants. You need to wait awhile though as the first part focusses on Remus and Snape's adoption of Harry. Like every single paragraph of this fic though, it's really well done. linkao3(23548960)

******** If you start the next story (Dandelions) Remus is in Azkaban and Severus is a badass spy and there are no physical relationships. Although he becomes even more badass in book 3 ( Geraniums) and relationships become a feature again. I didn't recommend skipping the first book though, because all Harry's actions in book 2 are based on his upbringing by Remus and Severus in book one.

  An orphan, Harry Potter has done everything he can to avoid notice during his five years at Hogwarts so far. He's only got one friend, is purposefully in the middle of his class rankings, and his only ambition, wizarding-wise, is to graduate with enough N.E.W.T.s to get a loan and open up a bookstore.And then he somehow finds himself in the sights of Tom Riddle, resident golden boy of Slytherin and darling of Hogwarts...

  ‚ÄúJust... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.‚ÄùWhat was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

Particularly Snape/McGonagall (non-romantic, just friendly/professional camaraderie) & Percy/Audrey are really lovely substories, but Harry/Hermione are so incredibly perfect, and always perfect, and without any conflict, and did I mention how perfect they are?, that they drive me to sleep (that's problem for me in many Harmony stories).
