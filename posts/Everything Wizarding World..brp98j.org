** My ranking (and the great majority people here):

7 Books

Pottermore

JKR Tweets

FB Movies

the 8 Movies

Far more people here consider Pottermore canon than the 8 Movies. Remember, Harry fixed his Phoenix wand with the Elder Wand, Voldemort never disintegrated into Confettis, and Ginny would never tie shoes for Harry! Also please remember, Ron vigorously defended Hermione against Snape's insult, Ron stood up to Sirius Black on a broken leg, and it wasn't Ron who panicked in Devil Snare's pit.

Less than 5% people here consider CC canon. I was more lenient toward it until JKR emphasized it was all written by Jack Thorne in an interview.

*** This is no ranking or critique towards anything. I'm not particulary fond of the FB movies or Cursed Child but they are just as important to franchise as anything else.

**** I find it interesting that you list "My Immortal" as part of the franchise. Why?

Shouldn't the general category of fanfics be counted as well?

Shouldn't the many high traffic websites such [[http://www.mugglenet.com/][mugglenet]] and [[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/][leaky-cauldron]] be more respected than "My Immortal"?

--------------

There are also many great Fan Art sites:

[[https://twitter.com/artblvnk][Blvnk]]: Her art is truly outstanding

In fact, these Fan Art sites are doing a far better job in depicting Book characters than the 8 movies. For me, Daniel Radcliffe DOES NOT look like Harry Potter, as Dan does not have messy black hairs and his mother's eyes (plot critical!), and is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/9j2wmu/harry_with_his_girls/][too short]].

Of course, there are the amusement parks, the merchandises, and sites like [[http://www.sedbona.com/2017/03/london-platform-9-34/][Platform 9 3/4]].

***** I don't care if the movies does things differently from the books. It is the filmmakers interpetation of the source material, no one else. It's nothing worth getting upset over.

My Immortal is the only fanfic that will ever matter. It is a classic like no other. It is the Star Wars Christmas Special of HP. You wouldn't want it to be any different.

I personally don't like the first Fantastic Beasts movie but I wouldn't want it any different. It was to me what The Phantom Menace was to many Star Wars fans. You need weaker parts to appericate the better ones.

Although Crimes of Grindelwald maybe takes some things to far to be acceptable.

** I read a book called "Tales of Beedle the Bard" (or it's how I guess it's called in English).

Not the most important thing but add several interesting little "children" stories. Also one of them (the "hairy heart" I think?) could totally pass as a story about Horcruxe.

** Anthony Goldstein (aka Jew mcJewface), Asian snake mystic, and Jk's other bizarre stereotypes? Can't see how this can go wrong.

​

Make sure to include wizards crapping themselves before indoor plumbing (unless they lived in ancient Poland, Crete, or India).

​

Including all the many conflicting canons seems like a pretty humorous idea all around tbh. GL OP!
