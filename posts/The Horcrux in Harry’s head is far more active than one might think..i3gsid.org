Ok no one took me up on my last challenge so this ones a bit easier. Maybe someone else has even done it and I just haven't found it. Anyway the challenge is based around adding a single detail to horcruxes. That detail is that every piece of soul used for a horcrux contains a piece of the original persons personality and life experiences. The one in Harry's scar contains all of Voldemort's righteous fury and hatred for those that mistreated him as a child for being different. When it sees Harry being mistreated at a young age, it takes action. No other real rules for this, besides having the horcrux and Harry be friends/partners and not having Harry being afraid to get revenge (he's being influenced by a horcrux from a young age, logic states that he won't exactly be the forgiving type.) Also a manipulative Dumbledore is recommended but it's not completely necessary.
