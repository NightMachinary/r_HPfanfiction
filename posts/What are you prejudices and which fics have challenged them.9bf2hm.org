** I initially hated the idea of "wrong boy who lived" fics. I didn't understand the point of having Lilly and/or James still be alive if the author intended for Harry to still have the same emotional neglect trauma from living with the Dursleys. I thought, what's the point of changing that fundamental aspect of Harry's childhood to sideline him for an OC if it doesn't change Harry?

Then I read some fics where the trope is actually done well and realized that the emotional turmoil from family drama can be great. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] is the one that finally grabbed my imagination.

Now I just need to get over my aversion for fem!Harry fics somehow and I'll be completely free of restraint.

**** When I first started reading Harry Potter fanfiction I was leery of any fic that changed Harry's name, because I assumed the authors were doing it to make him a special snowflake. However, I eventually read some stories that were good regardless of the name change. These days I don't care what the main character's name is as long as the character motivations, interaction, and dialog are all well written.

The Arithmancer has done something more /meta/ for me, I'd say. It sold me to the idea of fanfiction as a whole. It was the second story I read, after HPMOR. I soon realised that Methods was almost like a hit-piece, even though cleverly cloaked under some fun first chapters. I was about to give up when I came across The Arithmancer. And there it was. The Arithmancer was what I hoped fanfiction would do: expand on the universe, remix it, rethink it. Thank you White Squirrel.

** I once thought that Ginny would be an interesting character in fanfics, hell, the first few I've read were all soulbond canon pairings (no idea how that happened). While never a fan of Ron and Hermione, I at least had the hope to find something better for Ginny because I really liked her growth in OotP. Fun, athletic girl with a mean streak who just fought magical Nazis at age 14. This has to go somewhere good, right?

By now, I have given up to canon pairings in general. While most background characters get interesting concepts with a certain variety, the canon pairings always feel bland and more often than not commit the same mistakes. The narrative doesn't match what is shown, the attraction comes out of nowhere, teenagers do not act like real teenagers, horribly named children, bogging down everything with irrelevant Weasley children like they are collectables and fanfics which stick way too close to canon.

Nowadays, I utterly despise Ron/Hermione because in 98/100 cases, they will not have a healthy relationship and yet the author depicts it as perfect romance, constant fights indicating love and passion after all. Canon already fucked up big time with that relationship, and all fanfiction written to support that pairing made me hate it with a passion. It wasn't as much a single fic as an accumulation of shit. And if you look for Harry/Ginny fics, you either get Hermione with Ron, Hermione bashing or a character assassination off her, sometimes all three. Is it too much to ask for a story where Harry and Ginny build a new life without the other Weasleys taking up half the word count and still have a Hermione characterisation which has her canon friendships with both Harry and Ginny? Or Hermione wingmaning for Harry at Hogwarts while he and Ginny get some quality time together. I don't want to choose between the best friendship in the series and Ginny as love interest.

Tl;dr: Canon pairing fics ruined Harry/Ginny for me due to a lack of creativity and depictions of Hermione which are nothing short of an character assassination.

Here's my biggest issue: Fics with canon pairings (almost) never bother to justify the relationship, the characters are just in love because they are supposed to be, even if there's no soul-bonds involved (characters just blindly following direction of the epilogue as if they've read it). Obviously that's a huge problem for people who don't find the canon romances very compelling. I'm not strongly against H/G as a pairing, but you need to sell me on the fact that they belong together, not just assume that - of course - Harry loves Ginny and Ginny loves Harry, why wouldn't they?!? (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

That's why rare pairings are cool: authors in those fics don't get to make assumptions that their readers are already on board and they can't rely on JKRs shitty romance writing, so they do all the leg work for their pairing on their own.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It makes me wonder why Harry never ends up as Harry Weasley in those fics, considering how Weasley-whipped he usually is. He'd be totally lost in that family and end up as another paper shuffler in his family because Arthur got him a job that's better for a family man than all that dangerous Auror work. At least Cursed Child got that right, Harry is completely dead inside and pathetic, exactly as I would have expected: no more spark.

As Stanrick wrote:

#+begin_quote
  "Hey, guys," said Luna. "How is my one big happy Weasley family?"

  While Harry seemed to sink into his hands again, Ron smiled at her und shook her hand, of which she wouldn't let go for a second too long.

  "We are..." began Ron, then stopped and thought for a moment. "Well, one big happy Weasley family, right?"

  "Yes you are!" confirmed Luna cheerfully. "And I would've loved so much to be a part of it."

  "You could still marry George or Percy, you know?"

  "That's actually a great idea. If we go on like that, we could have Hogwarts full of a single, one big happy Weasley family one day," said Luna full of excitement. "Or even the whole wizarding world. Wouldn't that be cool? There would only be muggles and Weasleys!"

​

I half-agree with you. I think that to most readers who support the canon ship, the relationship doesn't need to be justified because in their minds, canon already did that. It's kind of self-fulfilling. Having said that, a good writer will show the relationship in a way which does indicate why the pair makes sense together. So for H/G, a good writer will show Ginny understanding what Harry needs when he is upset about something (for example, maybe Ginny forces Harry to go for a fly with her when he's about to lose it, which calms him down). And Harry might push Ginny to go pro with Quidditch whereas others in her life are pushing in her in an opposite direction.
