So, I'm looking for fics that go beyond Hogwarts and Britain and explore what can be done with magic and whatnot.

For example:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magics-of-the-Arcane]] A Mentor!Dumbledore fic that is well written and interesting.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10226216/1/Unstable]] Has some interesting ideas and an intelligent Harry

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB]] Harry and the Sorting Hat survive in the wilds.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8551180/1/In-the-Mind-of-a-Scientist]] Hilarious and cool ideas.

Some other fics:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10834977/1/Equinox-Redux]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8253087/1/The-Power-of-the-Mind]]


** jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]] and sequel come to mind: runes and warding, an alternative take on the Animagus transformation, and adventures that range all over the world (/BitG/ is centered primarily in South America, e.g.).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity]]'s /Alexandra Quick/ novels also very nicely extend the Harry Potter magical world. The stories are set in the U.S.

** Miranda Flairgold's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]] trilogy is great for leaving Britain and exploring magic but the last book is sadly abandoned.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/883762/Taure][Taure]] knows more about the magic of Harry Potter than anyone has a right to, and his work [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]] stays amazingly close to the canonical magic system while also being fascinating. His story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I][Lords of Magic]] details a very different magic system that deviates from canon, but is well-described.

The recommendations for Inverarity's work is seconded. Jbern doesn't stick all that closely to the canon magic system but they are enjoyable reads nonetheless.
