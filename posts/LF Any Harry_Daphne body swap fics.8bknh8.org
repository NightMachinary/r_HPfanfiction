Just think it would be interesting to see how Harry handles being a slytherin girl.


** Yes.

*** It never ceases to amaze me how many oddly specific requests are easily met by the fandom. It's like crossover between "Simpsons did it" and Rule 34

** This is oddly specific. Why not look for fem!harry stories with her in Slytherin?

*** Because that involves her being a girl the entire time. In OP's request, he would have to deal with being a girl and a Slytherin. It's pretty different from someone who was always a girl going into Slytherin right away instead of getting comfortable in Gryffindor and then switching both houses and genders.

*** Not OP but for me a lot of my interest in this kind of fic would come from how sudden it would be and from the conflict between the two characters.
