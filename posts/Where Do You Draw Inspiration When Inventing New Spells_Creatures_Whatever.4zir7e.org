I'm curious as to where writers get their inspiration for non-canonical spells/potions/creatures/etc.

I know for me at least, spell/potion wise I usually just need something for a fic and go, "this exists now", but for creatures I try to spread out over mythology and even various weird natural areas. An example is the Tsingy Bibby, a dangerous spider like creature with razor sharp spines of stone jutting from its limbs. I got the idea from Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park in Madagascar, a death trap of stone pillars that can cut to bone if you stumble against one while walking.

My boyfriend on the other hand is some weird super genius when it comes to making rituals. He just shoves together things and goes, "yeah see cause this thing here you've never heard of interacts with this thing cause of fact you didn't know and that equals step one in this ritual."

What about you guys?


** I usually just take inspiration from more developed universes, such as D&D and MtG. Like, obviously using something like a Beholder would be a pretty big red flag (though I have seen people use them), something like a Cloaker is a bit more subtle, and obscure enough to mold to your own needs.

Same with spells. Magic Missiles are a very generic spell, in a bread and butter sort of way. It's not that hard to bring similar concepts over. In HP it's pretty easy, since a lot of things are just different versions of the same spell, just on a different scale. Like, you have more powerful versions of fire based spells, or cutting spells. MtG has this in a more obvious way, but it's a great place to grab names from, like Searing Spear, Lightning Axe or Winter's Grasp.

For ritually type stuff and potions, Dresden Files goes into more depth than HP, though I'm more of a fan of the scientific type approach, where certain ingredients will act in the same manner when used in a certain way, regardless of potion. Like, Hellebore does X, and Belladonna does Y. Coming up with names of ingredients is sort of fun.

Lastly, I'll take inspiration from music. Bands like Omnia and Blackmore's night have a lot of music touching on spiritual and magical topics. Examples would be "Wytches Brew" by Omnia and "Fires at Midnight" by Blackmore's Night, or even something like "Eight of Swords" by Huntress. Inspirational music could be a whole topic in of itself.

** I don't do much inventing of creatures. I did send poor Luna off in search of Brazilian Tree Sprockle venom once, but I have to confess I haven't a clue what a Tree Sprockle is.

When it comes to spells, the 1884 White's Latin-English/English-Latin dictionary I got from a car boot sale is abolutely priceless.

** For spells, I want to make sure it solves a problem without cheesing it too much, and I want it to make sense for the characters to use them. So I don't really need any inspiration, I just see it as a tool for the characters to overcome obstacles, and for me as a writer to shed some more light on them, show the dynamics between them.

I wrote one scene where Harry and Daphne need to go through a door together, but it's cold and snowy on the other side and they're not clothed for that (standard problem that needs solving). So I came up with a wind shield spell and made up a story about Hagrid teaching Harry this on a cold winter's day. And Daphne melted the snow, and in that way they worked together at solving the problem (= a peek into their dynamics).

Sorry for the rambling.

** Oh yeah, I remember hearing about that place...

I've gotten it into my head that some of the more advanced spells just don't work with only two words; They require 3-5. Sometimes they even require ritual setups, albeit small ones that don't require outside items, just a runic circle and a wand. Sometimes they require incantations of up to a sentence long. It really gives you a lot of variety when making spells, more room to specify and symbolize.

I haven't really focused on creatures or spells, though.

  Twenty-one years after the fall of Voldemort, he returns again and this time, he wins. With no hope and a dying world, they made a ritual that would either send the performer into the past or cause the earth to tear itself apart. Draco figured that either way, they could count it as a win.

** magic is, to me, a way a wizard imprints the world via their intent. So when inventing magic, I have to keep in mind the inventor. For example, my harry is.. colder than Canon. Yet he is extremely loyal, and cares more for those who matter to him, than actually surviving. So his spells that he would invent would be protective, powerful.. but may have a sacrificial level to them. For example, he invents a counter curse for Crucio, in a sense. If placed on a person, the caster takes all the pain from the curse... two fold. Every second is the same as two.

My James Potter is much the same. Except he is a prankster at heart. He creates a spell that opens a pocket dimension that absorbs spells. There are limits however... his intent must be to annoy, to protect, and to NOT KILL.

"Magic is about intent. And the Potters, have the strongest will to shape their world that has ever been seen." The Potter Grimoire.

Rituals however are different. For me, rituals are scientific acts that are applied to magic. Something that is repeatable by multiple people. There is a ritual in my story that is done by a character to up their chances of survival during a trying time. Yet, they screw it up. They get the result, but they get a side effect as well... Rituals are banned in my headcanon because there is always the risk of side effects, that are dangerous to others.

When inventing effects of both spells and rituals, I look at other mediums like Naruto, Bleach, other books, ect. Most stories where everyone has the ability to battle on a level that is beyond standard humanity, such as Eragon, Naruto, Bleach, DC, Marvel, and especially the Author Brandon Sanderson, have built in limits, or drawbacks to every ability. For example, the concept of Eragon's magic is that you must have a clear mental image of the intent. Naruto, you must be able to control the level of chakra into a technique. Bleach, power is always tempered by skill, and more examples exist. When creating a spell you must look at it the same way. A spell must have limits. A spell must only do one thing. It is how the spell is used that sheds light on the character.

My favorite use of magic in the fandom is actually from A Cadmean Victory. Harry creates a spell that is seemingly useless, but its perfect for what he uses it for.

This is a vary interesting case. Magic in Rowlings world is static. By that I mean, each spell is used for ONLY ONE THING. Avada Kedavra is used to kill, Expelliarmus to disarm, Stupify to stun, and episkey to heal small wounds. Magic (or similar energies such as chakra, Soul Pressure, Inheritance Magic ect) is elastic, in that it does multiple things with a single incantation, historically. Alohamora in any other form of magic, could do more than unlock doors. For example, a wizard could point his magic wand at a bitter man, state Alohamora, and the bitter man would be less bitter because in that medium the wizard connected the magic of unlocking, to the bitterness of the human.

So, when creating magic for HP, I think of one effect, and how my character would use it.
