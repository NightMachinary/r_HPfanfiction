*** Trying to think of more detail. It was a very long fic, I think I recall Snape attempting to do some magic on Harry to attempt to extract something from him? Sorry my clues aren't very helpful lol

** Well, you said to extract something from him. That makes me think of linkffn(Crime and Punishment by mlocatis) It's on ff.net though, so it might not be what you're looking for.

  Harry is accused of burglary. The Dursleys leave him to rot. Dumbledore sends Snape to remedy the situation. Harry finds himself in the care of an irate Snape. Not slash, gen-fic w/ focus on Sevitus relationship. Angst galore. Warnings: language, mentions of abuse/neglect. Un-betaed, un-Britpicked, unapologetic.

** It's not A New Place To Stay, is it? Even if it's not, the author of that has done a decent number of works and quite a few of them are Severitus/mentor!Snape, so she may have what you're after

  Harry Potter is called up to Dumbledore's office and told he was being moved elsewhere to keep him safe. He no longer has to stay at the Dursley's, but Dumbledore tells him he has to stay with Severus Snape. For a few days it seemed like a bad idea. Until Severus Snape uncovers the truth of who Harry Potter really is and what he's been through. Watch as Severus does as nobody else has done before him. He takes care of Harry. Watch him flourish into who he was meant to be, a boy with the heart of a Gryffindor and smarts of a Slytherin. The Dursley's, Umbridge and Dumbledore had better watch out Severus is out for revenge. Spy or no spy, Severus is not allowing anyone away with hurting Harry.
