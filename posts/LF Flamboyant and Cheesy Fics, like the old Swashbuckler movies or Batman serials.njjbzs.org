Basically, I'm looking for fics with the cheesiest plots and dialogues you can imagine, like the Princess Bride or Zorro or basically anything with Errol Flynn in it.

The kind of fic where Harry would stride into a battlefield and proclaim "En Garde!" and battle Voldemort across collapsing Hogwarts' towers, bantering and one-liner dropping the entire time, only for Voldemort to escape due to some convoluted and implausible thing happening.

Anything that plays into the old Swashbuckler-type movie tropes would be fun as well. :)

O-oÂ¬O-o_O-o-O

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410#workskin]]) this is the only one I can think of off the top of my head. It's not overly flamboyant but has a tone and feeling a bit like Stardust to me. Not quite princes bride levels of comedy but I laughed quite a bit and the feeling is definitely that of adventure

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.
