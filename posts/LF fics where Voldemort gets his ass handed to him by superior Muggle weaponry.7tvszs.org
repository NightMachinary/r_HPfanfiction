**** So, the answer to this depends on how you think about magic. I personally see Harry Potter magic to be conceptual, not actual, at least within the limits of the spell cast.

What do I mean? There's no physics involved. Magic does something, because magic says it does. Here's an example. A broom dooesn't fky because it has enough thrust to counter the acceleration due to gravity. It flies, simply because magic declares that is the broom's purpose.

Like that, the shield spell /protego/ works as a concept. It's not a physical bubble. It just protects. Therefore, with the spell cast with sufficient strength and knowledge, nothing, not even bullets can pass through.

***** That's plausible, but it does still assume that the victim knows they are being targeted and are able to react in time to put up a spell.

I think guns just aren't easily compatible with the HP world without twisting a bunch of rules around to make it work, which is why most serious fics just ignore them completely. Nobody wants to (seriously) read a fic where the DA storm the ministry with guns and just mow down all the death eaters or Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort wearing a suicide belt

Honestly conventional weapons could be really abused in HP,

****** I think these discussions really miss the point of magic in Harry Potter. There's no system behind it, plot and theme trumps all in this world. JKR uses magic as a way to create plot (like with the Time Turner), as a humorous mirror for Britain and the normal world (Mrs Weasley in CoS, with her "car gone! No note!" and the howlers of course. Who hasn't had a tongue lashing from their parents? Imagine if the whole school heard it instead of just you?). The rules of magic are shaped to make sure the plot fits as well as it can (like the restrictions on Time Turners, preventing any plot holes due to the possibility of time travel. Also the restrictions on transfiguring and creating food, making sure that the happy camping in DH isn't a walk in the park). Sure, you can grasp at straws and create a system out of all the hints, tidbits and other things JKR left us in the books, but why? It isn't meant to be logical, so interpret it as it's supposed to be interpreted: as a mirror for our society.

******* It seems JKR did think a great deal [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-3.htm][about the rules]] of her world before she started writing the series:

#+begin_quote
  JKR: "To invent this wizard world, I've learned a ridiculous amount about alchemy. Perhaps much of it I'll never use in the books, but I have to know in detail what magic can and cannot do in order to set the parameters and establish the stories' internal logic."

  "The five years I spent on HP and the Philosopher's Stone were spent constructing The Rules. I had to lay down all my parameters. The most important thing to decide when you're creating a fantasy world is what the characters CAN'T do."
#+end_quote

I agree that the time turner seems a bit iffy... but the rest of the rules, like the inability to create food by magic - how's that different from other books where authors impose limits on magic?

***** You still have to hit your target with any spell. There is no auto-aim in Harry Potter.

(And how fast spells are is a matter of debate - I generally assume they are very fast - too fast to be dodged "in flight". But I also assume that hitting stuff with a wand is not easy - as seen when Voldemort misses Harry at close distance - so effective range is very limited. If transfiguration were working as you describe, duels would happen very, very differently than in canon.)

Movie canon has changed several things. In the movie, Bellatrix uses the killing curse to kill Sirius, while in the books, it was a non-fatal spell, as Sirius was still alive when falling through the veil.

Transfiguration uses intense concentration and precision. It's McGonagall, Snape, Voldemort, and Dumbledore who are able throw around Transfiguration and concentration willy nilly

************* Again, that's your view. I don't share the idea that a Shield Charm "just protects" - in canon, it is described as "This was supposed to create a temporary invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx." And later, as "a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that they rebounded upon the attacker."

In the battle in the DoM, a Shield Charm "stopped the worst of the spell" when Dolohov tried to curse Harry.

In the forest of Dean, it was described as an "invisible shield" that forced Ron and Harry/Hermione apart - and impeded Hermione, who had to remove it to go after Ron. Later, Harry used it in the same manner to protect Ron from Hermione.

It also broke the flow of enchanted water in Gringotts.

I think it's rather clear that it's not a "conceptual protection", but a physical if invisible object.
