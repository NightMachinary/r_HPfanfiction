Looking for a fic that I found quite some time ago and wanted to read once more.

I don't remember much of the fic other than Harry and Hermione were in Transfiguration (?) and were required to make something and the pair made a model of Hogwarts. Then Harry (?) cast the homunculus charm on it and they could see some of the people within Hogwarts.

The scene has been stuck in my head for a while and wanted to find the fic it was in. Please help.


** I think the magic you're thinking of is [[https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/homenum-revelio][Homenum Revelio]] which is a canon spell.

*** Could be the spell I'm thinking of but I know they cast it on a model of the school.

There were other things in the fic I wanted to see but I can't remember them.

**** No. It's not that. Though I am enjoying the fic. Loving the way he pushes the limits of metamorphs and just makes magic, so to speak.
