To even witches and wizards, there is a second world, a veiled reality, underneath what muggles and they can perceive.

Whispers of this "Veiled World" found their way into legends as being full of fae and other whimsical realms, but they're merely corruptions of passed down rumours and glints of truth weaved into fables and cautionary tales.

Death and the afterlife, however, is a plane of existence beyond both worlds, which both lie on the same plain.

The Veiled World has creatures like the Blair Witch skimming the surface of perceived reality, and abominations straight out of the Todash, Lovecraft's imagination, and other such horrors like some of the more nightmarish and abstract stuff from Doctor Who and internet creepypastas. Heck, even the Gods and Goddesses of old are beings that still put about, having either lost interest in or lost access to the "first world".

Hidden mountains in plain sight, such as in the middle of muggle neighborhoods, a second moon, a temple that regularly emerges and submerges in the Thames that muggle ships pass through as though made of thin air...

Some artifacts bleed through, but they're seen a natural, muggle, or magical constructions, such as Stonehenge, the Giant's Causeway, the Veil in the Department of Mysteries, et cetera.

Thing is? Like the creatures and eco-systems in our world, they have their own natural and unnatural orders; they interact, they perceive each other... basically it's like an alien world interwoven with ours.

Where does Harry come into this? Because of what happened to him as a child, he was altered and is a technicality. He can walk freely between or interact/perceive it all as they naturally would... and the kicker is that because he's seen as "one of them", they /perceive/ him as one of them, as though he's always been there like them. He's not viewed some human that (impossibly) somehow accesses or interacts with the Veiled World.

He is, however, viewed as one of them that can access the First World/reality, which comes with its own advantages and disadvantages, naturally.

When he starts Hogwarts, people view him as being a bit spacey and quiet, and some of the more derogatory remarks are that he's a "half-wit". However, there always seems to be something /off/ with him, like tasting a briefness of sweetness in something savory or seeing hypoerbolic orange and stygian blue in blacks.

When he's seen idily jump/skipping across certain corridors, he just remarks: "It's to not get my feet wet." He's crossing a stream that runs through those corridors and into the walls. Disturbingly, when he slips, his feet are sometimes actually wet... which his teachers and classmates beg off as simply someone or himself spilling a drink or using a charm.

When he occasionally makes idle mention of hints of certain things, like how to solve a personal dilemma people are having, attention is paid more closely to him... much to his annoyance.

That's not to say he's immune to stuff in the First World, though: If he walked into the Forbidden Forest and came across an acromantula, he'd get eaten, naturally. However, his sitting in the middle of a clearing in the Forest and just relaxing, creeping out the centaurs as he fondly enjoys impossible sights like an unendingly tall, black tower piercing the heavens? Floating mountains like on Pandora? Or a stream that flows through the air and around trees instead of on the ground in channels?

Unfortunately for Voldemort, when he made his horcruxes, he unknowingly shunted the soul fragments, anchored by the objects he used, into the Second World. It's been sheer luck that some entity hasn't come around to finding them already and either eating them, torturing them, or using them for their own purposes.

Uh, I tried to articulate my abstract idea. Not sure I did it well enough. :S


** It's really a nice idea. I would have given you my free award if it hadn't expired yesterday, oh well, I will just way few days to give it to you then.

And I think these two fics have few similar things in them so you might like them if you haven't read them yet :)

Both are equally weird and unsettling but great.

*** The latter is one I read last night in the bath (the age of smartphones is a wondrous thing, haha). I love plots with unique shit like that. :D

**** I read the latter yesterday as well xD I saw it here just too often to be able to resist anymore.

And after that I started reading Dreams and Darkness Collide (it's similar to Hannibal serial in some way) which is also nice - and yes, I was also in a bath when I started reading that :D those two hours baths will be the end of me someday, I'm sure of that.

** So this is where Nargles come from. Does that make Luna sort of a Muggleborn for this second level of Magical World?

*** Luna's just a lonely, slightly traumatized girl who believes in slightly strange things as an escape for her problems, such as believing "nargles" took her possessions instead of her classmates.

However, I could see her becoming fascinated and borderline obsessed by understanding there's something /odd/ about Harry, especially if he ends up in Ravenclaw, and she tries to understand him/what he sees.

She may try to reconcile her beliefs with his: She may abandon them entirely in favour of something more "real", consciously or not.

He may find it annoying: He may be happy to share what he knows. Either way, I can see canon Luna latching onto him to try to understand.

And, as a ripple effect, I could see some of his year mates also being interested in eavesdropping -- especially if coincidences stack up around him to the point where it's something they can't ignore.

Either way, it'd be greatly interesting. :D
