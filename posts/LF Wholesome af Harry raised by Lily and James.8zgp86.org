Need wholesome shit, preferably complete,


** linkao3(1746629) is part of a series that is a very wholesome canon-retelling with an alive James and Lily. The series isn't complete, but it has several finished fics that are really satisfying. It's the closest I've ever come to feeling like "Yes, this is what James, Lily, Harry + Marauder friends would have been like had they lived."

**** Canon rehash has been done a thousand times. If you are going to change something in the world then canon will not play itself out. It's boring and its lazy. I want to read something unique and creative.

  Mr. and Mrs. Potter were not perfectly ordinary people. They did not live on an ordinary street like you or I. They did not have a small house with a number to differentiate it from the identical houses on either side of it. They had, in fact, quite the opposite of it all.----How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived? Ships not listed because I'm unsure if there will be deviations from canon in that respect. Characters will be added as they appear.

** A different Halloween by robst

It is one of his best works that I recommend people reading. I would really like to read others fanfics that start with the same concept.

** linkffn(4736622) is the first thing I thought of when I saw 'wholesome'. I haven't read this in quite a few years, but I remember enjoying it a lot! It's definitely sad and angsty, but also super super wholesome in the end.

  AU Harry Potter's Holidays: Little Harry wants his Christmas wish to come true this year. Maybe if he makes his own lucky angel it will. But can his luck hold out for the rest of the holidays? Maybe if he wishes very hard...
