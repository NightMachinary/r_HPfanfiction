Am I imagining this, or are the reviews on FF just.... ick.

After I read a story, I go to the comments to leave a review and typically scan a page or two afterwards. And it seems like the comments on FFnet are always a mix of toxic and positive, whereas AO3 comments are almost always positive or constructive. And some of those FFnet reviews are downright disgusting.

Is this just a coincidence or actually a thing?

*** Also worth noting that AO3 specifically prohibits harassment in their ToS, unlike FFN, and has an Abuse team that follows up on complaints. Obviously, negative reviews don't necessarily count as harassment, but I think that, plus various options for authors (you pointed out writers being able to delete comments, but they're also able to moderate comments and lock fics to AO3 members-only) encourages a stronger norm of being polite to writers than exists on FFN.

*** Not only, but AO3 allows EDIT of comments, which makes me reluctant to write on FFnet. And of course, because of public replies (and replies to replies), AO3 is more inducive to reasonable discussion with author. With FFnet you can just one bark (and one per chapter!) and nothing else.

** I'm exploring FFnet these days, and, yeah, the comments are something else.

I also remarked that a lot of them make demands out of the writer. It's rare on AO3 for a commenter to say « ok, after this scene, writes this, make this couple happen bla-bla-bla ».

Or, worse, something happened that goes against their demands and suddenly it's ok to violently insult the writer. It's really wild.

**** FFN users certainly criticise harder, but it's rarely constructive from what I've seen.

With the tagging system on AO3, readers can see if the fic has tropes/pairings they dislike before clicking, and if they still do, that's on them. So those really bad fics have their target audience that would praise them, and other people are able to avoid them in the first place.

But, yes, they're harsher but without any real feedback, I feel. It's more criticism but without the constructive part of it. Whereas, as someone still learning English AND learning to write fiction, I can get really good criticism on AO3. (And, tbh, with the quality of the fic on AO3, I feel like they're more justified in their criticism/advice).

** AO3 apparently occasionally gets really nasty, but authors can clean up comments and a lot of drama appears to occur off-site. I think the fact that the site is more welcoming of certain content helps, along with the overall higher age among users. I don't remember if you can even comment as a guest on AO3, but if you can't, I assume the barrier to entry (the need for either invites or a waiting list) weeds out trolls, especially those who would otherwise flame a bunch, get banned, then make a new account immediately.

** I much prefer FF.Net reviews.

For a start, there are a lot more of them. I crosspost Victoria Potter on both FF.Net and AO3, always updating at the same time so it's not like one has an advantage over the other.

Reviews on FF.Net: 448

Comments on AO3: 30

FF.Net wins on quality of review as well. In terms of length, of my 30 AO3 comments, only 11 are longer than a single line. In terms of content, I would identify 10 out of 30 as genuine reviews, by which I mean they engage with the fic on some specific level, either by asking questions, making predictions, or commenting on the quality of specific story elements. The rest are all fairly generic. If you combine these two metrics (length and content), the number of substantial reviews I've received on AO3 is... 5. For the whole fic. So let's say 15% of AO3 reviews are actually substantial.

Meanwhile, on FF.Net, the number of substantial reviews (length and content) I've received on chapter 18 alone is 6 out of 13. So FF.Net reviews are around 50% substantial.

So yeah, I definitely prefer FF.Net when it comes to reviews.

It's true that on FF.net you get more critical reviews from people who just don't like your fic and want you to know it. That's fine. I've posted my story publicly, people are entitled to shit on it if they dislike it. But then, I'm the kind of person who rolls their eyes when an environment is described as "toxic" just because someone's feelings might get hurt.

You also get more trolls on FF.net, but I just ignore them. Jokes on them in the end; they're just increasing my review count.

When reviews boil down to "I don't like you and I don't like your face, so fuck you, cocksucker.", I would consider that toxic, without the quotation marks. Not liking a story and shitting on it is one thing. Attacking the author because you didn't like a story or because they ignored your demands about what to write? Yeah, that's a little much.

I'm not an author, I'm not one to get offended easily and I can swear with the best of them. But damn, some of the comments I've seen make me want to take a bar of soap and stuff it down somebody's throat.

** Probably due to better tag system in ao3, readers know pretty much exactly what they're getting into so no one is left feeling like theyve been ripped off or lied too. Granted this doesnt excuse some of the comments on ffn but that's what I feel causes some of them.

PS: plus ao3 cultivates an environment of like minded degenerates that I freaking love while ffn seems to reward staying in your lane and not stretching outside of the norms as much.

** No, you're not imagining it.

I pretty much hate ff.net; the only reason to look at ff.net there is that the site is vastly more popular and thus gets more traffic and more stories published. ao3 is far better designed, far easier to search (the search features alone are worth using it for), has far nicer and (dare I say) better users. ff.net also uses dirty tricks to try to prevent anyone from every finding out that ao3 even exists (they block most non-shorthand ways of referring to ao3), and the only site that blocks ao3's story import feature is... ff.net.

Plus, ff.net will do stuff like nuking stories without so much as a minor warning; look at what happened to Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past recently. ao3, by contrast, has very little to no censorship. You don't have to worry that they'll remove your work and account without warning or the ability to appeal. ao3 is run by a tax deductible non-profit whose whole mission is to make sure fanworks are protected and cares a lot about making things better for writers and readers, and ff.net seems to exist mostly to juice out as much advertising profit as possible from a site whose technology is ancient and never seems to improve.

And yah, I post anything I write to both places. And certainly I get more hits on ff.net --- but my heart's with ao3.

** I think you're on to something. I like reading reviews and comments, and... It's generalized, of course, and there are plenty of nice and thoughtful reviewers on FFN... but in my experience the numbers of trolls, intolerant douchebags and people who get butthurt because a fic doesn't cater to them personally is notably smaller on AO3... also the reviews on FFN can sometimes get a little, ummm, bizarre.

I've been pretty lucky with my one fic, Holly Potter and the Witching World, which is a Fem!Harry story where most of the magical population is female... mostly the reception's been positive on both AO3 and FFN.

But, well, it wasn't on AO3 I got anymous reviews saying "female garbAge shitfic"... and yes, it did have that random capital A... and it wasn't on AO3 that I got reviews accusing me of plagiarizing myself.

I mean, seriously, when a fic is posted on AO3 under the handle "D_M_Nealey" and then the same fic is posted on FFN under the handle "D. M. Nealey," you'd THINK that people would get that it was the same person posting the fic to both sites, right? But I had like three separate people on FFN accusing me on plagiarization. Two of them took it to PM, the third posted reviews saying "good job stealing D_M_Nealey's work from archive of our own."

I have to say that overall I like AO3 better. :)

** I'm posting my current story on both, and the AO3 comments are far and away just plain better.

On AO3 a comment requesting an update would be 'cant wait to read more!'. On FFN it's 'update now'

Criticism is worded better as well. I had a person on AO3 dislike my characterization of Harry at times, and they said so, but then followed up with positives the liked about the story as well.

Had a criticism on FFN that tore me apart in a flame, but the roots of it were good points on problematic areas of a recent chapter that I ended up fixing.

On AO3 I haven't gotten a single comment about boring, bad characters, or crappy story, like I have on FFN. I don't expect everyone on AO3 loves my story, but I dont think they feel compelled to say something if they dont, like FFN readers do.

***** It's unclear what "favorites" is meant to convey. Does it mean it's actually a favorite story of yours, or are you trying to convey a complement to the author? AO3 separates the functions; there are bookmarks (which you can put reviews into as well so people know why you're recommending things) and kudos as distinct features.

I've only had positive reviews on FFN (and my longer story has 397 by now) and some of them were very insightful. My Thor fanfiction has more reviews on AO3, though.

** Oh I don't know. My reviews on FF haven't been toxic and while I'm not reading a crazy amount of HP these days, the few I have don't seem to get too much unfair flak. I've had some harsher ones over the years, yet never anything I'd call really mean. Mostly, I've had positive responses. Typically, they're all pretty short and simple (lots of "Thanks for the update!", "Nicely written", "Good chapter").

What difference I have noticed between the two is while I get less comments on AO3 as whole, what I do get is typically more thoughtful. Even if they're still not saying a lot, they remark on something from the actual chapter they liked instead of just giving generic praise like my average FF.net reviews.

** What we've found with AO3 is the responses lend themselves to discussion. Comments, questions, quotes. On FFnet, it's usually a sentence or even just 'pretty good'. There's not a strong interactive element because there's no public discussion. Tbh, I rarely remember to post on ffnet these days because it's just this one (albeit lovely) person who tends to read and comment so it feels more like writing in a vacuum.

I get people are posting for fun and what not, but you can't expect to totally through out the English language in your English language story and not expect to be buried for it. Then the authors complain, and reviewers are validated by the fact the author is trying to justify their terrible attempts at spelling, or not using commas, or switching tenses back and forth mid sentence(I've seen this in multiple top rated stories), so they continue on in their attacks.
