E.g. Harry is split in to four Harrys: Gryffindor!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, Ravenclaw!Harry, and Hufflepuff!Harry.

Voldemort's personality is (forcefully) merged with that of Colin Creevey.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood, starting his transformation into something else. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process (and Harry's soul) in the nads. Now what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?

  Hogwarts is home to any number of strange occurances. This one, however, is stranger than usual. Can the school survive Luna Lovegood getting together with Harry Potter and Harry Potter and Harry Potter and Harry Potter? Rated mostly for innuendo.

** I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but there's "The Many Faces of Harry Potter," where Harry has multiple personalities from the start, and eventually when another personality "takes over" Harry's body changes to look like that person.

Sticks a little too close to canon for my tastes, but it's interesting to read just for the in-depth look at life with multiple personalities.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.

Note: Feature's some of the most descriptive dueling and combat I've ever read in HPfanfics. To the point where there is an established meta. Also a Fleur pairing, whats not to love.
