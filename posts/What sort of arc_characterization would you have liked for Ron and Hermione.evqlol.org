What sort of direction would you have liked to see the character go in canon that you didn't get to see. Bonus points is if you also do the same for Harry.

I personally would have liked to see Ron become more of a chessmaster archetype. Have him show off the strategy skills you only see occasionally. And use the fact hes the only one of the trio who grew up in the wizarding world more.

Hermione on the other hand who is more direct in her approach and not the best at noticing the surroundings, ( accidentally insensitive, gets frazzled more easily, direct approach take down the troll doesnt immediately realize oh the structure will also come down) becomes more person who solves puzzles is more the detective. While putting more emphasis on her social awkwardness and struggles she encounters because of it.

What about you guys?


** I like Ron being depicted as having ADHD/ADD, instead of the somewhat common interpretation of his character as an idiot.

I like Hermione when she's written as an independent character with her own goals and endgame, and not just a prop for Harry to further his story.

** I think the chessmaster stuff is very overdone. I like Ron as the best friend. At times he's the only sane one. Harry is heroic to the point of suicidal and Hermione was whatever JKR needed at the time. Ron was the best mate and the one who kept them together. I will always look at the time Ron removed the rubbish from Hermione's house elf hats as peak Ron. He accepts he might be wrong but just wants everyone to have a fair choice. What we need more of is Ron down the pub after work for a quick pint with Harry.

Hermione should have been wrong more or rather, Hermione should have faced the consequences of her actions. JKR bailed her out a bunch of times. Stuff like Crookshanks not eating Scabbers or Sirius and the broom. All things that all the evidence suggests it wasn't the case, but she somehow ends up being right anyway. She also gets away with hexing McLaggen so Ron can get on the quidditch team, brewing polyjuice and several other examples. For someone so righteous she's awful willing to bend the rules when it's her doing it. Hermione could have grown so much more as a character if she'd failed and had to recover. There are so many times she could have stumbled and we get to watch her develop but when she stumbles JKR says 'she meant to do that all along' and we all have to nod and accept it.

*** I agree with the facing consequences. I think its a missed oppurtunity for character growth. Hermione was socially awkward and struggled to make friends. Even after making them shes the odd one out. Harry and Ron are closer to each other than her for bout half the series. And her flaws lead to issues regarding relationships.

She thinks she knows best and often she does but because she acts like it, it would strain relationships and often has. But they were solved because she was right. And honestly relationships arent usually about whose right. Her growth should have been in struggling to learn better collaborstion skills and trying to be understood better so she'd feel more included and less lonely. It would be a struggle for her but I think it would be compelling and satisfying seeing it play out. But as you say JKR bails her out and therefore she gets more limited character growth which is unfortunate.

** Ron improving himself after Arthur got attacked. Really pouring himself into Quidditch and schoolwork. Maybe he drops his Prefectcy, maybe not.

Hermione facing consequences for her actions.

** Hermione as someone you call for the dirty jobs. In canon, she's ruthless and vindictive, yet those character traits are completely absent from the last two books. HBP would have been a lot better if she came up with another type of "polyjuice" type of plot to get behind whatever Malfoy was up and then take care of the matter like she did with Umbridge.
