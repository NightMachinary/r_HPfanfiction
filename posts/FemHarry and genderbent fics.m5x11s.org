I think I'm mostly looking for Fem!Harry right now. I've read: Harry Potter and the Wait, Scratch that by jobob, Victoria Potter by Taure, and Girl in the War by astridfire. I'd love anything along those lines, but I'm not totally set on it. Anything genderbent for now is totally fine and I can figure out what I like and don't like based on your recommendations.


** I'd recommend trying Certain Dark Things by eirajenson. If you like characters that act their age, sisterhood, magical world building, and plots that are shaped by but distinct from canon, it should be your cup of tea.

The endgame primary pairing may not be to everyone's taste, but it will not happen until Harriet is in her 20s. Right now, the fic is completely gen and the author has said that it will not be romance centric.

It's probably my favourite currently updating fic and updates are super regular too.

  Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with snakes in the garden, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing that's happened to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. [Fem!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, AU Retelling]

  Rose Potter spent twenty-one years as the Chosen One. Reborn as Harry Potter's twin, he alone has the scar after that Samhain night. Harry knows there's something odd about his sister - she's too old, too mature, and knows far too many things she shouldn't - but he loves her anyway. He's been there for her ever since they were born, so Rose'll be damned if she lets history repeat itself.(In her past life, Hogwarts didn't unite until the very end and everyone suffered for it) (Lily Potter was willing to do anything and sacrifice everything for the safety of her family. Rose intended to do nothing less)In which not all Slytherins are evil, not all Gryffindors are good, and the Wizarding World is more than just an extension of the Muggle one.Years 1, 2 complete

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** I've been really into Tom/Harry fics recently here are some of my faves:

linkao3(15676317) - amazing, funny, well done and a little more light hearted then most tom riddle fics, highly recommend! some of the best characters i've ever read

linkao3(24970723) - just finidhed this, i really liked it! lots going on plot wise, well thought out and planned and harry's character is very interesting. the dark arts call to her but she resists until she gives in a bit and then tries to find a balance. pretty big age gap in this one because it's present day harry and voldemort.

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership.

  Appetence--- defined as an attraction, a natural affinity, or an instinctive desire. A cosmic sort of bond that clouds the mind until all thought is consumed by that singular point of infatuation. When Voldemort divines what Harri Potter truly means to him all those years ago in the graveyard, a festering sort of obsession begins. His horcrux. A part of his split soul, crafted from his marrow, magic, and might--- his very own damning appetence. He knows what has been kept from him, what rightfully belongs at his side, and he wants her back.
