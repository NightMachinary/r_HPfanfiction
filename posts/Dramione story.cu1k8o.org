There was a story I read a while ago. I think the war was still going on and some way Hermione and Malfoy were bonded or something. I think they defeated Voldy and were on the outs with both sides. It was completed and at the end I think they left Britain.

** Do you remember anything else? Was it a soul bond or another magical bond? Which site did you read on?

**** Hmm, there are a lot of stories that could fit that, but I can ask around and see. The subscribers on this subreddit don't like Dramione so this will probably be downvoted into oblivion before you get any answers. Are you a member of Dramione FanFiction Forum on Facebook? They have stories categorized by tropes and such that may make searching easier.

***** I think the reason they were bonded was to save the others life.
