Been a long time since I've looked I really don't care how he's ancient could be master of death or a vampire/magic species!

Looking forward to recommendations. Thanks!

Edit: ancient 300+ but i don't mind 150+

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

** Another I think you might enjoy is Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The Carnivorous Muffin.

This is one of my favourites and it features a fem!Harry who learns she is death and has Tom riddle horcrux talking to her inside her head and meets canon!Harry who is death of the original universe and traveled to her reality out of boredom. There is alot of humour and multiple fics with lily being in different fandoms and causing chaos.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** What do you consider ancient?

- Browncoat, Green Eyes is a *fantastic* read if 150ish is good enough. There's a not-quite time travel element that puts the action in the 26th century, and you don't really need any knowledge of Firefly to read it (though it's recommended because it's a great show). This is a novel quality fic with excellent characterizations and a sensible, well thought out plot that fits into Firefly's existing world very well plus moments that will leave you in tears laughing. Superb.

- On A Pale Horse is a creepy/crack fic featuring a certifiably ancient master of death Harry. It's entertaining, and a much quicker read than the other two I'm listing.

- Illusions of Grandeur is another certifiably ancient MoD!Harry, this time in the world of Supernatural. Unlike Browncoat, it /does/ require a bit of knowledge of the original Supernatural story arc (seasons 1-5). It's a good story, but not up to Browncoat's absurdly high standard.

If you want a TL;DR about Firefly: The population of Earth left for a solar system with a fuckload of planets and moons ages ago because Earth was toast. They then terraformed the planets/moons and settled there. The was a war for independence against the Alliance (only government) 15ish years before the fic (and 6? years before the tv show), and some of Serenity's crew fought on the loosing side - the people who lost wore brown coats as a uniform. Honestly, you can figure out the rest by just reading the story.

  COMPLETE. Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar.

  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.

**** I read it and I thought it was pretty good actually. It was well written but I know what you mean. I wasn't too fond of how the MC developed in the later chapters after his "face reveal" I don't want to spoiler but I don't know how to black out stuff so I won't say anything further. But yeah. It was a little clichée but an enjoyable read as well.

  He's been stuck like this for a couple of beginnings, and so many ends. Millennium have passed by and his age never changes, his skin cannot stay pierced, his body cannot die; thus locking his soul, binding him forever to this existence. This stranger comes into their lives, and they're unprepared for the events that follow after him. Viper is an interesting enigma. Immortal!Harry
