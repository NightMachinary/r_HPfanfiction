I really liked The Sum of Their parts, with Harry doing everything he can to better the world post-Hogwarts. Can anybody help me find some others gems like it please?

*** This one sucks and couldn't possibly compare to “The Sum of Their Parts”. The ending is a piece of fucking crap, and the author bashed Ginny into oblivion for some weird reasons.

**** It's certainly not the best, but it's amusing to view it as a somewhat less than serious take on the typical lordship tropes and as a bit of a guilty pleasure for more or less tearing down the wizarding world

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth. COMPLETE.

**** It's written in present tense (Harry says vs Harry said) so make of that as you will.
