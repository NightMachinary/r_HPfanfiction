I'm looking for something like Harry Potter and the Spellbook of Desires. It's basically a retelling of Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire.

At the start if the story however Harry obtains a Spellbook of Desires, which causes everyone to act more lustfully.

I really enjoyed seeing Harry Potter retold in this way. I'm looking for something thats grounded in the source matieral, without straying away to far. Preferably something that spans the timeframe of one of the books. Of someone could help me out, it'd be greatly appreciated.


** I hadn't read or even heard of the Spellbook of Desires before- thanks for that.

As for your request; are you saying that you're looking for plot-driven erotica with more than Harry getting lucky?

*** I'm looking for erotica that takes place during an entire book. All the major plot points are present but there's an erotic spin on the storytelling.

**** @ RoseBadwolf11 - [[http://stories.xnxx.com/profile300289/Avatrek][here's]] a (NSFW) link to the author's profile where that story, its sequel and other similarly-toned postings are listed.

For other stories of a naughty nature that still visit the 'stations of canon', there may be a few.

[[http://www.reddit.com/user/JustRuss79][GinnyMyLove]] wrote [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=349][Searching for the Power]] with that in mind. It covers sixth year, more or less.

I recently started reading a Fleur/Hermione romance that covers 4th year, with sequels for the following years sticking pretty close to canon, but it doesn't quite qualify for the level of bed hijinks compared to your reference.

Y'know, strictly speaking, if it's erotica /and/ follows canon, it isn't going to try hard to be a story as well. There's plenty of that sort of writing on ficwad.com, hpfanficarchive.com, restrictedsection.org, and other adult-friendly fanfiction sites.

If you're looking for stories that feature a good plot and also include sex scenes, that's a different request (and one I'd have more interest in aiding).

***** I'd just assumed that a good plot and erotica were mutually exclusive. If it does exist, then I'd love to see whatever you can provide.

Thanks!

** Mad Snorkacks and Englishmen (I'm at work and am not willing to link that on this computer). H/L focuses on book 7. I got linked to it by a friend of mine just because of the site it came from... joke's on him!

Warning though: lots of sex, but it's very very kinky. You've been warned. That being said, I'm like 13 chapters into it, but it seems like it follows the story fairly well; there weren't any massive plot changes.
