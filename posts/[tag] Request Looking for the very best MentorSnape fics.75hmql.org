I'd like to read some fics where Snape and Harry have a good relationship. I don't care if Harry is sorted into Slytherin or if Snape rescues him from the Dursleys - just rec me the very very best mentor!Snape fics you've got. He can be Harry's dad too, I've never read one of those but I know they exist.

I feel I should note that I am a die-hard Snape/Hermione shipper, so I'd prefer it if Snape wasn't shipped with anyone in the fic, but it's not exactly a dealbreaker (well no it may be but I'd try /really super hard/ not to let it be).

I don't mind if Harry ends up with Draco at all, but I'd prefer it if Hermione and Ron didn't end up together. Mild to serious Ron-bashing is okay and I don't mind Dumbledore-bashing at all.

And if, by some chance, there's a mentor Snape fic where Snape and Hermione end up together that's /not/ creepy (because look, I'm aware that my chosen ship has untold potential for creepitude, and Snape being a mentor to Harry while ending up with Hermione later on is sort of...ehhh, well I mean in the right hands it could work, it's just that I can't imagine a way it would without being creepy, is all) I'd be delighted.

I feel like this rec request may be too specific? It's probably too specific. If you think I might like it, please give me a rec and I swear on my grandmother's grave that I'll give it a fair go.


** The best mentor Snape fic I've read is (I view the two as one really, since the first is more a prologue): [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4307359/1/Harry-s-First-Detention][Harry's First Detention]] by kbinnz is the short story prequel.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4437151/1/Harry-s-New-Home][Harry's New Home]] is the long sequel.

**** I've known enough people to know that some abused children do act this way. It all depends on their personality and circumstances. The author never makes the claim that all abused children act this way. Perhaps in your experience you haven't met people who do. But in mine, and I'm guessing the author's, some do.

Best Revenge is great too, although it was sadly the fic that made me realise that I'm uncomfortable with Snape being shipped. I'm so disappointed in myself with that -_-

The first chapter of Blood Magic looks great - I think that will be my next read :D

** I agree with fics mentioned by adreamersmusing and I would also add these-

AYLNO - this was quite a popular Snape/Harry fic at time. Published before HBP. I liked especially the beginning. If I remember correctly, Snape was not shipped there.. [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=5036]]

Always in Your Shadow - linkffn(4294544). This doesn't really fits the request as it is Dad!Snape with OC. But Calista (Snape's daughter) is really likable character. I'm suggesting this fic because there is a lot of mentoring and Snape is very well written. Again, Snape is not shipped.

O Mine Enemy - linkffn(3514260). This is unfinished story. It is one of 'rescues from Dursleys' fics I like. It doesn't follow 'Snape founds out Dursleys abused Harry' -> 'he admits he was wrong about the boy' -> 'Snape and Harry have perfect relationship'. Story is only from Harry's POV which helps a lot I think. Snape can keep his 'mystery' here :)

Yet Another Snape meets the Dursleys story - linkffn(601118). Not really mentoring in sense of Occlumency etc., but both Harry and Snape are written well.

I will add that I don't really like fast change in Snape from evil to nice. It doesn't happen in fics above.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** One of my favorites is linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe deBlassenville). It's a Snape-mentors-Harry fic, and although Snape is shipped with someone, it's pretty cute so it shouldn't detract from your reading experience (I also ship SSHG, so I know where you're coming from! :) )

*** The Best Revenge is actually the fic that led me to discover that I'm really uncomfortable with Snape being shipped with someone else. I was enjoying it tremendously up to that point and I was so disappointed with myself when I realised why I'd suddenly gone off it.

Thanks for the rec though!

** I'm sorry if this is too far outside your request, but Snape is not shipped with anyone, and it's a dad!Snape fic. Red Sorrow by lupinlaughed: linkffn(Red Sorrow by lupinlaughed). A story about Snape being the real father of an OC Potter sister, she's raised by Snape while Harry is raised by the Dursley's. Filled with a whole lot of angst and hand-wringing and secrets and all the messy stuff, but Snape develops into a good mentor for Harry. Looooong fic follows Harry's first three years at Hogwarts, and there is a sequel which is a WIP (got "abandoned" for a month or two but recently is back to weekly updates and seems like author is back on that type of schedule).

** I should keep up with Reddit more.... I'm a sucker for 'canon' Snape and Harry/Snape mentoring. Don't know if a new post is going to be noticed at this point, but anyway, here are my favourites:

linkffn(4040612) Snape is mentor-ish and it's all very frustrating for Harry. Seems abandoned, unfortunately.

linkffn(3766574) It's a long story but if you're interested in a somewhat believable Harry/Voldemort friendship AU (about the only one I know of), you will find a very nice Mentor Snape plot along the way.

Also love this bit of mentoring, one-shot: linkffn(5564272)
