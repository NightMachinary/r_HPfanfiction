** Look to the sixth book. Dumbledore in the cave. How does he work out there is a door, how does he work out what is needed to pass the door?

  The science behind it
#+end_quote

I'd say that's the wrong approach, bits of magic aren't logical, you might be better sticking with a hodgepodge mix of symbalism, mythology, feel and whatever else strikes your fancy.

Magic isn't a series of logic gates, you take the magic out of it if you do that.

** Wards is a fanon term. More appropriate words are enchantments and curses. Examples, the Fidelius Charm, the cursed necklace, all the magic that was in the cave, the hand of glory...

In other words, enchanted objects or buildings. Curse breakers are pretty much archaeologists who remove the curses and enchantments from buildings and such in search of treasure. How they break those curses, idk. That's where your creativity comes in.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

** Alright, the single best cursebreaking scene in the fandom is in the second chapter of The One He Feared by Taure. I'd take a look at it. Go back and look at HBP, specifically the caves where the (fake)locket was kept. That is a canon example of cursebreaking.

For me, the big thing about cursebreaking is that it should be a puzzle. A very, very, very dangerous puzzle. The curses and spells should be tricky, malicious, clever and subtle. It should be creative. Not just a magical wall that needs to be taken apart or whatever.

Good luck with your story!

** let's list what you need for Curse-Breaking to work.

First, you need a way to spot curses - preferably without having to use a "walking trap detector". So, unless you have purely physical hints to curses - like the stones they were cast on being resistant to erosion and such or some residue of curse victims around - that means a way to sense magic curses. If you can detect magic easily and at range, though, it renders the disillusion charm and invisibility cloaks and the Human-Presence-Revealing Charm useless. So, presumably, something hard/slow to cast, with very limited range, and something that affects your normal senses, so not something you'll have cast in a battle.

Then you need a way to identify curses. Again, you could do this with physical means - "this tone of discolouring (on the stone or the victim) indicates it's a bile-poisoning curse" - or you use the detect magic mentioned earlier to analyse the magic you see.

And then you need a way to break curses. That can be a counter-curse - canon - or some some generic "dispel curse" means - also canon with the Finite Incantatem. However, if breaking curses is too easy, it makes msot curses cast in canon pointless, so it has to be difficult. That can be achieved by making curses require complex counter-measures after a thorough analysis of their "pattern". Like "Ah, a detection charm tied to a skinning charm, and there's a vile venom trap charm cast and tied to both, so if one spell fails, the trap goes off, so I have to deal with that first - provided that's not trapped either..."

You can pick and choose your favourite method - I did for my Curse-Breaking series "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider" and "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis" - but you need to keep the consequences of whatever methods you pick for the rest of the setting in mind.

*** I agree on this and further comment: ask yourself this, will this magic invalidate canon? /would it have changed the plot in canon if it was used? Its like veritaserum and pensives in canon, as it was introduced late, every time it could have been used in the past and wasnt, just makes everyone look incompetent.

** Wards can be whatever the story requires, from "Enchantments on buildings that offer protection and information to the owner" or "Nasty magic traps on old places" to whatever you want.

Is cursebreaker!Harry going to be hunting death eaters? Have him learn how old ass buildings and homes are protected. Want him to travel the world? Think of traps in pyramids or something, and how he might bypass them.

** I remember reading a story called 'Magics of the arcane' where Harry and Dumbledore go on these fantastic adventures where Dumbledore teaches Harry curse breaking.

Also, in 'I'm still here' by Kathryn 519 we see Harry use --> runes <-- for making incredibly complicated protectice enchantmens on the slytherin dorms but in canon and most other ffn we see that runes are just a course that teaches the translation and meaning behind all types of runes. Like a language basically.

Then again, here's an idea: what if you take some rune from some language which means 'protection' or something similar, does that have any effect? I might just make a thread asking about the role of runes in warding.

P.S. sorry for not including links, I've no idea how to do that.
