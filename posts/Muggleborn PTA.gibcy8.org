I looking for any stories that have muggle-born parents forming a PTA to help muggle-borns and muggle raise children to adapt and advance in the magical world. I found one similar to the one in squib by nanchih. Or maybe like a muggle-born handbook. I know that there a fic already with the book but I don't remember it. Does anyone have recommendations?


** I've read a number of stories that had Harry find out about a "muggleborn information packet." I've also read two, I think, that had muggle parent associations. However, they were more-or-less mutual commiseration societies, because the wizards didn't care what muggles had to say about things, and there were no teachers participating. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to come up with any titles for them.

  When Harry offered himself up to Voldemort, he discovered the people in the Ministry of Death are not happy with him at all. To make up for his years of blunders, Harry is sent back in time to correct everything that went wrong and to get some revenge. Harry/6 girls, Bashing of Dumbledore, Snape, and certain Weasleys. Written for humor only. Lots of cliches. Reviews welcome.

** There is an clandestine conspiracy among Muggleborn parents (led by Grangers) in linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel), which helps during CoS.

And, of course, one has to mention linkffn(There Will Be No Foolish Wand Waving by kgfinkel), where Petunia Evans (it is in the Marauders time) destroys the Lord Voldemort by the introduction of the Wizarding Customs class and remodelling of the Muggle Studies one.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?
