It seems like in every fic they are either destined friends or Hermione is bashed to oblivion. Are there any where they become worthy rivals or enemies for well-developed reasons (not romance)?

** Hogwarts Battle School fits the bill, although it was originally posted on portkey; this combined with recent developments in the story probably mean a Harry/Hermione endgame but it is still incredible
