Stories like “magicks of the arcane” is what i'm looking for basically. Instead of Dumbledore kind of backing away from Harry in his fifth year, he starts to be a mentor to Harry sort of.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12792189/1/A-Beautiful-Lie]] fits this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light]] fits this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13116300/1/The-Mysteries-of-Magic]] fits this to a lesser extent.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6359413/15/The-Warlock-s-Apprentice][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6359413/1/The-Warlock-s-Apprentice]] fits this, though the story is of dubious quality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/52/Hogwarts-Battle-School][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]] - very loosely fits prompt.

#+begin_quote
  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
