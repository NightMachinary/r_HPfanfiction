Absolutely cannot recommend this story enough.

** Are we allowed to discuss it here? Because I was blown by this chapter. My only problem was with Jocasta Flint- if she'd traveled back in time and been betrayed again, and the Unspeakables had come unknowingly offering her a third chance, wouldn't she have taken it and kept Grindlewald alive?

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** There is no pairing so far and it's pretty much impossible to say who will end with Harry at this point in time. The only thing we know for sure is that he isn't gay
