** Linkao3(never grow a wishbone) by ShanaStoryteller keeps skirting around this issue.

It hasn't happened yet, they only just reopened the Potter manor. Draco-pov, he's brought on as a new potions teacher at Hogwarts. There's also references to family magic and some really cool lore stuff added in, in my opinion.

  She almost smiles, and true alarm starts to build in his chest. “I'm afraid I'm not here for something so small. Professor Roberts has resigned.”“Good,” Draco says honestly, “Would you like a list of suitable alternatives? I know a number of competent potions masters abroad, but then of course you'd have to hire another teacher to act as the Slytherin head. I'm afraid you've dried up all the half decent Slytherin Potions masters.”“Not all of them,” she says quietly.He blinks. She can't be serious. “You can't be serious.”“Gravely,” she says, “Mr. Malfoy, I am not above begging.”What the bloody fuck. “I don't even like potions!”~Draco returns to Hogwarts. He has a duty to his blood and his name and his house, and he will fulfill it.
