Characters disliking each other is fine, a author purposely bashing ANY characters is a huge no no.

Edit: Also am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be on any site, not just fanfiction.net


** I'm not a huge fan of that and this is not exactly what you are looking for, but Obscura Nox Animae has Lily survive and it's really well written. No one gets bashed. But if you dislike Snape, the story is probably not for you. If you don't have a problem with him, the story is really awesome.

** And the Wolves All Cry is a long oneshot, and really worth the read. linkffn(8809533)

Sarcasm and Slytherin starts with this one: linkao3(12608820) - there are bashing warnings in the tags, but I don't remember any beyond sullen-pre-teen-dislike. WBWL.

linkffn(3503388) - Birth of a Phoenix. No bashing, but you might want to beat Dumbledore over the head with a baseball bat anyway. Sorta WBWL, but not really.

I'm not a big fan of WBWL, so I haven't read many stories with his parents alive. Wolves is fantastic tho and doesn't have that trope. It's especially great if you're into dystopian stories.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** This story is absolutely amazing so far! Very funny, no bashing so far. Just this character dislikes those characters and it's told from their POV. Just got updated today :) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21911965]]
