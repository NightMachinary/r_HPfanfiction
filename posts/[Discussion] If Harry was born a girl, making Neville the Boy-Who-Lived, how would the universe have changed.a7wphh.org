The prophecy states the Chosen One is a boy, so if Harry was a girl, Neville would have been the only choice for Voldemort.

What else would have changed?

I think Peter would never have been revealed as a traitor and would reintegrate with his old friends when his master is defeated. Snape would likely remain a loyal Death Eater without the loss of Lily to change his views. Lily would become the Potions Professor in Snape's place.

What else can you all think of?


** ...Welp, that gives me yet another silly idea.\\
When Harry and Neville are born to the Potters and Longbottoms, knowing the prophecy, and the 'Dark Lord will mark /him/' bit, conspire to conceal the newborn childrens' genders. Hence, Harriet & Nevina.

And because this is diving into crack fic territory, Voldemort can't fall for it yet since he doesn't know the relevant line of the prophecy, so everyone has to figure out how to leak it to the Dark Lord without him getting suspicious.\\
Alternatively, he did learn of the whole prophecy, courtesy of a sneakier Severus Snape, and when the two likeliest candidates 'produce' girls instead of boys, he gets paranoid and goes on a world trip to find the suspect baby.

*** In the end he comes to the conclusion that "when the seventh month dies" is somehow December because of some convoluted logic, and figures out it's his past self that will be his downfall, and travels back in time to kill himself.

The end.

** Why would Neville ever become "The Boy Who Lived?" Harry only lived because Lily was given the chance to live by Lord Voldemort, in good faith, and denied it, creating the sacrificial protection. And that chance to live was only created by Snape begging Voldemort spare her. Which follower of Voldemort would beg for Alice or Frank Longbottom's life? Why would Lord Voldemort offer to spare him/her?

Basically, if LV chose to assault the Longbottoms as canon stands, everyone in that house dies that night. Prophecy, no prophecy, female Harry, transgendered Neville, Turian Harry, ... dead.

This is my problem with every Neville!BWL fic.

*** Very true, things would probably have been different if Voldemort had begun targetting the Longbottoms personally. For one thing, they too could have chosen the Fidelius. Which would lead to a whole different situation, as I doubt they would have also chosen a death eater as the secret keeper, which would likely lead to a prolonged first war.

This would make a good story now that I think about it, a whole balance of terror where V dedicates all of his focus in discovering the Longbottoms' location while the order scrambles to figure out wtf to do.

*** I've always thought it was kinda funny how Voldemort agreed not to kill Lily for Snape.

Cons: is muggleborn, likes Dumbledore, "thrice defied him", mother of his potential nemesis, he was already at their house.

Pros: Snape wants her to live.

Voldemort: ok, she lives.

** There's one issue with the question asked OP. While the prophecy does state the gender of the Chosen One quite explicitly, none of the lines which Voldemort knows state the gender of the child. Since Voldemort picked Harry over Neville due to him subconsciously picking the half blood like himself, it is quite likely that none of the aforementioned events would change. The only person aware of this would be Dumbledore and since, according to canon, he only believes in the effect of Voldemort believing in the prophecy, it is unlikely to change much of his plans either.

*** Actually "he" and "him" being exclusively male terms is rather recent. The use of "he" and "him" for a someone of unknown gender would be normal in the 80's and that's before we get into how far behind the Wizards would be.

** There was a fun request I recall which was for Lily to take a gender-forcing potion (on the theory she heard the prophecy early enough to do so), thus getting out of the prophecy. I thought it was a fascinating idea, as you can play around with concepts puke 'fate doesn't like to be avoided' and 'is prophecy about specific language or intent'.

I am not sure what the value of simply making a duck by fem-harry is. Seems like it would be virtually identical to the standard WBWL formula (variant where Nevill gets attacked).

*** Lily is a muggleborn, and thus armed with the very rare trait in the Wizarding World called "common sense". There is a trivial solution to take the target off your back -- just force an early birth. I wouldn't put it past her to convince (Confoundus, perhaps) a Muggle hospital to do a C-section a week early or so.

But I guess that doesn't make for nearly as interesting a story!

** u/Deathcrow:

#+end_quote

Sure, because Harry was a boy. If he had been a girl it would have been "she" and "her" instead.

A prophecy makes predictions about real life, it doesn't shape real life after its predictions.

*** Neville or Harry could have been the chosen one. Voldemort basically chose his own opponent by marking one of them.

If Harry was born as a girl and the prophecy did not change then the prophecy now states a gender and thus one 1 child now meets the requirements. However Voldemort wouldn't have heard the part that says it's a boy so would have still killed the Potters but girl-harry wouldn't have the benefit of prophecy backing her up. It might just end with all the potters dead.

** No matter what else happens, such a plot is likely to give very different outcomes for Peter and Severus -- to the Order's disadvantage.

Let's say that Voldemort is afraid of Neville. He targets the Longbottoms. There isn't a Severus "equivalent" to beg for Alice (or Frank, I guess) to be saved. So Voldemort hunts down the Longbottoms and kills the entire family -- Neville never becomes the BWL. Now, they're gone. Voldemort is happy.

The Order now has no spy (Severus turned for Lily's protection -- he cared little for the Longbottoms). Peter is still not outed (or in hiding). The Order is much worse off, and the war is still at large.

Dumbledore might at some point be able to wrangle a spy into the Death Eaters -- perhaps even Severus, if Dumbledore figures out his reluctance in harming Lily and runs with it (or maybe he sees his patronus? I have no idea, to be honest), given how big he seems to be on the power of love to solve all the problems in the world, and second chances -- but likely he'll have to start from scratch.

Either way, the Wizarding World at large is much worse off.

Even if Neville does become the BWL (say, Voldemort offers the Longbottoms to join him on the spot, they refuse, and Alice manages to induce sacrificial love protection on Neville), the Order is worse off, with Peter still at large and Severus not being a spy... unless he turns as a result of being desperate to magic up a potion to reverse Cruciatus-fried Potters, by somehow avoiding Azkaban? Actually this is a plot I kinda want to explore, a SS-centric fic that reverses the Potter and Longbottom situation, where he does everything in his power to reverse the damage to Lily (and, begrudgingly, James), and following his endeavours over months/years.
