Maybe Charlie and Hagrid hang out. Snape and Charlie. Or Theodore Nott and Luna Lovegood, or Percy Weasley and Hermione Granger, etc etc. Can be any type of friendship.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

Not looking for romance, but if there is any: Am fine with het/slash/femslash, Asexual/Bisexual, etc.


** Would you say a Pansy and Hermione friendship is unexpected? Or Pansy and Luna :D

Time to introduce you to one of my favourite HP fics ever linkao3(coven by naidhe). It's focused on female friendships, exploring Pansy and Hermione's characters first and then later exploring 3 more girls, including an incredibly accurate depiction of magical OCD and life when you think you're a ‚Äòside' character. The depth of these characters! Omg. It's the bane of my life that it's not complete, I keep hoping that if I recommend it to enough people on this sub then they'll comment and encourage the author to write more :(

  ‚ÄúThe problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen.‚Äù Hermione looked at him then, and smiled softly, ‚ÄúAnd what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore.‚Äù

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.
