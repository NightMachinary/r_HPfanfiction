i posted this in the Harmony subreddit and i got "the Riders of Hogwarts" as recs. I now post this here, maybe you people know other fics aswell.

​

here its actually 2 types of fics that im interested in.

The First one is that Harry (and hermione) meet a Powerful (and Beautiful) Witch. She can be from an AU or other Dimension or even did a Time travel...or H/Hr can be dragged into her World, whatever. While Harry and Hermione get to know her better and potentially becoming friends, Harry starts to fall for her....or atleast he is attracted to her. Well thats the point of the Fic and im uncertain about how it would go further or how it would end, but it would be good, if the Witch and H/Hr would separate in Piece and Friendship. So, no hostility between them.

​

The second one is basically the same, but with the Witch being attracted to Harry, because she likes "Powerful magic". So she would make several avances and flirtings with him (i will leave it to the Author if its to Hermiones Chagrin or if she fully trusts in Harry and put the whole "lovey-dovey" stuff as "just fun").

However, since Hermione is also magical Powerful (atleast i would rate her this way, since she can easily perform the hardest Spells during schooltime alone and those way above her class), the Witch might be also attracted to her. Im not rejected to a bisexual Witch, but i would like it, if it just stays to flirts and a Peck on the Cheek tops (on hermiones side). So, she wouldnt reject Hermione...if she is attracted to her at all, but Harry would be her Prime target.

Also here, a friendly and Pieceful goodbye. Like she kiss or touches Hermiones Cheek and says something like "take good care of him", but thats just an example.

Im fine, if the Witch belongs to the Canon universe, but i honestly cant imagine a known Character to fit in that place, unless the Author pulls her out of the Hat. So i would like it more to be a Powerful OC.

Also i would like H/Hr to be circa at the Epilogue age. So the Magic (on both parts) can be grow, also it would be a better Reason to "challenge" their Love and Trust" even after all those Years.

Does the Fic have to include Sex? My initial Thought was no and i would stay on that, as im not sure how it would affect H/Hrs Relationship, so i would like for it to have it by simply kissings and Hugs tops. But as some kind of reserve, i would say, if it fits.

I made my inspiration for ths Request by this Picture of Rosalina (known for Super Mario) [[https://www.deviantart.com/axsens/art/Dark-Rosalina-18-optional-770647275]] so yeah, such a Witch, but nothing Dark or Sinister character, possibly the appearance and the Attraction.

​

But, if you know possible Fics that have her a little Dark/Grey, but tempting, i would be open for that too.
