I know that there are people who think that the names are not realistic or the names are too heavy or both, but what people don't remember is that /Harry Potter is a fictional character, along with the rest of the cast/. It's not /meant/ to be realistic. It's meant to /teach/ us readers a lesson about honor and forgiveness, namely with Harry's second child, Albus Severus Potter.

Am I the only one in this fandom who actually /likes/ the name Albus Severus? There's a deeper meaning behind the middle name! Albus has Lily's eyes, Harry wanted to to forgive Snape, and Harry wanted to thank Snape as well for his efforts and self-sacrifice. Even if Snape was an utter douchebag to Hermione, Neville, and Harry, he was the one who did the most to ensure Harry's survival, even going as far as vilifying his own name for the greater good of the Wizarding World. If he hadn't been muttering the counter-curse in Book 1, Harry would've /died/. The reason why Harry didn't give Albus the middle name Rubeus is because Hagrid, though he was a /really/ nice and sweet person, didn't do as much to protect him, and he also has unwittingly put the Golden Trio in danger a few times (namely in Book 1). He didn't name his child Albus Remus either because Remus already had a son, which meant he already had someone to continue the name. Also, Remus didn't show up in Harry's life until 3rd year, and even then, Harry only learned about Remus's association with his father at the end of Book 3. On the other hand, Snape was always there, behind the scenes, making sure that Harry was safe. He wasn't obligated to /like/ the kid; he was just obligated to protect him. Out of everyone who protected Harry Potter, Snape did the most and sacrificed the most. Harry understood that, which is why he wanted to honor Snape by naming the kid who inherited Lily's eyes after the man who loved her.

Realistically, Harry and Ginny /wouldn't/ have named their children with such heavy names, but that's what /novels/ are /for/. They aren't /meant/ to reciprocate the hard truths of reality, they're supposed to provide us with an /escape/ from it. They're supposed to /teach/ us something. What good is a book if it just regurgitates what we already know and hate?

J.K. Rowling /purposely/ named Harry's second son Albus /Severus/ because she wanted to show that there's no use for holding a grudge against a dead person. She wanted to show that Harry was /able/ to forgive a man who tormented him and belittled him and even humiliated him at points, unlike said man. She wanted to show that Harry could /forgive/ Snape for judging him because he was a carbon copy of his father. She also wanted to express the importance of Snape's role in the war and how the Wizarding World would still be fighting Voldemort if it weren't for his self-sacrifice. Lastly, I think that she wanted to give Snape a good send-off after torturing him so much during the course of the series. That guy honestly deserved more appreciation and thanks than he received during his short life, in my opinion.

So, next time you want to complain about the unrealistic nature of the HP Epilogue, remember that these characters aren't real, and they're meant to teach us a lesson.


** I don't mind the epilogue, but I think it raises warning signs about Ron and Hermione's relationship. Ron has cheated the muggle government, and is lying to Hermione about doing it, because /in his eyes/ the lie is harmless. Oh, and he also placed a driving test officer in a confused state for an unspecified length of time; there's no real telling what that might have led to after the test was finished. Did the officer even make it home safely afterward?

** I don't like the Snape apologies that sound like “an adult man in a position of power verbally abusing his students from his teachers position is a good man”. There's a BIG difference between respecting someone for their sacrifices and naming your children after them.

News flash!! You CAN hold mixed emotions for people who have hurt you. I just don't think a man bullying a girl into changing her teeth, or ignoring ongoing harassment incidents, or the entirety of the Occlumency lessons? No matter how he's looked at, he is still a man with DEEPLY ROOTED ISSUES with no intent on changing his bedside manner to any kind of professionalism with his students. I'm not happy.

You can like Snape for being a complex and complicated man, but draw the line at Good, because that's not happening. And naming his son “Albus Severus” is like saying that as long as a toxic adult means well, that excuses their prior actions or behavior.

Harry kept his own cousin at “Christmas card” length and probably never spoke to his aunt and uncle again. Why would Snape have been an exception if he lived? Why did Snape deserve that distinction?

And by the way... “they're meant to teach us a lesson”? Maybe I just wanted a single adult to take responsibility for a change. Forgiveness should be earned, not freely given. The whole magical society turned against children. Two grown man discussed Harry's impending sacrifice of life. A kid learned to fight dementors, giant snakes, and terrorists before ever reaching the age to legally drive. A man put a stone of immortality behind a door that could be easily unlocked, with traps children could solve. A grown adult was never able to put his personal issues aside long enough to put his big boy pants on and establish a rapport with the “boy who literally is being targeted by a dark lord”. You don't need to like a child to still act like an adult for them. That's it.

*** I put it down to Harry not having a good sense of how adults should behave, so he sees Snape as both a hero (who he is indebted to, who was brave and made great contributions to the war effort, who put himself at risk for Harry/Lily specifically) and the only person who showed him memories of his mother.

I don't think it symbolises forgiveness, myself. I think its meant to show that niceness (or complexity of character) doesn't map onto dedication for the cause. Snape was radicalised as a vulnerable young person and paid for it (ungraciously) for the rest of his life.

I think we don't see his mixed feelings because once you've named your child after someone, you can't then turn around and be like "Yeah, your namesake was an utter bastard who I hated, but he did save my life."

**** It's actually just sad. Turning into an adult looking back at the series from this stand point? A human who is older then Lily and James when they died? Just reinforces that idea that Harry needed better adults in his life.

It's not okay that the kind or people he idealizes as heroes are some of the most substantial in not being substantial. They're valid humans with flaws, but it almost misses its own self awareness in favor of rose shades and memories of Lilly that, instead of creating some fond attachment to Snape's life, make me more infuriated that sharing those memories with Harry was not a viable concept until he was literally DYING. It was never purely for Harry's sake. If Snape died alone...

And that's okay. It just needs to be acknowledged.

***** I agree. I was thinking earlier how young I was at 21. I'm only a few years older now, but you mature so much in those early years of adulthood. It's like looking at the graves of soldiers in WW1 (we have lots in the nearby graveyard).

In many ways, I find it more concerning that Harry idolises Dumbledore than Snape; Snape, at least, fundamentally disagreed with the idea of sacrifice. Dumbledore was willing to bank on an guess - whoever educated - that everyone would behave exactly as predicted for Harry to choose life. Even if Dumbledore knew with certainty, the experience was traumatising. Dumbledore also ensures that Harry alienates himself from any of the adults who wanted to help.

Harry really did need better adults. From an adult perspective its worrying that even a child in as obvious circumstances his weren't supported at all at Hogwarts. McGonagall already knew the Dursleys were a terrible choice to raise a child, knew they spoilt their son and yet Harry came to Hogwarts in oversized casual clothes, without a Hogsmeade note and with no response to letters regarding his behaviour or - presumably - to his stays in the hospital wing.

Also, I was just checking up on how old Petunia Dursley was Harry was dropped on her doorstep. It's not clear, just pre-1960 though I imagine not much older given that she wrote to Dumbledore at one point. She was told to bank on some form of magic (knowing her sister had died despite having magic to defend herself) to keep her family safe. Whilst also knowing that this terrorist specifically wanted to rid the world of 'normal people' with personal murderous intentions towards her nephew.

Oh, and she can't tell anyone about this. Dumbledore said he knew Harry would be unhappy there, but never actually makes an effort to mediate this position. At the very least, he should have had the discussion in person to answer any of her questions. Really, she ought to have been able to decline, given the risks involved.

Obviously, I'm not suggesting any reasonable person would neglect a child but the situation could either have been eased or avoided. Potentially even a bit more testing could have been done regarding how early a month a year could have been exercised.

** It's not that I don't like the contents of the epilogue itself, I just feel it was way too much of a time jump. JKR basically locked herself out of any potential follow-up material by skipping so far ahead (resulting in the atrocity known as the cursed child), and the jump from a boarding school trope to married with three kids just doesn't seem fitting. Would've been much better to write it like a year or so afterwards, showing what the characters went off to do after Voldemort's fall. Imo, anyway.

That being said, if I do write something that involves an adult Harry, either he has no children or I make OC children because the names just feel too cheesy to me. Especially Lily /Luna/.

** Not alone there, I love the epilogue (yes, you may start screaming at me now).

About the name Albus Severus, it never really bothered me. Albus may be questionable from our view of Dumbledore, but for Harry he was a kind of mentor or even very remotely a father-figure, so I do get that name choice. And I think he did admire Snape for his bravery, pulling of what he did eventually to save him. Snape will probably not be acknowledged by many people, on either side, so maybe this was Harry's way of giving one last honor. This is from the view of Harry as a person, but I like your approach from JKs view!

** Is part of that lesson honoring the man who put out a hit on you and your father because of his obsession and desire to possess your mother? Let's not forget that Snape is the primary reason Harry was orphaned to begin with. Come to think of it, Snape is ALSO the reason that Neville was (basically) orphaned as well; Voldemort never gets the Prophecy without Snape running off to tattle as soon as he can. How does he atone for his crime to Neville? Oh, by torturing him so much that Neville's greatest fear was Snape himself.

How about when Snape was confronted by Sirius, an innocent man who had spent a decade in prison accused of a crime Snape himself (but not Sirius) was guilty of - namely, betraying the Potters to Voldemort - and straight up tried to have him murdered because they didn't get along in school. Picture yourself at age 30, and a kid you fought with in high school willingly trying to send you to the electric chair for a crime he knows you didn't commit. What a /psychopath!/

You also brush off his abuse - not bullying, straight up abuse - of generations of students, none of whom Snape had any deep attachment to. In other words, he emotionally battered a bunch of children he had control over for no reason beyond it was the kind of shit he got off on.

I get you're trying to look deeper into the meaning of the series as a whole, but Snape is an irredeemable figure, one that even Dumbledore was repulsed by. He was as big a villain as Voldemort in my opinion, because his motivations were so much more grotesque than Voldemort's. LV just wanted control of the wizarding world to make it (in his mind) better. Snape wanted a woman, and was willing to murder her infant son and husband to get her. Lily really lucked out that Voldemort killed her, saving her from a life where Snape was always just around the corner with (potentially) a potion or a memory charm. /shudder/ My favorite part of DH was Snape dying slowly. A Killing Curse is too quick and painless for someone as monstrous as him.

******* I view it as his greatest regret was that he was an indirect cause to Lily's death. So whatever that led up to it he would have thought of as a mistake, like joining the DEs and associating with Voldemort.

If lily wasn't targeted then it's honestly 50/50 on whether he would have defected eventually. Because no one knows if Lily being a target is the tipping point for Snape or is the primary reason for defecting from the DEs. It can be argued either way but talking about this is gonna get us nowhere because of no solid evidence.

The thing is short of Voldemort giving an unbreakable vow to Snape, nothing in Voldemort's character suggests that he is trustworthy and is one who keeps his promises. So Voldemort will never give any guarantee he will do as he wishes. As a DE Snape would have noticed and observed that. That's why he goes to dumbledore to ensure the Potters' safety because he definitely knows Voldemort will never ensure Lily's safety.

I think what you're trying to insinuate is that Snape only changed sides when someone he loved was threatened and didn't think about the other muggleborns therefore he's a selfish person. But I'll challenge you to find me one character from the hp series that has no personal motivations in this war and is taking part in the war on the light side for noble and non-selfish reasons. Everyone one from Harry to the Weasleys all have personal motivations.

Even dumbledore was friends with Grindelwald and believed in his motto until Ariana died when he realized that he's on the wrong path. And after that he atones for it by defeating grindelwald and shunning away from positions of major power like being a Minister. Making mistakes is a human thing, that's how you know you're doing wrong. But after that you cannot just wallow about it, you have to take steps to correct it.

Which is what Snape does by going to dumbledore and promising anything in exchange for the Potters' safety. The only person he blamed was himself, there's no other evidence of him blaming anyone else?

And sure, the Order fought for people they loved, but it wasn't the only reason why, and with Snape..., I never really saw a proof that he stopped believing in the pureblood propaganda. Though it has been some time since I read the books, so maybe I just don't remember.

Okay, I may be completely wrong, but I would point at Aberforth. His family is dead, and his relationship with Albus was rather frosty, judging from his speech in DH. His pub is doing well despite the obvious presence of death-eaters...

Also, Slughorn maybe too? I mean, we got that speech how he's afraid of Voldemort in HBP, but in DH he's teaching at Hogwarts without any problems. And McGonagall tells him it's time for Slytherin to choose sides, so I assume, he could go with his students, but he stayed.

I mean, not perfect examples, but not everyone was fighting for their lives or the life of someone they loved.

It is my interpretation, but I always thought that one of the reasons why Snape was so horrible to Harry was because Lily died, trying to save him. And the same with Neville, I think he bullied Neville because Neville was the other boy that fit the prophecy.

Also, The Prince's Tale when he's apologizing to Lily or trying to convince her that James is bad and Lupin is a werewolf are good examples of Snape making excuses for his actions, not owning his mistakes, and turning the blame on other people.

But like I said, it's mostly my interpretation of Snape's character, and I admit that I honestly think he was a horrible human being. An interesting character, and probably one of the most complex characters in the books, but I despise him and his behaviour.

********* Personally my view is that Snape joined the DEs to gain power to make up for the powerlessness he felt during his teens. I think he wanted to be recognized and celebrated, instead of ignored and bullied and will thrive under someone who gives him the attention and validation he craves. So whoever appreciates his talents he's gonna be on their side, and he's not inclined to care about the others because who cared for him when he was in need? He definitely has a me against the world mindset. If someone in ootp had expressed interest in him he would have been swayed to their side. So my view is that he's not someone who's into the beliefs and motto of a group, he's just in it for himself because someone wants him. So I don't see him believing all the pureblood propaganda, he's just there because they recognize his talents. But once he realizes that he's not getting what he wanted, he would be more inclined to leave the DEs I think.

Actually yeah Aberforth definitely has nothing to gain personally I mean defeating the DEs would mean not much business to his shop lmao. And it's not as if he really believes in all the stuff albus says but I think he's the kind to look out for the underdog and help those who are in need. Kudos to you! I definitely didn't think of this lmao

Slughorn I think was content to sit out the war it's more oopsie guess I'm stuck in the middle of this battle might as well try my best to protect the students. Kinda like a reluctant fighter.

My view was that Snape treated Harry badly because of him looking like James. Snape's triggers seems to be the marauders, just looking at them seems to make him on edge. For Neville it's because he's already a anxious boy normally and with someone like Snape his anxiety like skyrockets so he ends up doing even more mistakes and that just sets Snape off even more. I mean he hates Gryffindors in general but I think he also hates students who messes up the tasks he sets.

With regards to Prince's tale, I mean he was apologizing for his mistake and he does own up to it, it's natural to say stupid stuff when they are angry,humiliated but he does apologize for it, so I'm not sure what you mean? when they are both talking about James and lupin which part of the convo are you referring to when you say he's making excuses?

He does have a pretty unlikable demeanor and if I ever had a teacher like that boy would I dislike his classes. But looking into his backstory did change my view on him because a lot of his actions required great inner strength and sacrifice and I do admire that.

It was before he called her 'Mudblood'. They were talking about his friends, and Lily said they are terrible and asked him why he hangs out with Avery and Mulciber when they are creepy.

That is true he did not have an favorable opinion of muggles and if he was so vehemently against muggleborn disrcrimination then he would not have joined the DEs.

And by ootp I meant the organization! Or actually more like the Light side. In that scene yes Lily stands up for him and is the only one to stand up for him. But then we've got the marauders bullying him for the laughs as well. And well we can consider the marauders and lily to be on the light side and so when snape's got only 1 person for him and you've got 3 who's against him since day 1. Now would Snape join a group that has people who really don't like him and he also hates them?

What I meant by ‘expressing an interest' was basically to butter him up. It's like if you want to recruit somebody you've got to treat them well right? And it's a war and there seems to be strong propaganda from the DEs side because they have a higher follower count than OOTP. So did the light side lack the resources for it lmao? But I guess ootp wanted people who truly believed in their cause and not just there because propaganda so that's understandable.

And regarding the convo bwt Snape and lily in Prince's tale, lily does point out that Snape's slytherin friends do some bad shit for laughs (and doesn't mention about the marauders doing bad shit for laughs) and Snape is like why just point out only my slytherin friends, the Gryffindors also do that (like almost leading Snape to his death in the shrieking shack lmao). I mean in this case both the slytherins and Gryffindors engage in shitty acts against others. And both Snape and lily were being biased towards their own houses, which is understandable because they spend more time with their housemates. And lily doesn't /deny/ that what the marauders do is also shitty just like snape's slytherin friends, the only thing she says in defense of them is ‘they don't use dark magic'. Which is partially untrue because when Harry and his friend are doing detentions in the record room or something they find detention records of the marauders stating that they used a illegal hex. So maybe they didn't use dark magic per say but used illegal magic . Both of their statements are equally valid and true and if you're going to say Snape was making excuses and shifting blame around then lily was doing the same.

******* Um sorry what are you trying to say about Peter? I mean what point are you trying to put across by saying that he could have lived the entire life as a rat? And yes he aids in death eater activity by helping Voldemort get a body? I mean that's a pretty big activity.

Ok his atonement is for indirectly being a part of Lily's death. He isn't atoning for being a dick to his students.

But Snape wasn't wholly responsible for Harry and Neville's family situation. Snape did pass the prophecy but Voldemort is the one who chose to act on it and Peter was the one who betrayed the Potters. And bellatrix out of her own volition tortures the Longbottoms. It feels like the person who was directly responsible for these crimes are never called out for it but Snape gets all the blame? I mean if you're gonna mention Snape then please do mention Voldemort, Peter, Bellatrix also.

And also please the whole boggart thing again. Boggart are representations of fears they aren't “literal fears”. So if Hermione's boggart is a grade card with Fs then it means she's scared of failure. Not scared of grade cards. Neville's fears are being an inadequate wizard not Snape.

Whether he's redeemed or not is not the point, it's about realizing your mistake and atoning for it. He did sacrifice his life for the wizarding world and also saved a lot of people along the way like Katie Bell, all the petrified students in CoS (he brewed the mandrake potion), saved Draco's soul etc

*** Geez, you really have it out for Snape, don't you?

*REBUTTAL #1:*

#+begin_quote
  Is part of that lesson honoring the man who put out a hit on you and your father because of his obsession and desire to possess your mother?
#+end_quote

Snape never intended to get Lily to himself -- where's the evidence? If he really /were/ obsessed with Lily, he would've killed himself after she died.

#+begin_quote
  *“I wish...I wish* */I/* *were dead...”*

  “And what use would that be to anyone?” said Dumbledore coldly. “If you loved Lily Evans, if you *truly loved her*, then your way forward is clear.”
#+end_quote

If he truly /didn't/ love her, he would've broken his word. He would've taken the easy way out and committed suicide. But he didn't, because he /loved/ her, and he wanted to protect her son to honor her memory. If he were /obsessed/ with her like you claim, then he wouldn't have cared for her son's safety. He would've just cared for his own needs and his own wants. He would've been selfish. Instead, he listened to Dumbledore and committed the rest of his life to atone for his mistakes. There is no evidence of him stalking, bothering, obsessing over, or watching Lily creepily after she broke their friendship. As far as we know, he left her alone for their last two years at Hogwarts. He even refers to her as Lily /Potter/, not Evans, because he has /moved on/.

#+begin_quote
  “I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily *Potter's* son safe."
#+end_quote

A lot of people confuse his obsession with his guilt for an obsession with Lily. I assure you, if Lily had lived, he would've found another woman to marry sometime afterwards. He would've moved on from his love, and he would've been happy.

*REBUTTAL #2:*

#+begin_quote
  Come to think of it, Snape is ALSO the reason that Neville was (basically) orphaned as well; Voldemort never gets the Prophecy without Snape running off to tattle as soon as he can.
#+end_quote

Snape is /not at all/ responsible for Neville's parents' insanity. It also has /nothing/ to do with the prophecy. Neville's parents were tortured /after/ Voldemort's first demise. The torture was done by Bellatrix Lestrange, Rodolphus Lestrange, Rabastan Lestrange, and Barty Crouch, Jr. in an attempt to locate Voldemort. Don't place blame on a man who had no control over what those vile Death Eaters did. Please, /please/ don't.

*REBUTTAL #3:*

#+begin_quote
  You also brush off his abuse - not bullying, straight up abuse - of generations of students, none of whom Snape had any deep attachment to.
#+end_quote

I understand your hatred for Snape, but where's the proof that he abused "generations of students, none of whom Snape had any deep attachment to"? There were /five/ Weasleys before Ron who had him as a teacher, /none/ of whom came out emotionally battered. For crying out loud, Bill became a /Curse-Breaker/, which is a very, /very/ difficult job to get which requires an O.W.L. in Arithmancy and a N.E.W.T. in Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration, Ancient Runes, and /Potions/! George and Fred spent time inventing different candies and other things which would require a high potion-making ability, and they opened up a joke shop which /rivaled/ Zonko's. Tonks is another proof of his good teaching -- /she/ wasn't emotionally battered by him, either, during school (though he /was/ cruel to her about her love for Remus, but that isn't the issue here), and she ended up becoming an excellent Auror. The only students that he actually tormented in the series were Harry for his resemblance to his father, Hermione for her constant need to answer questions in class, and Neville because he could've /also/ been the Chosen One. Otherwise, no one else was strictly "abused" by him.

*REBUTTAL #4:*

#+begin_quote
  How about when Snape was confronted by Sirius, an innocent man who had spent a decade in prison accused of a crime Snape himself (but not Sirius) was guilty of - namely, betraying the Potters to Voldemort - and straight up tried to have him murdered because they didn't get along in school.
#+end_quote

Snape wanted Sirius killed because he /genuinely believed/ that Sirius betrayed the Potters. He thought Pettigrew was dead, and he wasn't conscious when Remus explained his life story to the Golden Trio. Sirius isn't innocent, either, you know. He thoughtlessly put Remus's life in danger by pranking Snape. In the series, he never apologizes for putting Snape's life in danger (which is understandable due to his hatred), nor does he apologize for for nearly getting Remus killed (which is /not/ understandable at /all/). Yes, Snape acted pretty stupidly, but Sirius should've at /least/ thought about his friend's life when luring Snape into the Whomping Willow. He is /also/ not responsible for betraying the Potters -- that was the rat, Peter Pettigrew.

*REBUTTAL #5:*

#+begin_quote
  Snape wanted a woman, and was willing to murder her infant son and husband to get her.
#+end_quote

Where. Is. The proof? /How/ was Snape supposed to know that Voldemort would take a prophecy so seriously? /How/ was /he/ supposed to know that he'd target Lily Potter's child? He was just following his master's orders. Nothing else, nothing more. When he realized his mistake, he immediately went to Dumbledore. Snape asking Voldemort to spare Lily actually /saved/ Harry's life, because Voldemort giving Lily the option to live gave her the opportunity to make a loving sacrifice, which in turn protected Harry for the next sixteen years of his life. If Snape had asked Voldemort for anything more than that, then Snape would've /surely/ been killed right then and there, and /then/ what would've happened? Harry would've died, and the Harry Potter series wouldn't exist.

*REBUTTAL #6:*

#+begin_quote
  Snape is an irredeemable figure, one that even Dumbledore was repulsed by.
#+end_quote

If Dumbledore was repulsed by Snape, why on Earth did he enlist him as a spy? Why did he trust Snape so much? If Dumbledore was repulsed, then he /wouldn't/ have given Snape a second chance. He would've rejected him on that windy night on the hilltop. Just because Dumbledore said that Snape disgusted him /once/ doesn't mean that he was repulsed by him throughout the /whole series/.

**** Look, the fact that Snape is Neville's boggart alone should be enough to tell the tale about his teaching style. I mean, Neville could have feared the death of his parents or them never getting better, or maybe Bellatrix Lestrange, the one truly dangerous death Eater who was amongst those who tortured his parents into the state they were. But no, Snape it is. That tells you just how much psychological damage he did.

***** Ok lmao I'm extremely tired of seeing people repeat the point about Snape being Neville's boggart. The whole point of the boggart is it shows the representation of the fears. Let's look at lupin's boggart shall we? It's a moon. Going by your logic, the moon must have done something to lupin? What did the moon ever do to him? Did it hit him, attack him? Is lupin scared of the full moon itself? Obviously no right? He's scared of what the full moon /represents/ to him. He's scared of the fact that on the full moon he turns into a werewolf and cannot control himself.

Likewise Neville's boggart is Snape because Neville has confidence issues because since young his family has doubted his wizarding abilities, and Snape does the same thing to him by intimidating him and belittling him. So Neville's fear is being a subpar wizard who messes up stuff, it's not “Snape is his literal fear”.

The choice to go into the shrieking shack was Snape's choice yes but who the hell gave Sirius any authority to let out the secret on how to access the whomping willow? Snape doesn't know the exact dangers of being with a werewolf, he has suspicions on remus being a werewolf but he /doesn't/ know that remus IS a werewolf. There's a big difference between both. Snape has suspicions but there was a chance that whatever that was in the shrieking shack could have been anything else but a blood thirsty werewolf. Putting the blame on Snape is purely victim blaming. I don't see anyone calling out Sirius for abusing his remus' trust? By outing remus' secret to Snape? Now that was a mega dick move.

And also at first yes dumbledore did emotionally manipulate Snape because he was a valuable tool but obviously as shown in the books dumbledore grows to trust Snape that he would call for Snape when his life was in danger and that he would tell such an impt secret on Harry being a horcrux to ONLY Snape and not anyone else.

******** Who is insulting? There are people in the HP fandom that really get off to Snape molesting Harry or Hermione. It's not a big leap to assume someone that has responded to /every single/ negative comment about Snape in this thread likely falls into those ranks.

You don't know who Snape tormented or didn't. He was a teacher who belittled his students on a regular basis. That is abuse, given his position of authority. The older Weasleys warned the younger students, so it is pretty much a given that he was a piece of shit to everyone, just not quite as bad he was to H/N/Hr. And Harry is a /child/ who has been abused by an authority figure. He is allowed to hate Snape. What is the excuse for the man in his mid-30s to act that way towards a defenseless little boy?

He never atoned for shit. If he had, he would have fessed up to Harry right away how he was the one responsible for Harry's childhood being stolen from him. Even as he was dying, Snape still tried to shit all over Harry's father. You know that horrible people can still fight for the 'good' side, right? Just because Snape spied for the OOTP, doesn't mean he atoned for anything.

Tell you what - wait til you have childen, then go back and re-read (yes, /read/, not watch) the parts where Snape interacts with kids.

He didn't even know that Voldemort would take something as stupid as a prophecy so seriously. If Voldemort hadn't taken the prophecy so seriously, then nothing would've happened and Harry and his family would've not been harmed.

If you say that Snape didn't atone for anything, then you're disregarding his /entire/ redemption arc. You're disregarding practically the whole chapter of "The Prince's Tale." Also, Snape didn't try to "shit all over Harry's father" as he was dying. He just said, "Look...at...me..."

The reason why he spied was /because/ he wanted to atone for his mistakes. If he didn't want to atone for his mistakes, he would have killed himself in November of 1981 like he had initially wanted to.

Lastly, for your information, I read the books /first/, then watched the movies. Before I even watched the first movie, I determined in my own brain that Snape did, in fact, redeem himself, and that he was a good character.

1. First it is really difficult to disentangle real Dumbledore from the fanon one (manipulative!Dumbledore, evil!Dumbledore). There is so much of the latter and so much Dumbles-bashing, that it is sometime difficult to find the Rowling's one.

2. I have actually more understanding for poor judgements of his when he was /de facto/ leader in the civil war. It is really rough job, and no one gets out of this job blameless, because all of them must make decisions which are quite questionable. I do believe that Winston Churchill was one of the biggest leaders of the twentieth century, and yet I still can understand the statement that if he was not the winner of the Second World War, he would be executed as the war criminal (mainly for the style of the air campaign against Germany in the later parts of the war). It is really difficult, and the good leader must to some extent forget individual lives for the greater picture.

******* The thing is fears aren't /literal/ all the time. They can be metaphorical. Hermione's fear is Mcgonagall telling her she failed her exams. So she's scared of failure not of mcgonagall is she? And Ron's fear as a spider is very literal but remus' fear of the full moon is not literal in my opinion. Because he's scared of turning into the werewolf he's not scared of the full moon itself literally.

Boggarts show your worst fears yes true. What would it show for someone who has a fear of heights? For someone who is claustrophobic? Someone who is scared of being alone? Some fears cannot be shown literally can they?

And also no one is saying he's perfect and do we have to resort to insulting? Really...

******** And fears are often a way more complicated. It was some Harmony story (obviously) which explained that she knew if she failed Hogwarts, she would be obliviated of all magical knowledge, her wand would be snapped, and she would have to return to the Muggle world, where she was hated and belittled by her stupid peers. Perhaps, the idea she could ever fail at Hogwarts is ridiculous, but as I said fear is usually not rational. What I want to say is that there are stories behind our fears and they are usually a way more complicated than what's seen on the first look.

******** You're right, actually! Snape never, EVER put Neville's life in danger. He just verbally undermined him. When Snape was Headmaster, he saved Neville, Ginny, and Luna by giving them detention with Hagrid after they tried to steal the Sword of Gryffindor. Did you notice that Neville, Ginny, and Luna are all pureblood, so that's why Snape could give them the leniency? That's a fun easter egg.

********* Interesting! Snape was always trying to protect people's lives, but doesn't really care for their welfare lmao. But I would like to believe it's just coincidence Neville, Luna and Ginny are all pure bloods, if it had been Colin or some other muggleborn I believe he would have still sent them to the Forbidden forest. Cos I feel that if Snape still had any lingering favoritism to purebloods dumbledore wouldn't have trusted him that much you know?

** I could write a lengthy paragraph on why the epilogue sucks, but the "all was well" line alone is enough to rate the whole thing as garbage. The fact that Teddy's parents aren't around to see him off is proof that not all was well, nevermind that Malfoy is out of prison and that long enough to have courted his wife and have an 11 yo son.

*** I have problems with Malfoy out of prison too (and with Albus *Severus* Potter), but still “All was well” is the best part of the Epilogue and the perfect conclusion of the whole series. I guess it depends whether you focus on small problems (these two I mentioned and some other ones I haven't) or how it perfectly fulfils the Hero's Journey towards new life and reconciliation with life. I guess, it is the same for the heroes inside of the story, whether they focus on real tragedies in their life (Teddy being an orphan, Fred's dead) or whether they focus on the huge blessings they were given (their own lives, freedom, their own children, etc.). I firmly believe, that all was well after all.

** I like the epilogue. I also think the names reflect how Harry felt about Albus and Severus, rather than what the reader thinks. I don't mind 'what if' fics where the story diverges earlier.

There's plenty of literacy criticism for books that try to moralise stories for children, of course. The best children's stories let children think for themselves - for the most part HP does.

** Eh, the epilogue wasn't actually bad. It's mostly a matter of taste, but generally the ones who give shit to the epilogue are mostly upset because their favorite characters didn't live up to their expectations or that some choice or another goes very much against their desires. Cursed Child though is almost universally hated and personally I feel it deserves the flames.

Take Harry for example, his mentor was Dumbledore, who was a brilliant researcher, one of the most powerful wizards of his time and accumulated a great deal of political power, when some see Harry being what amounts to a higher-ranking police-officer while Hermione is Minister they get the sense that he is wasting his potential despite the fact that such a choice is actually very in-character for Harry and that he never was invested in such things as political power, academic achievements or overwhelming power to begin with and actually appears to be quite satisfied with his lot in life.

Then there is the inevitable ship wars, where people get angry that their ships didn't fly, this one is admittedly mostly Harmony vs Hinny, but it's a fact that in popular fandoms many will end displeased over the endgame pairing.

Then there is the whole name business, and there you have to admit that Albus Severus came from left-field, I mean; ignoring the whole “Albus planned Harry's death” since he didn't know about it for time enough to have a deep emotional impact before meeting him and clarifying the issue; Snape is still a character hated by many and considering his mostly negative behavior towards Harry many of us feel that Harry should go tap-dancing over the man's grave weekly, not forgive him, he literally got Harry's parents killed and then spent six years belittling the boy for haven's sake. Plus the name itself is one we have to get used to, Albus Severus Potter (in an open translation: white grumpy potter) just doesn't roll that well on the tongue when compared to many other names used, even Nymphadora Tonks is kind of catchy, Albus Severus though isn't.

Then there is Draco. While they only nodded to each other on the train station the mere fact that Draco was free to marry and have a son at the same year as Harry's second-born was conceived gives the idea of there not having been changes from the status quo. The Malfoys were among Voldemort's most important allies, for them to be in the same situation as Harry gives the sense of impunity, like there weren't consequences for all the crimes they committed. Considering that we see during the books that the Status Quo was rampart discrimination against muggleborns (represented by Hermione who for better or worse is a very beloved character) and the government that thought nothing of torturing kids, being the books' antagonists deeply related with this agents of the Status Quo and having the final battle culminated in the defeated of this agents (Voldemort dead, Narcisa helping Harry, the DEs defeated, a member of the order taking over as minister) this continuity of the Status Quo becomes rather grating, like the conflict wasn't solved.

*** I like your explanation very much! I personally hate the Cursed Child because of its character assassinations. Harry, having had many terrible adult figures in his life, would /never/ wish Albus Severus wasn't his son. He'd be grateful that he could even survive to /have/ children. Ron, on the other hand, just becomes a big joke, and Hermione turns into a female version of Snape in the alternate reality. I mean, what the hell? Albus Severus is a total emo and brat, and the only characters I actually /liked/ in the play were Draco and Scorpius. I don't understand why Rose was so mean, either. She took what Ron told her about beating Scorpius too seriously, and in the process, she ruins her friendship with Albus. The other thing I like about the play is Snape's minor role (I might be biased here since Snape is my fav character in the series). He sacrifices himself so that the reality could be restored to its normal state while knowing he'd be dead in the restored reality. The Cursed Child just ruins the whole HP series and makes it into a joke and a travesty. I consider some parts of the Cursed Child canon and other parts not canon (like discounting Harry's bad parenting and counting Snape's redemption). I dunno, I just wanted to provide my opinion on the shit-show.
