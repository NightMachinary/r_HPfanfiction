tl;dr They're playing like, truth or dare. I can't remember if it went around the circle or if it was more a spin the bottle type thing. I remember pairings were Harry + Hermione (sort of) and Neville + Hannah, and there was at least 1 other playing. Ron was ostracized. I might be confusing FF's but i think Ginny had given Harry a love potion and Ron and defended her so that was why both were out of the picture? It spent like, 1 sentence on it lol. IIRC Harry or Hermione sit in the others lap for a portion of it from a dare, and the final truth was either Hannah or Neville agreed to do it in the first place in order to admit to the other they were into bondage or something?

It felt SUPER wholesome though, like an actual bunch of high school friends having fun on the nsfw side as opposed to a smut fic. I've seen it recommended here a bunch but I can't seem to find it anymore. Thanks!

-edit- someone Dm'd me Spin by canoncansodoff. This is NOT it but the piece has to be plagiarized from Spin or vice versa, most of the general structure is the same and there's a few lines that are basically identical to what I'm thinking of (and specific enough where it can't be a coincidence), but aside from some general events being different the writing style is just way too different from what I remember. It's still a good one and I'd recommend it if what I described sounds interesting to you.


** The 3rd was Susan iirc. Hannah was there to get spanked by harry so she could make nev dom her while hermione was taking care of Harry and Little Harry jr who didn't work right because of evil ginny's potions while susan wanted to fuck harry ultra bad and become their 3rd.

I wish there was more good truth or dare, or party sex game flics

  Hermione is told Love might be the Power-He-Knows-Not and vows to help Harry find it at any cost. Be Warned of some R/Hr until chpt 20 but skipping those chapters means missing out on H/Hr/G goodness. This is rated MATURE for ADULT CONTENT. Harry/Many
