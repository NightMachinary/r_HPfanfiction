Looking for Snape-centric fics with and or snark/scheming/humour. Something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6047401/1/Birds-of-a-Feather][Birds of a feather]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11625127/1/Darkness-Visible][Darkness visible]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11537837/1/Path-to-Victory-A-Severus-Snape-Story][Path to victory]]

A Snape is Harry's real father story. Plenty of snark and he's always scheming and a little bit of humor. The first few chapters are a bit weak, but it gets a good rhythm a little bit later.

Apart from Snape and Harry, major characters include Remus, Draco, Ron and Hermione.

Why recc it? It features one of my favorite portrayals of Snape in fandom - he's everything we've seen in canon - but actually has human emotions. Trio dynamics are explored heavily. Harry is pretty rebelious. And other stuff that escape me. It's a story that stays with you, I think - at least it's stayed with me after more than a decade.

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) has lots of great snarky humour, especially between Snape and Harry.
