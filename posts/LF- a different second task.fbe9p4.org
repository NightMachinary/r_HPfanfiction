** The TWT has four tasks, and three tournaments/contests for those not selected as champions in between, in my AU story "Patron". All tasks are elemental-themed, and far more aideince-friendly than in canon.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

**** I have daily quotas - 750 to 800 words, per day, per story. Two stories, generally.

And I write by planning out a very rough guideline, but then I let the characters act and react - so, I usually only have to ask myself "what will X and Y do now?" and then can write it.
