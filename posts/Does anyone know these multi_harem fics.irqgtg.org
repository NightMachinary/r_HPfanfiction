:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Please don't judge but they're two Harem fics whose names I can't remember, or maybe it's just one?

Eitherway one has Harry have some weird magical effect and he has to get with everyone cause he's insatiable and his magic demands it or something... Remembering more, he gets with tonks first I think and basically any woman at hogwarts

The other is Harry has a muggle gf during the summer holidays who he picks up clothes shopping but then also goes out witha Harem worth of girls at Hogwarts and I'm pretty sure he owns the rights to an underwear business?

Thanks


** First one sounds a bit like /Incubus/.

** First one might be /Ascension: Bloodline Book 1/? by Megamatt09. Iirc Andi and Nym take his virginity when he turns 11. Had something to do with first maturity.

Think the second one is linkffn(For the Love of Magic).
