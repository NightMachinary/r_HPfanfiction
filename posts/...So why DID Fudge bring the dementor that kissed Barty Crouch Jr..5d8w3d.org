Just something that's bugging me tonight.

An Auror would be more adept at shielding Fudge and escorting him out of trouble in case he was in danger; except in the case of Harry himself (who's severely vulnerable to them), individual dementors don't actually have much in the way of attack capability, they're more of a terror weapon. Not forgetting the potential for massive collateral damage if innocents get caught in any crossfire, or someone uses the imperius curse, or...yeah, a dementor isn't an ideal bodyguard.

Canon-wise, as I recall, the Kiss-on-Sight order wasn't authorized until halfway through the school year; it's not automatic for anyone who escapes from Azkaban, otherwise logically Bellatrix and the other Death Eaters caught in the 5th book would have been given the Kiss too. So Fudge wouldn't have had any authorization to execute a prison escapee.

For that matter, why would Fudge visit the suspect at all (he was already on the grounds of Hogwarts for the end of the Triwizard Tournament)? Shouldn't a Hit Wizard or an Auror have made the visit in order to collect testimony and retrieve the suspect?

So...why DID Fudge go out of his way to have a dementor retrieved from the Ministry/Azkaban, have it accompany him instead of any number of capable witches & wizards, and personally go to investigate a suspicious person instead of delegating it to someone else?


** On a meta level: Because Rowling needed to get rid of Barty in order to write OotP the way she has.

Within the universe, I interpret Fudge's actions and the Ministry as a whole as something close to a dictatorship. Fudge seems barely limited by any law, but only by his connections and the public opinion. He can drop a charge on a whim (PoA), he can issue executions without questioning (also PoA and GoF), he can sweep torture of children under the rug (because don't tell me nobody wrote home about this shit) he seems to head the court, the executive branch and the legislative branch of the government, plus he seems to have a tight grasp on the newspapers and media in general, enabling him to sway public opinion on a whim. The Ministry seems like a construct of a lot of uncontrolled authority, making on-the-spot executions possible.

** By this point Fudge was somewhat out of control and simply drunk on both power and the need to control the situation himself and show the public how amazing he was. He was absolutely convinced of Blacks guilt and wanted to take a hard line stance and show the control he had. Hence, a powerful statement of showing up with a Dementor to administer the kiss.

*** Yeah, pretty much. Although, on a random note, it might have also been somewhat influenced by Moody's (alleged) presence, as any Auror experienced enough for Fudge to feel secure would probably listen to Moody if the guy started barking out orders and if Fudge knew anything then he thought Moody is under Dumbledore's command (and Lucius was at that point quite succeeding at convincing him that Dumbledore was trying to upstage him).

** He knew that Dumbledore hated the idea of dementors in the castle, and he wanted to assert his power. In a time where there was a significant amount of unrest, it was a way to assert himself as the alpha.

** Alright, I have something of a mental picture now, I guess; it's all down to the advice Fudge is receiving, primarily from Malfoy and other Death Eaters hidden in the Ministry.

First instance, in Prisoner of Azkaban, the kiss-on-sight order isn't in place at first, Remus Lupin mentions that it was only announced in the Prophet earlier that morning, halfway through the book. This could be put down as the influence of Lucius going 'he's too dangerous, if you capture him again he'll escape again, have him killed on sight'.

Then, in Goblet of Fire, he hears that a death eater has been caught after orchestrating the night's events, he may or may not believe it's Sirius, but in either case, Lucius influences him again, "I so totally told you last time, you left Black alone for a few minutes and he escaped out the window, you can't let this one get away."

Finally, in Order of the Phoenix, Lucius is caught amongst the Death Eaters; with proof that his 'friend' has backstabbed him and nobody to tell him to 'have them Kissed now, you won't get another chance', the Azkaban escapees are returned to Azkaban (with a few extra) instead of being Kissed-on-sight.

Possibly, back in Chamber of Secrets, Lucius may have also been responsible for pressuring Fudge into sending Hagrid to Azkaban. I'm not entirely sure what his motives would be, mind, considering that Hogwarts ends up almost being shut down. Is that his goal?

~shrugs~

Just my theory, anyway.

** I always took it as he's a pansy but to address your points

TL:DR, Fudge confronted a convicted, dead (they buried his mothers body as his), and now escaped criminal so he summoned the things that deal with criminals. He did not think the consequences through and is a terrible detective to boot.

-Moody was the only auror we know of at the school at this time; he was also technically not moody so there were no trained aurors at hog warts at this particular time, it's a sporting event, why bring an auror! -dementors have a very strong field of effect and suppression. They stand OUTSIDE doors and drive prisoners insane. -Fudge is a politician, he rarely thinks of others, of consequences, or what impact he will (that's how he's written at least), the worst case scenario for fudge at that time is not the prisoner escaping, being harmed etc, it's that he could be attacked! Barty is an escaped AND convicted criminal. Who deals with criminals? Dementor, it's a pretty logical choice -Bartys prisoner rights. He's a convicted and escaped criminal. He probably has no rights in the wizarding world (even in reality escaped convicts don't have real rights, they're gonna get sent back to jail). -Barty is supposed to be dead, there is no magic that brings the dead back to life, but there is magic that reanimated corpses and Fudge has no reason to expect that this dead, convicted, and now escaped, criminal is anything that he says he is.

*** Sheesh, now you have me wondering why, if Barty Crouch Jr is supposed to be dead, Fudge took it at face value that he was alive over a decade later and it wasn't some doppelganger or lookalike.

...Maybe someone could make a fanfic along those lines; when Barty is Kissed, Harry feigns ignorance, "Who? But Barty Crouch Jr. has been dead for 10 years. People don't come back from the dead, Minister...if he wasn't Barty, who did you just have Kissed by a dementor?"

The fic might be a one-shot, based around maneuvering Fudge into admitting that Voldemort isn't as dead as he seemed, or else taking the rap for assassinating a complete mystery man before he could be questioned.

Although perhaps it could be turned around by Fudge pressing the claim that there was no man Kissed by a dementor and that Moody had been teaching all along, allegations by Harry/Dumbledore/Moody himself be damned. Oh, the potential...

**** and then the quibler starts running stories about fudge being a dark dementor lord. using dementors for assassinations, raising an undead army; using voldemorts remains in the ritual to create a undead voldemort corpse inhabited by a dementor. the heliopaths, natural enemy of the undead, are actually being held prisoner as part of the big scheme. the previous year was all attempts to off harry by the minister. dementors have no teeth, the gun disease plot thickens. confusing and forgetfulness, stolen atrifacts, invisible enemies.

** My head cannon reason for this is that with the Serious affair it had become a kissable offense to escape azkaban, and so when Barry touch junior was discovered, after a child was murdered rather than drag everything out with investigations and trials that could result in opinion shifting and blaming the ministry for letting 2 people escape prison, he immediately has the man kissed as fast as a dementia can be brought over, case closed.
