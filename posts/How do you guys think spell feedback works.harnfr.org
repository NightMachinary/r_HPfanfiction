I mean for example, diagnosis spells. Do you think the injuries/illnesses the spell picks up appear written in an already enchanted parchment? Or they float in the air, kinda like Tom's name? Or the knowledge of the result just pops up in the caster's head? In that case, how do they know they just aren't imagining it?

I'm curious how they would work. Kinda the same with enchanting. How do they know how to 'layer' spells? Do you reckon there is another spell, or device, that let's them sort of view the actual magic placed on an object?


** I've always thought that magic must have some sort of mental feedback. Dumbledore (and possibly Harry himself) act upon that mental feedback.

HBP page 557:

  Dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and ceiling.

  “Yes, this is the place,” said Dumbledore.

  “How can you tell?” Harry spoke in a whisper.

  “It has known magic,” said Dumbledore simply.

  Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of enchantments. He watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot, evidently concentrating on things Harry could not see.

  ...

  Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backward and forward over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall.

  “Here,” he said. “We go on through here. The entrance is concealed.”

  Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.

Plus, seers, for all the disbelief Hermione has in the subject, gain insight into the world via magic. Centaurs can look at the stars and glean meaning that muggles could never get. Even for non-seers, there are ways to gain information from magic itself, rather than through an abstract interpretation; legilimency, for instance.

Also, given how spells are influenced by emotions, require study and focus, and can do incredibly complex things even with a single (optional) incantation, I am utterly convinced that wizards /must/ have a sense of magical proprioception, a feeling of where their magic is and what it's doing.

*** This sums it up for me. I always thought it a bit ridiculous when authors use the fanon (afaik) charm Tempus and floating numbers appear to tell the exact time, or with the revealing charm, which makes the silhouette of the person or object or whatever appear (this last one could be canon, but it's been at least 5 years since i read DH and i can't be bothered to check). My actual headcanon is that it creates an awareness of some kind, where you cannot tell time precisely to the minutes, but some very rough estimate of when you are, time-wise. Of course, this could be extrapolated to other kind of magics, like diagnostics and detection, and could be even treated like an extra sense (which it kinda is), and be trained to be more accurate.

Edit: what really bothers me is that some people make magic which is to me so metaphysical sometimes, to be something so concrete as floating numbers that tell you the time, or a glowing red silhouette that tells you that there is someone sneaking about.

** İ think they create smoke like images with variations of colors and sounds. For example a dark curse will create a skull made out of black smoke while patronus will make an animal made from white smoke. People who use diagnostic spells often such as healers would need to learn manings of hundreds of different symbols, colors and sounds and need to be able to deduce what their combinations mean.

*** Your answer kinda reminds me of the alethiometer from The Golden Compass/Northern Lights series, which is, of course, awesome

**** I know, it was my inspiration:-)

And it doesnt necesarily needs to be limited to shapes and colors. it could be sound, temprature, smell, etc... For example Lighter magic like patronus could feel warm and happy, while killing curse could feel cold and smell like rot.

***** Kind of "magical" synestesia? That could be really interesting. The image in my head is of Gimli in the LOTR movie tasting and spitting orc blood, LOL

** As far as I'm concerned, diagnosis spells don't exist. I always found it a bit ridiculous how the healer would cast a spell, and then all your health history would be written on a parchment, just like I always found the Tempus spell ridiculous (especially in a world setting where it's custom for every one to get a watch when they reach their majority).

Magical doctors do their job the same ways muggle ones do, they look at the symptoms of their patient and use it to determine a diagnosis. I guess some spells could be used to help them, but they should not be accurate at all. A healer diagnosis should be more along the lines of "Thanks to a spell I used, I could confirm your injury was caused by Dark Magic, but I have no idea what was the precise spell" rather than "Thanks to the diagnosis spell, I know this injury was caused by a spell "Sectumsempra" used by a Severus Snape the 12 of March at 22:17").
