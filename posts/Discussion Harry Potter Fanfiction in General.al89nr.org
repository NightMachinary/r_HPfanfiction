So, I've been a huge fan of the Harry Potter books ever since I was young, I got into fanfiction (More specifically Harry Potter; fanfiction) When I was in High School. And I've noticed a decrease in interest with writing Fanfiction; at least in the Harry Potter related stuff.

Oh sure, we still get stories, or updates by people; but it doesn't seem as constant as it was say 10 or even 5 years ago.

So, that left me wondering. How can we change this? Harry Potter is one of the most popular series out there, it has a ton of fanfiction on fanfiction.net; using and re using the same or even similar ideas with occasional changes here or there.

So my question is, how do we spice things up? Is there anything different that can be done? New ideas with different out takes? I know that Harry is the most commonly used character, since he is the main character and it just makes sense to use him, but are there any ideas that haven't been used? Or as explored as some others?

Any thoughts or ideas you'd like to share? Maybe even centering on different characters?


** That's just the natural rise and fall of fandom, I'm afraid. Even big, popular, prolific fandoms eventually go quiet when the series ends and people find new interests. That the HP fandom still, over 11 years since the last book, has enough people to sustain a fanfic subreddit, is really quite incredible.

I'm with you on mourning the relative dearth of new fics, but being on the tail-end of a fandom's lifespan has its advantages, too - there's a big huge backlog of fics to sift through, and fewer people tends to mean less wank.

** We just discussed this on the [[/r/HPFanfiction]] Discord ~2 days ago. There's only one thing that can cause a MAJOR resurgence in HPFF interest.

A new, wildly popular Harry Potter series in the form of:

- A full length book series written by JK Rowling

- A TV series that approaches the popularity (and quality) of shows like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, or Rick and Morty

- A movie series as popular as Marvel or Star Wars

In order for any of these things to happen, it is my personal opinion that side stories or historical events about side characters will not produce the type of popularity needed to really boost the HP fandom.

The new series MUST be about the Potters. Specifically, it must be about one of the following:

- Harry

- Harry's parents

- Harry's children

I'm almost certain that a series about any other character in any other era would do little better than Fantastic Beasts.

In response to your specific question about what we can do. I believe there is NOTHING the HP fandom can do to stop the slow, inevitable decline and death of HPFF. Any marketing attempt, new ideas or tropes, new character approaches, or anything of the like would at best cause a minor uptick in a general downward trend that leads to the ruining of your childhood. Sorry.

*** This is just the cycle of fandom. Something new and exciting comes out and people want to create stuff for it---stories, art, whatever. New original content stops being produced and interest wanes. I've observed this with a couple of anime fandoms. In the mid-late 90s, Ranma 1/2 was hot---the manga was still being translated, the OAVs, TV series and movies were newish to the US and there was a ton of fanfiction. Now none of those archives are around and you're probably like “What 1/2?”

Same thing with Gundam Wing. Cartoon Network starts showing the show, fanfiction rapidly follows. Show goes off the air, people forget, creation drops off. Harry Potter has definitely slowed down from when I first started writing in 2005. Back then there were a ton of archives, Live Journal and FFN full of people writing, sharing and feverishly speculating how JKR would end things. I don't think HPFF is anywhere close to dying, but one day it will unless new original content is created ad Blandage said.

Decline? Yes. Death? No.

Why?

Because at the end of the day there will always be a hardcore core of folks, and that core will refresh as new blood is drawn in. Like any book series, there are generational cycles. As one generation ages out, another ages in. While the popularity will never approach the original levels, both in terms of the original content and invented content via fanfiction/art/whatever, the idea that interest would die is silly.

The "slow" modifier is the key word here. It might take many years-- hell it might take a thousand years. Shit there have been fanfics for The Illiad published recently on FFN, but the community will eventually wither and die with the heat death of the universe.

I get your point though. Perhaps I was being a bit over dramatic. The core community will likely endure for decades. It's kinda sad to think that in 50 years we'll still be hoping our favorite stories update, but we'll know in our hearts there's a good chance the author is dead or dying soon.

*** This is such a pessimistic view! Massive fandoms stick around for many, many years, and I expect HP to do the same. People are still writing Tolkien/LOTR fanfiction decades after its publication---yes, the movies obviously gave a big popularity bump, but there are still quite a few people writing fics about hardcore book material, and overall there's a decent influx of material. Things will slow down, but as long as HP remains a pop culture classic, there will always be people interested in writing HPFF. Keep making content, and most importantly, keep encouraging the next generation to get into HP. You hear lots of stories about how people got introduced to LOTR because their parents read The Hobbit to them for their bedtime stories, or how showing your kids the Star Wars movies for the first time is an anticipated family event---that's how you maintain a fandom (and fanfiction) in the years to come.

*** I'd argue that a next-Gen story based on the epilogue world would not be very popular. Because that one was a punch in the gut, even if you liked the pairings. Ron brags about assaulting a muggle's mind, Harry does not even call him out, Snape and Dumbledore, the number two and three people who caused suffering in Harry's life (no Dumbledore, no Dursleys), were heroes, the entire battle with its deaths was inconsequential because "all was well" and Malfoy was not in prison.

You'd need to revamp that part of the series if you want to successfully build on it.

You have more accurate depictions of Malfoy when he is the antagonists than when he is the protagonist.

At that point, people are writing OCs and call them Draco Malfoy.

** We are not seeing the decline of the HP fandom. We are seeing its normalisation. Nothing will ever match the hype around the HP books at the time they were being released, but the fandom has far too much critical mass to simply disappear. There are much smaller fandoms out there that tick along with barely any new material being released (see: Star Trek) and Harry Potter will likely continue in that vein for many years to come. But 2005-2009 will not happen again, I'm afraid. Even if JKR were to publish a great new series, it would not revive the massive hype of the original series, which was a unique event in the history of publishing.

** I don't like the idea of adding new content to the original foundation of the fandom: the 7 Harry Potter books. Everything new that has been added has been okay (Pottermore as a Buzzfeed-like trivia/encyclopedia page) to disappointing (Fantastic Beasts film series) to downright horrible (Cursed Child).

I'm more of the mind that we shouldn't try to stop a trend that is going to happened regardless of what this small community here does. But we can try to /slow/ it, keep the authors and creators in this fandom, and continuing to create content instead of leaving for the next cool new franchise or series.

We as a community should be more interactive and engaging with creators. Give them a reason to stay and keep producing nice things for us to read.

- Encourage authors, instead of downvoting people who ask for advice on their fics, or self-promote their work here. I see that happen all the time here, and I don't understand why. This is the HPfanfic sub, they are discussing HPfanfic. It's not off-topic, therefore downvoting is going against the Reddit standard of conduct.

- Read fics and engage with the authors. If there's a fic you liked enough to recommend, and you recommended it to another user here, why not copy and paste your rec to the fic's Review submission form on FFN.net or Ao3? Maybe the author would like to hear that people liked their work. When I see people discussing an ongoing fic that is actively being updated, that's the kind of thing that authors would probably like to see, and maybe would have a response to. But of course they never see it because it's a random reddit thread posted at 4AM in their timezone.

- Take steps in writing the content we want to see. Instead of complaining about horrible harem fics and how they never work, why not write a fic where this is explored in a realistic way? Instead of asking for ridiculously specific prompts in a thread, why not take 20 minutes to write a small snippet to post along with the idea?

*** Yes as a community we need to become more active again when it comes to leaving reviews and engaging with the authors. I have read some amazing fanfic and when checking the reviews most were very basic "keep up the good work" , "update please" ...

I like to pick out at least one thing I enjoyed (if it still in progres per chapter) and leave a review outlining what I liked, as well as mentioning everything that seems unclear or things that would help my understanding (paragraphs!!!!).

About your last point: I miss the very detailed challenges that used to be popular. I don't need novel length answers but maybe some nice one shots, sometimes author's continued or refined their work based on these answers to challenges

** New stories actually worth reading is a good start. Issue is that it's impossible to force people to write good stories. People need to stop worrying so much about the stations of canon or forcing pairings. Instead, we've just devolved into a state of complacency, where almost no one takes risks and it's just more of the same. That sort of thing can only hold new readers attention for so long, and then what, they're pointed to stories from 13 years ago as the pinnacle of what we have to offer?

I personally feel like there's still a lot the fandom has to offer with the base canon. I'm just one person though, and I can't write everything. Or even some things.

I'd also argue that the major stations of canon (eg the TWT tasks for GoF or Umbridge and the visions in OotP) aren't bad to use. What is annoying if you make X changes and yet Harry still gets together with Cho under a mistletoe after the last lesson and has a spat over the interview.

** When I got into fanfiction I was in a number of fandoms, besides HP Dark Angel and Alias were the fandoms I was most active in. As those series ended so did their fandoms, which is too bad because with social media being what it is today I think those series would do really well today. I am amazed that great HP fanfiction is still being written, I still get updates and new alerts and I constantly find great unknown fics (thanks in part to this reddit). Without new and decent source material becoming creative and innovative is hard. I remember that a lot of great fanfics were written for challenges (which lead to the formation of tropes) but as the HP only fanfic sites are slowly dying out that can become difficult.

  How can we change this?
#+end_quote

You really can't. Well, not without extremely expensive, both financially and in manpower, social engineering.

Or with new life to the franchise, which is in itself a tough order. I'm personally of the opinion that only a new series of books could achieve this, and /then/ these books would have to have an extreme pull by having some of the major characters be part of it, combined with a huge marketing apparatus. In my mind it also shouldn't be a prequel. We need high stakes, and prequels almost never deliver on that front.

But as I said once before: the HP fandom had an amazing run. It broke records left and right, brought forth some absolute masterpieces and changed the way fanfiction is perceived. There are currently 800.000+ fics on FFN alone.

Eight Hundred Thousand.

Yes it is sad that the franchise reaches the "equilibrium" state. Now it cozies up between Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings and other vastly successful and influencial franchises.

** A netflix series of some sort is most likilly to rignite interest as shows and films that launch tehre are what captures the zeitgeist most. A series of books that get turned into a netflix show about the black sisters is something i would love personally and i think its the sort of thing taht could take off. I'd really like to see Bellatrix Narcissa and Andromeda while they were at Hogwarts and see the inner workings of that complex relationship, how Bella went mad and drifted apart from Andromeda maybe with Narcissa caught in the middle betwen the sister of light and the sister of dark? It could maybe be a bit darker than the core series as we'll be dealing a lot with Bellatrix of course and the rise of Voldemort for the first time? also it would be set in the 60's(if i remember the timeline correctly) and i think that would be a cool era to explore the wizarding world. I think id enjoy it more than the current extened universe stuff with the fantastic beasts films or whatever as it would be UK based again. something about when the FB movies went to america made me lose interest really quickly its such a quintessentially English series, to me anyway, would love to return to that. Think a lot of fans would.

** The thing is that writing something new (eg Harry/Lavender while she is the one entered in the TWT) will get you almost no responses because most of the FFN reader base is not interested in such things. And we are not representative of the overall site populations when it comes to taste and standards.

For example, I've written a HIMYM inspired postwar story and despite tagging the thing properly and posting on both popular sites, it simply got no clicks whatsoever. I had more success with a Hermione/Tonks one-shot, and that is beyond niche pairings. Not even bad reviews but simply nothing. So that idea got shelved and I took it down.

But I agree that most postwar fics go down the (Weasley) family rabbit hole. I read a good point the other day which explains that. Basically "A lot of writers do not want to tell a story, they want to write down their headcanon". You see that a lot with background pairings (a lot of lesbian Hermione stories have offhand mentions of Darry) or children and names:

***** I don't mean to say slice of life is bad, just that I'm not really interested in reading it.

Especially as it relates to Harry Potter where there are a ton of stories that are actually relatively interesting, even if many of them are somewhat unoriginal at this point.

If I wanted slice of life, there are many other fandoms or even romance novels that offer a better setting, especially considering the absolutely *horrendous* selection of innately preferable femslash pairings in the Harry Potter fandom(in my strict opinion, of course-- I'm not saying that no femslash pairings are likable, but there is definitely not very many stories when unique, interesting pairings come along, and a lot of the girls in canon don't exactly have the best chemistry. Fem!harry femslash is probably some of the best stuff out there, and there's not very many fem!harry femslash fics)

Edit: It's also worth noting that I don't watch TV shows like HIMYM or any other long-running episodic comedy TV show, so it really is primarily a personal preference thing.

** I think these things have a natural cycle and this one is reaching---probably not the end, but an equilibrium at least. The original fans are getting older and moving on. Maybe they don't care about it as much, maybe they are too busy with having children and making a living.

I'm not typical (although maybe I am more typical than I think) because I came to it late, had a pretty intense four years of writing it and then made a conscious decision that it was no longer for me. Why? Well, basically the 'greater fandom' (as it were) didn't want to read what I wrote and didn't write what I wanted to read.

This is the only fandom specific forum I use and I'm making an assumption (which may be wrong) that it reflects the wider fandom: but noticeably over the last year or so it feels stagnant. People are asking for the same old, same old, sort of stories. Getting the same old, same old, recommendations. Every week. Every day. Sometimes I think I'm looking at an archived page.

** Part of it is likely that a good chunk of HP fandom had just managed to grow up and not have the time for writing like they did in high school and college. Let's face it, if you "grew up" with HP, you are now somewhere around 30-ish, and likely settling down into a career, a family, etc. It was one thing for fandom to be your big thing when you're working retail to pay for school, and your free time is entirely yours. It's another when you have small people that want your attention, a significant other that wants your attention, office politics to play where no one wants to be the one to jump first and mention that they're in fandom lest they be labeled "that" nerd (yes fandom is becoming way more mainstream. However a lot of "career" path jobs still have a lot of boomers/genx'ers in them and fandom was something that the "weird" people got into.)

So while HP is still popular enough to keep drawing new fans, there's never going to be the huge numbers there were when midnight release parties were HUGE events, and the line through borders/b&n to pick up your copy would snake through every aisle in the store.

It's just not as in the public eye anymore, and what is in the public eye is all crap and just makes people that might start feeling nostalgic and come back go "yeah, but cursed child was a thing that jkr sanctioned. I'm sure fic is just as bad as that these days".

Plus with no new canon to speculate on things are going to dry up. It's never going to be like the 3 year summer, where so many people got into fic because they were thirsty as hell to know what happened next and get /more/. DH ending on such a sort of anti climatic note didn't help things either.
