I am writing up a one shot scenario for a table top rpg. This scenario will essentially entail an extra dimensional Voldemort!Harry that is killing off Harrys in other dimensions. The only ones able to stop him are Harrys. The player characters (PCs) will be playing as a Harry from different dimensions/universes. At the moment I am thinking of using the original Harry and Harry Evans-Verres (from HPMOR) but I need some inspiration for some of the other PCs. I was hoping that [[/r/HPfanfiction]] could help me out with some other prime examples of AU Harry and their fanfics.

Feel free to give me a run down on how this Harry is different in personality, destiny, education, friendships etc.


** Also try A Study in Magic it's a Harry potter Sherlock Holmes cross over.

** Note the following has some spoilers for the two stories I'm mentioning as I explain what abilities each harry would have.

My first recommendation is the harry from A Black Comedy. While its a great story that I would recommend anyway (and I will be unabashed with spoilers here so please read it if you haven't yet), the abilities are as such. He has an affinity for three spells in particular. In a ascending order of skill, they are memory charms (ex. after traveling to a new universe, in order to escape the unspeakables after knocking them out, he performs a layered memory charm that makes them think he was a woman that performed a poor memory charm), fidelius charm (pretty much able to cast on the fly, for example to use as stakeouts for thieving, or inside of malfoy manor while robbing it to avoid getting caught) and finally summon/banish charms, which he as practiced to the point where he essentially has 6 invisible, extendable magical arms to fight with. Add in a ghost animagus form and he is quite the power house (and even though nonjon doesn't exactly fully go into it, I think his concept of what a dark lord actually entails is rather interesting and could have quite an effect on your game, perhaps even giving justification to why only harrys (or if you are going fully with nonjon's interpretation, only certain harrys) can defeat voldemort.)

The other au harry I've read that I'll suggest is the Harry from Faery Heroes. Along with a falcon animagus, he is a master of offensive mental magic (and as a result of this is a bit poor with occlumency). Paired with an understanding of psychology, an invisibility cloak, the invisible nature of imperios, compulsions, memory charms and the like, and a battle turns into a blood bath without anyone knowing he is there. (And after the power boosting accident, he is even more formidable in power). The hermione and luna from this story aren't too shabby either.

*** Wow. This Harry is an exceptional jerk. I do like that his magical focus is not squarely on offensive magic but is drawn more to wandless techniques.

** You could also have creature!Harry:

- there's the goblin-raised Harry (Harry Crow on ff.net)
- the basilisk Harry ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4385420/1/Serpens-Armarum]])

Try also one of the Harry Potter is a girl fics (I'm not good at those if someone could help)

It would make for variety :)

*** Never thought there were any creature!Harrys I will definitely check them out.

I really wouldn't mind a Rule63 Harry, I'm just not familiar with any decent fics. I keep stumbling on Harriet/Snape fics.

**** Looked through the fics I've read and maybe this one will help. Its a girl!Harry where Snape is actually her biological father:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7618752/1/Snape-s-Daughter]]

I know there are also Veela!Harry fics out there if you're interested in creature!Harry but they're usually very M rated and I couldn't name a good one.

Another idea is Harry raised by Dementors: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8569469/1/Raised-by-Darkness]]

Hope it helps, I'll think on it some more in case I have other ideas ;)

***** I could not get into Raised by Darkness. Does the writing (grammar/punctuation) get any better later on? I can push through if it does, but I'd have a hard time reading it as it is in the first few chapters. Cheesy writing I can deal with.

****** I'd have to say no. Sorry. The punctuation is really bad and the phrasing more than often very awkward with missing words and bad grammar (even in the last chapters).

It's a shame because the idea is interesting and there are some funny parts, but I would understand it would deter most people from trying to read it all the way through.

Why the author, who is obviously not from an english-speaking country, didn't get a beta is beyond me.

*** Ok so I have, smashed my way through Serpens Armarum and this basilisk Harry doesn't seem to bad. Besides some of his OP glamour items and the instatant death gaze his concept is workable. Have you read the sequel Serpens Arcanum? In your opinion would it be worth reading for cahracter background?

**** I seem to remember the sequel is not complete anyway and it won't really give you more background info. Basilisk Harry is not all powerful, which I enjoyed, but he has a knack for attracting allies.

** I'd say, confident and sarcastic Harry from one of jbern's stories (The Lie I've Lived or Bungle in the Jungle), it's basically the quintessential indy!Harry. The one from BitJ has warding skills, if that's important (no idea how your RPG is going to work).

Then you could take AK from Dimension Hopping for Beginners by nonjon, but that guy would destroy everything...

*** The concept I am thinking of is not to dissimilar from that of Dimension Hopping for Beginners. Voldemort after kills Harry's parents attempts to kill baby Harry, killing curse backfires. Though instead of his spectre fleeing he is able to latch onto the unintentional Horcrux in Harry. Voldemort grows up as Harry and eventually hears the whole prophecy and decides to kill all the Harrys, everywhere.

Once I have the pre-gen Harrys down I will flesh out some more of the hows and whats.

*** I will be using the [[http://www.voidstarstudios.com/strands-of-fate/][Strands of Fate]] system with some house rules we used during my groups Potterverse campaign. I have found it's a very good system that deals with the amount of spells available without having to go into a great deal of detail. The system is very good for cinematic storytelling while enabling the PCs to effect the world around them.
