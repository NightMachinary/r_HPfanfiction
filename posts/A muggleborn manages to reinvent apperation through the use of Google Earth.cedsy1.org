*** kind of like the book jumper im assuming.

They'd use google maps to help them visualize where they want to go an make travelling longer distances easier, though im fairly certain apparating very long distances is stated to be pretty difficult.

**** It depends on which details you have to visualize. Let's say you want to apparate from London to somewhere on the equator. You use Google Maps to get a good visualization of the city center of Quito, Ecuador (about one mile from the equator) A long distance which may have large power requirements, but that's all you need right?

 

Arguably it's not even close. Does this visualization of surrounding buildings also magically fix height differences between your starting and ending locations? While London is 36 feet above sea level, Quito is 9,350 feet. Being wrong on this point would see you far too deep underground for anyone to possibly rescue you. Or, if you do successfully apparate, that sort of sudden air pressure change will render your lungs useless if you aren't prepared for it.

 

Even assuming you make it in one piece to your destination, there are still other problems. Going from London to the equator means you'd have to near turn yourself perpendicular whilst apparating in order to arrive right side up (and indeed a trip from London to Australia would necessitate going upside down). Also, everything in Quito is moving much faster than everything in London due to the nature of the Earth's rotation (in the same way that the outside of a record is spinning faster than the inside of the record; while they complete one full "rotation" at the same time, the outside covers much more distance than the inside). So you also have to magically compensate, speeding yourself up to match local conditions.

 

You could of course just say it's all magic and hand-wave it away as automatically taken care of. Personally, the way I like to think of it is this. Apparation and portkeys are basically the exact same bit of magic, the latter just applied to an object. The reason portkeys exist at all is that, even ignoring power requirements, apparating farther than anything local is /really very dangerous/ and /ludicrously complicated/. And there is no real reason to do that hard work and take those enormous risks when you can instead take a portkey, made by people whose whole livelihood is based on making those sorts of calculations.

***** I kinda like the idea that all those unpleasant feelings in case of using apparation are due to magic accelerating/decelerating you to match the Earth's movement - and if you overdo it its gonna turn from unpleasant to downright deadly (and the whole process has to take max 2-3 seconds)

Still you could use something like Google Earth to help yourself travel, it's just the apparating across long distances would require making several stops inbetween starting point and final destination (and cross-ocean would be either risky or impossible due to distances)

The portkeys on the other hand don't have a time limit of how long can the journey take, so, while unpleasant, they can take you basically anywhere - and that also gives a good reason for such method of travel to exist (since why would you have portkeys if you can just teleport yourself without use of an additional object?)

*** You can't apparate somewhere unless you can visualize it. It's the one downside of apparition. But with google maps, you could pretty much go anywhere you wanted.
