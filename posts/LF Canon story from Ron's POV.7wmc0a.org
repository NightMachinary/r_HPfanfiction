I haven't read all of them, but I think they fit the requirements (though I think they focus more on Ron/Hermione than Ron&Harry).

  Ron's POV Harry Potter rewrite. Join Ron Weasley as he embarks on a journey that changes his entire life starting at 11 years old when he sat beside a scarred boy with glasses on the Hogwarts Express. This is the Harry Potter series, told through Ron's eyes. Rated T until Goblet Of Fire, now rated M for language, violence, and adult themes. READ AND REVIEW! :)

  Calm, rational discussions have never been their strong point. When a pre-wedding fight shows them that they need to get it together, Hermione suggests couples counseling with an innovative new method. Ron reluctantly agrees, and now the two of them are going to learn about each other in a way never before possible.

  Or, Ron Weasley's Year Six Diary: the whole of Half-Blood Prince from Ron's point of view. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to shake him. Winner of "Best Humour Fic" at the 2008 Reviewer's Choice Awards on FFnet.

** You could try "To Know You Is To Love You." which has Ron and Hermione re-experiencing the canon story from each other's POV. It's a little different and it focuses mostly on the Ron/Hermione relationship, but I think it's really good.
