Any recommendations for fics set in the wizarding world, but independent of the story of Harry Potter (all OCs)? Can be set in any time period. I recently read a story like this and would be interested in reading more. Thanks!


** If you haven't already read it, you should definitely check out linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) and its sequels.

** linkffn(Starnlicht by Marquis Carabas) - a period piece with some modern conceits, it's essentially a private eye story set in 1590. The main character is a witch troubleshooter/gumshoe tracking down a conspiracy that may explain the impetus for the Statute of Secrecy.

#+begin_quote
  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

** My fic seems absolutely perfect for you. It's all next gen and while canon characters are in it, they're not the focus. Have a look. I hope you like it :) linkffn(The Serpent Master)
