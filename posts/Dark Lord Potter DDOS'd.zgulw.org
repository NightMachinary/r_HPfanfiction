** Every time I venture into DLP in search of fics, I come across someone insulting someone else for no apparent reason. Thus, it's probably safe to say this was perpetrated by a disgruntled user.

To this user I pose the following question:

*Y U MAD, BRO?*

*** Hmm, I've usually found the place quite civil. Then again, I've mostly been checking the WbA section these days.

**** I agree. I browse outside WBA, and find the board very civil, as a general rule. Quite helpful too, especially for the aspiring author.

God help you if you're an idiot with an unwarranted sense of self-importance, though.

*** As far as my experience, I've found that most insults on the site are in jest, you probably need a firmer sense of humor.

**** Yeah... everything that went down in the introduction forum was totally in jest. The mods closed it because there was just too much friendly ribbing going around.......

Also, The Hall of Shame?

'Nuff said.

Edit: I have nothing against DLP. Just pointing out why this probably happened.

***** Whatever cuts out the unwanted from the community early. If a rough start is what drives the weak minded away, so be it. If I ran away from hostile attitudes I would never be playing DOTA or constantly hanging out with around half my friends.
