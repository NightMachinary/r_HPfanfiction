I'm looking for Fics where Harry is either Black, or of mixed race. I fell in love with that headcancon on tumbler and really wanna find some fics for it. would prefer longer fics but i'll read anything.


** Try searching â€˜desi Harry' on Archive of Our Own. I can't think of any specific refs right now but I love the idea that Euphemia Potter was Indian. Annerb, a great Harry/Ginny writer uses this headcanon but it's not prominent. Her fics can be found on AO3 and Ff.net

** I actually just came across this [[https://mxlfoydraco.tumblr.com/post/160510522128/i-understand-youre-not-taking-fic-requests-at-the][rec list of POC drarry fics]] on tumblr last night.

I sound like a broken record talking about it all the time, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]] (93k) by waspabi is excellent, and it doesn't go /too/ hard on the drarry if that's not your thing (it's not the main focus of the story, at least).

*** Some people like to see themselves represented in the stories they read. Same rationale behind gay/bi people writing characters as gay/bi, or trans people writing their favourite characters going through transition.

**** I get writing, sometimes I just want the character to have one of my beliefs and I do it if it helps the story. But when reading I never think, oh lets find a fic where the main character is tech-savvy(not that much) black eyed Indian.

***** Interesting! I definitely enjoy reading about characters who are, like me, queer and who have grown up in a stifling guilt-centric heavily judgemental environment (in my case, catholicism). So grateful for everyone who likes writing bisexual Slytherins!

*** In the movies harry is played by Daniel Radcliffe so I feel that at least in my mind harry is white. I just like the idea of him being mixed or other, gives a new feel to harry for me.
