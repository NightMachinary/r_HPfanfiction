Hey all,

I'm looking for some fics where two guys are vying for the love of Hermione. I'll take just about any guys as long as Ron doesn't end up with her.

​

Thanks!


** At first I thought you meant someone trying to beat Hermione in school results.

Not your exact request (obviously), but it makes me think about that...

Couldn't think of a specific fic to recommend, though...
