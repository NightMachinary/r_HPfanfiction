Hey guys.\\
I was thinking most of the fics show how cunning a slytherin can be and how this is dangerous because they every time are plotting something.\\
I want something that show how dangerous for others the impulsivity and the strong emotions of a Gryffindor can be.\\
Can you send me the best fics where Harry's attitude's towards the war is much more radical than in canon ?\\
I want him to be ruthless against the death eaters, eager to use even the foulest types of magic against them, i want a Harry that more than revenge he wants to see them suffering, i want a much more radical and straight foward Harry, in HBP everybody warns Harry that he just needs to let malfoy and Snape alone, that Dumbledore had everything under control.\\
Well im' looking for a fic where Harry would bruttaly attack and harm Draco just because he knew Malfoy Jr was a Death Eater.\\
He needs to be eager to kill and maim his enemies, unlike the order that tends to be more pacifist.\\
I want his Gryffindor impulsivity portrayed in the most dark way possible, like him just getting enraged and attacking Snape(Nothing against him, in reality is my favorite character, but he's the most likely to mess with Harry and in this AU getting something back) or some student in the middle of the great hall, not even caring about the consequences.\\
I want other characters to be scared of him, of what he can do and of how much impredictable he can be.

He needs to be ruthless, radical, Hateful, fanatic about destroying his adversaries by any means necessary and even obssessed with vengeance.\\
PS:It would be a great bonus if the fic exploits how much his obsession and hate are corrupting him and making him mentally unstable.

If the fic has pairings, i don't want him to be with Hermione or Ginny, any other character is ok.\\
Bonus for fics with pairings:It would be good, if the fic has focus on romance, if the girl can make Harry calmer, making he realize that he has now more to fight for than just revenge, and this can bring some of the old Harry back. (This is not obligatory is just a bonus if you gouys foud something with focus on the pairings.)

NO Slash.\\
NO Harem.\\
NO FemHarry.\\
No Dumbledore or Sirius bashing (It's okay with any other character).

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
