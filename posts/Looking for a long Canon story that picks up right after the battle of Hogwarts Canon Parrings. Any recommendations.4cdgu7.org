#+begin_quote
  The Hog's Head is an unabashed romance that follows the lives of Harry and Ginny from the Battle of Hogwarts through the following year. Chapter One, "Faith," begins during the Battle as Lord Voldemort calls his truce. It follows canon precisely but from Ginny's point of view. My own plot, post-DH, begins with Chapter Two, "Anticipation."

** litte0bird and Northumbrian are great. I am not sure how I feel about the James Potter Series. It feels like PS and CoS (a bit childish) over 5 books and doesn't get to dark and serious like HP 4-7 did. But its completely next gen if you are really looking for that kind of thing.
