It seems to me that whenever someone tries to write a pissed off "smart" harry they have him say: "And yes, I do think that." And predicting what other people were going to ask... It is really strating to annoy me. Constantly cutting people off and predicting what they are thinking doesn't make you smart. It makes you annoying!

Why do you think people do that?


** As with all things it depends. There are a lot of valid reasons with Harry that you might represent a character who is "smart" is such a fashion. While I would generally agree that this comes off as annoying, considering the childhood most authors continue to attribute to their OC-Harry, that being one still of abuse and social malformation, it is not too far of a leap that he would act in such a manner. If he is truly smarter (or even just believes himself to be smarter) than those around him, and he has never learned that it is rude to interrupt people, curb his perceived arrogance, or just generally any social skills, he could believably do this sort of thing.

That being said I do not think that most writers, write him in such a manner with this kind of character development in mind. I think that it generally is an ignorance in how "smart" people act or interact with other people, probably colored by their own perceptions and assumptions, that dictates the manner of these conversations. You see the same sort of thing on the opposite end of the spectrum with many author's versions of Crabbe and Goyle, who are often shadows of realistic characters hidden behind stereotypes of "dumb people".

There are authors that understand how to handle these extremes of intellect to make realistic characters that have the depth and complexity that all humans share, Daniel Keyes' "Flowers for Algernon" is perhaps one of the better well known examples of such characterization. However it is rare that you find such well put together characters in fanfiction. If i had to place a specific reason as to why, it would be that many writers of fanfiction are new or developing writers. They are experimenting with the narrative form through the lens of other worlds, and are learning how to build realistic characters, and progress a story. This is not always the case, but that is my take on it.

TL:DR; Writing realistic characters for any author is very hard, be them "smart" "dumb" or even average. Fanfiction author's are generally learning and honing their writing, so it makes sense for this to be something they struggle with and rely on stereotypes to get across their point.
