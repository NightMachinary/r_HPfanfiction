I love (almost) each and every pairing as long as the writing is good. I do wander how the other side lives...


** I'm not too discriminating about pairings any more. Maybe I've been in the past, but years of not finding enough gen stories in this fandom have cured me of using too stringent a filter. Now I read about many different pairings and it's almost never the romance that makes me put a bad story down.

That said, there are some pairings I'm having a hard time understanding. Since I also dislike their most frequent recommendations, it's been a while since I've read any of them. For clarification, that's mostly Harry/Draco, Harry/Lucius or Harry/fanatical-Death-Eater-Azkaban-escapee.

** I really enjoy Harry/Luna or Neville/Luna, Neville/Luna was my OTP for the longest of times.

And I know slash tends to get kind of ignored around here, but I really do enjoy Remus/Sirius an awful lot.

I'm fine with a lot of pairings, from het/slash/femslash to even cross gen, though I'm rather iffy on Hermione/Harry, or Hermione/Draco. Those tend to have Hermione as perfect, and Ron as a complete idiot and jerk, I'm fine with you pairing Hermione off with someone else, but at least have Ron be a good person about it. And if it's Draco, Draco has to be redeemed in order for the story to work for me, I don't care much for Dark Hermione stories.

*** I have a huge problem with Neville/Luna, Mostly that the movie made it canon when Neville/Hannah is actually canon... Also, I can't really see them working well together. I think Neville is way too down to earth and would a) feel uncomfortable with her or b) make her feel unaccepted. But I found myself surprised to ship Tom/Luna for a while after reading "Luna Lovegood and the dark lord's diary", so anything is possible.

I imagine a scene of Neville bringing Luna home to meet Augusta would be epic!

**** For me Luna has a sixth sense when it comes to people, she knows the right thing to get Harry out of his moods, she knew it was Harry when he was under Polyjuice Potion or was it something else? When he went to Bill's wedding, helped him identify the Thestrals, et cetra.

I'd imagine that she'd be able to support Neville, as well, and Neville would support her, even if he didn't fully believe her theorizes or creatures.

Luna is a really fascinating character and one of my personal favorites, I think she's a character who, in the right situation, could get along with almost every character, or maybe not every, but a good amount.

#+end_quote

This is going to be really controversial, but here goes nothing. Firstly I absolutely refuse to combine characters' names and come up with silly sounding, nonsensical words. A slash does a perfectly fine job. Secondly, I'm not a big fan of having only one “true ship”. We are after all talking about fictional characters. And fanfiction. And I simply don't have that much energy or passion to invest in the lives of made-up people.

At first, it was Harry/ Ginny when I read the books and hadn't gotten into fan fiction yet. After I started reading fanfiction it became Harry/ Hermione. Lately, it's been Harry/ Fleur. That's the short of it.

Why Harry/ Ginny? Why not? It is canon after all. And who am I to disagree with [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod][the word of God]], after all? I am simply astounded by the amount of hatred for Ron and Ginny in fanfiction. There is nothing /that/ wrong with Ginny. IMO her biggest "sin" is dropping "off-screen" (or is it "off-page"?) for the majority of The Prisoner of Azkaban and The Goblet of Fire and only briefly appearing in The Order of the Phoenix. And to be fair I still think that what Harry was feeling in The Half-Blood Prince was lust and not love. But those things can be easily fixed with Ginny having more screen time, developing a friendship first and someone sitting down and explaining to Harry the difference between love and lust.

Harry/ Hermione. This one just feels right. Also, the easiest one to write. I think both of those are due to the fact that Hermione is the female that gets the most screen time, is the most developed female character and is close to age to Harry. The downside is that a lot, and I do mean *a lot,* of Harry/ Hermione authors, seem to feel some innate need to hate Ron and/ or Ginny which can be a turn off at times.

Harry/ Fleur. My reasons for liking this are entirely "boyish" so to speak. Harry has had a shit life. There's no going around this or sugar-coating it. Getting it on with the French hottie is the least an author can do for putting him through everything from torture to war and death. Also, Fleur doesn't get a lot of screen time in canon so that leaves a lot of room for interpretation. Plus she's older (if only by three years) and there is something inherently sexy about an older, more mature and experienced woman seducing a shy young boy. (When the boy is at least 16, preferably 17 of course.) One setback to the pairing is that Fleur is often overpowered or too perfect. She's always beautiful (and should be) and smart (she was a Triwizard champion after all.) But she's often depicted as rich and having an influential father. That just stretches the suspense of disbelief a bit far. I'd be very interested in reading about a Fleur who is still very beautiful and smart, but poor and basically has no influence in the French government.

** My favourite is Harry/Luna, which has always felt like it would work in an odd sort of way. Unfortunately, it's hard to find a well written Luna, and even in the cases where she's well written, she's usually not paired with Harry.

So yes, I will read things that contradict it, because otherwise I wouldn't be left with much to read. I do tend to avoid Harry/Ginny and Harry/Hermione, because neither feel particularly right for me, but I don't mind Harry/Ginny if it's well written. I used to like Harry/Hermione but it's been ruined by too many bad indy!Harry fics. I also don't like any of the main characters from canon being paired with Draco or other death eaters, because that is just objectively wrong.

I do quite like the idea of Neville/Luna, but I see it a surprisingly small amount of the time. I guess I'd probably be open to most Luna fics if she's written well.

**** The most common one people throw around is Protection from Nargles, linkffn(7352166). It's fluffy, and fun, but unfortunately the sequel's unfinished. It stands on its own quite well though.

A more recent on is Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary, linkffn(12407442). It's quite humorous, with only short chapters, but it does actually have a plot. Luna's character is well captured.

There are a few other decent stories with Luna in them, but Luna is not particularly like her canon self in most of them. For example, Help of a Seer, linkffn(7548963), or Runemaster, linkffn(5077573).

Finally, there's the Firebird Trilogy, which is a dark AU in which every character acts slightly differently from their canon selves, because of how the AU works. Luna isn't a prominent character in the first book, but she's a main character in the other two. I think that Luna is characterised brilliantly for how her canon character would have acted within the AU that they're in. This is my personal favourite of the ones I've included in this list, because it's so interesting to read a completely new take on the whole series. However, it's notoriously hard to get into it (took me a few tries). I hope that if you try it out, you like it. The first book: linkffn(8629685).

** I do! There are a few fics out there that show why my otp (Harry/Snape) could never work and I enjoy those just as much as the ones in which they do work. I mostly just want to see these two characters interact, so it doesn't really matter to me if they end up together in the end or not, as long as they are IC.

** Yes, I read stories that contradict my OTP, and yes I'm able to enjoy them. However, I have another list of Anti-OTPs (People that don't belong together imo) that I avoid like the plague and don't read those.

My OTP is Drarry. I like Dark fics, I like seeing Dark Harry, I like Harry paired with any Slytherin. As long as the story makes sense and the writing is good. Tons of bad Drarry out there IMO but people like what they like.

*** Did you ever read the sacrifices arc? (Saving Connor, etc...)

I don't really like reading slash (as the main pairing, I just find it hard to relate), but I really enjoyed that one!

There was also the one where Tom Riddle somehow jumped to the 90's and started the death eaters with Hermione and co. There was a side of drarry and it was adorable. Maybe Pygmalion?

**** Yes! The saving Connor story was very interesting. I was hoping for some more internal struggle in Harry's character early on, but I really enjoyed it as well. I'll have to look up the Pygmalion one that sounds cool too!

** It's hard for me to enjoy some stories that contradict my otp, because they're so ooc.

That being said harmony stories are also filled with a ton of bad indy!harry which is also ooc.

**** Frankly it's the only pairing that makes sense unless you completely change one of their characters/personalities.

Or pairing them with an oc.

Or vanilla pairings, but it was done so poorly that just leaves a poor taste in my mouth.

But I'll give you that a lot of h/hr is mostly just complaining about canon, and wish fulfillment.

***** I've never felt that Hermione matches Harry with canon personalities. Unpopular opinion, but Ron/Hermione actually works. I can't really explain why Harry/Hermione feels so wrong, or why Ron/Hermione works for me, but there you have it. I don't particularly like most Harry/Ginny though, because Ginny feels a bit 2 dimensional in the books, and most fanfiction. When an author manages to write a fully fleshed out Ginny, with her flaws and her good points, I can read Harry/Ginny.

But Harry/Hermione just... feels wrong.

****** Depends on how you look at it I guess, reading g canon I think it's clear hermione at least held a torch for harry,

Some perceive their close and understanding relationship as obvious brother/sister in nature, but I feel Ron's and hermiones is much more sibling like how they're always at each throats, but still caring g and protective like ron is with ginny.

To me at least the canon relationships are stilted and forced,
