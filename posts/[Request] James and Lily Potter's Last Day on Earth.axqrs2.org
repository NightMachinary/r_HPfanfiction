As long as it's well-written I'm not too bothered about the details much. It can be angsty or lighthearted. I'd love it if the story just focused on them going about their everyday routine and thinking ahead to their futures with Harry rather than focusing on the impending doom aspect.


** Its not every day routine, but I wrote this one shot based on the night before Halloween (as in, the night of the 30th and early hours of the 31st). It's based on a children's book my mum read to me as a very young child.
