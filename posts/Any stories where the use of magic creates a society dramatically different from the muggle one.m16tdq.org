Like, for example the fashion on the magical world involves -beyond merely clothing articles that are sometimes made with things like fire, water, mist, ice, wood, rocks...- also big body modifications made through transfiguration/charms/potions/alchemy/whatever, sometimes a person just wakes up and feels like going around with their skin blood-red, horns and a few extra eyes, others like dressing in a literal rainbow instead of fabric, or jus harden their skin in an exoskeleton and discard clothing altogether.

Or between divination, time-Magic and the many magical ways of traveling Wizards have a petty non-chronological understanding of time and can't get their heads around the idea of a linear space, to the point that the actual territory of wizarding â€˜Britain' actually only exist four days of the week, includes the ministry and Diagon Alley in London, some forests in France and Japan, a few underwater cities and borders on magical Greece which only actually is on muggle Greece for the school year and then takes a holiday on Mars the rest of the year.

Also, remember seeing an interesting prompt here a few months back about the wizarding world being a post-scarcity society, so let's play a bit with this concept. What if it it's economy isn't centered around using gold to buy things, but in carrying big enough sacks of it to club shop owners on the head and take your purchases? Or there is literally no market at all for basic products necessary for survival such as food or water because anyone can just make their own personal automated farm on any random cupboard on their house which produces daily the amount of food a real farm would in a year?


** Linkffn(Significant Digits) comes to mind. A society capable of curing just about every illness including aging. Where Gold can literally be permanently transigured into existence. It is an HPMOR sequel though. Deals with world scale politics.

Linkffn(unsphere the stars) has a magical state as its endgame.

Linkao3(October) A God!Harry decides to civilize Mars.

Linkao3(The Lady Of (New) Avalon) Has a magical utopia as the endgoal for the protagonists. Still a long way to the end. But the AU Worldbuilding and Magic is unique and has enough depth to consider it a separate culture. Tons of day to day use of magic : from hairstyling charms to magical apparel to gender-inversion rituals to an actual system of Gods and Powers. Also recommend the authors' other works set in the shared AU.

****** Sig Digs is nothing like that. Mostly borrows from HPMOR worldbuilding and themes. Lots of OC's and new terms. So even readers of HPMOR will find themselves disoriented. This is closer to Original Fiction than HP canon. There is even a glossary on the site for confused readers.

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux.

  Avalon is a place of dreams and stories: a land of of faerie queens and knights and ladies, a land of magic, outside of time, where everyone is free to do as they will, and the worthy never die. But the thing is, Avalon isn't real. It never was.To accept that there is no island of knights and faerie queens, and that magic is hardly mystical, is part of growing up.To believe that you can reach it is madness, impossible.But Tom Riddle and Bellatrix Black have never had much respect for the concept of impossibility (or sanity).This is the dream of the Knights of Walpurgis: to build a New Avalon, a Dark Utopia, a paradise of magic and freedom and wonder --- a post-capitalist anarchy where all beings are equals in the eyes of the law, its leaders devoted to their people and ideals, and followed freely, by choice.A journey to Avalon is never easy --- the way is lost in mist: it's easy to go astray.But then, it's just as easy to stumble back onto the path as it is to stumble off of it, and if you're noble and worthy --- and above all, lucky --- the gods will send a guide to help you find it again. They probably won't tell the guide, though. Gods can be arseholes like that.

  (Continuation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) It's easy to make big plans and ask big questions, but harder to follow them through. Find out what happens to Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Hermione, Draco, and everyone else once they grow into their roles as leaders, leave the shelter of Hogwarts, and venture out into a wider world.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

I actually goes into a very interesting world building(with plenty of porn) like how bonds made are the core foundation of the society, its an interesting read and I havent found anything like that world building in another story.
