I am on a Regulus kick and need my fix.

â€‹

1. Sirius Black/Regulus Black: James notices that Regulus and Sirius are more than just brothers on Regulus first night at Hogwarts when Regulus sleeps in his bed. James knows though that Sirius is not with Regulus for his parents approval though. At the end, Sirius asks Regulus to the yule ball in front of Regulus' classmates and kisses him.
2. An older Slytherin student calls Sirius a Bloodtraitor and Regulus says that nobody but him can call Sirius that as that is HIS brother. This all happens in the great hall with everyone watching while snacking on popcorn.
3. The sequel to number 2, Valentines Day is among Hogwarts when a 3rd/4th year Slytherin sings on the table in Great Hall a song he wrote for him and gets made fun of by the same older Slytherin so Regulus attacks in defense then leaves the Great Hall with the 3rd/4th year.
4. Sirius Black/Regulus Black: I think this one is called CatDog where Sirius accidentally hits Regulus with a spell that gave him Cat features and in order to get back to normal he has to complete transformation into his cat form with Sirius Help.
