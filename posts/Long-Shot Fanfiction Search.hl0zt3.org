:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was reading a fanfiction about a year ago that I really enjoyed and I need help finding it. Well, more like I need help finding a specific passage from it, hence the use of long-shot in the title.

I remember it was either a RemusFOC or a SnapeFOC.

It wasn't a one-shot.

The paragraph I'm looking for ended with something like, "nothing beats the serenity of crying on the bathroom floor"?

I have been looking through FF and AO3 for months but I can't find it and would like your help. I know its a nearly impossible task but if that sounds familiar to anyone or if this was somehow about to reach the author, I would really appreciate some help. :)


** FOC?
