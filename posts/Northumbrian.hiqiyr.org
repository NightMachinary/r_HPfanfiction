Does Northumbrian still write? I've just finished all of their stories on AO3 and am craving more/ finished versions of the unfinished works.

I'm sure something in the real world has gotten in the way, but I really enjoyed their writing.


** He did an AMA on the Hinny discord a while back - he is still writing but seems to be drifting away from Harry Potter.

*** They seemed to take Cursed Child badly. They'd spent so long building up their own little world, working so hard to keep it canon and then that monstrosity came about. The way he wrote about it in his profile it seemed to kill a lot of his enthusiasm.

**** Honestly, I don't blame him in the slightest. And frankly at some point it's reasonable to pretend nothing besides the original 7 books is canon, because the more Rowling revisits the stories, the more likely she'll kill a bit of whimsy.

*** I am not sure even about that. His last fanfiction writing was completion of “Strangers at Drakeshaugh” (2018-08-31), and then he wrote non-HP original story “[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3328948/1/Winter-Journeys][Winter Journeys]]” (Feb 20, 2019), and that's it AFAIK.
