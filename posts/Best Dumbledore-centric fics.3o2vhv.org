Give me your best. Ancient, powerful, arcane magics commanded by an intelligent and cunning Dumbledore preferred.


** Depends on your definition of "Dumbledore-centric". I've written two stories where he is quite important.

In "Uncle Quentin's Spy", he gets to cut loose in combat a couple of times, handles politics and intrigue to keep two factions fighting Voldemort instead of each other, and does his best to keep his students safe from Death Eaters, their spawn, and corrupt evil teachers. linkffn(11102515)

He's a central character in "Patron" too, but focused more on leading there, countering a smarter Volemort's plans. linkffn(11080542)

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

********* You are doing yourself, and your readers a big disservice by just abandoning this fic. Please reconsider. I know it's rude to push a writer, especially if he feels he doesn't need to carry on, but please at least think about it. You may not feel it needs more, but a lot of people do. Does that not tell you something?

*********** You've decided to abandon it after positive comments? Well thanks for letting me know not to read any of your other fics. If you just drop a fic for something as petty as someone saying you don't know where to go with it or that people want you to write more, how can I trust you not to abandon any fic at any point? Why would I let myself get invested in anything you write when you are likely to drop it at the drop of a hat?

...really? I find this incredibly immature/petty/ridiculous. A few random redittors complain your fiction isn't complete (which you even admit) you defend this by saying you're done with the fic (but not listed it as abandoned and/or completed), and then this? I mean...what? Just say you want to abandon it, don't blame comments here, because that's a blatant cop out. Call people out on their rudeness if you want, but you control your writing, not us - don't put your apathy to finish this story on them.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.
