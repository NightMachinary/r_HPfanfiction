As above. Realized when I was creating a magic system for my story that this is an important distinction in how I view my magic in the story.

What's your take on this? What makes you so sure of your opinion?


** Magic-as-it-is was created by wizards taming magic-as-it-was-discovered and creating shortcuts to utilize it. Without wands, without magic words and ritual, it would be a much wilder and less well understood thing, but still present in the world. Accidental magic would still happen, but I think modern wizards underestimate just how much subtle systematic understanding is imparted through their learning process that even their 'wandless' or 'wordless' spells are built on the same foundation. They aren't truly using magic-as-it-was any more at all, any more than a computer is using a waterwheel. Without that basis of wand motions and astronomy and everything they learn as a child, magic would be a much different thing.

** Definitely discovered.

** Created.

There's no sensible reason why words in English, German, Swedish, etc. can't do the same as in Latin except it was designed from the beginning.

** Created, I suppose, though that sort of depends on semantics. Magic is a set of laws --- entirely separate, but not fundamentally /different/, from the laws of physics Muggles know. Creating a new spell is figuring out what precise motions and words and intentions happen to tickle magic just right for it to produce a given effect. It's like figuring out the steam engine; the steam engine was always potentially possible, at any point in time, you could pop in a time machine and build a steam engine a million years ago and it would work, but someone at one point had to experiment and figure out how to make one.

*** It's a bit like math in that respect, isn't it? It's all about figuring out the correct formula to arrive at the desired result. The Quadratic Equation was always there, in a way, it just needed someone to figure it out and bring it to light.

** Both. Like physics laws they are discovered and the mathematical tools used to describe them and use them as predictive modes are invented.

** I'm a fan of how linkffn(The Arithmancer) does it. Think of it like this: Magic is always there, whether wizards are using it or not. Magic existed before humans were here, and will exist after we're gone. As for how wizards get new spells and stuff....

Specific wand movements and incantations have direct mathematical expressions, and a spell is basically just a mathematical formula converted to wand movements/incantations. In this way, wizards are able to create new spells by working out mathematic formulas. This also allows a wizard to successfully cast a spell even if they have never seen it demonstrated before (think Harry and Sectumsempra). The reason Harry was able to cast Sectumsempra despite not knowing what the spell did is because he used the proper wand movements and incantation; since the specific wand movements and incantation correspond to specific values/effects, there is only one possible thing that the spell can do.
