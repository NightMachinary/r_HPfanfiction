I just had that experience, not for the first time. All I'll say about said fic is that the pairing was Draco/Hermione/Scorpius (yes, really), and the dialogue got so weird that by the last few chapters, I'd bash my head with the TV remote every time I came across a dumb line.

If for some reason, you want to read it, here ya go [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/503900/chapters/885628]]

Evar had a similar situation with a fic?


** linkffn(Harry Crow)

I don't mean to pile onto the shit robst gets on this sub. Harry Crow is bad, but it isn't nearly as bad as a lot of other fics I've tried to read. It is in fact just good enough that I read it to the end despite not really enjoying it.

*** Impossible for me. Interesting concept, believable beginning (I could imagine Uncle Vernon to drop off baby Harry at first wizarding establishment he finds) but it's just... incredibly long and boring.

There's no real threat for Gary Stu Harry and Mary Sue Hermione, and if there is, it's resolved in like 3 pages. Pretty much everybody is same, boring and OOC without any flaws (except few bashed characters like Ron and Dumbledore for example)

Only characters I liked and rooted for were Rookwood and Bellatrix. Don't know their fate since I gave up around 50-60%

The problem is that he always injects the same (horrible) tropes into his stories, and they're mostly pure fluff. If he were open to criticism and he could change his stories to be quite good.

  Based on The Galactic War challenge by Belgrath on DZ2's forums. During the Battle at the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter is sent to the Star Wars universe. Arriving two years before Attack of the Clones, this is Harry's story as he grows through the Clone Wars and his return home. An eventual H/Hr, it will develop after harry's return. Not sure which genres to call this one.

*** So, reading through this right now, I'm seeing a lot of OOC, which I personally don't mind, unless it's used to make a character functionally retarded (in this case it's Ron), cringy and awkward dialogue, and... I don't know, there's something else that's bothering me. Can't quite put my finger on what.

The prose is like a 6/10--barely passable by normal book standards, but for fanfiction, it's okay.

But I also feel like I have to finish it, if only because it paints Dumbledore in a good light, which is a once in a blue moon event for all the HP/HG, "here's-how-it-really-went" fics.

I think that story had potential but there are some critical flaws.

1. Move the earlier smut to later years. 11 year old children engaging in oral sex is right at the top of my "why the fuck is that here" list.

2. If Harry and Hermione are going to be uber-intelligent and deceiving at least pick decent opponents. Just stop being friends with the Weasley's if you don't like them. You are already memory charming the shit out of Ron anyways.

3. Some more world building for years 1-4. So much critical stuff occurred in those books, it is criminal to neglect that time period in fanfic.

Accusing me of being high or not being able to tell reality from a dream simply because you lack imagination is incredibly stupid of you. However, if you were to say the author must have been high, I wouldn't be able to disagree with your opinion.

Some think the author is a troll, but I like to believe that Tara Gilesbie really was a teenager who loved My Chemical Romance and hated prepz.

 

The premise of the story is that a self-insert of Tara, named Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way, who is a vampire that goes to Hogwarts in England. She has a best friend named Willow, a self-insert of Tara's friend, Raven/Jenny, who co-authored the story. Ebony and Draco are deeply in love but [[/spoiler][Ebony finds out Draco and Vampire are both bisexual and sex addicts]] which turns their relationship into a love triangle with a few other characters thrown in. Tara and Raven had a falling out, so Willow was written off by [[/spoiler][being expelled, murdered by Hermione, and raped by Lupin. Yes, in that order]]

Sybill Trelawney: Professor Tevolry

Dolores Umbridge: Doris Rumbridge/Professor Bridge

Voldemort: Tom Satan Bombodil/Andorson

*The misspelling of names is gold*: "Snap", "Snoop", Snopes", "Dumblydore", "Dubledork", "Dombledoor", "Hagirid", "Darth Valer", "Volxdemort", "McGoggle", etc.

*The sex scenes are... enlightening*: "...[Draco] put his thingie into my you-know-what..."

 

*TL;DR*: My Immortal is a Mary-Sue self-insert fic that should be required reading for all beginner fanfiction writers for what /not/ to do.

[[http://myimmortal.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Alan_%7E_Tyce/Full_text][Full story]] is up to chapter 44

linkffn(6829556) is up to chapter 35.

** I did this for genres. If you can call it that. Perhaps themes or tropes? I read almost every soul bond fic over 40k words, and same with oc/si. Well, I'm currently working my way through the oc/si.

I /love/ terribly written fanfics. If I can't make it past chapter three I get a perverse joy in it.

** There's very few fics that I manage to read in their entirety to begin with. I'm fairly liberal in dropping a fic if it turns bad, or even if it turns boring, I'll start skimming to see if it picks up (usually doesn't). If I see a fic that is draco/hermione/scorpious, I wouldn't even pick it up to begin with, since there's almost no chance something like that can be good to begin with. And that 1% chance that it actually isn't, it isn't worth the mental agony of sifting through the other 99%.

1. It's Draco/Harry slash, and I don't like slash in general.
2. Harry Stu big time
3. Draco is a Veela
4. Veela in this are the incredibly possessive type, to the point where they die if not loved.
5. I still like it.

It's my ultimate guilty pleasure.

*** This is one of my guilty favorites as well. It has some interesting ideas interspersed in it that sort of mesh together to make a beautifully strange trainwreck you can't look away from. Honestly I feel like if the veela parts were taken away from this fic, it'd make a lot more sense; it'd still be a super!Harry trope, but at least then it'd be a much less complicated one.

Still an oddly okay fic for what it is though.

** linkffn(5336173) The Ideal Daughter

The spelling is awful. (I'm not aloud, It's over their, your so wrong)

It's clear the author is working through some teenage issues...

Rose Weasley is sorted into Slytherin! (OH NOES!) Ron/Hermione take it poorly. As do the rest of the family. Rose decides to rebel, Rose starts smoking, drinking, sleeping with Scorpius and gets her belly button pierced. Ron/Hermione (after 5 years or so are coming around to her being a Slytherin) only to find out that she's dating a Malfoy! They immediately cast her out of the family! She responds with telling her parents all of the super-duper rebellious things she's done and leaves. She moves in with the super understanding Malfoys. Ron/Hermione only find this out 2 years later when they attend her graduation! (Because Ron/Hermione would totes not try to find out where their daughter was living...)

And something that drove me completely nuts, beyond the teenage angst plot line, was the author's lack of exposition. Scorpios was her best friend. Okay, so why? What did you do together? Did you bond over your love of gobstones? Did you fight a troll together? Did he teach you a really neat hex? We're the most popular people in the school! Why? You're a bunch of 4th years. You've done literally nothing of note. What made you the most popular? WHY DAMMIT WHY?

Given all of the above, for a teenage writer, I thought it was pretty impressive.
