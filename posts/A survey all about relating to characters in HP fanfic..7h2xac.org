** Not the best-written survey in the world. I think it's fairly clear that this has gone up in response to the slash thread, but it doesn't look like the author has taken on board the comments contained in that thread.

For example:

#+begin_quote
  How important is it that you share dominant personality traits with the main character?
#+end_quote

A fairly common theme in the comments to the slash thread was that many readers distinguish between:

A) Characters having traits they don't have but aspire to, such as being more confident, adventurous, powerful, etc.

B) Characters having traits that they don't have and do not aspire to, such as being attracted to people they find unattractive IRL.

The question doesn't allow respondents to distinguish between these two. Someone who likes to read Harry because they want to have adventures and they're not adventurous IRL would have to answer that it is not important that the main character shares their dominant personality traits, but they may very well still find it important for the main character to share their sexuality.

Another example:

#+begin_quote
  Do you enjoy reading main characters that have different backgrounds to yourself? E.g., different ethnic background, different sexuality, different era. *
#+end_quote

This one seems deliberately engineered to make people who dislike slash look bad. The question is poorly written for two reasons:

A) It conflates all personal characteristics, assuming that they are all equally relevant to a reader's ability to identify with a PoV character. This seems designed to allow people to say "people who dislike slash are racist too!".

B) It misses the core point being made in the previous thread that it's the aversion to the object of the main character's affection which determines the aversion to slash, not aversion to the main character themselves. People repeatedly said that they dislike slash because they themselves are not attracted to men and thus derive no entertainment from a story about being attracted to men. This question seems to completely ignore that point and just reiterate the view that people who dislike slash must dislike it because they dislike empathizing with gay people.

*** Also, the question about the gender of the reader contains stuff that could be considered nonsense. Not too much of an issue in itself (though some people may have ragequit at that one), but when it's added onto the other stuff it's also worth noting.

**** Out of interest, [[/u/kazeto]], which stuff did you think was nonsense?

I'm a transgender guy myself, so it was pretty nice to see trans and cis people being treated equally on the page rather than there being a "male/female" option and then another option for us.

***** Well, let me put it that way: generally, stuff either asks for anatomical gender (male/female/intersex/other), or for mental gender (man/woman/non-binary/other). In this case, because it asks about both, it lacks options, and while I could have answered both of the other possible versions (intersex, though could choose female if intersex wasn't an option since that's the closer one, and for the other one woman), in this particular one I cannot, without feeling fake, choose any of the woman options because if we are being honest then I am neither cis nor trans, if exact anatomy and the exact by-the-book definition matter all that much, but rather in-between those and thus forced to choose the last option, namely other.

And being forced to choose “other” because the author of a survey/questionnaire decided to split answers like that but did not actually cover all likely options feels like being grouped with attack helicopters. I'm not going to raise a fuss about it, and the mention of attack helicopters is only to show how off-putting it feels, but yeah, that feels like nonsense.

PS. And yes, technically I do count myself as a trans woman, but that's ... really kind of not exactly it (basically, counting as a trans woman is less freaky than the full version, and I use that with full knowledge of what the word “freaky” can be taken for here) and if I'm forced to choose something in a survey when the exact state of my genitals at birth is that important then I cannot truthfully choose this option.

****** That makes complete sense! Would have made sense to include intersex, I think, given that non-binary was on there!
