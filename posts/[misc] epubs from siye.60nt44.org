** [[https://fanficfare.appspot.com/][FanFicFare]] - web-based or Calibre plugin. Says it supports SIYE.

*** Can confirm, tried it out. Once you add the plugin, just click on the arrow on the right side of its icon, click download from url and paste the link of the first chapter.

It is a bit slow compared to sites like ficsave though (3-4 minutes for a story vs 30-45 seconds). Of course they don't support SIYE...
