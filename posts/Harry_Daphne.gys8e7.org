**** Might I also point out that it is */the/* gold standard for Dark!Manipulative!Harry?\\
Evil never looks evil, laughs maniacly and murders left right and center for shits and giggles. And Harry in this fic was definitly not a good person... He ends up murdering the head auror so he can advance his own position. \\
The parts about James's rather sick requirements for her body, is just more fuel for the fire. Harry is not a good person. She had no choice since she was born, forced to be the perfect trophy wife, or else. Harry ruthlessly took advantage of the fact.\\
And? She never really had a choice. She ends up with him, not because she loves him, but rather because she has to. Because it his her /duty/ as a pureblood heiress to marry power. It read like a tragedy for me.\\
Daphne was born in a cage. A cage that was encrusted with Jewels, but a cage nontheless.

Next, linkffn(A Champion's New Hope by Rocag) which I also really enjoyed

Finally, a fic that I did not anticipate liking. linkffn(Black coffee, with sugar by Jem Doe). This is a post war fic and has themes of adultery, which I personally find abhorrent, but I could not put this down. I read it all in one go late at night when I should have been sleeping

  Secrets of the war, a murder and a fatal attraction: After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG
