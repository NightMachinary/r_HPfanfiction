After a year and a half of work, I have finally completed my audiobooks of Books 1-5 (all that are out so far) of the Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity!

For those new to Alexandra Quick, it is an entirely new story set after Deathly Hallows in magical America, with fully-realized, complex and diverse worldbuilding that predates and disregards the MACUSA/Ilvermorny worldbuilding of Fantastic Beasts. Alexandra was raised by her Muggle mother and stepfather in the small town of Larkin Mills, Illinois. She has never known her father, but has always wondered who he was. Repeated instances of accidental magic lead to her being given a scholarship to Charmbridge Academy, one of the top four magical academies in the American Confederation of Territories and Cultures. There she meets new friends, makes new enemies, and tries to make sense of a world of magic that, as often as it fills her with wonder, at times seems two-faced and sinister.

Explore Central Territory's Goblin Market in Chicago, the island of Croatoa in Roanoke, the Five Hollers of the Ozarks, Witch's Rock in Dinétah, and New Amsterdam, the capital of the Confederation which hides in plain sight in what Muggles call Manhattan. Meet an entirely original cast of over 200 fleshed-out (and distinctly voiced) characters!

The books total 110 hours and 45 minutes of audio, and are available in podcast form here:

or by searching on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, or anywhere else for Alexandra Quick and the Audiobook Project.

As always, I began this project as a way to learn and get better at what I do, so any comments whatsoever about my performance, production, or any other aspect of the recordings is welcome and appreciated.

Thanks everyone for listening!


** Havent started listening to it yet, but the dedication alone is already worth it. I often let my phone read fanfiction to me but having an actual person do it should be awesome. Thanks for the hard work!

*** I appreciate it. I poured myself into this project. Even redid the entirety of the first book after I'd finished the fourth to apply what I'd learned from 2-4. I'm honestly still processing that it's finished.

** I'm so excited!! I often use the fanfiction.net reader which is occasionally entertaining in how it pronounces words but otherwise pretty dreary. And I was just thinking of doing another Alexandra Quick read-through!

*** Pronunciation is something I coordinated very closely with Inverarity on for this! I had to go back and re-record instances of names that I got wrong at first. Though I declined to do this with Cejaiaqui. I had recorded him as “Seh-ZHAI-ah-kee” and Inverarity told me after the fact that it was “Seh-jee-AH-kee.” His name is all over chapters that are very intense and emotional and I didn't want to re-act that many bits.

** Never read these but they've been on my list. I listened to the first few minutes and was impressed with the production value, definitely looking forward to getting a chance to go through these.

Thank you!!

** I am utterly blown away by your narration and the story itself. Trust me, you are on the same level as Stephen Frye and Jim Dale, at least in the Harry Potter audio world. Keep up the incredible work.
