:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So not too long ago I had a HP marathon on ao3 and read a lot of fanfiction about a lot of different issues. Anyways. I really try to find a specific fic that I just can't remember the name of! Well actually I think it's two separate ones. Anyways.

Sirius is actually Harry's dad. James is cruel to Harry and Lily isn't the best mom either even though she cheated with Sirius in the first place.

I really can't remember if it's the same story the but I think... Harry has a brother who gets celebrated as the boy who lived and is friends with Ron etc.

I think... James has an affair with Rita Skeeter along the way

I hope anyone can help me I'm going out of my mind since I just can't seem to find it...

Edit:

Found the story. For anyone who's interested it's called midnight sun from herald_of_dreams


** Um, that's the general premise of most WBWL stories... J&L are bad parents, Harry's brother's the BWL and friends with Ron... Maybe if you remember more details? Though, if it's the same fic, the affair thing would be very specific lol
