** Copied from my Unordered Top 20 HP Fics: a copypasta.

(The name of the trope you are looking for is Peggy Sue)

O = Ongoing

H/A = Hiatus/Abandoned.

O: Before I read Meaning of One, [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][Nightmares of Futures Past]] was my favourite fic. It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Basically, he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore.

O: Inspired by linkffn(10610076), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922][The Heir Of House Black]]) is another Peggy Sue, however, Harry is born as Turais Black, the elder brother to Sirius and Regulus. If you've read Galleons, it's a far more in-depth version of that, going into the events of each year, that really emulates the mystery of canon. The original characters are memorable and provide interesting parallels to the characters we know. It's just an overall good quality fic.

H/A: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8326928/1/][Three's the Charm]]) is another Peggy Sue, but with the Golden Trio. What I think this fic does best is its characterisation of a Post-DH Ron, who has made a bunch of mistakes and wants to rectify them. And honestly, it's just nice to see how far the kids have come and just /wreck/ canon.

Others not from my copypasta:

linkffn(Oh God, Not Again!)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Bonds Of Time by Vance McGill)

linkffn(Amalgam Lockhart's Folly)

linkao3(Messing With Time by slythernim)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Illusion of Fate)

linkffn(Again and Again by Athey)

linkffn(We Are the Golden Trio!)

linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute)

linkffn(Backwards With Purpose Part I: Always and Always)

**** Hmm. I still enjoy NoFP more than Meaning of One, although I liked both. What they really need is to be continued :).

Meaning of One stands out to me for making Harry and Ginny so united, always having each other's backs (and, well, sharing each other's everything really); seeing that kind of relationship in action is really sweet. Nightmares of Futures Past has something like that, too, because rather than focusing primarily on how Harry's much better at magic due to his future knowledge and can track down all the Horcruxes in a month, it instead has him focusing on his friends, knowing what they need to bring out their potential and build them up. I think that's how it became such a stand-out example of how to write Peggy Sue right; no matter what future knowledge you may have, relationships between people are always interesting.
