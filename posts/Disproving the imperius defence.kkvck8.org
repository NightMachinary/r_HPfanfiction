Ok so I think we've all read those trial scenes when a death eater is asked if the dark mark can be accepted under the imperius. The answer is always no (assuming that the question is not shot down by fudge), and suddenly everyone realises that the obviously evil people are evil. Now, done well this is not something I usually dislike but I'm still left with a very important question...

Why does the answer even matter?

Why would any death eater know if the dark mark has to be taken willingly, it seems monumentally stupid of Voldemort to tell them. And even if he did, what's to say he isn't lying to prepare for the possibility of him being temporarily defeated?

All in all I'm slightly annoyed that the wizengamot is shown as perfectly willing to disregard inconvenient facts, but does a complete 180 because someone (usually Pettigrew, Malfoy or Crouch Jr) says that to the best of their knowledge, you have to be willing.


** I'd even say this : Why would the Dark Mark have to be taken willingly? Think about it, maybe it has slight mind control effects, or it's just a way of seeing who's with Voldemort regardless of reasons and who's still fighting.

** I want to introduce you to linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) because they address and subsiquently fix this problem ðŸ˜Š.

Yes I agree it's completely stupid and for this and a variety of other reasons I think the Ministry is stupid although...not gonna lie, a pretty accurate reflection of the actual British Government who are also fucking morons.

The main fix is generally money and bribery. Most of the Marked people who got away with it were wealthy as shit (Malfoys spring to mind etc) With minimal defence they could bribe their way to freedom based on their status.

The wizarding world is a small community. To be in a position of power you need to support of other powerful people. If you send all those powerful people to jail, who is keeping you in power? Sure isn't that what Donald Trump is doing? Pardoning all his friends? It's not that unbelievable of a thing for politians to do... Turn a blind eye for the sake of power....

  In September of 1971, Severus Snape finds a forgotten portrait of the Slytherin family in a dark corner of the Slytherin Common Room. At the time, he has no idea that talking portrait will affect the rest of his life.

** Intent matters. I can't say as I know much of this subject, but â€˜willingly' is a very vague word under the correct context. The Dark Mark is essentially a tattoo, and if someone who normally wouldn't allow one to placed upon their flesh was held at wand point, in that situation, they would â€˜willingly', or choose to, brand themselves over the ultimatum. The Imperius Curse is, effectively, remote-control mode, where â€˜choice' does not come into play. You may not be willing, but your intent doesn't matter under the curse's effect, as you're not allowed a choice, forced as the â€˜wand point' situation may otherwise be. However, that said, there's a hole in this explanation, by way of one holding the ability, in part, to fight off the curse. If one is able to rail against the effect, then one does, in fact, hold some internal choice in the matter.

** It should be easy to just make each of these Death Eaters take Veritaserum, then make them swear an Unbreakable Vow to never become a muggleborn hater qgain.

*** That vow would be a disaster. Everyone has biases, and everyone has moments of hate. You could be a complete saint and the vow would kill you if you critiqued muggleborns in any form.

Not to mention the sheer power it would give them. Hermione could walk all over Lucius or Snape, destroy their homes, bang their wives and they could do nothing about it because /hating her would kill them/. I've seen fics that unironically used this as a solution and I really hope their authors never hold a position of power over anyone.

**** What I'm saying is that things would've been better in the long run had the Council of Magical Law not accepted the Imperius defense at face value. It'd be easy to figure out who was under the Imperius Curse and who wasn't by administering three drops of Veritaserum to each former Death Eater that is renouncing the Dark Lord at trial. Those who are found to have been lying, make them take an Unbreakable Vow to never become a Muggle-hating genocide worshipper again. Sounds cruel, but it's a harsh necessity given that Voldemort wreaked havoc in both the Wizarding and the Muggle worlds.

Instead, the Ministry bought the "imperius defense" hook line and sinker, and let the renounced Death Eaters resume their former lives. Lucius Malfoy gained a powerful position by making lots of donations to Fudge's campaign. Macnair is employed as an executioner. Dumbledore vouches for Snape, but while good at heart, Snape is still a sadistic teacher and a bitter jerk. Subsequently, these former Death Eaters manage to, on a rather dangerous level, infiltrate the Ministry, playing a long game for the coup in Book 7, doing things like: creating a new generation of Death Eaters like Draco Malfoy and his friends, terrorizing the Muggle groundskeeper and his family at the Quidditch World Cup, and busting out several of the loyal Death Eaters from Azkaban.
