OK, so I know I posted about this earlier, right here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jjs6cn/what_might_an_integrated_wizardmuggle_world_look/]] But I feel my original post didn't say exactly what I wanted to say.

What I want to know is, could the Wizarding world, out of options and out of luck, reintegrate peacefully? How might this be accomplished? Could Wizards and Muggles ever get along?

Would it look more like Star Trek or X-men?


** No, literally it's not possible for them to recombine and not have a large amount of class disperity, hate and problems. Muggles would be mad at wizards, wizards would be mad at muggles being mad at wizards.

** *In Short term* I cannot think of a peaceful transition. Think of protests, violence, rioting and looting that has occurred over last few years. Many of these over petty and frankly stupid issues (having to wear a mask?).

If Magic were to become known - I truly fear the outcome. We would have riots and witch hunts on a global scale, far worse than anything we've ever seen. A wave of violence which will be driven by extreme religious spiel. After all - Magic would undermine all of religion, every prophet, every miracle, every saint, not to mention psychological devastation it would cause for billions of people... One person is smart, can reason and understand, but a group of people? Wild panicky animals!

While some suggest that Magicals could mollify us the Muggles by magical potions and gadgets, solving our global issues - this would be temporary at best. I think witches and wizards would resent very much having to solve all our problems.

*In medium term* after protests and violence have subsided, and brought under some control, it all depends on power in-balance between Muggles and Magicals. Magic users could be caged up in concentration camps, or maybe active state of war declared between the two, or Magicals may have Imperius the shit out of every world leader, or there could be an uneasy truce between them.

*Long Term* however I believe to be very positive outcome for mankind. Think of technological / magical advances, flying cars, interstellar starships, force fields, faster than light travel. Perhaps through gene therapy everyone will have magic... Or perhaps Magicals will be like the Jedi in Star Wars universe. Who knows, but I think there is massively positive potential for humanity as a whole.

** Wizards and Witches would become like the Air Nomads in LOK and/or Alchemists in Fullmetal Alchemists.

Magic would be very strictly regulated, and laws like the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery would be a lot tighter and far more strictly enforced. Not for secrecy, but for the safety of both Muggles and Magicals alike.

There would be societal expectations for magic-kind to use magic for the benefit of mankind (on the positive end of the spectrum) and it is likely that wizards and witches would be discovered at a younger age and separated from the Muggle populace at younger ages than eleven.

As for the actual integration? I recommend coming out of the shadows with solutions to global, Muggle problems (such as famine, homelessness etc.) Something that avoids conflict and politics and firmly cements magic kind as peaceful and helpful.

This would, unfortunately, set the expectation for wizards and witches as a species (and wouldn't remotely ensure zero backlash at their reveal) but it does set up interesting conflicts to discuss in a world Post-Statute of Secrecy

*** In my scenario, the Axis win the Second World War. This is a world where Grindelwald never existed, and German Wizards allied with the NSDAP to oppose communism.

The Wizards help Germany win over the allies, and they also destroy the ICW for allying with the Communists during the war.

America survives the war, though it loses Hawaii to Japan.

Its all based off of a visual novel I've been reading.

I could see the American wizards being all like, 'Hey, you know how Germany was able to win over you all? Well, its because of people like us. But Germany also destroyed our global culture that had existed since time immemorial. We want revenge. We will help you take on the Reich.'

** I don't think it would work out well long term. Just think about XMEN. Only they would be literal witches so there wouldn't be as much of a leap for the worst sort of people to argue about why such people shouldn't live.

** Integration of two seperate yet developed society in this case will be hard. One society has the technology and numbers while the other literally has magic. If wizards suddenly start appearing, muggles will have hard time adapting to this. We fear what we don't understand and it's not possible for wizards to reach each and every single person and alleviate their doubts. Then of course there will be some muggle leaders who will turn this fear to hate.

If it started earlier when wizarding society hadn't developed then it would have been easier to integrate. But now, wizards will be alienated as there is difference in the society rules. That's not even talking about other magical creatures.

Avada is a different story but tell me how will you react when you find out that every wizard and witch is capable of using IMPERIUS, cruciatus, and have access to poly juice potion... Some even invisibility cloak. Worst of all, the legilimens against which muggle have no protection at all.

** I've thought about this and similar scenarios myself for some time, and I agree with those who say it would be impossible to accomplish in a way that could preserve both the culture and structure of the wizarding world and ensure a bloodless transition. HOWEVER! That does not mean it is wholly impossible if one is willing to let go of those two caveats.

In the example scenario given (an alternate earth with the complication of wartime magical purging forcing exposure on magicals), there are two conditions that would influence how the magical world might attempt to continue, if not simply survive:

1. Prior to the exposure of magic the muggle leaders of almost all of the Allies were aware of the magical societies within their respective nations, if not in regular contact with them. These leaders would have to have known about the Statute of Secrecy and how their respective governments worked in order to cooperate with them, so it stands to reason that in the larger and/or more forward-thinking nations they would have drafted emergency plans and procedures to be enacted in the event of a catastrophe or collapse of the Statute. Smaller, weaker or more isolated countries may not have similar plans, but the magicals in them might. In some cases, depending on the magical society, it might seem safer or easier to the magicals to simply take over or establish economic ties with larger allies to protect themselves.

2. The exposure occurred during and after WW2. This is a period of extreme upheaval in the balance of world powers that has not fully stabilized to this day, and a volatile time economically and politically speaking. It's easy to think that the world took time during the aftermath and the Cold War to recover, but the reality is that while the muggle world was indeed recovering quickly, tensions between the remaining powers were as high as they were because EVERYBODY was extremely vulnerable after the war. New technology had invalidated the old way of thinking about war and defense, the loss of life had crippled workforces and industries all over the world, and infrastructure had to be rebuilt from the ground up across the majority of Europe. No matter how damaging adding the variable of magic to that equation could be, it would be the perfect environment to nurture something like a magical renaissance. The powers of the world would be tripping over each other in a mad scramble to secure as many magical resources and alliances as fast as humanly possible, from both sides of the conflict. Remember the Nazi scientist buy-up after WW2? Imagine a space race that took weeks instead of years and a properly funded modern day NASA.

** Industrialisation of potions.

Introduce them slowly with the proper human trials, and get them accepted. Once they've been accepted for medical reasons introduce more variety of short term potions, such as veritasium, canary creams, and hair restorers.

Once it's part of society introduce wand users and enchanted items.

It will be very hard to keep wizarding culture unless they want to go the way of the amish.
