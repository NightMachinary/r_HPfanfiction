As the title says, I'm looking for a fic where the sword of Gryffindor is SPECIAL and not just a high quality sword that absorbs properties to make it stronger.

For instance, something similar to Thor and Mj√∂lnir. The sword appeared to Harry, thus making him 'worthy'. Maybe Godric Gryffindor put some of his own powers into the sword?

Any fics like that out there?


** There are but I don't feel like I can recommend them as they are all typical Indy Harry fics with either bad writing or crappy plot or both

*** That fic always throws me off from reading it because it covers so little (only first 3 years over 700k words if I'm not mistaken?)
