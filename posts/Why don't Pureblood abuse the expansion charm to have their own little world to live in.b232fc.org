We've seen suitcases turn into into magical zoo's (Thank you Mr. Scamender). If Purebloods really wanted a world to themselves free of the wrong blood... Why didn't they just make one? Like, take a closet and turn it into Narnia or something.

  The Ministry of Magic has therefore laid down a strict rule that capacity-enhancement is not for private use, but only for the production of objects (such as school trunks and family tents), which have been individually approved for manufacture by the relevant Ministry Department.
#+end_quote

Ministry restricted it because it's too easy to break the Statute with it. [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/extension-charms][Pottermore source.]]

It's also not that easy to cast, according to Hermione in DH:

#+begin_quote
  "Undetectable Extension Charm," said Hermione. "Tricky, but I think I've done it OK; anyway, I managed to fit everything we need in here."
#+end_quote

I can't imagine it being that simple to create a whole, self-sufficient world inside a suitcase or tent. Sure, it would be possible for 1-3 people to live inside an expanded tent for a few years, living off preserved food, but that's different to transferring a whole society into a magical space and expecting that all of them will have everything they want inside, without ever thinking about leaving the place to eat freshly caught fish and chips or watch a Celestina Warbeck concert.

*** Ok I genuinely had no clue it was restricted... Though how that broke the statute of secrecy in anyway I don't have a clue... A simple notice-me-not charm would likely prevent anyone from seeing you walk inside a suitcase...

​

Your point on the other hand is definitely fair, but honestly, if I was a wizard, I wouldn't mind having to go outside every once (Having to do so every few years makes it easier) in a while to get food if it meant I could use as much magic as I wanted when at /home./ And I wasn't really suggesting an entire society go into the same magically altered space. More that if they really wanted the freedom to do what they wanted, they could've easily got it... Sure it's a tricky spell but no one ever said they had to /make/ it themselves, hell even if they were capable of doing so, I could still see them paying someone else to do it anyway. And I doubt it been illegal to do would stop potential/confirmed /Death Eaters./

Some extreme purebloods might see the appeal in further isolating themselves into a subset of mainstream wizarding society, but I think you've misunderstood or simplified the Death Eaters' real agenda. It's not just that they "wanted a world to themselves free of the wrong blood", like you stated in the OP. Their ultimate goal was to be the top class in the wizarding hierarchy, with everyone else second-class citizens that they could rule over. That doesn't exactly work when there /is/ no second class to hold power over.

***** Can we all just appreciate the fact that at least /one/ Slytherin /(Regulus Black)/ acted the way a Slytherin /should./ Ie, he kept a low profile, did what was expected and at the end of the day came closer then anyone else to getting rid of a Horcrux during the first war. Right under Voldemort's nose. Sure he died at the end of it but what a hell of a way to go.

***** Hmm. I'd always thought it was because they /felt/ like they were the second class citizens instead, having to hide and all for the sake of another race? The whole wanting to rule over muggles been a side-effect of them feeling like they'd been limited/controlled by something they considered to be inferior, for hundreds of years.?

I'll be honest, you telling me that theres a restriction in place to stop them from having their own little world did give me some sympathy for them. But finding out that their main desire was to rule over muggles, for the sake of having proof they were better then them... Yea... That kind of kills said sympathy.

​

...

​

Still, the whole rule regarding expansion charms definitely rubs me the wrong way, I feel like it's an unnecessary measure made that heavily limits wizards and witches and why? Because there's a small chance someone could see you entering your trunk... I reckon the magical world would progress a lot more if people were allowed their own private 'laboratory' where they could practise without worry of others been affected, whether magical or not.

If I and likely most HP fans, found out I was capable of using magic, I'd want to use it as much as I could. Naturally, rules in place meant to stop a potential society meltdown, at best, would definitely be something I'd agree with... Atleast until finding out I wouldn't even be able to use magic in my own little *private* world, something that, while might be difficult to create, is still /possible./ The ministry's regulation on it is utterly pointless as the reasons behind it can easily be bypassed by entering and exiting said world in a magical place. In essence, instead of limiting the entire concept, they could've simply made it illegal to enter said worlds in front of muggles. Instead they outright banned it.

​

...

​

Though that still doesn't explain why they didn't just make a private world anyway and simply imperius a few muggles into sating their ego.

Maybe they did, but you never saw it because it wasn't relevant to the books or Harry's own perspective.

There are a lot of finer details in the series that are handwaved as "Harry didn't pay attention to it", like how wizarding government, culture and demographics, or Gringotts currency exchange rates work.

*** But that makes no sense, why isn't there a magical block of flats in diagon alley, where each room is just a tiny cupboard expanded to the size of a mansion? Not to mention the fact that wizarding homes are already pretty blatant and isolated, indeed the Burrow would likely be less suspicious if it was a small building that's much bigger on the inside than its canon shape.

Muggles would need to really pay attention to notice that too many people are in that little house or that they can't seem to see all the inhabitants through the windows, whereas a big, definitely-not-structurally sound building is suspicious at a glance.

Then there's the fact that magically hiding things is clearly possible, Muggles can walk right past the leaky cauldron without seeing, so just do that to entrances. I suspect that any private residence would get far less foot traffic than the county's biggest shopping district.

** Why don't white supremacist just create their own closed white-only communes and retreat there? /s

Purebloods who believe in blood purity don't lack the space to live, they feel that they are naturally superior to non-purebloods and should be at the top of the pecking order because it's their birthright. Why should THEY be the ones to retreat in the trunks when it's mudbloods who must learn their place?

Also the Death Eaters were extremists, I doubt majority of prejudiced purebloods wanted to be "free of the wrong blood". They just hired/promoted purebloods over more qualified muggleborns, bitched about "dying magical culture and traditions" at the tea parties and voted for restriction of werewolf rights because "those are dangerous beasts, am I right? Think of the children!"

** For that matter, why doesn't the Ministry utilize the expansion charm to further protect the Statute? For example, what if the entirety of Diagon Alley is a pocket space inside the back wall of the Leaky Cauldron? No people flying over and seeing it, no people wondering why the street widths don't match up, no people remodeling and suddenly finding a new access place. It's all inside the one pub, and it's linked into a strong power source so it's stable.

Anything in canon that contradicts that idea? The only bit that seems far fetched is Gringotts, but I wouldn't be surprised if Gringotts is actually not in Diagon Alley and only links in via their store front and they have their own system of hiding.

***** I mean, they already do live in a seperate world from muggles. If they're willing to put up with living like that then simply creating another world for Pureblood's only should be possible for them, blood purity seems to be one of, if not the most, important reason to them. Why start/join an entire war when the much easier solution is to essentially form another 'Hogsmeade' but for Pureblood's only? Sure you can say it's restricted by the Ministry but I don't think one law is going to stop them from attempting it anyway.

Said Pure-bloods likely don't care that much about the muggle world, their main issue is having to follows laws created for the sake of muggles and later on muggleborns, essentially making them feel like the Second Class citizens. In essence, they don't have a place they feel like they belong in, especially with the number of muggleborns rapidly increasing and effectively taking over the part of the world that's supposedly theirs.

** Who says purebloods haven't done it? Many of them seem to regard laws as optional. Which I fully support, the Ministry mess up laws just as well as they mess up everything else.

One thing I don't like with expansions charms in fanfiction, many authors seem to regard them as stackable. Too many authors give Harry a trunk with an expanded compartment, and then let Harry shrink the trunk and put in a pocket. In my headcanon expanded spaces are unshrinkable, and shrunken objects can't be shrunk further or placed in an expanded space.

I don't remember how expanded/shrunken spaces were treated in canon, but I think that combining two (or more) space-changing charms makes everything too easy. Want to move? Just shrink everything and put it into boxes, shrink the boxes and put them in a trunk, and shrink the trunk and put it in your pocket. Too easy, lazy writing, and makes for boring stories. Magic really should have limits, unless you're writing a power-wank story.

*** I don't have much to say regarding the first point as I frankly completely agree.

Regarding the magic having limits in order to avoid a power-wank story on the other hand... I see it this way, putting limits in your story only limits your creativity. At the same time, if you don't have limits, all you'd need to do to avoid said power-wank story is make sure the villains (Voldemorts /Death Eaters, not Voldemort himself)/ Are scaled properly.

Ie; If Harry Potter/OC is capable of pulling off powerful magic then anyone with years worth of experience over him is /capable/ of doing it to. Basically, if you want to have a powerful main character, then make sure that the bad guys are scaled to the same extent, even a genius prodigy child shouldn't be able to match a wizard/witch that has, at the very least, a decade of experience over them (Under normal circumstances at any case). Which honestly shouldn't really be that difficult considering around 70% of the competent wizards and witches in Britain are on Voldemorts side.

Tl;dr you want a powerful main character? Then don't pull a canon by having a wizard capable of successfully infiltrating the bloody /Unspeakable/s get beaten by *Hogwarts students*...

It seems too much like cheating, and was clearly one of the things that was only added in as a Hollywood gag. I see this crap as being what explosions are to action movies. Unrealistic, unnecessary, and entirely exaggerated.

As for the question itself - movies and plausibility aside - the purebloods would want their own, real space for much of the same reason why black nationalists, for example, won't just "go back to Africa", or (perhaps more relevant) why people want to find an actual partner and spouse instead of VR porn, or why people hate faux-meat: because it's not real, and that makes all the difference.

** My headcanon is that the charms themselves are temporary and not only need to be recharged prior to exhaustion, but the act of recharging it slightly degrades the charms, making them need to be recharged again sooner. So, a Wizarding Tent created to last five years could be recharged magically just before it shrinks, but then it would need another recharge in four years to keep it going, then three and a bit and so on, until it is needing to be recharged constantly in order to maintain it.

As Hogwarts is so magical in nature, its very structure would allow for the use of space expansion charms on a permanent basis, since they are being constantly recharged. It would also go some way to explaining the way that the interior layout seems to change slightly throughout the films.

Trunks, being smaller and more solid, allow for variants since they will be mainly used in high-magic areas, allowing for passive recharging.

I'm probably wrong, but from what I've seen, it would make sense.

*** Still, having to recharge something every few years shouldn't be too difficult. It's a pretty small price to pay when you consider everything, and even then, there's no actual cost besides the time spent on it (And the initial cost of buying it in the first place). And should it become a nuisance, IE having to recharge it once every year or less, then they could simply buy a new tent. The fact that they don't bother to /even/ try create their own little world, if only to, at the very least, get a glimpse of a 'Pureblood world' is the first issue I have with them. Each Death Eater might have had their own reason for joining Voldemort but the the fact is, even with all of the available options (If pseudo-Immortality is possible then frankly anything is at that point) that would give them the world they craved, they decided to go for one of the only options that could/would result in them been sent to Azkaban...

Regarding Hogwarts, I completely agree with you, honestly, the fact a /Basilisk/ managed to survive there for a thousand years is enough proof.
