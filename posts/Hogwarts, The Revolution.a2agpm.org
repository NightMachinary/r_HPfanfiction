Hi guys!

Sorry for the dramatic title (not really). I'm looking for recommendations of fics set in 5th year. I'm specifically looking for fics where Umbridge sort of causes a revolution from Hogwarts residents. I know that more people that Harry were affected by her so I'd like to see them rise up and band together. I want to see people being proactive. If the adults are proactive and being clever, that would be even better.

It can be any type of revolution - pranking, political, violent, crazy, downright !crackfics.

Let me know if anybody has read any good ones.

​

Thank you!


** The secret language of plants series is honestly one of the most affecting takes on the Harry Potter series I've read in a good long time. In this fanfic series, during 5th year, Harry gives Draco a book by Karl Marx. A few books by Foucault later, he becomes somewhat like the wizarding world's Robespierre. The rest is 20th century European history. Relevant excerpt:

#+begin_quote
  “House pride means nothing!” explained Draco in very loud whispers while he repeatedly hit the Slytherin badge in his robes. “All I'm saying is that the house division is merely a mechanism imposed by the super structures to keep the lower classes, that is us the student body, unable to unite and demand more rights.”

  Crabbe and Goyle were completely lost, but Zabini and Nott were listening and nodding their heads.

  “They are forcing us to compete to destroy any semblance of solidarity, all so they can exercise power unchallenged” Draco went on.

  “I told you to keep quiet during study hour, Mr. Malfoy. Ten points from Slytherin” said professor Willington as he walked down the tables of the Great Hall.

  It should have ended there. Nothing more than a murmur between a few students. But then Draco abandoned the language of his readings and said something easy to understand and memorize.

  “But that's just it! Don't you see? It is just a symbol of their ill acquired domination!” Draco had a feverish look about him. It was so clear to him! “The point system is a lie!”

  Which even Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs could comprehend. The points meant nothing. They didn't even hand out a special gift to the house that earned the House Cup at the end of the year. Hurray, you won, you are better, look at his cup behind the glass. That was it. It was just a system to enforce discipline and avoid unionizing by turning the +working class+ students against each other and stopping them from confronting the teachers.

  All this was explained later, while in the middle of a lecture of History of Magic. As long as you didn't speak louder than Binns, you could do whatever you wanted there. Like indicating to your fellow classmates the absurdity of the house rivalries and how it benefited the governing powers.

  Harry wasn't sure how, but he suspected he had been the spark of the change that came over the school, even if Draco was the engine. He was actually quite pleased and a little bit scared because the next time a Prefect took points from someone breaking the curfew, the student, a stressed Ravenclaw that had been studying nonstop for the NEWTs, laughed in his face like a maniac.

  “The points are a lie” said the girl, half laughing and half screaming. “I can stay outside if I want!”

  “Miss Turpin, I must remind you-”

  “You have no authority over me!” she seemed surprised and elated. “It means nothing.”

  “Miss Turpin you are not making any sense.”

  “Exactly, Roderick. It doesn't make sense. We produce the points with our conduct. Whether you choose to acknowledge them or not is irrelevant. The points belong to us. Ahahaha!”

  The stupid hat was stupid and refused to help Harry. The whole school and its division in houses was stupid too, and the teachers.Harry was in Hogwarts, but he didn't want to be. He wanted to go back home.
