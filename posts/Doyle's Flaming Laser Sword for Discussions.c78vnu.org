Named after Arthur Conan Doyle. Coined by Indian Fanfiction Reader Surbhit Srivastava in a Reddit post of the same title.

It states that anything that cannot be settled without resorting to Doylist explanations is not worth discussing in the first place.

/Has anyone anywhere ever felt any amount of satisfaction by a Doylist explanation from a smartarse who thinks we didn't know it ourselves?/


** I had a similar realization a while back. My version of it is posted [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15846651][here]].

tl;dr:

  To all those who claim in argument that 'JKR is a bad writer' or 'this plothole is explained because the story started as kid-lit and then tried to grow up', I have to ask... did you first sit down to play Monopoly and complain, "Why would I pay to visit other people's houses when I rent out my own?" It's a game, doofus. If you think it's irredeemably bad in concept, design your own.

*** Well, color me impressed. You put my thoughts into much more kinder and equally clear words.

You should be able to transfer karma rather than all this award business.
