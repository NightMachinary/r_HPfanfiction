Fics, where the wizarding world discovers that there was a reason house elves, were bound as servants, goblins were restricted to being bankers.

For e.g, House elves were bound because they were a bloodthirsty race who were themselves seeking to enslave humans, and after being freed, they return to their former attitudes, and modern wizards having no idea how to defend themselves against elf magic suffer huge defeats.

Edit: It seems that my post makes it look like i condone slavery. To be clear, I don't. The elves revert to their bloody selves mainly because of the way wizards have treated them all these years. Also my prompt doesn't only consider elves. There are countless other species in the Wizarding world. Goblins, Centaurs, Dwarves, and what not who aren't slaves, but are nonetheless oppressed.

The premise of my prompt lies in the possibility that any of these species decides to revolt when the Wizarding world is most distracted; the second Wizarding War. Of course there would be factions within their ranks advocating for peace (think Dobby and Firenze).


** Wouldn't this essentially say that the bigots were right? Also has some problematic connotations for condoning Slavery.
