It wouldn't be inaccurate to say that Harry has a badly behaved Rabbit. When Ron and Hermione explain that to their Defense Professor, Remus Lupin... he jumps to the wrong conclusions, having used that excuse for something entirely different in the past, and assumes the same is true for Harry. Even introducing the Rabbit to Lupin makes him think it's a coverup.


** I like the idea of the trio noticing Crooks chasing Scabbers but leaving Hedwig alone and possibly reaching the right conclusion early/ otherwise deciding something is up with Scabbers

*** It's a dig at the metaphor that (not sure if fanon or canon) was used for Lupin's lycanthropy, they said he had a badly behaved rabbit. Harry ACTUALLY having a badly behaved Rabbit, but when it's mentioned, Lupin thinks Harry is a werewolf and covering it up.

**** I think in canon the typical excuse was that he was sick. I don't recall the rabbit excuse.
