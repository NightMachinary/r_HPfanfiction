SO. It's a time-travel, back to the maurader's era thing that involves Draco and Harry.\\
Basically, it goes something like this:\\
Harry goes outside during the Hogwarts battle, before he sacrifices himself and before Snape dies, just to think I guess. Draco ends up appearing a little later under a disillusionment spell or smth, and Voldemort appears with a weird ass spell-maker death eater, and tells him to "do it". One spell later and weird deatheater #1 shows up and he explains that the spell did NOT in fact send Harry (and draco but shh) 200 years back in time, but only twenty. Someone else appears, named Charles, i think, and Voldemort gets pushed back by Hogwarts and the other Professors appearing. Snape confronts Aries, the weird deatheater, and Charles, and they agree to meet somewhere else? A little later Aries is explaining that yes, he's harry, no, he did not die. Draco and Harry were sent back into the maurader's era, both are gryffndor's, and they're kinda weird for gryffindors. There's more but I'm really fricken tired and it's like... moderately long
