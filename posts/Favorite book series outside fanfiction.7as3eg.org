I'm curious if we as a group have similar tastes for other literature as well, I assume that we will.

I feel like I'm out of fanfiction that grabs me at the moment, just finished reading the Pureblood Prentense, which I enjoyed immensly.

My favorite is the Dresden Files series, Jim Butcher really takes the world building to the next level in it. I listened to the audiobook for it, James Marsters narrates and brings it to life amazingly well. The fanfiction crossover of linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) is also spectacular.

Currently I'm listening to Mistborn by Brian Sanderson and am enjoying it as well. It's on the darker side as far as the world goes, but still comes across as fun.

Have any recommendations, fellow readers? Any piece of fiction is acceptable, fanfiction based on other works, stand alone novels or series, anything you have enjoyed!


** I cannot believe this hasn't come up yet:

Wheel of Time, by Robert Jordan, finished by Brandon Sanderson. Epic fantasy in the best way. Some of the tropes are a little cliche but they're done well all the same. I read this series about once a year.

*** I enjoyed the Wheel of Time a lot. It's definitely one of the best Epic fantasy series out there. Quite possibly one of my favorites.

But I can't imagine rereading this series every year. I rather doubt that I'm going to reread it /ever/.

**** Each to their own. I started reading it when I was 12 or 13 and there were only 8 or 9 books in the series. Given how long it took for the next books to come out, I ended up going back, rereading, and catching so much that I missed the first time. Rereading every year is probably out of the question for most people (especially if your reading speed isn't insane) but it's definitely worth reading a second time just to see what new stuff you catch.

** Anything written by Trudi Canavan -- Although I've not yet read the Millenium Rule trilogy, I've read everything else by her and feel confident in saying all her works are great.

The Invisible Library series by Genevieve Cogman -- I've only read the first one in the series (three currently published, fourth due out next month), but it was brilliant and novel.

Discworld Series by Terry Pratchett -- It's Discworld. What more do I need to say?

/Good Omens/ by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman -- Great fun.

Old Kingdom series by Garth Nix -- Necromancy, talking cats, saving the world from the dead, all good shit.

Bartimaeus series by Jonathan Stroud -- Demons! Personally I find Nathaniel dislikeable, but Bartimaeus more than makes up for him.

/Every Heart a Doorway/ by Seanan McGuire -- Short, but a good story about kids who've been to other worlds, come home, and want to get back.

Midnighters trilogy by Scott Westerfeld -- About a bunch of kids who have special powers during an hidden extra hour at midnight that only they're aware of.

/Graceling/, /Fire/, and /Bitterblue/ by Kristin Cashore -- Graceling introduces a world where some people are born with a natural affinity for a particular skill. Really interesting, good stories.

Nightside Chronicles by Simon R. Green -- Urban fantasy set in an underground London. The books are a little on the short side by fantasy standards (only average 70k), but they're a good read.

/Six of Crows/ and /Crooked Kingdom/ by Leigh Bardugo -- Group of misfits perform a heist, also there's some magic.

A lot of people say that Stormlight is his greatest work and while fantastic, Mistborn will always be the series for me. Mistborn isn't over either, there is more on the way (although it's set later and follows different characters).

You should check out any and all of his other work, especially stuff within 'Cosmere', which essentially means it will be set in the same universe as Mistborn, each series will be on a different planet or in a different time but there is things that connect them, including certain characters that pop up in multiple series (including Mistborn, keep an eye out!)

** I loved "His Dark Materials" (The trilogy that started with The Golden Compass) by Philip Pullman. I've heard it described as The Chronicles of Narnia, as written by an atheist - which I found to be pretty on point. Much less "follow the rules of God/Aslan", more figure things out yourself and from the people around you. Supposedly there's going to be a prequel series coming soon.

Also, the Culture novels by Iain M Banks - if I could choose a fictional universe to live in, this wins no question. The novels deal with a post-scarcity utopian society's interactions with their neighbors, who generally aren't. If you're into hard science fiction, I'd heavily recommend the series.

*** The Inheritance Cycle is basically just published fanfiction though. And most everyone enjoys Worm fanfiction because cool powers are cool, curbstomping and PHO reactions are fun, and despite what people may claim, grimdark can really wear on you.

Edit: Made clear that second sentence was referring to Worm, hence the mention of PHO, and the "cool powers are cool" refers to the popularity of Alt-powers.

Edit 2: Apparently I can screw up an edit, replaced a "Worm" with "PHO".

Yeah, I hate the sentiment that "only grimdark is good" - it's often said to be real, but reality isn't all bleak. Sometimes you want simply plain fun when reading, so with this I really agree with you.

Inheritance Cycle isn't /just/ fanfiction, Paolini has added loads of own material, and put a unique spin on a lot of things. Yes, it is less original than Star Wars was, or Harry Potter - but it still isn't quite in the realm of fanfiction.

And also, Eragon does have formidable opponents at times, the Shadow of the first book was quite scary when I read it the first time. It had its flaws, but I found it plenty scary when I first read the book (when I was 13 or 14), and even when I recently re-read it it wasn't that bad.

The end was a bit shitty, but it wasn't /as bad/ as you make it seem, even though the Inheritance Cycle is far from a flawless work. I think it's somewhere in the middle.

** My absolute favourite novel is War and Peace by Tolstoy. Characters that feel as alive as if they were real people, a fascinating historical background and a bit of philosophy here and there. What else would you want. Anna Karenina is great too.

I also very much enjoy ASOIAF. A very complex plot driven by multi-faceted characters in a world that is phantastic, yet life-like enough to feel real.

Oh and then there is The World of Yesterday by Stefan Zweig. It's probably the book that had the most significant impact on me. It's the memoirs of a writer whose adult life spanned the first half of the 20th century, with all the radical changes in society and the historical events that shaped it. Zweig was a very cosmopolitan person who suffered a lot from the nationalist divisions the World Wars and the rise of fascism brought.

**** I was replying to another comment when the word "French" caught my attention. I realize now I read mostly English novels in their original language, but there are some French books that ought to be more popular. * /La Passe-miroir/ is a fantasy series that is so original and refreshing. The story world is fascinating, as are the characters. It is all so crazy and grotesque but in a familiar way. * /La Horde du Contrevent/ is a brilliant sci-fi standalone novel. Another fascinating read, for other reasons, but it is also very unique. A fantastic journey. * Pierre Bottero's trilogies, and in particular /Le Pacte des Marchombres/. Most of his writing is for younger audiences, but he has such a distinctive writing style that it can be enjoyed by anyone. The first trilogy set in this world is /La Quête d'Ewilan/, but it is the most ""childish"" one. Still enjoyable, but /Le Pacte des Marchombres/ is by far the best in my opinion. A compelling read about the evolution of an iconic character. They are also adapting his novels as comics, and they are really good.

As for non-fantasy books, I also love Jean Anouilh's version of /Antigone/. It is a play I studied in middle school but I absolutely loved it and still do. Victor Hugo's "Le dernier jour d'un condamné" or "The Last Day of a Condemned Man" also had a huge impact on me, as a plea for the abolishment of the death penalty. Way more recently, I read François Bizot's /Le Portail/ in which he recounts his being imprisoned by the Khmer Rouge during the fall of Phnom Penh in 1975.

** If you liked the pureblood pretense, you'll probably like Scott westerfeld's steampunk YA leviathan trilogy about an AU WW1.

I liked The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms recently, sort of a politics/mythology fantasy series, heavy on the world building and characters.

Robin McKinley is one of my favorites- her award-winning series is The Blue Sword/ The Hero and the Crown but I also loved her /Deerskin/, a fairytale retelling of The Coat of Many Colors. The original story is about a widowed king who falls in love with his daughter & how she escapes from him, so it's heavy material, but the second half of Deerskin features the princess surrounded by incredibly charming and loving characters while she gets back on her feet. Happy, cathartic tears abound.

** While I too am a big fan of the Dresden Files (and also Codex Alera--God bless Jim Butcher), I would say my very favorite series is /The Grimnoir Chronicles/ by Larry Correia.

To briefly summarize the first volume, /Hard Magic/:

It's 1932.

For the last eighty years, there has been magic. One out of every hundred Americans has magic, and one out of every thousand is called an Active, who has control over their magic. While America suffers through the Depression, Japan is led by a warlord known only as the Chairman.

A man named Jake Sullivan has the Power to manipulate gravity. He's a private investigator, a war hero, and an ex-con. Under a deal with J. Edgar Hoover, Sullivan helps the Feds catch renegade Actives who use their power to kill. One mission goes bad, and Sullivan finds himself beaten by a team of Actives, wearing strange rings, who claim they're protecting other Magicals. Humiliated and chastised by Hoover, Sullivan wants answers. And he's done working for the feds.

Meanwhile, on a dairy farm in California, a farmer tries to train his adopted "granddaughter" how to use her magic, the power of Teleportation, safely. One day, a car drives up, four men get out, and their leader, a one-eyed man, guns him down. The farmer manages to give his granddaughter a small bag before he dies. Inside the bag is part of a piece of a Tesla weapon and a ring, along with a piece of paper with names and an address.

** *Toaru Majutsu no Index / A Certain Magical Index* - Long light novel series about conflicts between Academic City, a location where cutting edge technology is pioneered and kids are artificially made into psychics and various magical organisations.

Or at least it seems so at the beginning. Truth is much more complicated. There are plans, plans within plans and plans within plans within plans, and our heroes are only pawns in all this.

The main series is currently 40 volumes long and there are book side stories and manga side stories and they can be pretty relevant to the main series (and there is anime-original stuff which semi-canon too), especially considering that the whole book is Chekov's Armoury. For example, the description of a certain character's look is foreshadowing for something that happens over thirty volumes later.

The author has a hard-on on mythology and esoterics and did a crazy amount of research on it (there is a lot of stuff taken from Gesta Danorum for example in regards to Nordic gods) and he created wondrous, though often bullshity symbolic magic system.

Uh... I kinda wrote too much on this, so I'll limit myself with the second one.

** The stormlight archive series by Brandon sanderson has to be mine. It's incredible. Probably the best worldbuilding I've read and the payoffs throughout the book are just wild. Definitely check it out if you're a fan of mistborn, I've read both the series and I'd have to give stormlight the edge

** LotR, Old Kingdom series by Garth Nix, His Dark Materials, OUTLANDER -- 8 main books with a ninth coming soon, crossovers, as well as the series on Starz. Those are the series I return to most often.

Edit: oh, and ASOIAF for sure. Definitely seems to be a lot of similar tastes between us HP fans.

** Im actually a sucker for the dragonlance series, specifically the Legends series featuring Raistlin Majere. I love his character.

Mistborn is the shit, as is most anything by Brandon Sanderson. Also Barry Lyga's I hunt Killers series is off the chain.

The Dark Hunters is good too, tho i prefer the Chronicles of Nick to the actual Dark Hunters series as its less of a hassle to understand characters.

Anything by Johnathan shroud. Bartemaus is probably the best nonwizard or human based magic system ive ever read. Not to mention the character work.

** I'll stick to sf/fantasy titles because I don't think my very narrow taste in mysteries would contribute much to the conversation, and the list of my favorite mainstream fiction/lit fic would go on interminably.

For series, at the top of the list is probably Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun quintet. They're brilliant and dreamlike and disturbing and mysterious, and they have a hypnotic effect on me. Some readers find them too slow, but I love the language and the gradual immersion in a barely identifiable post-apocalypse world. (By barely identifiable, I mean it's science fiction and the clues are there, but it reads like an alternate-world fantasy.)

Lord of the Rings, which is an old favorite and a comfort read.

The Gormenghast Trilogy by Mervyn Peake, which is incredibly atmospheric and an amazing, creepy blend of Gothic and Victorian. I have to be in the right mood to read these because the language is beautiful but very dense, almost claustrophobic, and most of the characters are grotesque.

The Riddle-Master Trilogy by Patricia McKillip. Fairly standard Chosen One plot, but beautifully written, with a sweeping sense of magic and transformation. Romantic in the larger sense, and like LotR, with a non-ironic faith in noble heroes.

Further down the ranks, I also thoroughly enjoy the Johannes Cabal series by Jonathan L. Howard for the droll, self-referential narrative voice, misanthropic, singleminded protagonist, and steampunk magical world.

Ditto the Ancillary trilogy by Ann Leckie. Absorbing and entertaining, if a bit uneven.

Stand-alone titles:

Little, Big by John Crowley. Also, Engine Summer, even though it's somewhat dated at this point.

Angela Carter's The War of Dreams, surrealistic fantasy with dollops of Nietzsche and de Sade. Also, The Bloody Chamber, a collection of re-written fairy tales

Samuel Delany's Nova, although it's been years since I read it, so my high opinion of it may not withstand the test of time.

A Stranger in Olondria by Sofia Samatar, a combination of folk tale, anthropology, myth, and poetic coming of age, very beautifully told.

Richard Powers's Galatea 2.2 might belong here as well (parallel storylines of a former failed love affair and current romantic obsession juxtaposed with the gradual growth to sentience of a research lab AI)

** Woo, Sanderson love! I'm very behind on finishing Words of Radiance but The Way of Kings had me enthralled. I've been picking up his books after Mistborn and WoK and loving them.

I loved the Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow series until they just started falling apart. Speaker for the Dead and Xenocide are surprisingly good books on Humanism and tolerance coming from a horrible bigot like Card.

It's not a novel, but the comic Saga is incredibly good. I'm once again very far behind on it, but I was never able to stop myself from finishing the entire thing when I got my hands on a new volume.

Other than that, nothing really crosses my mind. That's just from looking at actual books on my bookshelf, so there's probably others that are slipping my mind currently.

** /Earthsea/ by K. Le Guin is my long-time favorite series, the earlier books at least, as the later ones are too philosophical and I might just be too dumb to understand or enjoy them. The first book deals with a young mage as he grows and learns, and that's a lot more to my liking.

/The Chronicles of Amber/ by Roger Zelazny, the first five books that is. The later five which deal with Corwin's son are just meh. The books follow a group of semi-immortal royal siblings who rule over a city in the center of the universe, and they can hop through dimensions including Earth.

/The Witcher/ by Andrzej Sapkowski is great fantasy, although my enjoyment lessened when Ciri became more of a focus and started hopping to alternate worlds.

/Недотёпа/ by Сергей Лукьяненко. It follows a noble-born teenager whose parents were overthrown by a rivaling lord. He manages to run away, seeks justice, and ends up becoming an apprentice to a mage in the process. It's YA so not very deep at all, but easily readable and humorous throughout.

** The "Discworld" series by Terry Pratchett! It's definitely my favourite book series ever. Not all the books are equally good, but all of them contain at least one moment of pure brilliance. Pretty much anything by Pratchett is worth at least checking out; he has such a way with the English language. (The later books, which were written by dictation and text-to-speech programs because Pratchett was too ill to actually type anymore, are a little more rambly and not as consise... though these books work best as audiobooks, I find, especially if read by Stephen Briggs.)

"The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. The cornerstone of modern fantasy; this is where pretty much all the classic fantasy tropes comes from. And it STILL manages to play those tropes less straight than many of the imitators. The book isn't perfect; it's badly-structured, messily told, it often drags in the wrong places, the female characters aren't that impressive... but the world it creates is just so vast and engulfing and MAGICAL.

Tove Jansson's "Moomin" books are an old childhood favourite that I re.-read recently to find they were even better when i read them as an adult. Those books are just beautiful... not for their external action, but for the rich inner lives of the characters and the curious mix of melancholy and happy-go-luckiness. And occasionally they're just hilarious.

One of my very favourite stand-alone books: "Watership Down" by Richard Adams. Possibly better known as "that adult cartoon with the bleeding, dying rabbits that scared the crap out of children," but the book is so much more than that. It's an epic adventure story featuring wild rabbits in the main roles, which is a lot more awesome than it sounds.

Anything by Michael Ende. You know that movie, "The Neverending Story"? Yeah, that's essentially the first half of the book. The second half, after Bastian has saved Fantasia, that's when things REALLY GO TO HELL, and it's awesome.

I've had a lot of fun with the Metamor City podcast stories by Chris Lester too. Essentially, it's a "classic fantasy world in modern times, except magic has developed and grown stronger just as technology has." So you have computers and hovercars and airplanes along with wizards and elves and dragons and magical curses. Mind you, there's a lot of sex in these stories, and the author's transformation kinks and fetishes are pretty blatant... but the world is really well thought out, and the characters are good. I especially like the grouchy, snarky wizard who runs the magic shop "Spells 4 U."

** Anything by Jim Butcher, his world building is truly amazing. Malazan Book Of The Fallen was also great, but its complexity works against it (you have to read the whole series in one go, because it's not told in a linear fashion and you'll be hopelessly lost if you leave it for a month or two and then try to continue)

** I posted elsewhere in this thread about Sanderson so I won't harp on again here more than just saying all of his work is top notch, if you enjoy Mistborn check out Stormlight Archive once you're through Mistborn era 1, or after Mistborn era 2. [New Stormlight Archive book is out in under a fortnight]

The Kingkiller chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss are a similar vein to Sanderson's stories. Quality characterization and fantastic world-building in a fantasy setting. KCs main character is a musician cross alchemist/wizard and it makes a great combination.

Third i'll recommend the Gentleman Bastard Series by Scott Lynch. It's less 'hero saves the day' than most fantasy, as it follows a thief / con artist and his friends. Imagine Oceans Eleven, set in a world of swords and sorcery.

His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman has been mentioned earlier in this thread, as has the Old Kingdom series by Garth Nix, both are great reads with enough content to keep you occupied for a while.

** Monster Hunters Inc. Basically government paid mercenaries who kill supernatural creatures. And business is very good. Lots of gun porn.

Sandman Slim. Description of first book: The stories' main character, James "Sandman Slim" Stark, escapes from Hell to take his revenge on the people that killed his lover. He wanders a dark Los Angeles haunted by vampires and demons. After 11 years of combat as a gladiator against demons in Hell, he is more than prepared to fight back. Very violent.

Galactic Football League. Take American Football, cross it with Star Wars, and throw in a splash of mafia/gangster for flavor.
