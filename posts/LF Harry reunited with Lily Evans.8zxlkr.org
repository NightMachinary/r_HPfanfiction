** The fic I'm reccing is a spoiler, so I'll put spoiler tags around it... though it's heavily foreshadowed, but some people didn't get it

More info about circumstances:

Lily gets revived, but her relationship to Harry is complicated, because from her perspective he was just a baby a few days ago
