I know I am nitpicking but when ever I read a fic with karate of some form in the fic, it breaks my reading. I realise that this FanFiction and the author is just intervening in and interesting way, but karate seems so out of place.

And again this is probably a first world problems So ask you; what are things in fanfiction that breaks the immersion?


** Anachronisms: characters using things that weren't spread during the time the fic is taking place (mobile phone).

Characters using electronic devices in Hogwarts or any magical places. I mean, I'd read it if during the fic, they do something to solve that problem but when it's just there like the author forgot that's a thing, it's annoying.

Things that shows the author hasn't done any research. I remember reading a thing where Harry ended up at the hospital and was worried about the cost and that's a thing that's so typically American (and doesn't happen in most other developed countries, certainly not in Europe) it threw me out.

*** /Part/ of this could just be the way he was raised - he never got eye exams, even though they're free, and he had one pair of glasses for probably 5+ years before even stepping foot in Hogwarts. The Dursley's were always harping about money.

I'm not saying that's what the author was going for in most of those cases, but it's quite possible that Harry is clueless about the NHS.

** One thing that took me out of a fic once was when the author gave Hermione a FREAKING PONTIAC GRAND AM, a car that:

1. Wasn't sold in the UK
2. Was from a brand that never sold cars in the UK
3. Would of been one of only 2000 Pontiac's in the UK at the time
4. Isn't even on the [[https://www.howmanyleft.co.uk/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=pontiac&commit=Search#][list of Pontiac's imported into the UK]] (though it might be in the "missing" category)

** Karate is actually not wrong. When reading linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) it seems completely logical that Muggle parents of kids who now are in danger, but cannot defend themselves magically (yet), will make these kids to train in karate to improve their reflexes, stamina, etc. What's wrong with it?

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

** Ah I understand that logically in the context of the fanfic, such as the one you suggested make a logical attempt at its use. There are a number of fanfics that use it as means of defining or some cases redefining a character on the basis of a plot change. Again this is fine, but when this defining trait is used as padding and is wasted after the point. It is at this point that the inclusion of the plot point become useless, becoming something is harmful to progression of the story.

In the example you gave, the answer is logical and if I am remembering correctly; the characters use it as a progressive plot point.

Sorry about the rant in all honesty I see your point.
