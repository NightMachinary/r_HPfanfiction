It can judge muggleborns for being ignorant and bringing their muggle prejudices and assumptions to the magical world. It can defend questionable magic and redeem evil characters. It could have a full out war between wizards tired of having to hide and muggles. If it's explained and written well, it's fine.

I'd just really like to read some long, outside the box story that doesn't rehash the canon and challenges the weak, helpless tone it set. A story that shamelessly pushes back against some values of the Light in a somewhat understandable, non-edgy manner.

I can't be the only one


** You would really enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][*Rise of the Wizards*]] linkffn(6254783) as it ticks the boxes you are looking for. Well, mostly. I haven't fully read it in a while but I do believe there are some edge-lord like aspects to it.

** Agreed, but sadly that author would be BTFO'd out of Fanfiction.net if they even made Hermione seem ignorant in the slightest. Maybe a 14 year old muggle born who wasn't born in the wizarding world doesn't know everything about House-Elves? "Buh, muh Hogwarts library". Well if the Hogwarts library had everything, they wouldn't need to buy school books.

*** The more fanfiction I read, the less I enjoy Hermione's character. She seems the least likely to get the "... in name only" treatment, probably because she's so easy to write as an argumentative know-it-all, but I wouldn't mind if she was receiving more character improvements.. If Harry can be smart, Draco tolerant, and Dumbledore ruthless, it shouldn't be a big deal to let Hermione be less annoying (:

** Yeah, I've been looking around for something like this. I feel like any stories dealing with 'Dark' main characters, it's filled with a bunch of delusion, edginess, or badly done justifications for being Evil.

I know HPMOR is pretty taboo around here, but David Monroe was an excellent character to show how someone could be irredeemably evil, but make decent points as to why.

*** The only stories that I know dealing with these themes properly are Athey's works that probably aren't broadly read because of the pairings. It's too bad, because her ideas in linkffn(Again and Again) and linkffn(Rebirth) are incredibly entertaining. Each of these has a single skippable smut scene, but it's probably enough to make people nope out.

In /Again and Again/, Harry is unable to die for good and doesn't know why. Every time he does die, he wakes up being born again, no matter what he did in his past life. Tired of just about everything, he decides to try something he hasn't before which is to not kill Voldemort at all but instead patch his soul up and hope for a manageable, non-batshit-insane result. The great part is that there's a future threat of muggles discovering the magical world and taking radical steps to control it. In Harry's past lifes, the wizards weren't fighting back, convinced that if they're nice and peaceful enough, they will be left alone.. Harry's influence was never enough to avoid the war.

It definitely inspired me to look for more

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

*** Idk, I feel that The Magicians had a pretty good 'morally-conflicted' main character in the form of Quentin Coldwater, he thought like a male would think in his position, and best of all, he understood that Magic was powerful, limitless, and must be explored. He was essentially a much better developed version of Harry, with actual human traits and characteristics, instead of the "Unknown Monster rising in my chest" and "I'm hearing voices but I won't look into it".
