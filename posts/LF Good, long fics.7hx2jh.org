This is another one of those 'I have a really long trip and need something to read lest I bore myself to death' requests. But seriously, I have a 20 hour flight coming up, so please, if you guys can rec me any decent fic that is at least 70k words, it would be much appreciated. Incomplete or complete, any pairing (slash, femslash or het), any genre, any character. I have read most of the completed fics that dominate the Most Favourited/Most Followed of ffn.net, though, so bonus points if it's a relatively undiscovered fic, or a relatively new one.


** I'm currently reading this fic, which has the most realistic Dark Harry I've ever read and Ron and Hermione being awesome. .[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630/chapters/14514247][The Sum of Their Parts]] Summary: For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone. It's complete, and about 138000 words.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Linkffn(pureblood pretense by murkybluematter)

A masterpiece, truly. It has three more parts and each one is bigger than the previous one, so more than enough for your flight:) A very thorough look on potions and magic in general and unlike most of the "theory fics" it has an amazingly engaging plot. I can't recommend it enough.

** I just stumbled across this linkffn(Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded). Then there's linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise by Autumn Souls) which has a sarcadtic lesbian fem!Harry and is one of the only fem!Harrys that I have enjoyed along with linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series.

An incomplete one that is fairly obscure is linkffn(The Butterfly Effect by CaspianAlexander). And this is a bit canony but is a complete GoF linkffn(The Other Champion - Part I by Srikanth1808).

If you can say what sort of fics you tend to go for I might be able to come up with some you haven't read.
