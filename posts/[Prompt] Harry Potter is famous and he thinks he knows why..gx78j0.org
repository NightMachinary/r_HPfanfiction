Harry Potter was famous, he'd been told that when he turned 11. "The Boy-Who-Lived" they called him in the wizarding world. What he didn't know, however, was that there was no wizarding world, and that he was famous around the globe. Chosen among a number of other orphans to be the star of new form of fantasy reality show, Harry Potter has been followed by secret cameras documenting his every adventure. Now the cracks are starting to grow in the facade that is his life, and he must come to terms with what is real and what is not.

Had the idea of basically a crossover between the Truman Show and Bolt, where every bit of magic and fantasy is scripted.

When Tom Riddle, actor for Quirrinus Quirrel started having doubts about the emotional stress they were putting a child through by making him think a teacher was trying to kill him, they scrapped his planned character arc and the reveal of Severus Snape in order to kill off his character at the end of season 1. Then in the beginning of season 2 they did everything they could to limit Harry's communication and access to the outside world through bars on the windows and the hastily thrown together Burrow sets before he was able to be brought back to the primary set. To thwart the further attempts of Tom Riddle to contact their star with the truth, they vilified his name to ensure that Harry would never listen to him if he broke through their security.

Obvious suspension of disbelief is required for them to have enough special and practical effects prepared to convince anyone that they can do magic, but hey. Its fiction.


** This is so great! I love Tom Riddle being the real person and the creators having to adapt the story arc to fit his departure, lol

Now I'm imagining the writers making up the middle name "Marvolo" to pretend Tom Riddle was always Voldemort, even though it hadn't been originally planned, and rewriting season 2 into being entirely about convincing Harry that Tom is Voldemort and he should stay away from him.

OR

Riddle keeps trying to sabotage season 2 and the whole Chamber of Secrets is a backstage war between Tom Riddle trying to contact Harry and the producers doing damage control. Ginny is a kid who genuinely likes Harry, and Riddle convinced her to help him, all the messages on the walls are threats for the producers. Salazar Slytherin built a secret chamber hidden from the founders of Hogwarts? Actually, /actor Tom Riddle/ built a secret room hidden from the /production crew/. "The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir beware." = "I'm going to tell Harry Potter the truth in the secret room I built, and beware anyone who tries to stop me". But in the end they manage to keep him away and hire a teenage actor to tell Harry Tom Riddle is the man who murdered his parents.

In season 3 they try to get the story back on track by telling Harry a bit more about his family.

But in season 4, Riddle has converted even more of the production crew into joining his cause, and derails what was supposed to be a fun plot about competition and inter-school cooperation. They hired a trusted actor for the role of the new Defense teacher to keep an eye on Harry, but his twin brother, who supports Riddle, comes in his stead.

*** They get Harry to the Graveyard, a guy in a Hoodie is standing there, he pulls the hood off and it's... Professor Quirrell?

He explains to Harry what's going on, perhaps even has a laptop with episodes loaded up on it. He and Harry talk, turns out James and Lily while nice people did die in a Car accident due to a drunk Driver hitting them head on. Petunia and Vernon signed him up for this to make money off of his name, since he did not know he didn't know he was making millions of pounds for the Dursley's

** I'd almost prefer the reverse. Everything is real, but Harry assumes it's all a reality show. He'd go around complimenting the goblins' prostheses, casting """"spells"""" with his """"wand"""", and defeating the idiot in the snake mask that the producers somehow convinced themselves was a frightening villain.

*** I remember reading a fic once where Harry thought all wizards were crazy and Hogwarts was an insane asylum that occasionally took in normal people to help keep an eye on the crazies. All those normal people were sorted into Slytherin with a few exeptions to make others feel better about themselves. Snape and the Slytherins went along with Harry's delusions. It lasts until at least fourth year, since I remember Fudge being really obnoxious about it. Harry labeled him a crazy too. You might enjoy that if you manage to find it.

** *Character Profiles*

There will be SEVEN SEASONS! (One for each book)

Show is centered around Harry Potter, an orphan whose parents were ACTUALLY KILLED in a car crash. There were no known relatives left on either side of the family.

The Weasleys are a family who sign onto the show because they're running low on money; they seize this opportunity in order to bring food onto the table. Soon, they start to feel sorry for Harry and start wanting to liberate him.

Hermione Granger is an aspiring child actress who decides to get her career started by joining the show; her parents are indifferent to the whole thing.

The Malfoys aren't really vain; they're just a famous trio of world-famous actors who think that this show would be different from what they usually experience.

The Order of the Phoenix and the Death Eaters are the resistances who want to keep Harry and liberate Harry, respectively. The Order has its mixture of people who want to liberate Harry and who want to keep Harry.

People like Lupin, Sirius, Tonks, and the Weasleys start secretly joining the ‚ÄúDeath Eater cause‚Äù while remaining in the Order of the Phoenix. People like Dumbledore, Kingsley, Mad-Eye Moody, Figg, and Fletcher are for keeping Harry.

All the Death Eaters are for liberating Harry while playing their respective parts in the show.

Instead of being a spy for the Order, Severus Snape is the spy for the Death Eaters working for Tom Riddle pretending to work for Albus Dumbledore, the mastermind behind the entire show. He's responsible for constantly dropping subtle hints that Harry's life is a lie. He also (secretly) works in the real world to gather more supporters for Harry's liberation and genuinely cares about Harry. Severus Snape is one of the producers who initially believed in the show in order to save Harry from the abuse, but he started to realize that Dumbledore was slowly becoming greedy and hungry for money and ratings. Before switching sides, he used to work closely with Dumbledore as a government employee's secretary. He is the second mastermind behind the show (but he regrets it soon after, similar to how he regrets Lily's death in canon).

The Dursleys aren't actors and are actually abusive to Harry. Dumbledore gets wind of this (with him originally being a government employee) and comes up with the idea to possibly ‚Äúsave‚Äù Harry from this abuse by creating a TV show. Once the money and ratings start coming in, though, he loses sight of what his purpose originally was and starts becoming greedy for money.

Hagrid is an actor who is instructed to take Harry away from his abusive foster family. He later joins the ‚ÄúDeath Eater cause‚Äù secretly while pretending to be in the Order of the Phoenix after realizing that Dumbledore lost sight of the original purpose of the show.
