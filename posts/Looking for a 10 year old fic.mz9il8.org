:END:
It's HHr, I think it was posted either after OOTP or right after HBP.

After the war, Harry goes to the US to play college baseball at Stanford. He sees Hermione and confuses her for someone else while her back is turned. They catch up, he finishes school and goes back to England. Another fact that stands out is he basically launches Voldemort off the astronomy tower(?) by slamming into him while flying a broom

I was reading it a while ago, but have automatic tab closer on after a month of inactivity.
