I've been reading a lot of antique fanfictions (written between 2000 and 2003). Something many of these fics (usually Snape-centric) have the name "Ars Alchemica" for a potions journal. I'm wondering if anyone knows who came up with this, and why I see it everywhere in pre-OotP fics.


** 'Ars' is the latin word meaning 'art', 'skill' or perhaps 'craft'. It takes many forms, because lol, latin conjugation grammar, but 'Ars Alchemica' is a latin phrase (using the arabic loan word Al-kimiya) meaning 'The Art of Alchemy', roughly. I don't speak much latin, but it's a thing. Using it as a potions journal seems disingenuous in-universe, since Philosopher's Stone implies that alchemy and potions are separate fields, so whoever started this trend clearly didn't think it through.

** I have no idea who came up with it, but someone was rather clever with that name, though I don't think alchemica could/should really describe potions making.
