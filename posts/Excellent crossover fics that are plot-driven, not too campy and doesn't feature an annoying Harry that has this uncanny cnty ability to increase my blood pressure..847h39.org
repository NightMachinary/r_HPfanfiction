**** Probably because it's already been said more than a few times already in the section of the aforementioned fanfic?

Edit: Don't get me wrong you/we should write a review first but well I understand the OP's point of view as well regarding the fic he was reading.

** I'm kinda working on a Harry Potter / Warframe crossover linkffn(Harry Potter and the War Within) and I'm basically not even including Occlumency as a specific thing he can do - he fell through the Veil after Sirius in the Ministry Battle. I'm working on finishing it but it's gonna be slow and infrequent.

  Sequel to Albus Potter and the Fortress of the Dead. The seventh and final entry in my Albus Potter series. Notice: this installment contains scenes of graphic violence. I advise parents to read first before reading to their children. Enjoy, everyone!

** That's your opinion. Many stories that you enjoy others wouldn't be able to stand. Authors write stories about what they enjoy. Asking for a story where they don't have fun writing it will come across as such. Request what you're looking for in a story, not what you aren't.

Thanks,

** To answer the question in the title:

I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12564799/1/A-Traveler-s-Guide-to-the-Multiverse-Earth-001][A Traveler's Guide to the Multiverse: Earth-001]] again. It's a Worm/Harry Potter crossover. It has its faults, but I enjoyed it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11196345/1/A-New-Man][A New Man]] are my favorite HP/Avengers crossovers, but they aren't updating anymore.

#+begin_quote
  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.

****** Harry Potter and Marvel characters exist in the same universe.

Generally, HP/Avengers fusions have such a shitty worldbuilding I don't even bother to read them. Admittedly, /Heroes Assemble!/ has done a relatively good job of explaining how the wizarding world and Marvel superheroes could coexist in the same universe.

I follow the story, but it just doesn't wow me the same way /Wand and Shield/ and /A New Man/ did. Not saying the story is bad, just personal preferences.

******* I've felt a bigger problem with fusion stories is that they are done in order to try and include all characters from both universes. There's a reason why professional authors don't include everyone and their squirrel in the same story. You can't really develop them much, and it results in the reader (or atleast me) into not giving a fuck about what happens to half of the characters in a story.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
