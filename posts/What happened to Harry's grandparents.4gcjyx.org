This has no doubt been asked before, but I'm new to this and curious. Lily and James died at 21, meaning that their parents couldn't have been very old at all. As Harry got sent to live with the Dursley's, it can be assumed that no grandparents were alive (Dumbledore would have rather he be sent to James' magical family or Lily's kind one as oppose to the Dursley's). So how did they die?

The only Marauder fanfic I've read is The Life and Times linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewels5), and in this both of James' parents are alive and Lily's mum is. It's also shown in canon HP that wizards and witches don't age as fast as muggles do. So is there any explanation? Headcanon or canon :)


** There was a Pottermore article about James' family. His parents were already unusually old at James' birth, and they died from Dragon Pox. I don't think there's a canon reason given for Lily's parents dying early.

Maybe Death Eaters went after them trying to find out where Lily was hiding.

** I really think JKR missed a trick in canon. Petunia should have, rightly or wrongly, thought Lily was responsible for their parents' deaths which would have given her an additional reason to hate Harry. A magical disease, the war coming to them, or just them dying of something when if Lily had been around she could've cured or healed them. I tend to headcanon this anyway because it really gives a context for how spiteful Petunia is and why she can't let it go, because honestly the way she acts is otherwise pretty extreme - if its solely out of a long-held jealousy that she now takes out on her murdered sister's child.

** The one I remember is that James' parents died of dragon pox. Lily's are even more shrouded in mystery. I always just presume they were victims of the war if no other explanation is given.

I think I remember one manipulative!Dumbledore fic where Lily's parents were alive, but Dumbles gave Harry to Petunia because he needed a martyr yadda yadda... Anyway, I remember the Evans visiting the Dursleys (to get the family back together or something) and Grandma Evans finds Harry in the cupboard. What follows were some really sweet scenes that eventually floated back into a bash-fest.

Also Jame's parents will forever be Charlus and Dorea.

*** Is Charlus and Dorea from the linkffn(The Debt of Time)? I am roughly three-quarters of the way through it and I remembered you replying to my submission ages ago, and I was so excited to make the connection. The fic is a pure work of art, I can't wait to finish it.

**** No Charlus and Dorea were seen on the Black family tree and the fandom just guessed that they were Harry's grandparents. Rowling ended up declaring some others Harry'S grandparents, completely cutting him off from any relationship with the Black family - which is why I think that Dorea Potter nee Black is 100000 times more interesting as a connection than anyone else.

** Veering a bit from the topic, but this has always been my favorite "grandparent" rendition: linkffn(1835915) It's about Vernon's father and of course, depressingly, my sister won't actually go back and finish it. Still, if Grandpa Dursley was alive this is how I imagine he would be.

** While James Potters parents are said to die from dragon pox shortly before Harry is born, Ive always had the theory that Lily Evans/Potter's parents memories (and her sisters) were modified by Lily in secret (Just like Hermione did to her parents) to protect them against Voldemort since they were muggles.

In other words, modifying her parents memories at some point near graduation or upon joining the order to think they had no children and know nothing of magic and having them move out of the country, and modifying her sisters to think they had died. If only James knew of this memory modification, and she told everyone in the order they had died of natural causes, then no one would be the wiser once she and James perished, and it would be near impossible to find them even if someone had suspicions.
