And then he learns that there are more prophecies, hundreds of witches and wizards have their own prophecies that they need help with...


** I would love this to end up as a "Malicous Compliance" fic, where he teaches each person to do the bare minimum in order to fulfil what are effectively poorly worded contracts.

** Hmm, not really what you're looking for in this case but you may well enjoy Ghost of Privet Drive, where a smartarse lawyer gets thrown into the Harry Potter universe. One great thing about Andrew Wolfe's writing is that he's heavy on the Britishness and it's a lot of fun. I'd recommend the work to anyone really, his take on nonsensical Harry Potter things and flair for bullshittery make it a must read!

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI-ish. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.
