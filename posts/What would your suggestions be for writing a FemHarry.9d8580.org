It can be for appearance, personality, dress sense, how she would've acted or if things would've gone differently in the movies, how she might interact with other fandoms or new characters.

It can be anything you think fem!Harry might be like, I'm just looking to see what other people would like to see her as, or what they might think a female Harry is really like.

Sorry if I rambled and made no sense üòÖ


** This would cause a whole lot of chain-reactions:

1. Dudley would never get away with bullying her. Two boys "roughhousing", especially if they are cousins is easily overlooked or explained away as "boys will be boys". But a boy picking on a girl will get every teacher's attention. Also, the other guys like Piers would be way more hesitant to pick on a girl and the girls in Harry's class wouldn't have a reason to outcast her because Dudley said so. Hell, chances are Dudley himself wouldn't even be interested in picking on a girl.

2. She would need new clothes instead of hand-me-downs. Petunia cannot possibly get away with giving her Dudley's old clothes and she has no other justification for not giving her new ones. Petunia is more afraid of appearing abnormal to her peers than she is of willing to spite Harry.

3. Assuming she is a still a Gryffindor, then at Hogwarts she would bunk with Hermione instead of Ron. They would become best friends and Ron might not even end up a friend at all, assuming he is still the one who insulted Hermione in first year.

4. She could still play quidditch just as good and end up on the team anyway. This would probably cause greater friendship with the other girls on the team. I can see someone like Angelina taking a more active role watching out for a girl!Harry like a big sister than she did in canon for regular Harry.

5. Snape could go either way really. There was never any logic behind how he treated Harry so it could be just as bad, worse or he might end up liking her instead.

6. Malfoy won't be the primary antagonist amongst her peers. He would probably end up at odds with Ron all the time. I can see someone like Pansy taking over as the "rival".

Edit: Reread his attitude towards Hermione before, during and immediately after the Yule Ball. Also, remember how clueless he was during the Cho incident (and consider that Hermione isn't exactly famous for being sensitive).

*********** Because as Ron sees it, someone's Yule Ball date is like a symbol of status, regardless if it's Hermione having Krum on her arm or Michael Corner having Fleur. He doesn't see it in a romantic sense, which is why he is hesitant to ask anyone. He thinks, "What kind of girl would want someone like me? Some fourth year too poor to afford dress robes that aren't a century old, the worst of seven siblings, and an afterthought to my best friend." And the cherry on top is that you can tell Ron is just being snide.

In all likelihood, Harry would have gone with Ron unless someone asked her.

No. It serves plenty of purpose. If there's no abuse and Harriet is happy with his Aunt & Uncle there's no reason for her to latch on so vehemently to Hogwarts and the Magical World as a whole. She knows all about her birth parents and doesn't want to end up like them. She may even end up a little bit like Petunia and prefer to live a normal life, thank you very much. Maybe she just doesn't want to disappoint them by repeating the mistakes of her parents?

Even if she goes to Hogwarts, she wouldn't take all the abuse as stoically as Harry did, because he was constantly afraid of being thrown out and having to go back to the Dursleys. Petunia is not going to react well when what amounts to her daughter is put into deadly situations year after year. JKR had good reason to put Harry in a position where no one outside of Hogwarts cares whether he lives or dies.

But... he's not. Having your protagonist be an actual idiot is not very compelling. And I still don't understand how him being "a bit of an idiot" would change the fact a Harry from a loving/normal household brought up by Petunia would have entirely different feelings about Hogwarts, Dumbledore and Magical Britain. If he's an idiot he'd be even easier to influence by Petunia (and she has 9 years to do it)

Sure, there's problems with that. But him having little self-worth certainly helps his martyr plotline more than it hinders. And him hating his home life certainly gives very good reasons to hold Magical Britain precious: It gives Harry a self-interest in rescuing them and defeating Voldemort, because he has nothing in the Muggle world to fall back on. This is integral to how the Harry Potter novels work. It beggars belief that you think it is pointless.

Him being an idiot achieves none of these things and in fact works in the opposite direction "Why should I risk my life for these people where I get killed by trolls and basilisks?" If Harry - from a normal home - wants to be a Hero for them, he needs high level intelligence to rationalize it, because it wouldn't make sense on an instinctual (aka "idiotic") level to act that way, especially if he shares any of Petunias idiosyncrasies.

I don't understand how you can't grasp this.

But I think I understand. Being "a bit of an idiot" for you means acting in a way that isn't immediately obvious and understandable to you (FYI: That's not what being an idiot is). So if Harry acts in a way that doesn't make immediate sense to you, you just go "well, he's being a bit of an idiot again". Since you lack the ability - *or willingness* - to empathize with literary characters (if someone doesn't reason the same way you do, they are an idiot) you want your way of looking at things to be canon and get mad when other people who want to make sense of Harry's behaviour and mention how his home life is portrayed as less than loving.

It really gives a grim view of all those characters. Which is partly the basis for evil!dumbles evil!weasley stories.

But the abuse of course is canon.

What i am also saying is that if you leave the abuse out of a story the story can make just as much sense or more sense than with canon abuse or even more abuse.

Agreed. Which is why I said JKR included the abuse as a narrative device. She didn't want to deal with the nitty gritty or take it seriously.

That doesn't mean it is meaningless to the books though, I've already gone through all the reasons why she included it. She just didn't want to deal with it honestly.

Sure. You'd need to write a complete AU to do it though: Remove Vernon, make Petunia regretful about her past with Lily and it could go somewhere. Harry just being "a bit of an idiot", keeping everything else the same except the abuse, is much more ridiculous and bad than the abuse backstory. I honestly can't think of anything much worse than explaining inconsistencies in your story with "well, the protagonist being a bit stupid now" every time they occur, I'd rather have the slightly inconsistent abuse background, at least it's an attempt.

*** I'd say the abuse would have two forms.

- significantly raise the amount domestic tasks. Harry does a lot, but I have a feeling a female Harry would get piled up with even more.

- Petunia resented her sister, she thinks she got killed, because she ran with the wrong crowd, liked the wrong men. I could see her being very controlling, acting in a contrived way to "protect" FEmHarry from doing the same stuff that killed her mother.

Vernon's abuse would likely remain the same, it wasn't really targeted at Harry as a person. He's cruel, petty and does not want to have anything to do with him.

The driving force behind the abuse was usually Dudley and Petunia (who often abused by proxy of Vernon) as these two had a personal stake.

The big question is how Dursley changes. The original was written as an utterly dislikeable person in the first few books, who also was fat, not really too popular or intelligent either. Someone like that can easily abuse a younger "brother" without anyone noticing too much in fairly stereotypical ways.

But I think the abuse would have to change. This Dursley would have to be more popular, have more clout with popular kids so that other students do a lot of the abusing for him.

It's similar enough to Harry and while Holly isn't technically a flower I think it's close enough to count for the Evans tradition of naming their girls after flowers.

** Ultimately, the author can take it in any direction they like, though you'd be more limited if you're committed to having fem!Harry as the /only/ point of divergence (as opposed to writing an AU). Given the amount of author freedom on the matter, I'm not sure that there's any one direction that's the "correct" interpretation, so I'll just talk about what /I/ like to see in these fics.

Firstly, as in all fanfic, I want to see a version of (fem)Harry who is good at, and interested in, magic. PoA!Harry at a minimum, but ideally at least the same level of talent as Lily and James. I just can't get behind weak protagonists.

Secondly, I generally want to read about a fem!Harry who is quite feminine. A tomboy fem!Harry seems pointless... why turn Harry into a girl if you're not going to explore the idea of a feminine hero?

Thirdly, I think female Harry works best when you use the fic to showcase a different kind of hero. In the books, Harry was brash and headstrong, always diving into situations, rarely thinking before he jumped. These are typical "boyish" behaviours -- essentially, excessive risk taking. While of course you can write a more thoughtful, smart Harry as a boy, I think these characteristics particularly suit a female Harry. Girls are generally more mature than boys at a given age, less overtly aggressive, and also generally more risk averse.

Fourthly, I like fem!Harry fics where she is sorted to a house other than Gryffindor. This grows out of point 3 above -- a desire to present behaviours other than boldness and risk-taking as laudable.

** Before I say anything serious, for the love of God don't name her something ugly, like Harrietta or whatever. Ew.

Aaaaanyway, I've read maybe only half a dozen of these fics, but every time what I see missing in femHarry is, well, /femininity/.

What's the point of writing a female main character if she still thinks like a guy, behaves like a guy, and goes through all the events and motions that a male character would go through?

I personally would love to read a fic with a femHarry which has her actually be feminine, with none of this tired and overplayed "tomboy", "red hair firecracker" crap.

There's a bunch of fics like that, and in 2018 we know that women can have the potential to achieve just as much in most fields as men - certainly be as powerful with magic as guys.

So why not do something different and interesting, where the fem character just isn't interesting in training and fighting, and instead plays to her womanly strengths?

Having her combat Voldemort not through direct battles, but through political and social influence, through these crafty maneuvers within and outside the system. Have her be the political mastermind, the temptress, the socialite!

I'd love to read something like that, it would be a refreshing change from the sort of fics which are being pumped out now.

Why not? Compared to many common changes to canon (good Death Eaters, evil Dumbledore), changing Harry's plumbing is rather minor and the resulting ripples would be interesting to watch.

Dursley abuse could go either way since they seem to despise what Harry stands for, not just him personally. Dudley would probably be more bearable, but the adults are in the air.

Plot wise, I'd go with a BAMF Harry who doesn't take shit but does refrain from the usual cringeworthy OP Harry stuff. The silent world of Cassandra Evans does a wonderful job at depicting femHarry that way, even if the first few chapters are a little over the top angst.

** It would be dangerous... throwing a wrench into the clogs kinda stuff. Especially if you are wanting to base stuff on canon.\\
So, in order...

- Appearance: Well, The fem!harry with the idea of being like their parents... Looks like James with Lily eyes...Nope. You might wanna go Little Lily with James eyes.
- Personality: If Harry had been under physically bullying by Dudley, Here it would be emotional bullying by Petunia...Dudley and Vernon mostly don't care(othering than rubbing it on her face that they are happy and normal). So, you're looking at a secret OutLaw who has been trained to act uptight and normal, who gets into her mind not to trust anyone on face value and work sneakily. So...It's basically Prefect Lily going into mischievous James..
- Dress sense: Conservative but not overly stylistic or fashionable. Think of Movie Hermione costumes and extend it to a bit pale and dull colors.
- Action: Would be more Prideful and forthcoming. I think this Fem!Harry would run to save a girl from a troll and hold a really hard grudge against the Ron, Never suggest to Cedric to get the cup together, And there might not be the whole "Am I becoming Voldemort?"...Also, this. She'd cling to Sirius(early) or Remus(when she matures) as her father figure.
- Interactions: Would love to see more of how open she is to other houses. Definitely think she'll become friends early with Luna and Padma. Ginny is definitely going to be a part of "the gang" early on..Maybe her rival of sorts maybe Susan Bones or Cho Chang. Colin Creevey here would be an actual stalker, so there is something.
- Other fandoms: Maybe she gets into MCU and she and Scarlet Witch train under Dr. Strange..would be great. Rivals turning to friends, you can use a lot of these tropes well.

Those are few ideas of "a" Fem!Harry, I can imagine. I currently have another different set of these for a fem!harry fic I'm trying to write. So, hit me up if you want to.
