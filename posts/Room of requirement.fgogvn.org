So I was thinking of incorporating the room of requirement into a fanfic I'm writing, but I am not sure how to use it without it being too OP. Either it can turn into anything you want then whenever there's a problem it can be solved very quickly, or it has limitations. If it has limitation what could it be? Also, could the room theoretically produce muggle electronic stuff like computers? I know that technology doesn't work around magic but could it conjure it and the technology immediately starts malfunctioning? I'd like to know what you think.


** Gamp's Law is a limitation in canon. It includes at least not being able to create food from nothing, but the rest of that law is unclear and can for your purposes be used to make up limitations.

Hermione says in book four about walkie-talkies that "those sorts of things don't work around Hogwarts", but I think that's all we have from the books about technology.

Computers were only starting to become normal in normal people's homes in the late nineties anyway, and the internet was a lot slower to set up with dialling and modems back then, so I imagine that's where the real problems would be. Maybe you could put on a computer but it would be impossible to get the internet working, and all other programmes would maybe be more likely to crash and freeze if there was magic around. Today with the G networks, I imagine they wouldn't cover Hogwarts because of magic, so there still wouldn't be any internet. This last bit is all headcanon though :)

** I'd say that it can only ”make” things that have been put in there, so basically everything in the room of hidden things

** In my mind the Room of Requirement is limited to hogwarts. I don't think it would be able to produce tech. Maybe some digital watches and radios muggleborns brought and abandoned when they broke.

I imagine it works by replicating rooms of the castle, using them as blueprints and maybe adjusting them as needed. In canon we read it becoming bathrooms, cupboards, a training room, and the room of hidden things which I think was compared to the great hall? It has some level of mind or intent "reading" and can draw on the resources and magic that have collected in the castle for hundreds of years.

it didn't make things like the death eater dummies, it just took them out of storage.
