After seeing threads like [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/aylcny/i_always_assume_that_harem_fics_are_written_by/][this]] or [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ayxien/are_there_any_good_male_writers_of_fanfiction/][this]] pop up in the last couple of days, I've looked at what fics I've deemed quality stuff in the past, and realized for the best fics (at least the ones I liked the most), the gender of the author can't be identified by the content and style of the writing.

In these fics:

- Male and female character POV's read like real [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSVDcw6iW8][human beans]] instead of caricatures of their sex or canon personalities. (Big Dick macho Harry of harem fics vs. Short 5'2"/160cm bottom Harry in slash fics.)

- There is an even ratio of male and female characters, and even ratio of positively and negatively portrayed men and women.

- The writing avoids the Male Gaze ("She ran over to their table, breasts bouncing under her robes") and elaborate purple prose descriptions ("He carded one slender hand through his sleek, platinum locks").

- The story genre is broad. There are elements of action, suspense, drama, romance, but no one exclusive genre label as applied to fics in genres like Harem, Woobie, Whump, Slash, Dark, or Powerstomp/OP.

- The story avoids gratuitous self-indulgence. No putting the beta males and manipulative old coots in their place, no long shopping trips describing every single dress robe, no paragraphs-long description of the main character's physical appearance, or the MC's love interest's physical appearance.

- The best of the best fanfics make it so that along with their gender, you can't identify the author's nationality, religion, personal beliefs, or political leanings from the way the story is written. These fics never slip up in the character dialogue by using words and phrases like "tax dollars", "Mom", "semester", or "whoop some ass", and the authors also don't insert their IRL opinions through a character mouthpiece.

In hindsight, this is why I very much enjoyed fics like Alexandra Quick, The Pureblood Pretense, Perfectly Normal, and The Arithmancer, which were all written in a gender-neutral way, despite having majority female protagonists, and probably having female authors if we go by the statistics of fanfiction writers. But I don't know, and I don't care, because it doesn't affect the story itself.

On the other hand, this is why I didn't enjoy fics like Prince of the Dark Kingdom (gratuitous nudity and physical descriptions of 10-14 y.o. girls), The Harem War (that motherfucking Relationship Scorecard at the end of every chapter!!!), A Black Comedy (fratbro screwball humor, like Zoolander if it was a HP fanfic), Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, HPMOR, and Princess of the Blacks.

Some more questions to think about:

1. What are your thoughts on gender neutral/gender impartial writing? For PC wussies like me, or does it actually make for better stories?

2. Do you think canon HP is written in a gender neutral way? Could you tell that JKR was a woman reading HP? (She chose a pen-name to specifically appear gender neutral, so it seems like it was intentional.)

3. Do you prefer a story where you can tell what gender the author is? For male fanfic readers, does it enhance your experience and enjoyment to see a male protagonist like Harry Potter written with an "authentic" male voice? Not just a chest monster, but popping stiffies, ogling the quidditch chasers in the locker room, and making good use of the prefect's bathroom, etc.

*TLDR:* I think gendered writing in fanfic detracts from its quality and readability. YMMV.

The best fanfics aren't written by authors with no gender. The best fanfics are written by authors who can write realistically for any gender.

That said, I still like some of those fics you use as examples of bad, but in the same way I like sugary drinks or salty snacks. I know they aren't good for me, but they're still fun once in a while.

** I think that this is just a matter of general anonymity on the internet, plus a smattering of good writing (i.e. the purple prose stuff trips up newbies regardless). Most fanfics are written by authors without a clearly identified gender, so it makes sense that you see a comparable ratio in "good" fics. Many really good/popular fics are certainly written by authors who are open about their gender. And if you count gender tells in writing, there are a whole bunch that you missed, i.e. "sensitive" male characters.

#+end_quote

The OP posits that the best fics are written by authors in whose work no specific gender can be inferred. I say that while this makes good stories, the best stories are those in which the author is capable of writing, not with the absence of gendered perspective, but with the perspective of the character being written. Those authors that can write both male and female characters in such a way that, when reading about a male characters POV, it feels like a guy wrote it, and when reading about a female charaters POV, it feels like a girl wrote it, develop characters that feel truly alive.

The key lies in the balance however, if the author can only do one or the other, then the better approach is, as the OP said, to do neither. As only doing one, or doing one to a greater capacity than the other, comes across as stilted at best, and disingenuous at worst.

*Edit:* This comment is written under the assumption that the author in question is attempting to create an intentionally balanced set of characters. While it is in fact possible to create unbalanced characters and do so well, this is a very intentional, and more importantly, very uncommon thing. Thus, in the interest of general applicability, those types of intentionally unbalanced characters are set aside from the discussion to be considered separately.

No. Good writing makes for good writing. You can have a good story that is obviously written by a male author, a female author, or an author that is not obviously either.

  2 Do you think canon HP is written in a gender neutral way? Could you tell that JKR was a woman reading HP? (She chose a pen-name to specifically appear gender neutral, so it seems like it was intentional.)
#+end_quote

No. It's been a while since I read the actual books, but I remember it being rather obvious that they were written by a woman. I think this was especially clear in the later books with respect to how the characters acted in their romantic relationships. None of the men (Harry, Ron, Remus, Snape) really acted like typical men who were interested in women, but instead more like caricatures of how someone might think men would act. Chest monster? Ridiculous. Dumbledore is absolutely sure of Snape's loyalty because of an almost 20 year-old crush on a dead woman? Absurd. From my male point of view, that was clearly written by a woman. And if I recall correctly, JKR's use of her initials wasn't her idea, but rather her publisher's, as they thought it would help sell books to young boys. I believe she reluctantly agreed.

*** Thank you for contributing to the discussion.

After some thought, I find that my original opinion was influenced not by stories written by authors of any specific gender, but the ones where a gendered voice was /out-of-place/ for the character and story context. If it was appropriate for a character's age and personality to view their world through the Male Gaze, then it's unobtrusive. That works. That can still be good writing, especially if the author set out to do just that. What I notice when I read is the most exaggerated examples that /break/ the immersion, and come off less as conscious, organic characterization choice and more as personal appeal. Or are just poorly written and the descriptions are on-the-nose instead of trying to be subtle. Although it's kinda of hard to expect subtlety from a fic whose premise is pure powerwanking.

Interesting thoughts on JKR's writing. I never actually noticed "hey, this is what someone thinks how a man might act" in regards to Sirius and Remus, but assumed their thin characterization was due to not having much screentime. At least, this was what I thought about Remus' big idea to run off and join the horcrux camping trip, which was pretty unrealistic to me, though not for any reasons of his gender, or the author's. Ron's character, however, was more obvious. His emotional insecurity was played up over and over and used as a point to mock him, particularly Ginny in HBP who laughs at him when he calls her fast for dating so many boys. Yeah, that one was pretty clear.

#+end_quote

Yeah, that's the crux of the matter. The bias/world-view/etc. of the author, whatever that might be, (which, I would argue can never be totally exorcised) is always going to be magnified by poor writing. When you have a male author that is doing a shabby job of writing a female character (or vice versa), the authorial flaws in the depiction of the character are going to be jarring and immersion-breaking - but that's a factor of the poor writing, and not a result of a male or female gaze.

When it's done well, I've quite enjoyed reading some stories that were obviously authored by women and express a woman's point of view, even though I'm a man. The example that immediately comes to mind would be the /Wonder Woman/ movie that came out a couple years ago. The film leaned rather heavily into the fact that it was a movie about a woman, directed by a woman, and it did so in a way that worked rather well. I thought it was particularly good at bringing the Ethics of Care, a feminist philosophy, into the conversation of the superhero genre, which is normally built around punching to Solve The Problem, which is typical of masculine thinking. It's good to be able to see things from the opposite perspective occasionally, even when you know that's what you're seeing.

Likewise, I've had a lot of fun reading and watching media that was clearly created by men and caters to a male point of view.

As for JKR's writing, now that you've got me thinking about it, looking back, it seems even more obvious (at least to me) that the fact that the HP books were written by a woman is all over the text. I think the female characters were much more complex and varied - take the two big villians: Voldemort and Umbridge. Voldie is rather two-dimensional; he's the big bad intent on conquering the world, etc, etc. Umbridge, on the other hand, is rather complex; with her comes interesting themes of government corruption and media campaigns against whistle blowers. I think I can easily say that of the two, JKR managed to make Umbridge into the more hated and memorable villain for her readers. And then there's the hero of the series: Hermione. She's the one that actually solves and overcomes most of the problems while also dealing with rather significant personal obstacles. Poor Harry didn't even get to be the hero of his own story...

There's also the fact that I think JKR emphasizes the impact and importance of relationships in the story overall and from Harry's point of view in particular much more than a male would do. Neither is better than the other, but women tend to focus on interpersonal issues and relationships while men focus on tasks and problem solving. But when Harry is walking into the forest to meet Voldemort in /Deathly Hallows/, does he draw strength from the fact that he's about to lay down his life protecting others? That he's about to solve the big problem and beat the bad guy? Nope. He's consoled by loved ones, by having one last, significant relational moment with important people. I'm not saying it was a bad scene, I actually think it worked rather well, but it was definitely written by a woman.

Finally, yes, this is all rather silly. But there's no reason we can't have an interesting discussion about something that's silly. We /are/ talking about Harry Potter fanfiction after all...

***** I also enjoy reading a broad range of views in fiction, and I don't necessarily need to be able to personally relate to a protagonist in order to enjoy a work, as long as the strength of the character writing can stand up on its own, without having to rely on a specific gimmick or premise. (This is why I also find Second Person PoV to be particularly jarring. They usually involve other elements like Real Person Fiction, or Choose Your Own Adventure game mechanics style storytelling.)

The more I think about JKR, the more obvious the signs of her authorship are. One of her big motifs, which I can't believe I didn't notice reading the first time, was the importance of Maternal Love.

- Lily sacrifices herself and saves Harry, and for the rest of the series, everyone tells him how brave and strong she was, and it's never contradicted by anyone Harry meets, who knew her when she was alive (except Petunia, I guess). Unlike James, whose reputation loses his tarnish early when Harry found out he was a teen bully, Lily remains perfect and untouched until the end.

- Molly kills Bellatrix, in a symbol to show that her pure, motherly love protecting Ginny was more powerful than Bellatrix's unhealthy, one-sided, obsessive love for Voldemort. Objectively, I found it a somewhat unrealistic choice, because Bellatrix is meant to be Voldemort's top lieutenant, and if motherly love could have stopped her, she would have been beaten down by Alice Longbottom 20 years. But I can appreciate it, subjectively, as a symbolic choice.

- Merope's lack of love is how Tom Riddle turned into a monster like Lord Voldemort. JKR has said in an interview that Tom Riddle Jr. would have turned out completely different, had he had a mother's love in his life. Merope's suffering is treated with sympathy by Dumbledore, while the concept of Fatherly Love is barely mentioned, which could have changed Tom Riddle's life too. Other examples of fatherly love are Arthur Weasley, Amos Diggory, and Xeno Lovegood, but I still feel like it's outweighed in terms of endgame relevance by Molly and Narcissa's actions.

Of course, HP isn't a bad series because the gendered writing seeps through, because it's honestly subtle enough that you'd only find it if and when you look for it, unlike in poor writing where you are slapped across the face with it. It also /fits the context of the story/, which from the very first book has emphasized themes of love conquering hate, and the power of love and true friends. It's internally consistent, and therefore doesn't feel out of place or break the immersion of reading.

** The maxim /everything in moderation/ applies here, I think.

Verisimilitude is a vital part of what makes a good story. Caricatures of one or both sexes do not feel real. The sex ratio isn't a hard rule (for example, certain plots or settings are more suited to one or another), but it could be an indicator of a bad writer, avoiding the problem instead of dealing with it. Genre goes back to verisimilitude --- most fanfiction is set in a world instead of a story, so strictly adhering to a single genre can make the world feel unnatural.

Self-indulgence in a fic means that readers similar to the writer are also indulging, but others are constantly reminded of how fake it is, breaking the illusion of the world. This also applies to nationality, religion, personal beliefs, and politics. They can be done subtly, but too much will make the reader pay attention to the writer behind the curtain.

I like impartial writing. I believe stories should stand on their own. I like it when it feels like a real world. I dislike stereotypically male or female things, because I never experienced them nor has anyone I know. To me, they're "media-fiction", an idealized reality only perpetuated by various media. Which means it breaks my suspension of disbelief if I see it presented as reality.

Canon, especially the romance, does not feel natural to me. I actually think Harry is pretty gender-neutral, which could be an intentional choice to mask parts where JK slips through, or a symptom of insufficient author-character separation. (Which might explain the popularity of Fem!Harry and fanfiction itself.)

I don't care about the writer. I never try to figure out their gender, and will subconsciously avoid the question. I dislike when Harry is given an "authentic" voice, somewhat based on my understanding of it differing from how it's written. This also leads back to canon's presentation of Harry. If a writer makes Harry an "authentic" male, it feels like a misinterpretation of canon.

This is a good discussion topic. I've never heard anything similar to it on here, and it got me thinking about a lot of what I've read.

** A good story is a good story, and a bad story is a bad story. It doesn't matter how it's written, or what gender a story is written in, or if there's a male or female gaze.

Let me give you an example that's stuck with me due to how poorly it was executed:

One of the worst stories I read, has a page or maybe even two dedicated to describing Ginny's breast growth over the summer. It wasn't smut. It was written by a woman, but written like it was what the author thought a man would want to read, in order to make Ginny attractive to male readers... In other words, a really shitty male gaze. But by the time the author was done with the (very well written) scene, this Ginny wouldn't have been able to buy a bra that fit from Target or WalMart. The overall execution sucked, actually, but it was a well written and original plot.

Meanwhile, something like "Ginny's tight stomach was visible as she jumped up and down, waving, and catching Harry's eye" can convey attractiveness in the same way, while still progressing the story (Ginny waved). Conversely, "Ginny's breasts bounced just a little too much as she jumped up and down, waving, and catching Harry's eye", works if you don't want an as athletic Ginny.

It's all about the execution of Ginny jumping up and down to catch Harry's eye, and I don't think it matters who writes it, as long as it's written well.

#+begin_quote
  "She ran over to their table, breasts bouncing under her robes"
#+end_quote

Can also be written as "She held her breasts as she ran over to their table". That is just as "male-gaze" as your sentence, if not more-so, since not only have we established large breasts, but we've established that they're large enough for the character to need to work around them in everyday life. The difference is that one is basically telling you that the character has large breasts, while the other is showing you how large they are. This is a classic case of "show don't tell", that good authors can pull off. Again, it's about how it's written, not whether or not the characters are 10's who have sex at every opportunity.

It wasn't in this fandom, but I've read a couple of fanfics which were written in the third person, but where the narrator was the current perspective character. So the narration changed styles depending on who was being followed, even though it was in the third person.

It resulted in moments like [[https://i.imgur.com/xpAmB1Y.png][this, from a character who was very crude]], or like [[https://i.imgur.com/PeOLTIf.png][this from a character who was very analytic and emotionless.]]

  I mean...why would you want to read that?
#+end_quote

I can think of exactly one situation where I would want to include that in a story. Simply put, where it doesn't stick around. Much more accurately put, in a story where it is part of the characters development to start out that way, and then leave this kind of behaviour behind. The original commenter is correct, that is indeed how a horny teenage boy would act and think. And while I probably wouldn't find this kind of character compelling if that's all they were, if it is the starting point of their arc instead, it could be quite compelling. One of the least realistic elements of Harry as a character is how good of a person he is considering all that has happened to him and influenced him. (This is likely an analogy for self determination, wherein the reader is shown how it is possible to be a good, noble person regardless of personal circumstance). However, this archetype of a teenage boy, if employed correctly, could allow for a protagonist that, at the start of their characters development, elicits a unique response in the reader. They're not noble, they're not particularly virtuous, they're not a hero. Similarly, they're not a villain, they're just a teenage boy. The kind of behavior described in the previous comment would be a perfect point to start from when trying to create a protagonist character that goes through significant development and eventually is noble, eventually is virtuous, and eventually is a hero. There are other ways to do this of course, but this method would (in my opinion) best showcase the kind of process of maturation that guys actually go through. It would feel more genuine and earned than other methods, and if combined properly with those other methods, can create a character narrative on a level of quality unlike anything we have seen before.

It certainly wouldn't be for everyone, but for those capable of seeing the transformation through to the end, I believe it would be an incredible literary experience. This connects nicely with my take on the original post, the OP posits that the best fics are written by authors in whose work no specific gender can be inferred. I say that while this makes good stories, the best stories are those in which the author is capable of writing, not with the absence of gendered perspective, but with the perspective of the character being written. Those authors that can write both male and female characters in such a way that, when reading about a male characters POV, it feels like a guy wrote it, and when reading about a female charaters POV, it feels like a girl wrote it, develop characters that feel truly alive.

The key lies in the balance however, if the author can only do one or the other, then the better approach is, as the OP said, to do neither. As only doing one, or doing one to a greater capacity than the other, comes across as stilted at best, and disingenuous at worst.

***** I could see that working, yeah. I would likely be turned off of it too soon to see the evolution, but it wouldn't be inherently bad. Sometimes I feel like Rowling was actually intending to do something like this until HBP---she very clearly writes Harry's relationships with Cho and Luna to explore his emotional development over the course of a year that focuses on teenage angst more than any other in the series, and if not for the backslide that is her portrayal of Harry and Ginny in HBP (that I've heard was inspired by fan response, although that might not be true) she might have succeeded in the longer term as well.

#+end_quote

Umm... are you a hermit? From this comment, I kind of get the sense that you are, because otherwise you would have read or seen some popular media that's been produced in the past 50 years and realized that the "horny teenaged boy (or girl)" trope is rather prevalent. Entire film series and genres have been built around this premise.

I'm not sure what fits into the category of "serious storytelling," but I think it kinda goes without saying that there are a lot of people interested in reading that kind of thing.

***** fair enough, I'm being pretty elitist when I say "serious storytelling." I generally don't like that sort of thing, and most people I talk to don't, so I'm almost certainly projecting my own opinions onto others.

I will say, though, that romance isn't predicated on a gendered gaze, and a lot of popular media is lambasted for that sort of writing so I'm far from alone in my opinion.

It is a story set in the UK. A Brit would be best suited to convey the overall feeling, give good descriptions of (similar) places they have already visited and so on. You can always do some research online (I read the Kent Habitat Survey and spent hours in Street View for "No Longer Alone"), but it takes a lot longer and does not convey the full picture. And the word choice should be British and not some location neutral English.

#+begin_quote
  There is an even ratio of male and female characters, and even ratio of positively and negatively portrayed men and women.
#+end_quote

People care about that? And perhaps more importantly, why should it be when the reality is not? Most atrocities during war have been committed by men. If you go with folklore witches, the "bad guys" will be exclusively female (or the Clergy, so entirely male). If anything, the token "good man/woman" often feels very cringeworthy and can be immersion breaking. Just look at the controversies surrounding inclusion in games like Battlefield or Kingdom Come Deliverance.

"Pranking the Tournament" is a good example of this. It bashes teenage boys and puts Neville on a pedestal for "not being a pervert". It makes the author come across as immature.

*** For a UK-set story, of course it would be nice if they were all written by native Brits who capture the distinct sound and feel of life in the UK, in the vein of Beatrix Potter or Roald Dahl. But since the Harry Potter series is such an international phenomenon, the best writing comes from authors who may not be British, but who can write a story that is indistinguishable to that of a native Brit's, to the extent where it sounds so British you can't tell their original nationality or native language. This would be different for another setting, like MACUSA or Wizarding France, but the thought is similar: the story's setting, no matter where it is, feels authentic and immersive.

  People care about that?
#+end_quote

People also care about the Bechdel Test in their fiction.

I think the point is that if the story is about the adventures of the Holyhead Harpies quidditch team, that's fine to write about, and part of the established setting. But if male characters /are/ introduced, they aren't there just to "balance out the numbers", or treated like token characters for some kind of meta affirmitive action. Ideally, all characters should act like human beings, without bashing or pedestals, but that just feels like stating the obvious.

In the fics I've read and enjoyed, I've noticed a good spread of characters, and why I thought those fics were good was /because/ they were all handled like regular human beings, and I could see how and why they were there to further the story, instead of fulfilling some sort of authorial motive.

Your description makes it sound like a guy wrote it. There is a lot background slash in this fic though which makes me think it's more likely that it was written by a woman. Also Sirius and Remus calling Harry "Cub" and referring to each other as "Alpha" and "Beta" despite the author claiming they are not in a relationship makes me lean towards a female writer.

I have to disagree with you on it though since I absolutely loved that fic. I thought the characters were really well written and it has some amazing humour, dialogue and worldbuilding. Its still one of the fics I love to reread despite its length.

To me it really doesn't matter who wrote a fic though as long as I enjoy it. I avoid the tropes you mention like slash, harems and power wank fantasies but even being able to tell who wrote it via occasional clues doesn't matter as long as there is good writing, dialogue and characterizations.

** Hey, I think this a really interesting topic and I was surprised at the comments kind of shrugging it off. I just wanted to say, I tend to agree with you. I'm pansexual and questioning non-binary, and in general I prefer media (and real life relationships, ha) where characters are three-dimensional, people are treated like people first, and where gender dynamics, when discussed, are handled in a thoughtful and compassionate way that doesn't assume like, "Well MEN are one way and WOMEN are ALWAYS this other way."

Another thing that always bums me out in a good fic is a sudden unnecessary moment of "no homo bro," where casual homophobia or transphobia is used for a quick laugh.

I think one of the things that makes fanfiction (for all works!) a minefield when it comes to gender stereotypes is that a lot of it is romance, and romance as a genre, even on a published fiction level, just seems prone to reliance on gender tropes and romanticism of problematic relationships/gender dynamics.

There is a well-written next Gen series (Rose, Albus, Scorpius, etc) I can't remember the name of where some characters are pan and ace and queer and a lot of them have anxiety and they are all in Ravenclaw and have a very close-knit friend group. I have no clue what the author's gender is. I liked it because it reminded me of my smart queerdo high school experience, ha, and had a lot of fun banter. If you're interested, I could try to dredge it up for you!

EDIT: The fic I was mentioning is The Fred Weasley Memorial Scholarship by ad astra.

Are there such fics? Anything I have read 10k+ words I can make reasonable assumption about author's gender. Actually out of the authors you mentioned I would instantly say that:

- WhiteSquirrel is a man
- murkybluematter is a woman
- Inverarity is a woman
- I don't know which Perfectly Normal you mean\\

I also would disagree with your ratings, since I am stuck in both Arithmancer and Pureblood Pretense due to them being incredible slogs. I liked HHD though, AQ less so, but I left it for now mainly because it seems like it may be actually finished.

But I think that's also maybe because they excelled at what they are. Your 'best' fanfic list just describes good solid tropes, but also glaring leaves out comedy and crack fics. And while I wouldn't say crack is the cream of the crop, it's certainly something that I think can be appreciated.

Some of the most well written stories I've read could've pulled out an interesting one-shot involving their secondary (or even tertiary) characters living a day in their lives without even mentioning the protagonist while staying in character.

Great song there, by the way.
