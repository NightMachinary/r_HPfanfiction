Hey guys,

Does anyone know of good HP/Outlander fics? Ok with mostly anything.

Thanks


** The author of Outlander is the same one who wrote the long rant bashing fanfiction as 'immoral' and 'unimaginative'. That will probably make your search harder.

I haven't watched the show, but the series is decent. The show seems relatively popular

**** I've read the first couple of books, and they were decent.

The TV adaptation is surprisingly well done, and the costumes are absolutely gorgeous.

I've heard! Part of the reason I want to watch it TBH. The costumes in Game of Thrones have some wonderful embroidery as well

****** I haven't seen all of GoT (as I read the books), but what I did see I can definitely agree.

I LOVE costumes in period dramas. It's one of my favourite parts of watching shows from different periods. There's a yellow dress in season 2 of Outlander that was on some promotional photos (I think), and I have consistently gone back to look at it and admire all of the tiny little details.

EDIT: [[https://strongfemalefriendship.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/outlander-02.jpg?w=863][The Dress]] I mentioned above.

Also, just as a side-note about the show... it's surprisingly decent. I mean, it's an adaptation of a romance novel, but I wouldn't compare it to a Harlequinn romance. I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.

*** A popular novel/TV series revolving around a early 20th century woman beought back into 18th century Scotland. Incredibly stupid porn included.

** My first thought was that you were talking about the movie but then I realized there was a TV series by that name.
