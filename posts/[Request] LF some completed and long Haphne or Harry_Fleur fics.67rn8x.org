**** I checked, there was at some point a sequel called "Misericorde and Lili", which the author removed due to not being really happy with it + negative feedback. Maybe you can dig it up by that name.

Otherwise, here the authors plot summary of the sequel which he published after putting it on indefinite hiatus/abandoning it.

[[/spoiler][For those who care, this is how the sequel was envisioned (warning--spoilers for Dagger and Rose): Sirius, rescued and recruited by the Unspeakables, finds love. Ron redeems himself. Remus is captured, but escapes, learning an important secret along the way. Harry and Fleur deepen their relationship. The Rosicrucians maneuver. Tonks plays with fire, though exposes a spy in their midst. Harry goes on a quest for an artifact. Dumbledore's and Harry's relationship becomes strained when Harry learns neither he nor Dumbledore will survive the war. Narcissa usurps the Ministry, sparking civil war. Hermione takes on Umbridge in Hogwarts. Harry completes his quest, though at great personal sacrifice. Dumbledore creates a simulacrum. Harry discovers it. He and Dumbledore have a falling out, as he believes Dumbledore is cravenly seeking to avoid death. The war escalates, culminating in a final battle in the Ministry involving all of the major powers. With the artifact, Dumbledore and Chevalier sever Voldemort's connections to his horcruxes. Dumbledore perishes. The Ministry burns. Chaos. Harry is captured by Death Eaters. Fleur and Sirius rescue him. Voldemort and Harry face off. Harry wins. Fleur, deceived by illusions, strikes Harry down. Faucon, ordered to slay his aggrieved daughter, kills Chevalier instead. Harry is resurrected into the simulacrum body Dumbledore had created, a final gift from his mentor. He and Fleur are reunited.]]

  Having the right partner can make life much smoother. The right persons can complement each other's strengths and support each other's weakness. Love really does make the world go 'round, especially with a Dark Lord after your blood. HP/DG

  Working for the ZPD is a demanding job, especially when you are the first of your kind on the force. Although Nick and Judy make an effective team, trying to balance the demands of work while still maintaining a social life is a challenge of all its own---especially in the face of social pressures brought by living in a city still recovering from pred/prey tensions.
