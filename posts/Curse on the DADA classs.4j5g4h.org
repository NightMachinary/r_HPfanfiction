Hey guys, just a quick question. I was doing research on Professor Quirrell for my fanfiction, and I read [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/essays/essay-quirrells-leave.html][this]] essay, which seemed to make sense, however if that is the case, wouldn't that break the curse because he had a second year as the DADA teacher. (If it does break the curse accidentally, I have a plan to fix it by having Quirrell not be the DADA teacher.)


** I am quite sure it's confirmed that he was the muggle studies teacher before. But I am not sure where that was said. Pottermore maybe?

*** yes, that was confirmed. I am planning on it being that he taught muggle studies for a few years, took a year off to study the dark arts, came back and taught a year of dark arts, then takes back over muggle studies for harrys first year

**** I think another fic had him teach two years in a row, but Dumbledore hypothesized that was due to Voldemort possessing him in the second, so either the curse was designed to recognize him, or he just overrode it, or the curse recognized him as a new teacher, due to the possession thing. I find all those acceptable enough reasons, since Voldemort was the one who placed the curse

**** That's canon, no need to theorise any of that.

** Even if he was there for 2 years, one could argue that he was able to because of the possession.

** I presume it's that Quirrel gave becoming able to teach Defense Against Dark Arts as a reason for his sabbatical (since he officially did it “to gain experience”), thus making it so that they'd expected him to take the position when he returned. I do not know how clear he made his reason for the sabbatical to Dumbledore, but he really took time off from teaching to find whatever remained of Voldemort in an attempt to ... do something, I guess prove himself capable or stuff; this also means that though he only took a year off, it might have many month since his meeting with Tom by the time we see him for the first time. And even if we presume that he only got back once the classes ended, that's still a month and a half since then until the moment that Harry (and thus the readers too) meets him, and for at least some people a month and a half would be enough to get used to it the way Hagrid seems to have; and that's discounting the possibility of him actually returning earlier or sending an owl ahead of time to confirm that he will be back and teaching.

** One story had it being that the curse could only be broken by a teacher more suited to the position than Riddle himself getting the job(can't remember which off the top of my frawn).

That one really resonated with me and I decided that would be how I break it in my Darkness!Harry story when Harry takes the position in his late-twenties for a few years.

** Honestly Voldemort was kind of a douche in this aspect, because he applied the curse because he never got to teach DADA, but technically he did get to be a teacher via Quirrell's turban head, so the curse should be void either way.
