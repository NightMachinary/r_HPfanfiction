** Out of all of the ones I've read this sounds like what you described above:

She didn't need to be saved. She needed to be found and appreciated, for exactly who she was." J.I.W I watched Hermione as she sat in the corner pretending to read a book. I say that because she spent most of her time behind that particular book examining page 214. For the past month she had been 'reading' that book and hadn't turned the page once.

  Sequel to Harry Potter and the Veil of Mystery. Feeling a great sense of responsibility for those who die helping him, Harry tries to master his 'power the Dark Lord knows not' as he heads for a final showdown with Voldemort.
