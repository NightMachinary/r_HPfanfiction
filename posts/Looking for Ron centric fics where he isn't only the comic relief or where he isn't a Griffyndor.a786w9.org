Where he's a strategist and/or intelligent, preferably without romance but anyway it's okay


** My top three Ron fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Extreme AU. Lucius Malfoy showed more courage and cunning after Halloween 1981. Dumbledore was forced to leave Britain with his remaining followers, but would return with a vengeance 18 years later. Ron was one of his main spies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Ron showed tremendous loyalty to Harry's mad plan and often made good suggestions.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Non magic Sci-fi AU with an awesome Trio. Ron is a model boyfriend here.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Windschild8178 has some great Ron stories other than Stay Standing.

â€‹

I think Vangaurd fits this bill. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12632781/1/Vanguard]])

It's pre-Hogwarts right now, but the author already stated he wouldn't be in Gryffindor.

Ron's young here, so no romance and he's pretty observant.

** In my series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all in Slytherin. Ron's strategic side is explored, and he's one of the main characters -- the series has multiple points of view, and Ron is one of the narrators. There's also a fair bit of politics and worldbuilding. I'm almost done with the third in the series, and the combined wordcount is around 170k.
