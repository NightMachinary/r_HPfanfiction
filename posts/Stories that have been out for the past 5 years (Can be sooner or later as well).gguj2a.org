Was just wondering if there were any newer fics that I might want to check out.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Et cetra), j

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can have any warnings, can be from any era.

Extra notes: IF there is rape, I don't want it to be there, just to be there. I want the character to come to terms with what happens, or maybe never coming to terms but definitely struggling, other characters try to help, et cetra.

Similar with Male preg. I'm VERY iffy on Male preg, I don't want it to be there just to be there.

If Harry is a main character, or even a side character: No OP Harry, no Lord Potter, no Harem Harry. Harry slightly more powerful or slightly more smarter is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable. Note if Harry is a "Lord" I'd like for him to help other people, instead of just acting like Draco Malfoy 2.0

Would rather not have Weasley bashing, if at all possible. If there is then MINOR bashing.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** So you want some of the more recent fics? I think I got fics you can enjoy.

Kicking Gotham - linkffn(13521865) - A DC Comics Crossover: A good fic that came out this year. It's certainly interesting.

A Year at Beauxbatons - linkffn(12921072) - Is also a good story that has received more life recently and came out about 2 years.

Harry Potter, Squatter - linkffn(13274956) - Percy Jackson Crossover: My current favorite on-going fic.

Albus and Harry's World Trip - linkffn(13388022) - Another pretty good story with an interesting premise.

The Stag and the Flower - linkffn(13132670) - A romance fic between Harry and Fleur that has good build up.

Serpentine - linkffn(12459242) - Here is a good fic that came out recently. Very unique in its premise and I wish there was more like it.

Crafting Magic - linkffn(13256217) - Harry brings the arts to Hogwarts and its a very enjoyable journey.

Hope you enjoy any of these. If you want more recommendations feel free to PM.

  For twelve years, the prison fortress of Azkaban held the notorious killer, Sirius Black. Now, he has escaped and seems to be on the hunt for Harry Potter. Hogwarts is no longer safe for the Boy-Who-Lived, but there is another option. New friends, new foes, and most importantly, a new school! Will Harry decide perhaps it's best that he make his stay at Beauxbatons more permanent?

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Hey.

I don't know if you'll be interested, but I'm writing a fanfiction called "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22530556/chapters/53837263][Our Little Everyday Deaths]]". Maybe you'll like it. There's gonna be some Remus/Sirius and James/Severus. I'm currently reworking the layout of the chapters and I may change some scenes that were already published before I release chapter 5.

In any case if you read it, don't hesitate to let me know your critics!
