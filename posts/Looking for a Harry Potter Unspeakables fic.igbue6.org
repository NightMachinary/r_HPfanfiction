:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi,

So i vaguely remember a fic from a while back where Harry is trained by the unspeakables and it turns out that the head unspeakable is a relative of his.

â€‹

If anyone has read it, can you please provide a link. Or any other good HP stories were Unspeakables play a major part.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter.

** I'm not sure if it's Unspeakable things, though I'll link it anyway. Harry and Ginny become unspeakables with Lockhart as mentor.

  Formerly Defense for Two. Adopted from Perspicacity with permission. They thought Lockhart was a fraud. They were wrong; he was their guide into a world of danger, adventure, intrigue and other Unspeakable Things.

** This one is a bit old and can seem cliche at times but I enjoyed it enough to have read it a few times. It's a Harry x Tonks story taking place in the summer after 5th year. Is more about a secretive special force than magical research and focuses a lot in combat. linkffn(2567419)
