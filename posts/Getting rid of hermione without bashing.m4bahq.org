Using just canon events, how can Hermione be made to drift apart from Ron and Harry without bashing her, preferably make her a background character


** Make something slightly change that prevents the Troll scene from happening. This can range from someone telling a teacher that she's crying in the bathroom (I can see Ron doing something that irritates Lavender or Parvati and when they tattle, they mention "and oh! He's been so mean to Granger, she's been crying in the bathroom all day because of him!") so there's a teacher there talking her out when the troll shows up, to Lavender/Parvati sticking up for her as a kind of "girls against mean boys" thing so she doesn't end up crying in there all day, to swapping it so that some other students overheard Lavender talking about how she'd been crying all day so it turns into a different set of students rescuing her and she latches onto them instead - there are plenty of nice ways to move that scene around that will end with sidelined Hermione without bashing.

Another thing I've seen is having one of the teachers or older students talk to her earlier in the year about social skills and basically presenting it in a way that causes her to tone down her behavior enough that she actually makes friends. It's a bit difficult to do this right, but it definitely can work - get her into a club and have an older student who recognizes themselves as a first year take Hermione under their wing (Penelope Clearwater might be a good choice here), get a teacher to be slightly more aware of bullying and talk with her, there's loads of options.

Basically, give her other friends. The Troll incident + not having other friends is what tied her in with Harry and Ron, so if you can give her another set of friends then she's nicely in the background and having a perfectly nice time in school without being involved in Harry's adventures.

** Depends on how early you are diverging.

One neat idea is to have her start Hogwarts a year early, and then /not/ shoehorn her into Ron's and Harry's lives. (There is a number of mechanisms for having her start a year early that I've seen in fics.)

Sort her into Ravenclaw, sure, and then /don't/ make her a miserable damsel that needs to be rescued from her bullies. (If I had a dollar for every fic that...)

At Troll Time, if she makes her way back to the Gryffindor Tower before the Troll shows up, they are unlikely to become friends and would probably end up associating each other with hurt feelings and bad outcomes. (The potential pitfall there is that she'd probably be right there next to Neville trying to prevent Harry and Ron from wasting more of her hard-earned House Points in their absurd vendetta against Snape; she knows the Full Body Bind Curse, and she is not afraid to use it...)

Not having them reconcile in PoA could work---but if you don't want to kill off Sirius and Buckbeak, you'll need some other approach to rescuing them. (Actually, having Hermione /succeed/ in exonerating Buckbeak may suffice.)

Later on, it'd be harder to make them drift apart.

Is there anything in canon which suggests Harry and Ron didn't know jinxes themselves, other than the part where Rowling didn't allow them to shine? Remember, Harry used the Tickling Jinx and knew the Dancing Feet Spell Malfoy used in second year, when Lockhart was their Professor. Ron also apparently learnt the Leg-Locker Curse, and there's no reason to assume he can't learn it in this AU too.

Also, heh...

It's clearly mentioned in canon that Harry, "the hero of two Quidditch matches", won them a shit-ton of points by catching the snitch. Her points indeed...

**** I think you're taking my casual musings a bit too seriously, but fine, I'll bite.

Why wouldn't they know the jinxes themselves? I didn't say that they wouldn't; but if the Body Bind hits you, you are out of the fight and silenced, whereas all those others let you keep going if you are determined enough. Either way, it doesn't matter who wins, just that there would be a fight. Once the spells start flying around and people start screaming spells or invective, it only takes a few people to overhear and but the kibosh on the whole thing. And even if Harry, Ron, etc. somehow win without alerting anyone, they still have to tie them up and gag them, etc..

About the Points, that line was obviously from Hermione's biased perspective. But, even your argument doesn't work, because 1) Harry's Quiddich victory doesn't belong to him, it belongs to the whole team, even if Harry made an outsized contribution; 2) without Hermione's intervention at the Quiddich match---and not being Harry's friend, she might not bother attending---Harry probably would not have caught the Snitch; and 2) even if we loosely follow canon, Harry and his friends had just wiped out at least one of his Quiddich victories through the ill-fated dragon smuggling---and they are refusing to tell anyone why.

***** Would the Body-Bind really get them though? Hermione failed to jinx Millicent Bulstrode in CoS, who apparently held her in a headlock before Hermione could curse her. Given that Harry is just as competent as Malfoy in CoS, and held him off quite well for several minutes, I'd say a Harry vs. Hermione duel would be quite short at the end of PS, and quite certainly in Harry's favour.

The victory would belong to the team, yes. But the points gained from catching the Snitch belong solely to Harry. As for Quirrell's curse, there are many ways to ignore or resolve that situation without Hermione. Hermione herself disrupted Quirrell accidentally, her main target was Snape. Any character could be allowed to replace her.

And sure, the blame would solely be on Harry's head for the points lost during the dragon-smuggling, but he's not losing any points he hasn't himself directly contributed to. Also, Hermione isn't really in a position of authority to call them out for it.

****** I'm pretty sure the scuffle with Mille was something that Hermione did on purpose, in order to get a hair sample from her. Even if not, it's comparing apples and oranges to coffee and tea.

Even if we grant that Harry could have beaten Hermione in a magical duel at the time, the point is that there would be a fight, in which the hypothetical Team Harry (including Ron and whomever else) have to succeed in every way to achieve their objective:

- subdue all opponents
- /and/ bind them securely
- /and/ do it quickly
- /and/ do it quietly
- /and/ suffer no important casualties in process.

On the other hand, the hypothetical Team Hermione (including Neville) only need to foil Team Harry in one way to prevent them from achieving their objective:

- not be subdued (i.e., outright win the fight)
- /or/ escape to raise alarm
- /or/ delay Team Harry enough
- /or/ create enough noise
- /or/ inflict at least one important casualty.

One of these teams has a much more difficult job than the other.

AFAIK, a Quiddich victory gets the house 150 points, period. The margin doesn't matter.

As for positions of authority, Hermione doesn't need one to be angry and motivated to stop Harry and Ron from pissing away any more house points, which is what matters.

That's fanon. Probably from Forging the Sword. There's no indication that Hermione "lost" on purpose.

Harry and Ron only have to beat Hermione and Neville quickly, which they can. Once they're outside the portrait with a headstart and an Invisibilty Cloak, there's very little Hermione can do. Even if she attempts to follow them or inform the Prefects/McGonagall, Harry and Ron won't take long to cross Fluffy.

And that's assuming they don't use the Body-Bind Curse themselves. It's not exactly hard.

Oh, and Neville doesn't really contribute anything to the confrontation. It's basically 2 on 1 in Team Harry's favour, and Harry himself could end the fight quite quickly.

About the Quidditch victory... Ok? Harry won them the match. The points are still counted as being won by him. Also, winning 2 Quidditch matches (1 quite quickly, to avoid Snape's supposed favouritism) makes Harry responsible for 300 points. Without Hermione being involved in the dragon-smuggling, they lose only 100.

And sure, Hermione can be motivated and angry to try and stop them. Doesn't mean she would be successful.

******** OK, fair enough. Let's say that Hermione hadn't planned it. They are still 11 and 12 years old, and Millie was bigger than Harry at the Duelling club. If it gets down to a physical brawl, it won't be fast, there will be noise, and even if they win, there will be time wasted tying people up.

As for their ability to win this fight, I don't want to put down Harry, but in canon, the following was his contribution when confronting Neville, who was standing in their way, his fists raised:

#+begin_quote
  Harry turned to Hermione.

  ‘Do something,' he said desperately.
#+end_quote

Without Hermione? Harry and Ron would be /worse/ at magic, because they would need to study more to get the same result. Neville on the other hand, might actually be better at magic, since it's not like Hermione has anyone else to try to tutor, and Neville would put up with her because he is pliable enough. But even if not, he can still contribute, because when all Harry and Ron know are weak jinxes, punching and grabbing is actually an option, and Neville strikes me as the particularly tenacious type.

But, suppose that against all prior indications, Harry and Ron will have somehow picked up enough magic to take down both Neville and Hermione, quickly and quietly.

Then, they are travelling to a known destination. How fast do you think they would be able to run under a cloak? Not faster than someone who is not thus encumbered.

OK, suppose they've gotten there first by some miracle. There's Fluffy. They start playing the music. It's not an immediate effect, and easily interrupted. Then, they need to actually get through the trapdoor without waking fluffy. Mission accomplished!

To recap, to avoid being stopped, they have to pick up magic skills they didn't have in canon, with less help than they had in canon; win the fight overwhelmingly---quickly, quietly, without losses; then either somehow bind and silence two peiple or outrun older and faster people who know the castle better, while under an invisibility cloak; and they need to do it with enough of a lead to play the flute long enough to put Fluffy to sleep, tiptoe to the trapdoor, open it, and jump down. If any one of these things goes wrong, they "lose".

At which point, they better hope they know a fire spell, because otherwise, they are going to /wish/ they'd been hit by that Full-Body Bind.

So, I don't like their odds.

********* Wot mate... I wasn't talking about the Duelling Club scene to say Harry and Ron would try to engage in a physical brawl and win. Rather, it shows that Hermione has a much harder time subduing a target who doesn't just stand around and wait to be attacked (y'know, like Neville did).

Aah, yes. Harry's contribution to the confrontation... Desperately looking to Hermione for help. Yet, in second year, where Lockhart didn't teach them shit, Harry knew enough jinxes and spells to hold off Malfoy. It's almost like Rowling doesn't allow Harry to shine whenever Hermione's around, eh?

Harry and Ron would not be helpless without Hermione. They were not completely useless in their classes without her in first year or after her petrification in second year. Harry even mentions that they mastered the basics and began spell-casting. Hermione does not hold their hand and teach them stuff. She only motivates, sometimes even nags, them to study harder.

Who knows? Without her, their brash tendencies might lead them into more confrontations with Malfoy, thus forcing them to learn more hexes to fight back.

The assumption that /Neville/ would become more competent simply due to Hermione's presence while Harry and Ron flounder and become useless screams of bias.

As for the weak jinxes part... They're first years. All they know are weak jinxes. Even Hermione.

In canon, it took the Trio a few minutes to reach the Third Floor corridor. Fluffy was already asleep when they reached there. He stirred a bit and immediately went back to sleep when Harry played the flute for a few seconds. How long do you think this takes?

The lesser help part doesn't matter... Again, Hermione didn't hold their hand or teach them. Their skill was all their own, with Hermione's presence only contributing to longer hours spent studying. Something they can do on their own in the correct setting.

TL;DR Harry and Ron can become quite competent, perhaps even more than their canon selves, without Hermione. They can even get through Hermione and all the traps quite easily if the author focuses on them, instead of turning all their fanboy energy into hyping Hermione (and /Neville/, of all people) up.

********** When you have first- and second-years and starting in a very close proximity, brawling can be a viable tactic. (If I had a dollar for every Dramione fic in which he disarms her by the expedient of grabbing her arm...) However, if it does become a brawl, Hermione and Neville win by timeout. That's why it's worth mentioning.

The incident with Millie doesn't demonstrate your point, either, since they were specifically told to practice casting a Disarming Charm on each other---a Charm which has little stopping power unless there is a lot of anger involved. For all we know, Hermione might nave nailed Millie with it twice before Millie got her hands on her.

There are many authorial decisions made by JKR that I dislike but accept. You don't have to like that Harry either couldn't or didn't know what to do in that confrontation either. And, accusing an author of being "biased" for or against someone in their own work is a category mistake. It's not even wrong, and says more about /your/ biases than about the author's

A perfectly charitable explanation for Harry's inaction is that Ricumstempra and other jinxes he knew wouldn't have solved the problem of taking Neville down quickly and quietly, and he hoped that Hermione knew something that would. (She did.) Alternatively, the incident showed him that he had a deficiency in his skills, which he remedied off-screen during the first few months of his second year at Hogwarts.

I wouldn't say that Harry and Ron would be helpless without Hermione; and certainly a fanfic author can set up a sequence of events that would make them more motivated, but that's a preference, not an extrapolation of the most probable outcome. As it is, we see many, many instances with Hermione helping Harry and Ron learn magic---and only one (Patronus in the OotP) of the reverse. Again, it's theoretically possible that her attitude had turned them off studying, but, again, it's a preference, not a most likely outcome.

We have no idea how long it took for the trio to reach the corridor or to put Fluffy back to rest. A sentence of text can represent half a second or half an hour; but Hogwarts is a big place.

Could Hermione get Neville up to scratch? Here, I admit that it's more of a preference than a probability. However, he doesn't actually have to be any good. He just has to present a credible threat from the point of view of Harry and Ron.

The bottom line is that /everything/ would have to go Harry and Ron's way for them to succeed. Only one thing of a long list needs to go wrong for them to fail. (It does become easier if you add another person to their team, since they now have someone disposable.)

*********** There's no guarantee of Hermione and Neville winning in a brawl. There's nothing in canon which suggests that other students will interfere due to any disturbance. Heck, it's unlikely Harry and Ron will even bother with physical fights, and neither Hermione nor Neville show the kind of traits which makes you think they would throw out punches.

Similarly, there's nothing in canon which suggests Hermione hit Millicent with a Disarming Charm. If you're determined to view all of Hermione's actions in the most favourable light, sure, go on. Doesn't make it canon.

Given that 1) Hermione is Rowling's Self-Insert and 2) this is the first in a long list of inconsistencies where Harry doesn't do something in Hermione's presence despite clearly having the ability to, I'd say author's bias can be blamed here.

Yes, Harry and Ron becoming more proficient at magic is a preference, just as how Hermione even being in the common room or being able to take on Harry and Ron long enough to delay them is /your/ preference. In canon, Neville and Ron practically had a shouting match before Hermione cursed him. There's no reason to assume the other students would wake up and interfere, yet that's the scenario you want.

Given that Harry and Ron go on to become quite capable wizards, I'd say my preferred version of events is simply an accelerated variant of the most probable result.

Also, Hermione never taught them spells. She told them off for being lazy, made homework plans, sure. But she didn't ever teach them.

And Harry taught her more than just the Patronus. Almost every spell that Harry taught the DA, Harry taught her too. Hermione didn't master the Stunning Spell, the Impediment Jinx, the Shield Charm, the Reductor Curse or a number of other spells in GoF, that was Harry.

We have a clear idea of how long it took to reach the Third Floor. They ran into Mrs. Norris at the bottom of the first flight of stairs, encountered Peeves less than a minute later and reached the corridor in a similar amount of time. Quite fast, in my opinion.

Neville going from useless coward to somewhat skilled wizard took 5 years in canon. If you think Hermione can make him a credible threat in less than a year...

  says more about your biases

"Everything would have to go the protagonist's way"... This is pretty much canon. Hermione herself benefited a lot from practically being coddled by canon. Why can't the same treatment be extended towards just Harry and Ron?

In any case, it isn't really a stretch to believe Harry and Ron can do the exact same stuff as canon without much trouble. Not as much as it is to think Hermione somehow stands a chance against both of them together. My previous TL;DR note pretty much sums it up.

************ Mate, I don't think there is anything in your post that I haven't either addressed already---sometimes several times---or that is trying to respond to an argument I didn't make.

For example, you insist that I "guarantee" that Hermione and/or Neville win a brawl against Harry and/or Ron. I've written, /several times/, that they don't need to /win/ anything. They just need to delay and make noise. What they need to do is /not lose/ long enough, which is a much easier task.

Similarly, when you say that there is nothing indicating that had Hermione hit Millicent with a Disarming Charm, that misses the point, which is that whether or not Hermione hit, it wouldn't stop Millicent from grappling her, which means that Millicent grappling her is not evidence for or against either possibility.

And now, you bring out the Self-Insert thing. Here's what Rowling actually said in [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-connectiontransc2.htm#p3][an interview]]:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione is a caricature of what I was when I was 11 - a real exaggeration, I wasn't that clever - Hermione is a border-line genius at points - and I hope I wasn't that annoying, because I would have deserved strangling; sometimes she is an incredible know-it-all.
#+end_quote

Does that sound like a self-insert to you?

Mate, you seem to have a vision of how talented, motivated, etc. Harry /should/ have been. And I get it. Harry was a male protagonist of a heroic fantasy. The typical journey for such a hero is, in fact, to gather power, either in his own abilities or in his allies, and then overcome the villain with force and cunning. But that's not what happened in the books. The cunning was largely other people's domain: the old mentor, the spy, the female sidekick; and the "force" was power of love and willingness to sacrifice self, with the final victory achieved not by complex or advanced magic but with the most peaceful of spells learned early in his schooling. It is natural to wish for Harry to be more conventionally badass. It's not even necessarily a gender thing: there are lots of popular fem!Harry fics out there.

As for my preferences, I think that it's a /fun/ possibility that Hermione is there along with Neville because it ties things back together nicely. That they then either delay or cripple the expedition is the best prediction based on available evidence, however.

I don't know where you're getting what Hermione did or didn't master and when. Harry doesn't exactly keep track of the spells she knows. With respect to Neville, he had the courage to confront the three strongest students in his house and year at the end of PS without much intervention; then IIRC not much happened for 3 years; then he got better in DA in OotP. So, yes, it could happen in a year of concerted effort. In any case, given the level Harry and Ron are at at that point, just grappling is already effective.

About the scene in canon, we don't actually know how much time elapsed before leaving the common room and coming to the "first set of stairs". If you look at the conversation text, Neville is the only one who raises his voice, the loudest sound was when Hermione "cried" the spell incantation.

Was Hermione coddled by canon? Off the top of my head, she was almost killed by a troll, Potioned, petrified, ostracised, cursed with a Dark curse, and tortured, all without getting to be the protagonist. (Ron had his share of injuries, at least one Hermione-inflicted, but I think Hermione did worse overall in terms of stuff that can't be healed by Pomfrey in a few minutes.)

My bottom line is that the fic author could write anything they wanted, but /if/ you take the most reasonable extrapolation of canon for characters' capabilities /and/ stipulate that Hermione joins Neville in confronting Harry and Ron /then/ Harry and Ron will probably not be able to continue for any one of the reasons I have listed.

************* And as I have already addressed, there's no "long enough". No one is going to rush down into the common room to stop Harry and support Hermione.

The only thing the fight vs Millicent is evidence of is that Hermione is not as good at duelling as you want her to be, which nicely ties back to the notion that Harry and Ron can get past her easily enough.

If Hermione is intended to be a caricature, she should have been called out on her flaws more often (or at all, really) and she should have suffered greater direct consequences for her BS. If Rowling tried to make her a caricature of an intelligent, yet arrogant eleven-year old, she failed.

Give me a break. I'm quoting stuff from canon yet I have a "male power fantasy vision" with respect to Harry? Are you sure it's not just your vision of super!Hermione suffering from canon analysis?

The fact that Harry's greatest tools in his fight against Voldemort are friendship and love doesn't change the fact that he's miles ahead of literally everyone in his year, even Hermione.

You think it's a fun possibilty that Hermione robs the third act of all action and tension, and instead gets Harry and Ron caught by McGonagall and/or the Prefects? Really? Ok bruh.

Hermione is clearly stated to learn stuff along with the rest of the DA. It's never mentioned or even implied that she teaches the DA. It's not canon that she already knows those spells in OotP.

"Just grappling" won't be effective when Neville gets hit in the face with a spell, and hence won't help Hermione and Neville hold off Harry and Ron. How hard can this be to understand? And don't give me that BS about Harry and Ron not knowing spells. They did in canon; Ron is clearly stated to know the Leg-Locker Jinx, and suggesting that he can't/won't learn it in an AU is just more Hermione favouritism.

I have already given enough proof that the time and any ruckus caused by Neville and Hermione is inconsequential. I'm not going to repeat it.

Let's see - Hermione figures out Slytherin's monster despite having only one clue more than the most intelligent wizard of all-time; when her cat attacks Ron's rat, it turns out that the rat was a villain all along and Hermione was right not defend it despite having no prior notion; an experienced journalist apparently has no safeguard against a teenage witch blackmailing her; when Hermione turns out to be completely wrong about Malfoy's Death Eater status, the book she's been complaining about all year conveniently turns out to be written by Dumbledore's murderer.

And not once, is she ever held responsible. Coddled? 100%.

The most reasonable extrapolation of Harry and Ron's skill level in an AU is not to nerf them. Their canon capability is far above that of an average witch or wizard, and showing the progression from the beginning is not an unlikely chain of events. What is an unlikely chain of events is Hermione suddenly having non-canonical support in stopping Harry and Ron, suddenly gaining the ability to take on two wizards of the same level as her and a new sidekick who goes from, as I have aready stated before, useless wizard to competent wrestler just because she motivated him.

If you want to continue sticking to possibilities where super!Hermione /always/ hands Harry and Ron the L, that's your personal, biased preference. Not the most probable outcome.

And the sheer irony of you stating I haven't said anything new while copy-pasting the same debunked theories is just ridiculous.

If you actually believe this, then I think that our understandings of what is "canon" are far too different for us to have a sensible discussion. I can see it as your canon-as-it-should-have-been, and, like I wrote earlier, I think I get where it's coming from. (I didn't just come up with this to diss you: I was writing about it years ago ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/seventh-horcrux-hp-au.298748/post-15004312]], [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/seventh-horcrux-hp-au.298748/post-15005730]]).

Anyway, yes, I vastly prefer the ironic and whimsical conclusion to the whole misadventure to the yet another canon rehash but with more badass Harry (and maybe Ron too, this time---good for him). So sue me.

*************** Correction: I didn't refer to them as biased as if that makes them less than canon. I named them as such because they do not paint an accurate picture of Harry's canon-level skill.

Again, I didn't say Harry is as powerful as Dumbledore or Voldemort, which he most certainly isn't. But saying he's way ahead of his peers is just canon. No one in Harry's year repelled a hundred dementors, nor could they resist Crouch Jr.'s Imperius, much less Voldemort's. If you think this still doesn't make Harry vastly better than his classmates, then yes, I agree. Our interpretations of canon are too different to have a discussion.

***************** Sure.

If a bit of canon is clearly inconsistent with all past and future examples, with the only difference being the absence of a specific character who holds a special significance for the author, "biased" is a perfectly reasonable argument.

The /one/ contest? Those are specific examples. I could point out that Harry learnt complex, powerful spells in GoF from a textbook (while Ron helped him in target practise and Hermione simply reminded him of the textbook theory word-to-word if necessary). Compare this to the DA, who had to /learn/ this stuff from him, and I'd say he's far ahead of them.

Even in HBP, Harry pretty much turns the tide of the final fight after the DA struggled around for whatever unspecified period of time. He immediately jinxed multiple opponents with a high (nearly perfect) success rate. Plus, Ron, Hermione and Ginny had Felix Felicis while he didn't and the other DA members like Anthony Goldstein and Ernie Macmillan are quite far from the main "action".

OP!Harry who kicks Voldemort's ass in straight fight is fanon, Harry being much better than his classmates isn't.

I have no dog in this fight, but I'd like to point out that the magic Harry learned in GoF wasn't very complex or powerful. The only spells we know he learned were the Impediment Jinx (which, IIRC, Ron and Hermione could also cast in GoF), the Point Me Charm, the Reductor Curse, and the Shield Charm. The only one of those spells that could be called advanced is the Shield Charm (since it was on the fifth year curriculum), and Harry didn't even manage to cast it properly until OotP. For the majority of spells he taught the DA, he learned them a few days before their meetings.

Also, using the Battle of the Astronomy Tower as evidence for him being an exceptional duelist is odd since, IIRC, he mostly just one-shotted people who were already duelling other people. Any relatively agile and courageous upper year could have done the same.

****************** Again, I think this is cherry-picking and selective interpretation of evidence. To characterise someone's argument this way is not an ad-hom, even if it's not particularly nice. (On the other hand, I feel that I should apologise for the "amateur psychoanalysis" around the canon-that-should-have-been. I am not very good at expressing sympathy without coming off as condescending, particularly in online arguments.)

I do think that we have a different hermeneutic when reading the books. When I see an apparent inconsistency, I operate under the assumption that it is due to my limited knowledge, which results from the limited perspective of the characters. In other words, Potterverse is internally consistent and populated with people, what is described as happening in the books actually happened in the Potterverse, and if I don't understand something, it's because I only get to see a small piece of the Potterverse.

So, for example, when I see Harry being helpless at the end of PS and then using a variety of jinxes at the Duelling Club, I do not dismiss one bit of evidence in favour of the other. Instead, I assume that both of these things happened in the book universe and, based on that, speculate what would account for that difference (e.g., spells Harry knew not being suitable for the situation or Harry learning the spells between those events and the Duelling club). I am not particularly attached to any given explanation, and I am open to others, but ultimately I incorporate /all/ evidence, not just the parts I prefer to be true.

On point, the way I see it, Harry is a very talented fighter due to his non-magical talents. I think that we can agree that Harry is an incredibly talented /athlete/, who made Seeker without any practice and killed a basilisk with a sword without any prior sword training. He also has an emotional disposition that lets him maintain focus and composure under fire and gives him a powerful Patronus but also makes him impulsive and easily baited (and makes it much harder for him to learn Occlumency, though that's more headcanon territory). These things let him punch significantly above his magical weight in magical combat: to go farther with what is ultimately a very limited arsenal of spells. (This, by the way, is a part of why grappling Hermione and Neville in that hypothetical scene might be a viable option, particularly if your hypothesis that no one would here were true.)

Against skilled adult wizards and witches, these talents have utility, particularly in ambushes and running battles, but not so much in pitched battles. In Bellatrix's, Snape's, and Molly's league, the athleticism-based jumpy style that teenagers use because of their small spell arsenals and having to cast verbally becomes less generally viable. Ironically, the best example of a magical duel between two highly skilled but not Dumbledore-tier adults that we see in the books is Molly vs. Bellatrix in DH.

Once we take these things into account, the general picture that emerges is that Harry has a significantly above average talent for learning magic (as does Ron, actually, though not to the same extent), but he doesn't actually learn general magic that much faster than his peers and has to work as hard as them to do it. (One possible exception is the Dark spells, though we know even less about those than we do about the others; I personally like the idea that they are actually easy to cast as long as you are succumbing to evil, because evil should be tempting.)

With the amount of effort Harry puts in, if he were truly ahead of the class, we would expect him to be the first person to perform a spell or a Transfiguration in class, but that honour invariably goes to Hermione, and that includes DADA skills like nonverbal casting. You can use that to claim that JKR is biased and disregard that very consistent part of canon, or you can accept that there are areas in which Hermione is more gifted than Harry. It's not the end of the world. There is no Fundamental Law of Fiction that says that the protagonist has to be better at literally everything than the sidekick.

Regarding who taught whom what, we know next to nothing about theory of magic and its importance, or what learning a spell actually feels like. For example, when Hermione was helping Harry with the Summoning Charm, IIRC she had him read stuff, then they pulled an all-nighter, and in the morning, Harry could do it. What insight did Harry get during that night? In what way was he different? We don't know. Similarly, what role did Ron and Hermione play in helping Harry learn spells? We don't know. (I do recall either Ron or Hermione commenting that they would be much better prepared for the OWLs now, so I think they learned at least some stuff right along.)

What the books do have is a pretty consistent distinction between knowing how to cast a spell and being able to use it effectively in combat---a distinction from which Hermione tends to suffer horribly. (Remember why they had to abandon 12 Grimmauld Place? If Hermione had used some spell that would have taken Yaxley out, they wouldn't have had to---a good example of Hermione being shown messing up and suffering the consequences, by the way.)

So, the way I see it, in DA, Harry had a lot to teach Hermione and even Fred and George (who had already passed their DADA OWLs), just in terms of being able to defend against their fellow human beings, even if he (hypothetically) didn't teach them a single spell.

******************* Reducing Harry's duelling ability to his physicality and athleticism massively demeans his magical prowess.

We have a very different understanding of what magical competency is, apparently. The rate at which Harry learns spells doesn't really matter. The fact that once mastered, his spells have much greater effects (beyond what the standard level is) shows that he is indeed far ahead of his classmates.

This is not just for spells that depend on his emotional disposition. He uses the Impediment Jinx to violently banish and knock out a Death Eater in HBP, and the idea that his state of anger "powers" the spell is pure fanon.

Similarly, the idea that Dark Magic is easier to learn/cast if you're an immoral person is fanon. As far as canon is concerned, it is up to the skill of the witch or wizard. The fact that Harry pulled of spells like Sectumsempra just by reading the incantation, as well as spells like the Cruciatus and Imperius in his second and first try respectively shows that his apparent inability to learn magic faster is his failure as a student, not as a wizard.

I have never denied that there are a few aspects in which Hermione is ahead of Harry. Indeed, her ability to understand and apply theory /explained to her/ by someone quickly is much greater than Harry's. This makes her a better student, not a better witch/wizard.

Ron said that they would be better prepared for the O.W.L.S. Is this a generic sentence a kid would say when he's just looked up a lot of interesting stuff or is this a genuine analysis of his own skills? As Ron and Hermione have to actually learn and practice the spells in OotP, I'd say the former is a more canon-faithful interpretation.

Ron and Hermione's presence is clearly moral support, not educational. This is made apparent repetitively in canon. They learnt a lot of stuff themselves, sure. They didn't teach Harry, which should be obvious (as they weren't experts either).

Harry is a superior wizard due to his ability to get extraordinary results. Hermione is a better student due to her ability to learn faster. And Harry is a better duelist because of his magical /and/ physical prowess. Not just one of them.

Insisting on viewing Harry's duelling ability as a result of only his athleticism, while saying Hermione is a better witch /and/ student due to her ability to learn faster reveals an inherent bias against him. One which I do not share.

As for the whole inconsistencies thing, using a character's lowest showing to judge their ability is just unfair. If we "cherry-pick" the lowest of Harry's displays, then the same uncharitable treatment must be extended towards /all/ other characters. But that isn't an accurate way of gauging their estimated ability.

Eh? We were just talking about him learning spells and such and who taught whom. When I read that someone is "ahead" of their classmates, I read that as them learning material that others haven't yet---which means either learning faster or studying more. If what you meant was that Harry's spells are more powerful than others' of the same age, then why didn't you say so in the first place? (It's not particularly true except for the Patronus Charm, either, but that's a separate discussion.)

#+end_quote

Harry is far from the only one to knock people back with the Impediment Jinx, the Disarming Charm, Protego, etc., you know. Just do some keyword searches through the books.

By the way, I actually went back and looked up that scene. Basically, Harry ran on to the scene, hit some DEs who were distracted by fighting other people and not shielding or attacking him without a wand because savage werewolf. And then, the DEs ran away, because Snape had ordered a retreat, because their mission to assassinate Dumbledore had been accomplished. (And, Amycus was not knocked out, since Harry saw him running away right behind his sister immediately after.)

Oh, and the DEs were under orders /not/ to kill (or maim, presumably) Harry---at least according to Snape---which means fewer or no Dark curses aimed at him. I'd say that's about as good as an eighth's of a dose of Felix Felicis. Wouldn't you?

So, I don't think that it was a particularly interesting test of Harry's abilities, any more than the Diner scene in DH was Hermione's.

A related fun fact is that in the Department of Mysteries battle, the only one who was targeted with lethal and Dark magic was Hermione. The others---Harry and the pureblood children---were targeted with Stunners and hexes of the sort that can be healed quickly.

For that matter, there are far too many examples in canon where all kinds of magic is affected by emotional disposition and personality to call it "fanon". Off the top of my head Neville's progress, Lockhart's limitations, Harry's block on the Summoning Charm.

I didn't say Dark curses were easier to cast for an immoral person. I am saying that it makes all too much sense that Dark curses /want/ to be cast, make it easy to hurt and maim. It just seems like an interesting coincidence, that the only spells that Harry was able to cast without study or practice were the particularly nasty Dark curses. Now, Harry himself is more merciful than pretty much anyone else in the setting, including both of his friends, so I don't think it's about him, and so infer that it's about the curses.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Apologies for bluntness, but this is just plain untrue.

Firstly, it would be more accurate to say that there are a few aspects in which /Harry/ is ahead of /Hermione/. The only non-Dark magic that we see him master ahead of Hermione was Patronus, and that was because of the special lessons; he possibly learned the things he learned for TWT before Hermione---while Hermione was focused on helping him prepare. (More on that later.) Again, thanks to his non-magical traits, intense training, and experience, he is better applying the magic that he can do to combat than Hermione. On that, you won't get any disagreement from me. On everything else? Yes, Hermione is ahead of Harry.

Secondly, Hermione was casually learning spells from books alone before she even showed up at Hogwarts. Who explained them to her there? Her Muggle parents? Her casually showing up with a spell that Harry hasn't heard of is practically a running gag. Are these "biased" too?

During TWT, Ron and Hermione helped Harry research spells (and Harry mentions that explicitly), there is some speculation that Hermione invented the Four-Point Spell (though I think that's probably not the case), and they helped him practice his spells by casting jinxes at him. We don't get details, but to claim that they were just there for moral support is disingenuous.

On extraordinary results, how many of those did the others have the /opportunity/ to produce? Also, you do have things like a parchment jinx (again, researched from books and as a solo effort) that Madame Pomfrey couldn't reverse. Not as flashy as a Patronus, but pretty impressive, if you ask me.

The reason I seem to be uncharitable to Harry is that you are insisting on introducing highly exaggerated (in my opinion) descriptions of his performance and achievements, and I am stuck having to refute them.

Completely untrue. Neville was hit by a Cruciatus Curse from Bellatrix. Dolohov tried to use the same curse that hit Hermione on Harry too, who shielded/deflected it. Hermione was targeted by a potentially lethal spell just once. Stop using fanon theories.

So basically, anything Harry can do is only through some convenient detail which canon did not even mention? Sure.

Personality affects spells, sure. It doesn't replace the need for skill and knowledge. /That/ is fanon. Can't change it.

Again and again you put down Harry's achievements while using non-canonical extrapolations to hype Hermione up. No she didn't learn the spells Harry did. I've literally proved it multiple times. Super!Hermione ain't canon mate, as much as you wish it was.

"Hermione is ahead of Harry in everything" - peak Hermione fanboy sentence. Dark magic, Defense, Charms (not O.W.L.S., practical use), understanding of wands, Occlumency, horcruxes, duelling... Harry's knowledge is ahead of Hermione's in all of these. Hermione is better in Hogwarts subjects like Transfiguration, Potions and so on, sure. I've already addressed this.

Casually learning? In her own words, she tried a "few" spells. She didn't master first year material before the year began. It proves absolutely nothing, given that future Hermione /had to be taught by Harry/, and still got a lower result on her O.W.L. than him in DADA.

There is no speculation or proof that Hermione invented the Four Point Spell. Its origins are unknown. More fanon nonsense.

And to claim Hermione and Ron actually learnt the spells Harry did goes against canon, but you've been doing it a lot eh?

The DA had the chance to practice the Patronus. A handful of them were successful (in the books). And none showed any ability of being as good at it as Harry was.

The Parchment Jinx - Impressive, sure. Half as good as the Patronus? Not even close. A Patronus that can drive away a hundred Dementors? Forget it.

I've exaggerated Harry's feats? I'm the only one referring to canon in every other sentence here. And unlike you, I haven't used "examples" from fanfiction either. I'm yet to see a single "refutal" that I haven't debunked.

Here's the difference - I'm taking a charitable or /atleast/ neutral stance towards all the characters, while you're viewing a choice few characters (first and foremost being Hermione) in the most favourable light and attempting to show Harry in negative light, often using fanon "facts" in your insistence to do so.

If you're far too enamoured with Hermione and dislike Harry, that isn't on me. The fact that your post history is basically "Smart/Indy Harry fics bad hurr durr" while hailing Indy!Hermione fics as the pinnacle of fanfiction (which are basically just Indy!Harry fics with Hermione in his place) is just more proof of this.

It's not my job to address your apparent, irrational hate of Harry. That's on you. Not me, not the books, and not on derivative fanfiction either.

Call it cop-out, if you want. You're not particularly above using them yourself. You've basically repeated yourself - multiple times - while dismissing all counterpoints without disproving them.

In my opinion, of course. Make of that what you will.

  Harry was not aware of releasing George, all he knew was that a second later both of them were sprinting towards Malfoy. He had completely forgotten that all the teachers were watching: all he wanted to do was cause Malfoy as much pain as possible; with no time to draw out his wand, he merely drew back the fist clutching the Snitch and sank it as hard as he could into Malfoy's stomach --

  ‘Harry! HARRY! GEORGE! NO!'

  He could hear girls' voices screaming, Malfoy yelling, George swearing, a whistle blowing and the bellowing of the crowd around him, but he did not care. Not until somebody in the vicinity yelled ‘Impedimenta!' and he was knocked over backwards by the force of the spell, did he abandon the attempt to punch every inch of Malfoy he could reach.

  ‘What do you think you're doing?' screamed Madam Hooch, as Harry leapt to his feet. It seemed to have been her who had hit him with the Impediment Jinx; she was holding her whistle in one hand and a wand in the other; her broom lay abandoned several feet away. Malfoy was curled up on the ground, whimpering and moaning, his nose bloody; George was sporting a swollen lip; Fred was still being forcibly restrained by the three Chasers, and Crabbe was cackling in the background. ‘I've never seen behaviour like it -- back up to the castle, both of you, and straight to your Head of House's office!

Sorry, I was in a hurry and hadn't mentioned that, because for all its unforgiveablness, Cruciatus is the one curse that isn't actually damaging without prolonged exposure, so it was immaterial.

You're right about Dolohov trying to curse Harry with that spell later, too---it was after the grown-ups had shown up, and I didn't remember that part as well. It's actually a pretty odd combination of things: Dolohov hit Neville with a /Dancing Feet Spell/, then tried to curse Harry with a similar curse to the one he had cast at Hermione, even though they were under standing orders not to kill Harry.

In any case, you are right, and I withdraw my claim. I think there is evidence that at least pureblood kids were treated with kid gloves (like the above-mentioned dancing feet spell for Neville). With respect to Harry, my updated canon is now that Dolohov's original threat was a bluff, then after Harry Petrified him, he got mad and forgot himself. (Unless, is there a good reason Voldemort would have standing orders to leave Harry for him in late HBP but not in late OotP?)

Now, please do me a favour and reread the HBP scene. It's not nearly as glorious as you make it out to be.

  Personality affects spells, sure. It doesn't replace the need for skill and knowledge. That is fanon. Can't change it.
#+end_quote

Never said it did. But it's one of several factors, one that you seem to be inclined to neglect.

#+begin_quote
  Again and again you put down Harry's achievements while using non-canonical extrapolations to hype Hermione up. No she didn't learn the spells Harry did. I've literally proved it multiple times. Super!Hermione ain't canon mate, as much as you wish it was.
#+end_quote

Mate, I already wrote that there are, possibly, non-Patronus spells that Harry learned before Hermione, because, like I said, Hermione and Ron were helping Harry practice, because Harry had the TWT, and they didn't. Heck, he might have even helped her master some of them---get them to the point of usefulness.

#+begin_quote
  "Hermione is ahead of Harry in everything" - peak Hermione fanboy sentence. Dark magic, Defense, Charms (not O.W.L.S., practical use), understanding of wands, Occlumency, horcruxes, duelling... Harry's knowledge is ahead of Hermione's in all of these. Hermione is better in Hogwarts subjects like Transfiguration, Potions and so on, sure. I've already addressed this.
#+end_quote

Let's see... Dark Magic---maybe; I don't know if the Parchment Jinx counts, and I don't know whether this is a competition one actually wants to win. Defense and duelling, I am happy to agree, with the provisos mentioned. Charms, other than Patronus, needs a bit of an elaboration, since Hermione casually pulls off stuff like the Protean Charm on a large scale and the Undetectable Extension Charm. Wandlore is generally unimportant outside of the very specific circumstances Harry and only Harry was dealing with. Occlumency Harry never got anywhere with, and his substitute would only work against Voldemort because he was allergic to Harry's mind, and not anyone else; and it's not like anyone offered Hermione lessons. Horcruxes? By the end of DH, Hermione actually knows how to make one. (Though, again, I am not sure that's a competition one wants to win.) :P

And, well, /most/ magic is Hogwarts subjects. Most of what you list is stuff idiosyncratic to Harry's specific adventures.

#+begin_quote
  Casually learning? In her own words, she tried a "few" spells. She didn't master first year material before the year began. It proves absolutely nothing, given that future Hermione had to be taught by Harry, and still got a lower result on her O.W.L. than him in DADA.
#+end_quote

I didn't say she mastered things. You keep putting words in my mouth like this; please don't. The point was she tried them, and they worked; I only brought it up because you made various claims that she does well mainly when it's explained to her.

The DADA OWL is not surprising: it doesn't matter how good your /Ridikkulus/ is, if you are paralysed with fear by the Boggart. Also, it's not clear whether anyone other than Harry got an opportunity for bonus marks for casting a Patronus---the dialogue suggests that it was special treatment, but it's open to interpretation.

The Four Point Spell possibility is mentioned in the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Four-Point_Spell][wiki]]. Like I said, it's speculation, and I put a low probability on it myself.

And nobody disputes Harry's enormous Patronus. We've all seen it.

#+begin_quote
  If you're far too enamoured with Hermione and dislike Harry, that isn't on me. The fact that your post history is basically "Smart/Indy Harry fics bad hurr durr" while hailing Indy!Hermione fics as the pinnacle of fanfiction (which are basically just Indy!Harry fics with Hermione in his place) is just more proof of this.
#+end_quote

My favourite fics are actually ensemble casts that include Harry as a co-equal member, followed by Hermione-centric non-romance (all dozen of them), followed by Ron-centric fics. My favorite pairings---to the extend I have them---are the canon ones, though perhaps one day I may find a Krumione fic where their personalities hadn't been excised.

My supposed hatred of Harry? Let me explain. The problem with Harry as a fanfic character is that outside of the whole Prophecy-BWL-Voldemort thing, he's just uninteresting; and it doesn't help that Ron and Hermione have much better defined personalities and ambitions, and more interesting flaws. And the best evidence for this is that even Smart/Indy!Harry writers seem to agree with me, if we judge their deeds rather than their words: overwhelmingly, the first thing they do in their fics is rewrite Harry's personality, insecurities, interests, strengths, weakness, goals, and even values to the point where he might as well be named "Bob". Just look at the most popular and respected fics in those genres. And, over the process, they often drop the very things that made Harry's point of view in canon compelling.

If you're going to dig through my posting history, look at the fics I recommend and the fics I criticise. Or, just ask me what fics I would recommend without reservation.

************************** Don't get me wrong---Harry can be /very/ fun to read. One of my favourite one-shots of all time is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118202/1/In-Which-Sirius-Can-t-Tell-a-Story-to-Save-His-Life]]), for example, which does an amazing job of capturing Harry's smart mouth. And yet, it seems that the more highly an author thinks of Harry, the more eager they seem to be to replace Harry with an OC with the same name (adjusted for gender) and similar background.

The fics that actually manage to use Harry well without erasing nearly everything that makes him him tend to have ensemble casts, with linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl]]) being the best example off the top of my head. I don't think that's a coincidence. Harry works best with his friends, and peeling him away from them diminishes him---and to a large extent, so does reducing them to "moral support".

Stepping back to a more overarching plot---and here's what I mean by "uninteresting"---consider a thought experiment: keep Harry's basic personality, values, interests, and decision making ability as they were at the start of Hogwarts, but make him a magical genius on the level of Dumbledore and Riddle. How would it change what he chooses to do? I am not asking how it would change the canon storyline---those are almost always things that happen /to/ Harry, and being a genius would liberate him from many of those constraints. He gets to do with his life basically anything he wants.

My read on his character is that, if he has to do less work to get the same results, and if his confrontations are resolved easily, he will spend more time hanging out with his friends and playing games---and being happier. Good for him, sure, but you'd need to throw genius-sized challenges at him to him to do anything interesting.

Now, do that with Ron. Ron isn't that different (which is a big part of why they clicked), but an important aspect of his character is his insecurity about his overachieving brothers. Now, if he's the next Dumbledore, how would he act on that insecurity? Probably in ways that create interesting conflicts.

It's similar with Hermione, but even more so. She'd be actually following in Dumbledore's footsteps, working to Fix the World (whether the world wants it or not). She'd be stepping on people's toes---with the weight of an elephant. That's the sort of thing interesting conflict is made of.

I am genuinely interested in what your read on this scenario is.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This is the exact same thing - increasing the amount of conflict Hermione faces to create tension.

Harry would not be content with sitting about and doing nothing. His ambition was to be an Auror and fight dark wizards. In HBP, he clearly stated his intention to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters, /and/ kill as many of them as he could.

As for the "OC with Harry's name" part, that happens to be one of the worst arguments I've read. Personality is /supposed/ to change based on the challenges a person faces. If Harry grows and undergoes a change in personality, that's perfectly alright. On the Way to Greatness does this very, very well.

In any case, Hermione and Ron undergo massive changes in most fics which have them as MCs. They become more confident, leaving behind their canon insecurities, become more outspkoen, take on characteristics that Harry showed in canon (foolish bravery and quick-thinking being the most common traits) and are more inclined towards "leadership". Examples include Speed and Fate (both Ron-centric) and ACA and Arithmancer (both Hermione-centric).

It seems particularly unfair to demand that Harry remain the same as his canon self in all fics while Hermione and Ron are allowed to be changed according to the needs of the plot.

Why must Harry start of with his canon values? Canon Harry is basically the pinnacle of the modern "Perfect Hero" template. Brave, gallant, quick-thinking, cunning and smart only in stressful situations (but not when dealing with unimportant rivals), he's able to keep a cool head in situations others don't deal with well and holds himself to his own high moral standards.

This is pretty much what most "hero" characters have been for over a century. Superman, Thor, Luke Skywalker, Wonder Woman... Heck, even Spider-Man, although he's supposed to be a genius, ends up with a "brain-freeze" unless the plot demands otherwise.

Starting with a character like this is extremely lazy. It's much better to show a genius!Harry eventually grow into these characteristics and resemble canon Harry in many ways, hence /becoming/ a hero as opposed to natually being one. As far as I can see, this might be the general direction Victoria Potter is heading towards.

To tie down Harry to his canon traits /and/ character arc oppresively and declare that OP!Harry is boring, while applying no such rules to hypothetical scenarios involving Hermione and Ron is beyond unfair. It's hypocrisy at it's finest, no offense.

If Harry's outlook and studiousness towards magic is being increased to set him up as a Dumbledore-like wizard(while keeping his canon personality), the plot /must/ change. Not doing so would only lead to making all the characters around him look stupid at best, or outright bash them. What You Leave Behind is perhaps the best fic that demonstrates this. Canon Harry with incentive and drive to be a magical genius, faces an appropriate amount of challenges to make the story interesting.

Let's just say we reverse the kind of examples you're providing -

A more powerful Harry would take a more active role in the struggle against Voldemort. Voldemort would adjust to this Harry's superior intellect and create more complex plans to beat him. Harry's fight against the Death Eaters and Voldemort ends up being quite interesting.

Super!Ron is still jealous, still has an inferiority complex, still envies Harry at times and doesn't step up and accept his feelings for over 6 years. He ends up wasting his potential as he has to overcome his own personal problems. Boring.

Super!Hermione is still friendless, craves companianship and support, displays a crippling need for approval and fails to step up. Boring again.

See how that's unfair to characters you're favouring?

A hypothetical story is only as interesting as you're willing to let it be.

**************************** I'll try to be brief. I think you've mostly made my case for me: Harry is a generic hero archetype, if a particularly reactive one. He says that he wants to destroy Voldemort and DEs---because they've hurt him and people around him (as I believe he says in that very same conversation, or maybe a nearby one). He becomes a wizard detective pretty much out of familiarity with the job, and it happens to be a job where he sits and waits for someone to commit a crime.

My thought experiment was not about what kind of a fanfic one could write but rather about trying to understand what drives the character. Also, I specifically gave them "genius", as opposed to things like drive, studiousness, and other things that are a part of personality, interests, and values, all of which are staying fixed at least at the start. Most of your predictions modify the latter or if not, and Harry plays a bigger role in the struggle because of greater talent alone, that's still in response to Voldemort. The idea is not particularly new---in the immortal words of Robert G. Ingersoll "If you want to find out what a man is to the bottom, give him power."

Given all you just wrote about Harry, can you really blame me for thinking that he's uninteresting outside of an [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredToTheParty?from=Main.EigenPlot][eigen plot]]?

And, of course Harry (or any other character) would behave differently---and develop differently---in response to a different set of circumstances. But, how many fics bother to even begin to sketch out that evolution, rather than just going full HINO? One of the many reasons OtWtG is so great (and so tragically abandoned) is how diligently the author charts his path. (I've recommended OtWtG quite often, you'll find, and I've written my share of criticism about Hermione-in-name-only.)

I take your point about having a HINO evolve /into/ a hero, and it's a framework I haven't considered before and will take on board. Thank you for introducing me to it. The problem I see with it in this situation is that it apples equally to pretty much any character: from Abbott to Zabini, or an actual OC.

** It doesn't make her into a background character, but linkffn(Coven by Naidhe) does have her drift away from Ron and Harry in a realistic way.

The simplest way to turn her into a background character is probably just not have her be friends with them at all in the first place. Just make it so the Troll never happens and they stop being in each other's radars after a while.

The thing is that the biggest hurdle you'll be facing if you want her to drift away after they're already friends is that canon!Hermione is both extremely proactive and stupidly loyal. Shaking her off will be very difficult. More importantly, it would be up to Ron and Harry to actively shake her - like the Firebolt and Scabbers fight for example.

That said, the most realistic way to have Hermione drift away from Harry and Ron is to play with her politics. Have her become frustrated with Ron's callousness with creature rights for example or get frustrated with Harry's passivity. Have Harry and Ron focus on their day-to-day lives while she puts more time and effort into her advocacies, missions, or the like. You can do this any time starting PoA, but especially in OotP and DH.

Another way is to play with her ruthlessness. This would need a bit of tweaking on Harry and Ron's character, but you can have them be a bit more uncomfortable with her "ends justifies the means" mentality. (I say tweak because Ron and Harry in canon are probably even more callous and willing to do immoral things than Hermione is - she just happens to be more capable.)

The boys will probably have to be the ones who will to do the friendship break-up in both cases.

**** Ron being callous about creature rights is perfectly in character. We see this with the elves, the giants, the goblins, and the werewolves. He doesn't change his mind about the elves until DH for example.

Harry's passivity is in the books too. He was on Ron's side about the elves, but kept quiet. He preferred to play quidditch and fuck around with Ginny as opposed to putting all of his effort in getting Slughorn's memory for instance. The second task in the Triwizard tournament was so nerve-wracking because Harry didn't want to deal with it until the last minute.

How is my suggestion bashing them when these things are perfectly in character for them? Harry and Ron do not stop having flaws just because you like them.

I'm guessing you'd have preferred that it be Hermione's insensitivity that drives Harry and Ron away. And it's believable for Ron, but that's bashing /Harry/ - Harry whose biggest virtue is forgiveness. I was assuming that the suggestions should keep all the characters in character.

I'm suggesting that the writer make Hermione more impatient than she was in the books. Have her get frustrated faster so she looks for friends with priorities that are more in line with hers. Then boom. Suddenly she's running in a different circle.

#+begin_quote
  Proof
#+end_quote

Sure. The polyjuice plan where she drugged and impersonated her classmates. The Rita Skeeter kidnapping and blackmailing scheme. The SNEAK jinx in the DA.

These are all things that Ron and Harry heartily approved of, but it was Hermione who knew how to plan, strategize, /and/ do the necessary magic to pull these off. So between the long-term planning and her greater magical ability? Yes, Hermione is more capable.

You go to Harry and Ron if you want someone bludgeoned to death. Otherwise, it's Hermione for the more complicated stuff.

(An aside, but the DA was more of Hermione's leadership than Harry's. He's the figurehead who teaches. The most he set was the schedule. She's the one who had the vision, did the actual planning, recruited both the students and instructor, motivated said instructor, and disciplined the traitor. Heck, we see this best in the very first meeting of the DA. Even when everyone looked to Harry as leader, it was /Hermione/ who set the agenda and led that meeting while Harry floundered.

And I know I know the people looked to Harry - but leadership is more complicated than just being liked enough that people follow you. A person followed but with no actual power is called a figurehead. As I demonstrated above.)

You're suggestion makes them less intelligent than they are, and assumes that they don't have the potential to change. Harry can stop being passive. Ron can become more sensitive. If the author chooses to make Hermione more ruthless and proactive, and doesn't extend any of that goodwill to Harry and Ron, that's bashing.

Greater magical ability... She had to be taught by Harry in the DA, it was Harry who drove a hundred Dementors away and it was Harry who resisted Voldemort's Imperius, but sure, Hermione has greater magical ability. The Hermione Bias is getting too thick now.

Also, Hermione is not the leader of the DA. Planning stuff doesn't make her the leader. Harry taught the DA, he was the best at magic among all of them, he decided the lessons and spells to be taught by himself and he motivated the DA to learn more. When Hermione struggled with the Patronus, it was Harry who helped her.

All the stuff you mentioned makes her an enforcer, not the ultimate position of power. Harry is not a figurehead. When push comes to shove, /Harry/ is the one everyone looks to, not Hermione. This is made quite clear in HBP, where Hermione panicked and looked to Harry when the Death Eaters invaded the castle.

Your entire comment seems to focus on glorifying everything Hermione does as much as possible while writing off Harry's achievements.

In any case, my original point still stands. OP wanted Hermione to be a background character, not the main protagonist.

It's clear from the start as he's the main motivator and order giver. But for all of my dislike of the last 3 books, she does have Harry fully step into that role when he needs to.

When he keeps the DEs distracted in the DOM while coming up with a plan is my favorite. But having them patrol the school while he's away like Dumbledore has the order do was a nice touch.

Yeah, I agree. That's my point, really. I just picked the most obvious example I could think of.

+1 on the DoM part. The last 3 books nerfed Harry's potential a lot, but his actions in the third act of both OotP and HBP are quite fuckin' good. If only JKR had maintained that throughout the books...

****** OP wanted a point of divergence such that Hermione is written out of the picture without bashing. I proposed that given canon characterization at certain points in canon, they use said canonical characterization (eg. Ron's callousness in GoF, Harry's passivity in HBP) to drive Hermione away so that she makes new friends and does her business elsewhere.

OP did not ask us to write the plot or the character arcs for them. I have not claimed that Ron and Harry cannot change. Only that in certain places in canon (ie. specific moments in time), pushing certain character traits could drive the wedge OP wanted. They can change after wedge has become irreparable - I don't know, that wasn't what OP asked of us.

I'm going to admit that I forgot to add Hermione's canonical feelings of frustration and impatience to the mix (I thought it would have been obvious tbh). So I added it in my second reply, and I am now reiterating it here. Hermione's impatience kicks. Give her a group that is more in line with her priorities. Boom. No more Hermione in the story. She is too busy campaigning in the background to have time for Harry and Ron.

Anyway, I am not solely crediting Hermione for the polyjuice plan. I'm pointing out that the planning was all hers. I'm highlighting the ability for planning that neither Harry nor Ron exhibit. That makes her more capable at creating and executing complicated plans.

As for Rita Skeeter, why is Hermione's greater ability to gather information - and /use/ that information - not make her more capable? I am referring to capable as in able to execute. And she executed something that neither Harry nor Ron did. That makes her more capable (at planning and executing).

As for the DA, yes Harry /taught/. That makes him a /teacher/. Teaching involves skills in both expertise and leadership. The things you pointed out (eg. communicating information, and setting the curriculum - which we have no evidence he did by the way) fall under expertise. Leadership skills in teaching such as motivation, administration, and discipline were all done and decided by Hermione.

(Planning is also a leadership skill by the way.)

Put it this way, Harry is the teacher, Hermione is the principal. The administrative (ie. leadership) position is Hermione's not Harry's.

Now about Hermione only being an enforcer. That is only possible if Harry created the policies upon which she is enforcing. But Hermione created the policies too (ie. secrecy, vision, goals). If anything, it is the other way around. Hermione set the goals (eg. teach students how to defend themselves properly), and Harry is enforcing that. And he is enforcing it in the structure Hermione built.

About HBP, I thought we were arguing about Harry and Hermione in the DA? That was what I was talking about when I called Harry a figurehead. Your evidence is outside the scope of the argument.

Final point: again, I did not suggest a plot or character arc for the OP. I'm simply pointing out a point of divergence that would write Hermione out. OP can easily use my suggestion and have her do centaur campaigns in the background that Harry and Ron have absolutely no interest in. They can have Harry and Ron do their missions while Hermione is preoccupied doing something else after they ditch her for her methods.

(Also, I just pointed out her ruthlessness. How exactly is that glorifying her?)

I don't know. I'm not the one writing the plot or the character arcs.

Anyway, I'm ending the conversation here. You and OP can do what you wish with my suggestions.

No, it isn't. Harry /ordered/ the DA to keep an eye out. Ordered. Which, quite obviously, makes him the leader. As much as /you/ want her to be, Hermione isn't the leader. She didn't go ahead with the plan until Harry agreed and approved. That makes her the sole member of the planning committee, not the leader of the entire organisation.

Anyways, the rest of your comment is suitably covered by this-

*** I /love/ Coven! Whenever anyone asks for feminist themed, female friendship focused or realistic dark Hermione recs, Coven is my go to recommendation. It's the bane of my life that it's likely abandoned.

I could definitely see Hermione throwing herself into politics and seeing the things the boys get up to each year as small fry distractions. For example, have her be too busy organising for the liberation of mermaids to be able to spare energy for Harry's Triwizard adventures.

** On Halloween 1991, Harry and Ron are looking forward to the feast.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.

  And that way, it remained, until they reached the Gryffindor Common Room, where Percy had led them, after all the hubbub about the troll, and a headcount revealed Hermione Granger was missing.

  She was searched for immediately, but it was too late: The troll had somehow managed to climb up to the third floor, and a first year witch, no matter how clever, was no match for an angry troll. Hogwarts was very solemn when Headmaster Dumbledore announced her death at breakfast the next morning.

** I mean the best way is just to not have her interact with Harry as much as she does in cannon. Like don't have her show up on the train with Neville and maybe have her go to another house. Don't have the troll corner her and don't have Ron pick on her etc, fill thouse scenes with other bodys.

I think having her fade into the background could be a bit problematic though, as her part in the 'golden trio' friendship is pretty important. If you are writing her out cause she is hard to write than I would suggest keeing her in as a challenge to become a better writer. Alternatively, you could tweak her character all you want, this is your work after all.
