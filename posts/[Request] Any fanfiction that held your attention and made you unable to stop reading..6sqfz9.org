I've read a lot of fanfic lately and noticed I was getting bored of things that were "meh".

Please recommend fics that you are unable to put down.

** When I first read "Against the Moon" linkffn(7305052), I literally could not put it down. And it's a REALLY long story. I think I read nonstop for days. The author recently started updating it again (a chapter every other day or so), and I'm powerless. I have to immediately stop what I'm doing to read. I've never come across a fanfiction author that writes their characters better than Stoplight Delight.

***** Linked elsewhere in the thread, HP and the Prince of Slytherin. HP and the Accidental Horcrux linkffn(11762850), and The Pureblood Pretense(7613196) are all phenomally engrossing stories. Another fic I don't see recommended as often but find equally engrossing is linkffn(7469856). Most else of what I'd recommend (and even some of the ones I just listed) tend to be rec'd pretty often on here.

If you're interested in fics from Firefly, Naruto, or Superman, I've got a few I can recommend that are of similar quality to these ones we've listed.

****** For Firefly, I've got three I recommend by default.

A Man of Principle linkffn(5106208) and it's sequels are amazing. They deepen every member of the crew and even some characters outside of it (you really WON'T look at Badger the same way after reading A Man of Principle).

Forward linkffn(4099993) is more action heavy but also boasts some excellent character development. The RiverThink moments can be frustrating to read (I just tend to skim them), so if you can't take that, make sure you just read the Last Man episode (starts on CH 66 of the fic); the story of the Six Rifles and Jayne could easily be a standalone fic and is amazing.

Two Gorram Days linkffn(3272960) and its sequels are classifed (on TVTropes at least) as shipping fics (River/Jayne, specifically, though everyone on the crew gets paired up by the end). I've never enjoyed "shipping" fics, but I really do love this series. Again, it's a far more nuanced portrayal of Jayne and an interesting look at why River might fit well with him, but it's also an AU since it starts pre-Miranda and goes a little ways past it.

Only have one to rec for Superman, but it's top notch. The Metropolitan Man linkffn(10360716) is an sympathetic look at Lex Luthor, as well as an exploration of what a competent Lex might do when confronted with an all-powerful alien. I think it was inspired by Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, but I don't remember it being as insufferable as HPMoR. It's been a while since I've read it though.

If you've got any other favorites to recommend, I'd love to hear them!

******* Nice, I'll definitely check those out. I've got some recs for sure but I'm not sure they are quite in the same league as the ones I posted earlier, although some might disagree.

Linkffn(12511998; 9860311; 10493620; 11132113; 4828132; 9036071; 11933512; 3557725; 3078469; 5856625)

- *Wind Shear* is a time travel fic and gets right into it from the beginning. There are some cool bits of magic and battles. Points for being the only completed one on this list(as is the way with most great fanfic)

- *A long Journey Home* is great and while a bit heavier on the introspection/exposition than a lot of what I've posted, the writing is quality.

- Both *The House of Potter* and *Ruthless* I'd consider a lesson on how to properly pace a story. They are both very different from each other but have a unique and engaging style of writing.

- *The Difference One Man Can Make* is a Game of Thrones crossover where harry essentially starts his own faction. I have only seen season 1 of GoT years ago when it first aired but didn't have too much trouble following the plot.

- *The Ascension of Ra* drops Harry into Smallville right in the thick of the things. It's listed as Harry/Lois and while there is some tension there, I don't think anything significant actually happened before before it was abandoned. Focus is mostly on the wider plots going on around Smallville. It's one of my favorite crossovers.

- *With Strength of Steel Wing*s was once a pretty regularly recommended fic on this sub but I figured I'd be thorough because it's excellent and has a ton of content. A bit more angst than a lot of what I've recommended but still solid

- *Forging the Sword* has solid writing the whole way through. You'll enjoy the dialogue as much as the various action/revalations. Some of the best canon characterizations I've read while still growing in a believable way with the story.

- *Changes in a Time of War* and it's sequel *A Second Chance At Life* has probably some of the best world building of any fic I've come across. It's a classic though I don't see it mentioned as often as I think it should be. It's so AU that it's pretty much a major departure from Harry Potter in general. The supporting cast and even the plot with Voldemort take a back seat to OCs and new antagonists.

- *The Return of the Marauders* is probably a more questionable addition to this list and a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine. It's completely ridiculous in a lot of parts and it has flaws but I still enjoyed it. There is a lot of banter/action and a larger focus on romance than most of the fics I've posted but pretty much zero angst which is why I liked it. This one is also completed.

Pretty much every fic here is going to be light on angst and feature an either confident or very competent Harry and a lot of times both. Those are the fics I gravitate to. You've prob read quite a few of them but I figured I'd be thorough just in case.

******** Have read and enjoyed Forging the Sword and A Long Journey Home and agree they're top quality. I started reading WSoSW after I read through Blindness (by the same author) and couldn't get into it because I found the writing aggravating :\ The rest are all new to me and intriguing. I'm starting with Wind Shear, because it's not often you come across the trifecta of 1. Time Travel, 2. Complete, and 3. Quality.

******** Quick update based on what I've read so far:

-Read Wind Shear and enjoyed it quite a bit. Harry did feel a bit too overpowered for the stakes to really be high, but otherwise it was quality. Just rec'd it to someone else.

-The House of Potter and Ruthless are both excellent as well. I thought Ruthless had a fascinating exposition method, as it was pretty sparse on details (which is necessary when rehashing canon) but that's totally in character for Harry due to his personality in the story.

-Started The Ascension of Ra and Return of the Marauders, but I couldn't get into either. AoR had Harry being too overpowered and RotM felt like EVERYONE was out of character in a bad way.

-Still holding off on Changes and it's sequel, as the very AU stories require some time investment on my part, since it's practically a new world.

TL;DR you're awesome, thanks!

********* Wow, glad you're enjoying them. Changes is actually the sequel to A Second Chance at Life linkffn(2488754). I got that reversed. I will say that the earlier part of the story hits on some cliches(as is sometimes the case with older stories) but once it starts to move on from cannon and explore some of the OCs it gets better.

I'm not sure if you've read the classics as I assume most people have but I could link the ones I know if you're interested. They are high quality. Also [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/][Scryer]] is a good search tool for finding some quality fics if you sort by DLP Review Score.

I'll have to get to reading on your list soon. I'm still finishing up Hail Odysseus which someone else in this thread linked.

Iv noticed that many of the animeXHP crossovers especially those that are from shonen anime i have a hard time putting down.

I have read Mystic Knight online, linkffn(11815818) and I really like it. I do think the dialogue can get a touch irritating at times. sometimes I feel as if the author treats the characters as somewhat mary-sue ish, or just unrealistically mature for their age.

******** I would say that while you might be confused about a few things as the fic starts it explains enough about the series that you should be able to follow through, because Shirou the MC needs to explain his position to Louise.

Though if im not mistaken the version of Shirou that Louise summons is actually from another fanfiction, which is fairly common among the Fate community. Alternate dimensions is part of the series lore so fanfics blend together sometimes within the community.

There are some aspects of Shirou as a character that may not be explained very well and because of that some scenes may not come across the same way as it would to a fate fan but i dont remember which way it goes.

I would say give it a shot and if you get really confused about im willing to answer questions for you or you could check the wikia to clear something up but i dont think its necessary.

I'd post more, but finding all of these stories has exhausted me. I'm pretty tired tonight. Not to mention it's going to take months, if not years to read all of them, depending on how much time you have.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

  Between Quidditch practice, pranking, Hermione Granger, detention (or, rather, gettting out of it), and, not to mention, helping the escaped convict Sirius Black, Fred Weasley doesn't have time to be a werewolf. But such is his new life, and he can't laugh it off this time.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

** The first time I read linkffn(A Cadmean Victory), I pulled an all-nighter. The skipped lecture and messed-up biological clock were so worth it!

Similarly, I could not stop myself from just clicking 'next chapter' the first time I read linkffn(Deprived by The Crimson Lord), although reaching the abrupt end where it has been left unfinished was and still is very disappointing.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

Isn't that the one where Katie Bell is artificially stupid (like Ron bashing level stupid) in order to drive the plot forwards because the author was unable to kill their beginning relationship in any rational way?
