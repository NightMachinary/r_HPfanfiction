To me it always seemed a bit suspicious that the Weasleys suddenly won the Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw after Second year.

I don't think that the Weasleys Rigged it themselves they would see themselves as above that but maybe someone that knows the Weasleys wont take anything they think of as Charity Decided to do it. after all it was Hardly a secret that Ginny was Taken in the Chamber of Secrets and almost Died and Arthur is well liked. I could almost see Lucius Malfoy doing it as sort of anonymous Bribe to Keep the Weasleys Quiet about his Involvement in giving Ginny the diary.

SO any stories were it is no coincidence that the Weasleys won the Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw after Second year?


** Nah. What is amazing is that they immediately splurged it all and had none of it left within months. Does that mean the Weasleys were destined to be impoverished forever?

*** I think that was just J.K. Rolling being bad at math again

The Weasleys won 700 Galleons just 300 less than the 1000 Galleons got for winning the Triwizard tournament that harry gave the twins and considering what the twins were able to do with that 1000 Galleons it just doesn't add up.

Unless Arthur and Molly were in Debt and they used most of the 700 Galleons to pay off the Debt with out telling the kids about it while using the holiday as an excuse for why the money was used up so quickly.

**** Another thing to remember is that George and Fred had been selling their products for at least a year at school before opening the store. They had enough money to make a big bet with Bagman, they had all the products they were selling before Umbridge drove them out. The 1000 galleons put them over the top but it may have been just enough for first and last months lease and enough capital to get product into the store. They weren't likely to have purchased the store-front in Diagon Alley, would've needed way more than that.

*** I like to think they did it for Ginny. She just came out of the Chamber of Secrets the previous school year, and it's possible they just want to take Ginny's mind off of that traumatic event.
