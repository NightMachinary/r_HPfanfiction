I constantly see them referred to as the evilest of all evil things, the most terrible and darkest of arts, in both Canon and fanon. I've seen so many fics where the death eaters abandon Voldemort after finding out he created some, because it's that unimaginable that someone would stoop so low as to create horcruxes. Even Magicke Mister Evile calls it the "wickedest of magical inventions". But like... Why?

Sure, you've got to murder someone. But that doesn't really make it any worse than avada kedavra. And it's not like murder is completely taboo - hell, Molly Weasley kills Bellatrix, and I don't think she regrets it.

So the purported evilness of a horcrux is probably related to either the splitting of a soul, or immortality being intrinsically evil. But these are both pretty vague.

What is a soul, and why is splitting it so bad (but having a dementor eat one is a completely fine element of the criminal justice system)? And even then, isn't splitting your own soul more an act of self harm more akin to say doing drugs than hurting other people?

I've seen people take the 'immortality is wrong' angle by saying it throws life/magic/the universe 'out of balance' (usually in MOD!Harry fics). This one kinda makes sense, I guess, but it's still very abstract and feels more like a religious wrong than a spiritual wrong.

What are your thoughts? Why are horcruxes in particular so bad?


** I've always thought that splitting your soul makes moving on to the "next great adventure" impossible, and that you'll be stuck in limbo forever. Plus, I took Voldemort's insanity and less than stellar planning and actions as a consequence of messing with his soul. Once resurrected he seemed more like a mad dog than the charismatic magical genius he was meant to be.

Also you can't prove immortality, if you survive to the heat death of the universe but die then, then you weren't immortal. If you can survive beyond the heat death of the universe then I feel sorry for you being horrifically cursed, you still need to keep living to prove your immortal though.

It would better explain ultimate evil too because there's obviously an afterlife in the hp universe so stopping a soul (even your own) from moving on would be worse than murder.

** I was thinking about this way too much probably, but Rowling said there is something you have to do to split your soul and put it inside an object aside from just murdering someone. If all you needed to do was murder, there would be horcruxes willy nilly.

Also, when Myrtle was killed Tom didn't even do it himself. It was his fault because he was messing around with a giant killer snake, but she accidentally saw its eyes when it came out of the sink pipe. He definitely didn't regret her dying, but he didn't go out of his way to murder her himself, which suggests a whole other complex step is involved with the splitting and binding it inside something.

There was an interview where JK said that when she told her publisher how a horcrux is made, it actually made him throw up. So then she decided not to release the information publicly. I don't know if that's true or if she just said that to generate hype, but I started thinking about what would be that gross.

Some people have guessed cannibalism. Because that is friggin gross. We don't know what the condition of Myrtle's body was when it was found, but we do know the Riddles died without a mark on them and it was very mysterious to the muggle police. We also know muggle forensics are a lot more thorough than wizards, so they probably would have noticed people magically missing organs or something.

The only thing I could think of that is super barf-worthy and wouldn't maim or leave marks on the corpses of the victims is necrophilia. Which is really, really gross. And would explain the level of horror and grossed out-ness Regulus experienced when he discovered Voldemort had made a horcrux. And also why Slughorn might be so reluctant to even have a scholarly type of discussion with a student about it. .

****** Biography. My Son, The Killer: The Untold Story of Luka Magnotta

I would not recommend reading it. It's only one paragraph (the book on a whole is just... dull), but I swear to God, it left me a wreck. The author (a friend of the killer? The book does contain the actual murderer's words, but not for this bit, I remembered) described the contents of a video. Necrophilia, defilement, murder, rape. The crimes were horrific, but nothing could compare to the devoid of empathy tone he wrote it in, before proceeding to write a passionate paragraph on how immoral it was to kill kittens.

It made me sick, not even because of the actions, but the crude terms he put it in. As if the life of this student and his horrific torture was nothing more than casual viewing, but killing kittens was worthy of execution (don't get me wrong, I hate animal abuse as much as the next person).

One of those things you can't unread, really. Though I wish I could.

Anyway. No, I don't believe that JK could make them sick with her descriptions. Would take a better author than her.

**** Same, but it still did make me wonder what would be so gross that it would cause those reactions in someone. Or even the reactions we see from characters in canon.

Cannibalism is gross, but when you read The Hairy Heart in the Tales of Beedle the Bard there's a part at the end where the wizard literally cuts the heart out of the young woman he just murdered and people find him sitting their licking her bloody heart in his hands. And that was a wizarding child's bedtime story, so I don't think cannibalism could have caused the abject horror we saw in Regulus and others.

Boning his dead dad's corpse after murdering him though? That's pretty freaking gross.

**** This is the most convincing explanation I've found in this thread. Denying someone an afterlife by destroying their soul seems pretty evil to me.

One loophole would be that if you do it to someone evil, you will actually be doing them a favor by saving them from eternal torment (if that's a thing in this belief system), which makes the deed less evil. A way to fix that would be to require that the destroyed soul must be innocent/virtuous.

It's pretty explicit in the books that Lily's sacrifice is what caused his attempt to kill Harry to backfire. It wasn't her protection that caused the fragmentation, it was the killing curse that he himself cast. Her protection just made Harry not dead.

Using a dementor to defeat him is a pretty intriguing idea. I mean, in the books it seems like he's able to control or negotiate with them. They're not mindless eating machines anyway. I assume a fractured soul probably isn't that satisfying of a meal for a dementor, so it might work as long as Voldemort isn't able to convince the dementor that he could get it much better and more frequent meals if it's a little patient.

**** I just came up with this theory to explain it (which probably doesn't hold any water but I think the SCB would be proud)

Voldemort had already killed someone else and done the ritual for a horcrux, splitting what little of his soul he had left.

When his Avada ricochets back to him, one part of his soul (which is locked and loaded to be a horcrux) bonks into Harry, and the last remaining bit of his original soul pops off to Albania for some sight seeing.

Here's where things get crazy: Voldemort read about the hallows at some point on his quest for immortality. Being obsessed with blood purity, he also traced his ancestry back to the Preverell brothers. He connects the dots and recognized the stone is in his family ring. Doesn't have much use for it (someone who's terrified of death doesn't wanna kick it with a bunch of ghosts right?) but thinks a hallow would be a sweet horcrux.

He also knows that James has a cloak (“hey my lord, watch out when you kill them cause they can turn hella invisible. And if you can't find Harry, prongs probably tucked him in to bed with the cloak again by accident” - Pettigrew) and of course he knows the Potters descended from the three brothers also (I'm thinking he's like the conspiracy theory Charlie Day meme when it comes to blood lines).

Maybe this is why Voldemort waited almost a year before going to kill Harry. Since prophecy says “the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches” and he was informed right away by Peter that it might be this Potter boy, a fetus, why waste time? If this kid would be a threat to him, best to attack before he's even born, right? It says “with the power to defeat the dark lord” so what if he's already got the power, like some weird contagious disease that Voldy can't survive or something?

I think the ceremony takes a while to complete. Months, maybe. I haven't seen Hannibal but I assume eating someone is no small task. And I'm sure there's more to it that just that. He wanted to finish the ceremony before attacking, so the cloak could be his final horcrux.

Also I googled the hallows in order to spell the Pravirall brothers right and found this:

Deathly Hallows, page 304: Harry: “And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?" Dumbledore: “I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry, I doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead.”

I think he knew about them, he just thought they would be a nice addition to his collection of soul back-up drives, rather than a real path toward immortality.

Though I did laugh out loud at “took a bite out of Lily”

** I like to think that it isn't just murder/killing someone but instead has qualifiers, that they have to be innocent and you can't regret it afterwards. This still doesn't make it ‘evilest of evils' but it does differentiate between normal murder or killing in self defense or battle and the making of a horcrux.

I also link the soul somewhat to sanity in my mind. I believe it's said that in his youth Riddle was handsome and charming (I read too much FanFiction to be sure this is cannon though) and once he's older he is pretty much insane. I always thought that it was because he split his soul that every time he did it he became a little less sane, and somewhat lost his good looks as well. It would help explain why he would go after a baby over a half heard prophesy if he was already lacking most of his soul therefore most of his sanity.

Finally, I am not religious, so I don't know any details but usually souls are linked to the afterlife so by splitting your soul you could throw away your chance at that. Regarding dementors, while in cannon they are seen as bad but not complete evil, I've seen a bunch of FanFiction that makes them just as evil/immoral as horcruxes.

I also agree with another response to this prompt about how something about souls are seen as inherently good and pure and he tainted that.

When you make a Horcrux, the soul slowly starts to unravel, deleting the more superficial details of a person, only leaving the most important, grounded, and strong accents of the person. In riddles case, his anger, wish to be something more than a wizard, and fear of death. Eventualy, thing like common sense gets erased, or abandoned because person becomes so simple-minded(without losing his intelligence) that he becomes so sure of himself, and starts ignoring "Evil Overlord List".

(Molly Weasley didn't commit murder, by the way. What she did was in lawful defence of self and others, which makes it not murder. Not all homicides are murders, not all homicides are even /crimes/.)

Lots of fanfic authors have beefed up the evil factor of horcruxes. I've seen:

- "have to make the victim so utterly despair that they desire death",
- "it's a perversion of a marriage bond, the soul of the victim becomes tied to yours and can't ever pass on",
- "it's a procedure that requires the active assistance of Nyarlathotep and /he/ is in it for the lulz at /everyone's/ expense,"\\
- "you have to commit the murder in, and maintain forever after, the mindset that your life is the only one that matters and everyone else can and should die for your benefit,"

and my own effort "the murder is a /sacrifice/ and the entity you sacrifice to gets access to your soul and mind to do a little editing. Every one you make takes you that little bit closer to being a devil in human skin, and it's false immortality because it's not /you/ that carries on living."

******* "One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter?"

This is something Rowling's books don't grasp; I am pretty certain that around either Sirius's death but probably Dumbledore's funeral Harry tells one of his friends that the light side will prevail because Voldemort's side is evil and therefore hasn't got the proper motivation. Not in those words, but that was the gist of the message.

If it was book 6, it was released in 31-7-2005 I remember finding that incredibly short sighted, especially after 9/11 and the 7-7-2005 metro bombings in the UK. Now of course those books were probably already being printed at that point, but still. I do not condone terrorism in any way, let that be clear. So please don't misunderstand me when I say that those terrorists clearly had an ideology to die for. Just like almost any other terrorist really.

And we know that Draco Malfoy was raised with plenty racist ideology, just like any other Death Eater.

** There must be something that makes them impractical, at the very least. You can chug off mainstream wizards calling them evil as mindless superstition and societal norms. But something seems to prevent dark wizards from casually making horcruxes too, and I don't think it's simply due to them being obscure.

I think either A. The downsides of having one far outweigh the benefits B. They don't actually work as advertised C. A mix of both or D. The requirements are nearly impossible to achieve. Like killing in cold blood someone you actually care for deeply. Something most people wouldn't be able to pull off.

I agree that at canon face value, they don't really seem that bad. But then again, I strongly disapprove of assigning intrinsic moral values to things and am more in agreement with 'there is only power' mindset. It's why I so hate the idea of light and dark magic.

** Well like others said; splitting ones soul is a no-no for a bunch of people. I mean if someone came up to you and said you could live forever but your soul will be cut in half it /should/ give you pause. /Should/ being the ultimate word, but like others I'd be just as tempted. For religious people splitting ones soul should be a hell no, and JK is religious. With that in mind Edward Cullen and Carlisle thought vampires were soulless but Carlisle created them into vampires anyway, and Edward eventually turned Bella, so... it's perspective really on souls and how much stalk you put into them. One might think that becoming immortal would you wouldn't have to /face/ consequences - like heaven or hell or any god or gods/goddesses. (This is, of course, excluding the fact Voldemort ultimately /does/ face consequences).

I did read a few fan fictions were Horcruxes were much more than a murder - one made it the torture and then consuming of the corpse the way to make a Horcrux. Another made it the death of an innocent victim - ironically it was hinted at the newborn babe Harry killed to make his own Horcrux was Voldemort's daughter from CC (don't know her name, never read it, never will). A lot of books and I think(?) JK hinted that it was /more/ than murder. Murder was the /start/ but not the end. That the ritual one has to undergo to finally split the soul fully is much more fouler than a mere murder (I say /mere/ because of the few people who say “what's one death? Pick a criminal etc”) death of infants, cannibalism, self mutilation (killing oneself to be brought back? Can't quite recall). Anyway I do think it's much more than /just/ a murder. I think you have to do something truly awful, like murdering or tainting of an infant or someone pure/holy to make a Horcrux in its entirety. Now this is just my opinion. I could be wrong, but that's my take anyway.

And yes, a lot of what I mentioned is heavily relied on human concepts of “forbidden”; like cannibalism. Very common in nature but morbid, unforgivable, and unfathomable for humans. Anyway, my theory is it'd be something like that.

Not that it's like a body, but somehow the very act of soul-manipulation must be terrible - like touching something that was never meant to be touched. Or maybe (but this is pure speculation) in order to split the caster's soul, the soul of the murder victim is somehow sacrificed? Maybe they can't pass onto the next world. Or something. (But if Myrtle is the first source, I don't know...maybe all the Horcrux victims were made into ghosts?)

I read a fic or something somewhere, where the ritual to make a Horcrux included cannibalism. I think that lends it a suitably horrible angle but no way Rowling could have included that.

** I've always imagined splitting your soul and creating a horcrux as two very different procedures. Murdering someone will fracture your soul, in this sense Molly Weasley will always have a fractured soul because she intentionally took a persons life. However that is just the first step into creating a horcrux and to do so requires many more horrible acts to pull part of your soul from you and lock it away permanently.

Why do I think the Horcrux itself is most evil, because it divides the soul which is who you are, a person with only part of their soul is only partly a person. The dementors kiss takes a persons soul from their body similar to the killing curse but both these leave it whole. All of these things are terrible but the Horcrux is more so because it takes what makes a person and rips it apart, destroying their humanity forever.

Also Remus describes dementors as the foulest of all creatures just like Slughorn describes a Horcrux as the foulest of all magic. Lastly nobody said the ministry was entirely smart or moral in their treatment of others they deem as less.

** From what I remember reading in interviews, there was originally going to be a multi-step process to make a Horcrux - and each step of the way would be some kind of heinous act, of which murder was the second-to-last step (the last being to put the soul-fragment into the prepared vessel). She scrapped the description from Book 6 because it didn't fit the tone of the book, if I remember things right.

We also have information about /other/ methods of potential immortality which aren't inherently evil - the Philosopher's Stone kept the Flamel family alive for a few centuries, and nothing in the books hints at the Flamels being bad people just for using it.

** Morality systems in general center around three things - freedom, property and life and protection of those from undue harm, with life being usually conisdered of the highest value. Religious beliefs take the 'life' part up to 11 with them beign also concerned about your afterlife, thus a slew of additional rules to make it so you get there in good shape. So: property, freedom, life and eternity.

Now, how does that pertain to horcruxes? Well, you see, in order to make a horcrux you need to break two most important rules of the 4 (or even technically all of them since killing someone self-possesing and unwilling is a crime against their freedom of choice and their possesion of self) - you take a life and give up a chance at the afterlife yourself, all in permanent manner. There is no other act that could violate all of these rules at once - hene it's the most evil. After all we consider ordinary murder to be the worst crime on it's own, and it doesn't have such permanent effects on the afterlife of the person in the HP-verse (apparently).

** One of the most prominent theme of Harry Potter is the acceptance of Death. Throughout the story, Harry learn to accept the loss of his parents, of his mentor and even his own death (and he greeted Death as an Old Friend). Horcruxe are evil because, just like unicorn blood, they are an unnatural way to preserve his life, but cursing the user to only live a half life.

Another point which make the Horcruxe Evil is that, according to canon, souls are real. It's not just an abstract thing but something "physical" (or magical I guess) which can be interacted with or lost.\\
Without trying to explain the whole judiciar system of HP, we know that losing your soul is the worst possible punishment you can give to someone. And that while it is possible to survive without a soul, the victim is only an empty husk, unable to feel talk, think or feel anything.\\
Since losing your soul means losing your ability to feel, I like to think that splitting your soul as a comparable effect. After creating an Horcruxe, the life continue, but the world is a little more lackluster, the fire a little colder, as if a veil separated the wizard was shrouded in a veil, separated from the world. Each Horcruxe tearing the soul one more time, Voldemort's world is akin to an old photography, blurry, colorless and cold.

Finally, an Horcruxe is Evil because Evil deeds are need for its creation.\\
Before even beginning the process, it is necessary for the wizard to have a fractured soul. According to Slughorn, a soul can only be fractured by the worst concevable act, a murder. It's not just about taking a life because, as most thing in Harry Potter universe, intent matter. Harry killed Quirell because he had no choice, Molly killed Bellatrix to protect the ones dear to her, Voldemort killed Miny to prove he was the "heir" of Slytherin, and killed his family to prove he was above them. Maybe all murders affect the soul, but the damages should be way greater when you the wizard wanted to kill.\\
The making of an Horcruxe also require a total lack or remorse, since they could mend the soul. Harry was shocked when he learnt he killed Quirell, Molly probably felt bad the act (if not the victim) once the tension of the battle was gone, Voldemort never cared about the body he left behind.\\
Finally, while Rownling never wrote about the instructions explaining how to split the soul and place the tear into an item, I remember her saying in an interview that the process is "disgusting enough to make someone sick" and that "she could not bring herself to put it them into paper". So you can at least suppose that these steps are Evil.

In the end, Horcruxe are Evil because they represent all of the things that are bad in this world. On this aspect they are pretty similar to the One Ring from LotR.

** The HP universe does not run on moral relativism. It's just the way that universe works.

It's author fiat, but that's the rules of the universe. You could say it up as "not being any more evil than killing", but that's not how the Evil value is calculated in universe.

By that same measure, Soul destruction via Dementors is just as Evil (and i think the horror of it is underrated). It's disproportionate punishment.

Whatever the consequences ordering that Evil are, they are not explored in universe.

Why it's more evil than killing, it requires killing, so it supersedes it on the evil-o-meter. Since the details of the horcrux ritual are not disclosed, murder could just be one of many more acts which would make the whole ritual extremely evil, simply by counting all the evil acts it has as prerequisites. It could be the cherry on a cake made of a heaping pile of utterly evil actions.

If killing someone was the only prerequisite, the absolute nature of morality in-universe does not discount "intentionally mutilating your own soul" as inherently not Evil, so it would still be more evil than 'just' killing, by pure arithmetic.

There are a lot of religious overtones to the question (obviously), and when dealing with religious questions, one must answer them from within the same worldview.

If you would like a more nuanced view of morality and souls than the canonical one, you're better off exploring other literature (aimed for more mature readers).

I've been reading a lot about Souls for a Mage: the Awakening worldbuilding I'm doing.

In that universe, Morality in that verse is less good/evil, and more on a should/should not basis. Souls are tangible, and you can pretty easily mess around with them with Magic. It's not even hard.

Souls can be extracted, consumed, partitioned, stolen or destroyed, and most of them are firmly under the "Should not" flavor of morality.

Partitioning your own soul (and extracting it) is done relatively often, because the soul fragment can be used to create an area where magic works better. It's still under the 'should not' category, because splitting the soul is akin to self mutilation, and reduces your potential for magic.

Soullessness is debilitating, and eventually leads to a state of non-personhood, similar to the dementor's kiss.

Consuming souls, is universally reviled. Reaping can be used to empower all sorts of magic as a sacrifice(reapers), and there is a major group of antagonists that eat souls to sustain their immortality.

Immortality isn't what's bad about them though, it's what they do to maintain that immortality that condemns them (and their heretical teachings...). Liches (mages who seek/achieve immortality) are frowned upon, but not outright forbidden.

Lastly, soul destruction as a punishment is possible, and is the absolute last resort, used for things like souls so corrupted they would infect the afterlife with their corruption. When this kind of punishment is used, the whole council that orders the punishment resigns as a mark of shame. Shame that all their other measures failed, and they had to pull out all the stops and commit a blasphemy themselves.

Anyway, this has been a long post, but hopefully it explains why it's a question that has to be answered on a per-universe basis. In the case of HP, it works that way because the author chose a more absolute morality.

** I haven't noticed any comment here yet questioning weather or not souls exists to begin with, and what if this whole 'split your soul' thing is actually real. We gotta keep in mind that A. The Wizarding world is, at heart, a Medieval society. I'm sure we all know by now that the Middle Ages weren't exactly known for their traditional of critical thinking, logic, and secularism. At least in Europe. Wizards believing in souls, dark magic, strong good/evil divide, etc. hints that the magicals share the same weaknesses that medieval muggles did. And B. There is no objective narrator in HP. Every piece of knowledge we get comes from a character, and those have their own philosophies, emotional baggage and personality. They will attach their own spin on things just like any regular human.

​

The whole 'most vile and unthinkable act, splitting your soul, the most sacred of things' could be an absolute bullshit and 'soul magic' actually deals with the electrical patterns of the brain. Horcruxes either being a save-file of those, or perhaps some sort of firewall that prevents the real deal from deletion.

As to how ghosts fit into this, well, I would say some people reject dying so much, that their magic naturally starts a similar process as a horcrux ritual would, and somehow materializes a persons's brain activity into a 'ghost'. Kinda like how fearing/hating magic makes your magic suppress itself, but that creates a contradiction which results in Obscurials. Ghost would ba a type of naturally occurring Horcrux.

Then, looking at his typical behavior towards them, they might realize they are getting more crucios than eternal glory.

Also, knowing the wizarding world it's possible that there are rumours in certain circles about horcruxes and what you need to do to make one. Perhaps something like the murder of your followers or anything else really. Inner circle death eaters might not want to be sacrificed.

Also, considering most Slytherins, having an immortal master might not be a good thing.

It seems like canon and most fanfics go the "too evil" route, but I feel like other considerations could be explored based on the traits we know maybe of the death eaters had. Such as pride, a belief that they are better, obsession with family/blood, and a healthy dose of self-preservation.

** I've seen some people theorise that it required self mutilation and in more extreme cases, self-cannibalism. In order to split your soul you need to give a part of yourself over, which is why Voldemort looked so unnatural. For example, he had red eyes like snakes because he gouged his own eyes out to create the horcrux. His fingers were spidery because he cut them off, his voice was unnaturally high because he did something to his voice box, presumably. I like this because it matches up with making someone horrified and because it makes sense. You want to be immortal and achieve what no one else has done? Easy, just give off something you normally wouldn't live without. People value their eyes, their voice, their hands, any part of their body, really. Also, the diadem screamed when it was destroyed. The locket had an eye when you opened it, the diary bled out.

** Well, I think it's not the result that is so 'evil' and 'ammoral', but the process.

In one of the fics, I've read that to make a Horcrux, you need to achieve certain mindset.

Namely that of a total sociopath.

Because killing a innocent soul, and splitting yours for immortality symbolises, in magic, that you would do anything, and I mean anything for immortality.

Even sacrifice people close to you.

You need to maintain the mindset that you're the most important person in the world, and that the whole world should be destroyed if it would help to further your immortality. And the mindset needs the be active constantly. Otherwise the magic would unravel and you would get a backlash.

So to shorten up, Horcrux is so evil because only a person without a stopping line would do it. And I wouldn't want to work for a madman who would sacrifice his followers in hope to gain more immortality due to a rumor or something along those lines.

** I have to imagine that it's the process you undertake that classifies it as "most vile". In my head, mutilating your own soul might be bad, but it only affects the one doing it. I don't think something that only affects the one undertaking it can be considered "evil". Unnatural maybe, but not "evil".

Unfortunately, JKR keeps the specifics hush hush. I have to imagine though that it is something extraordinarily horrific to classify as the "wickedest".

My own head cannon is something like mutilating the soul of another human being, likely after death once the soul is released from the body. Denying them the chance to ever "move on" to the afterlife.

Perhaps the soul used is whole enough to remain as a ghost, if it's not just an imprint left over, but not enough to allow it to cross to the afterlife. So if you're not a ghost you're just gone. Complete annihilation of the individual.

I can't imagine a "normal" murder is enough.

** The thing is... think of the negatives that we /know/ to exist. We know you must commit murder. We know you must never regret the murder. We know that the object must be something physically in your possession. In order for the Horcrux to be destroyed, the object but cease being itself (utterly destroyed). These objects also have at least some semblance of sentience. Finally we know that it can make the soul unstable with extended or prolonged use.

The positives of it sorta... suck in relation to that. A horcrux allows you to exist as a spector like being after the death of your original body. An existence that Voldemort himself says was absolutely horrible. Not only that, but you are completely and utterly useless without help; either a host or a partner. This pain makes the first year plot make sense from Voldemort's point of view and from Dumbledore's. But we can get into that later.

So not only are you in agony and forced to wait until your help or vessel for parasitic riding appears, you must also be slightly aware that the other horcrux(es) exists somewhere and someone MAY find it and destroy it. It must absolutely reek of magic after all, which is likely why Tom only picked historically important magical artifacts to turn into his Horcruxes, you know other than his narcism. Add in that it is entirely possible for Tom to be fully aware that his horcuxes may be sentient... we have a major issue.

As a spector, the horcrux maker may be absolutely paranoid as hell. What happens when a Horcrux stops being a Horcrux while you are in a shade form? /We don't know/.

Here's the biggest kicker though... Horcruxes don't bring you back. Like that's the wild part. Horcruxes don't bring you back at all, you have to do that yourself as a spector. So not only do you have to figure out how to do a Horcrux, protect the object, die, survive being a shade for who knows how long, then you have to perform some form of magic to get a body back, while at the same time knowing about said magic.

Like logically, thats a lot of effort for fake immortality.

As for morally, for me, evil things are those that get the most selfish goals for the most effort. IE the most selfish goal while having the potential to harm the most people. in the steps outlined, we have at least 2 victims. The Horcrux victim and then the victim of being your helper/host. Assuming the ritual in fourth year is the only way to bring back a horcrux holder fully, we now have at least 3 to 4 victims. As you need an enemy to take the blood from (victim 3) and a way to make them an enemy (possibly victim 4) and the bone of the father, (possibly victim 4). That doesn't even get into the mindset you have to have to kill people and never regret it. I've read dozens of serial killer interviews via true crime and such. Even the most psychopathic, sociopathic and horrible people regret killing someone. Even if it is purely self motivated, they do express regret at the act. Which would invalidate the Horcrux.

It literally must be a constant mindset that only your life is truly valid and valuable for the condition of genuine regret to not appear. That is the most horrifying to me. A complete disregard for human life is thrown around a lot in fiction, especially comics and in this fandom.

But I guarantee you that most people have not thought about what that truly means. It means that it doesnt matter if you are a man woman or child. If you identify as a fucking goat. It doesn't matter if you scream, beg or plea. It doesn't matter if you match a type, if you are righteous or what. That person, with no regard for human life, does. not. give. a fuck. Its actually even beyond that. The mindset required means that every other person is not a person, but a pawn, a pet or prey.

Israel Keyes said that he felt that everyone around him was either family or prey. The FBI KNOWS he killed at least 3 people. In his interviews, he mentioned at least 8 possible. If you track his travels, and check missing persons reports... its over 3 dozen possibilities that he will never be pinned to. Yet he still had a family he cared about. Meaning that he still regarded human life.

That is the most terrifying part. The part that makes it evil. It turns you into a monster by definition. All for faux immortality.

I'm aiming for immortality if I enter the wizarding world, but I'm not going for horcruxes. I'd rather keep myself sane and healthy.

And that is the crux of the problem. Horcruxes make their users insane and unhealthy. It literally splits their souls, what do you expect? So, yeah, they are intrinsically evil. Why do you think they are in the book "Magick Moste Evile"?

Murder is already awful and selfish on its own but making a horcrux means you're willing to take someone's (life and) soul away to create an object that protects /your/ soul.

Dementors pose an interesting commentary here. It might reflect how serious messing with souls are. Obviously it doesn't inspire great faith that the government can send soul eaters out to whoever and whenever but the fact that it is considered a horrid punishment implicitly reflects how valuable souls are in the Wizarding World.

You're definitely right on it being a religious wrong. I also don't think it's right because of nature. As far as we know, nothing natural lasts forever. Even something like the sun doesn't last forever. That's also putting a lot of stock into the order of nature which may be a whole other argument.

** Personal theory, Horcruxes are made from the remorseless murder of an innocent combined with the cannibalism of the blood of a murdered blood relative as part of a spell/ritual that would temporarily tether the blood relative's soul to the land of the living so that it could be used as a binding agent between the soul splinter, caused by the murder of an innocent, to whatever object that would house the piece of soul, which is why it makes the object so hard to destroy, as souls are typically very difficult to destroy. These two qualifiers are, historically, combined into one action, typically a parent murdering their child and then cannibalizing their child's body and soul, which is what Herpo the Foul either performed or theorized. Books on the Dark Arts list the combination, specifically quoting Herpo's theory, as the only way, which is why they would be so horrified by Voldemort, as they assume he murdered a child in his own family.

Voldemort only discovers that he can separate the two qualifiers when he thinks of how to use Myrtle's death to his own benefit and attempts to use Myrtle's murder in conjunction with a vial of blood he took from his father after killing him. Myrtle qualifies because she is an innocent that was killed by the basilisk on Voldemort's order (kill muggleborns).

The reason that Harry has a piece of Voldemort's soul stuck in his head is because, while Voldemort hadn't made the preparations to make another Horcrux, Voldemort's magic was very experienced in the process, so when Voldemort's Killing Curse was sent back at him, Voldemort's magic had instinctually sent a sliver of his soul to the only thing magically powerful enough to contain a piece of a soul, Harry. As for why Voldemort's soul was able to bind to Harry, it is because Lily's sacrifice was the type of magic that imbued Harry's body with a resistance to Voldemort's soul by having Lily's magic sinking into the depth of Voldemort's soul, which created enough of a link between Voldemort and Harry that a piece of Voldemort's soul could safely fuse to Harry's body. The reason why other witches and wizards who have died at Voldemort's hand while protecting a loved one didn't have this result was because Voldemort's soul was in just an unstable enough state that the magic of Lily's sacrifice was just strong enough to have this outcome, as this sort of sacrificial magic is powerful but Voldemort himself was previously too magically powerful and his soul still whole enough to reject another's magic entering it to be affected by it.

On top of all of this, the less of your own soul you have, the crazier you are, as a part of your very being is violently ripped out of you.

This is a very convoluted explanation, but it would certainly explain why Horcruxes are so horrible, and would explain why Voldemort conceived Delphini despite being immortal and neither needing an heir nor having any interest or desire in being a father, as he likely discovered that Harry had destroyed his diary Horcrux and sought to use his future daughter's murder and blood to create a replacement to retain his self-believed ideal of wanting 7 Horcruxes.

  ‘By an act of evil - the supreme act of evil. By committing murder. Killing rips the soul apart. *The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage*: he would encase the torn portion -‘

  ‘Encase? But how -?'

  ‘There is a spell, do not ask me, I don't know!' said Slughorn, shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. ‘Do I look as though I have tried it - do I look like a killer?'

So killing rips the soul apart, and creating Horcrux is ripping that part of the soul from your body to an object. For example, Alastor Moody would have a damaged soul because he killed Evan Rosier, but his soul would still be whole because he didn't seperate that part of himself.

Now, the true evil, it seems, lies in the spell of creating it. We are never told about this spell, and apparently, Rowling's editor vomited when she revealed it to him. Contrary to the popular belief, it cannot be cannibalism because Myrtle's body is undamaged. My personal theory, which I read in a fanfiction, is that you must believe with an absolute certainty that out of the entire human race, your life is the only one with any value, and if you grow to love a soul more than your own then you won't be able to create a Horcrux.

It would make sense, because it is exactly the dangerous and twisted thinking that Voldemort is capable of, he's already shown to not care for any being (barring perhaps Nagini, but if it came to sacrificing himself or her, he'd sacrifice her in a heartbeat), and it also ensures that very few if any would be able to attain this mindset, even the darkest of wizards such as Grindelwald are shown to value someone's life. It would take an uncommon lack of empathy and love to reach this mindset while also being horrific.

** I've not read the other comments here (mostly so my initial thoughts aren't influenced by them) so it's probable that there are better answers to this than the one(s) I will contribute.

First I /don't/ think the push back about Horcruxes has anything to do with 'immortality being wrong/unnatural'. There seems to at least some ways to achieve immortality in the magical world: Making a Philosopher's stone seems to make the drinker functionally immortal as long as they continue to take the elixir; Many people sought the Deathly Hallows of which many people likely believed that one of the perks of becoming the Master of Death would be immortality; Vampires are probably functionally immortal; and (this is a personal headcanon) it's possible that at least some Metamorphmagi would at least be biologically immortal too.

Making a Horcrux seems to be so reprehensible not because of the murder involved; because murder (both justified or not) is something that happens all the time, and magicals aren't making Horcruxes left and right because they had bits of their souls going into objects as a result of killing someone.

It /could/ be because of the mutilation of the soul needed to make a Horcrux. Murder essentially just creates a fracture, or a weakness that a suitably inclined magical can then use to make a Horcrux. The act of actually splitting the soul could be horrific itself enough that anyone that knows anything of the process would rightly think it would be evil.

It could also be in reference to how the Horcrux is created /after/ the soul has been split. It might take something else horrific to actually stuff a part of your soul into an object. As splitting the soul would surely not be enough to make a Horcrux, you'd need to put that soul fragment into an object for it to linger on this plane of existence.

Finally it could actually be the whole process from end to end that is actually what is considered evil in itself.\\
After all, you'd have to be a pretty dedicated dark magical to research Horcruxes, discover how they're made, decide to actually go through and make one, and then go through all the individual steps (that in themselves might be horrific, but not necessarily irredeemably reprehensible) to make one.

** Here are a few thoughts in the late hours of the night on the matter.

First off, do Horcruxes convey eternal youth as well as eternal life? As they're presented in canon, they seem to be more of a safeguard than anything else. If your body is destroyed you don't move on, but your body can still be harmed, so can it still age? If yes, then if you're lucky enough to avoid a violent or traumatic death, do you grow increasingly old, decrepit, and senile for all eternity? Your memories, faculties, and knowledge slipping away, slowly, always at the brink of death but never able to move on, never to be reunited with your loved ones, never to be free from your rotting prison of flesh?

Second, does the creation of a Horcrux damage the soul of the murder victim? I differentiate between killing and murder. We kill organisms all the time, whenever microbes enter our bodies only to be destroyed by our immune systems. But if the Horcrux damages or destroys the soul of the victim as well, then you're not only destroying your ability to move on but also your victim's.

Third, does having a damaged soul also affect your physical and mental health? If so, then maybe it's like using R-rated steroids; you get a short-term benefit but at the cost of your future health and well-being.

Like I said, it's late and this is all fan-speculation. Love to hear your thoughts but be civil and constructive.

** I always thought that it wasn't entirely the splitting a soul thing is evil by itself but more there is a specific ritual or something to make a horcrux that involves something super taboo. Like I never liked the idea that horcruxes could just be made by killing someone because if thats the only thing you need there would probably be some accidental horcrux users running around.

** Eh, I do worse things in Skyrim all the time. Its actually a good case study, i think.

For example, to powerup the ebony blade you need to kill several people who trust you with their life. In order to please Boethiah.

Black Soul gems are a convenient way to make high powered enchantments in exhange for trapping the soul of someone you killed in a prison and then trading their soul to the Ideal Masters which tortures their soul for all eternity.

Vampirism is a curable disease for the player but you can choose to be an undead horror that literally sucks the lifeblood (sometimes killing) of others for the power it gives.
