looking for harry potter fanfics where harry trains in a dimension/house/room/time dome where time is slowed, story must be complete and over 60k words.


** I wrote one once where this is effected using Time Turners. Though I'm not sure I'd recommend it today, here's a link if you care: linkffn(Dagger and Rose by Perspicacity)

** There's linkffn(the black star by Aileen dickenson) that was recommended a little while ago. Multiple-year time dome is used.

Features: awful Weasleys, lots of money and more money, crazy Dumbledore, mpreg... Still a fun read, but not one I'd put on my Kindle.

**** Like I said, fun read, just not something I'd put on my Kindle. I love a bash fest when I'm in the right mood for it. Figured I should stick those warnings there so people aren't as surprised as I was lol.

** In linkffn(30 Minutes That Changed Everything by Radaslab) Harry & co. go to a summer school in Japan, which employs some sort of a time dilation bubble. IIRC, they get 5 years of education in about 2 months of realtime, and they did it over 4 summers.
