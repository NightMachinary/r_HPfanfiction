Can you guys give me your best under rated fics? I keep seeing the same ones being recced (PoS, HPMOR, Seventh Horcruz etc.)

Now to put what I always put at the end of a request

Preferably complete but if not, that's fine. No slash/femslash. Stories can be any length.


** Unfinished but incredible, maybe the best ff I've ever read. Canon compliant Bellamort: linkao3(11682174)

Finished Lucissa history, canon compliant: linkao3(26862214)

Obviously I love Slytherins ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

  “I,” her gaze slips down to his mouth, “want only to please you. Is there no way I might...” “You want to own me,” he lilts to her. He tucks a curling strand of hair behind her ear. “No, master,” she insists, plaintive words and sharp, devouring eyes. “I am your faithful servant. Nothing sustains me but to obey your will.”

  Coming together is not always an easy feat, but the rest of the time, things fall apart. As Narcissa and Lucius navigate whether or not to trust one another, the Wizarding world begins to bend to the power of a Dark Lord and everything they've ever known starts to unravel.(Minor edits from same story posted on ff.net)

** Im not sure of its popularity but i dont see it recced that often

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11914698/chapters/26923794][Renascentia from the ashes]]

/In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new./

Its complete and has a sequel fic which is not yet complete but 31 chapters pretty long. It has one of the best characterizations for Regulus ive ever seen and my favorite characterization of Sirius. The first story more of a character study the second is more plot heavy but its very well written probably one of the best written fics I've seen like stupidly good.
