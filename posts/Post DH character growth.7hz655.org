** Flaws aren't always some aspect of personality you can point to and criticize. For a character aspect to feel negative it has to have an important negative consequence in the story.

To use a canon example, young Harry is impulsive and lacks patience. In book one, this is a positive aspect of his character because it saves Hermione from the troll. Contrast this with book five, where Harry does something similar and winds up starting the event sequence that leads to Sirius's death. In this case, his impulsive nature is a negative.

Having strong or powerful characters not feel like Mary or Gary is a lot of times about having their strengths mismatch the situation. Consider Harry in OoTP, Dumbledore about anything to do with the Dursleys, or Voldemort on the night he murdered Lily and James. The downfall of each of these characters is not the ability to do things correctly (each could have), but the inability to see a different perspective. Harry is deceived into a trap, Dumbledore puts Harry's safety from wizards over safety from his family, and Voldemort doesn't consider what he's doing by allowing Lily to sacrifice herself.

In order to give more specific advice about your Harry, I'd have to know more about what situations she would run into. For an adult Harry that's true to canon, one character aspect that he never really fixes is his communication skills. He's direct and impatient with disagreements, especially with strangers. Between that and spending most of his childhood either fighting or helpless, I could see that creating a lot of problems for him when faced with adult responsibilities.

*** Thanks, that's definitely something to work with. And yes, his impatience is something I hadn't thought of. Especially with authority figures who refuse to listen or be fair.

** Edit: this whole comment is a mess honestly. I'm too tired to sort it all out.

I don't think Harry really had much character development at all throughout the books. The last third of DH had more character development for him than everything before, and even that wasn't much.

But then again, outside of his sass and rare bursts of anger, Harry had the personality of drywall. And I think he was still a but reckless throughout all books. Dude broke into Gringotts and flew out on a dragon. And told a shit ton of people the details of the Elder Wand, including Voldemort. I mean, why couldn't Voldemort just banish a big rock at Harry's head?

Harry at the end of the books is still flawed imo. If he really learned from his experiences, he would have killed Dolohov and Rowle.

There's loads of stuff you can give your fem!Harry to make her flawed. Maybe the war made her bursts of anger more often. Maybe she grows indifferent, jaded, and disillusioned with the world? Maybe Hermione doesn't and she gets frustrated with her best friend for not giving a shit anymore.

They don't have to even be huge flaws. As long as you make these flaws impact the story and plot, you should be good.

** Personally I think Post Hogwarts has the most potential for stories, we've all read far too many Harry vs Voldmort vs Dumbledore stories for a lifetime. With leaving Hogwarts comes freedom. Both for your writing and for Harry. Harry is at a loose end Post Hogwarts. For how long has his life been defined by Voldemort? Now what does he do next? Did he even expect to survive?

The hardest thing to balance should be the guilt and angst. Harry historically has taken the blame for so much. How does he balance being the hero with any responsibility he feels for not stopping Voldemort sooner. No matter how much guilt Harry feels however it can drag a story down real fast. For realism Harry shouldn't be okay but for the sake of the story it can't drag.

What does Harry want to do next? What are the motivations of the character now they're past, stay alive and get good grades? Does Harry even know? Until you work out the motivations its hard to get the characters right. Obviously crossovers make that a bit more complicated or perhaps easier if the source of conflict is obvious enough.

Obvious weaknesses for Harry are a lack of knowledge. He has an interrupted and incomplete education. How much did he skimp on everyday spells to try and stay alive? Does he lack lots of combat skills as school focuses on everyday life? There is also a lack of knowledge with regards to the situation. Ignorance can make even brilliant people fail. If you don't reveal everything then Harry will stumble around.

*** Yes, those things are difficult to balance. You see too often that Harry is either immediately okay again and doesn't suffer any trauma, or the story is just over the top drama and angst. I once read a fic where part of Harry's recovery after the battle was him just feeling wrong about having been a horcrux for so long, and he had to try to come to terms with that. I hadn't come across a fic before that dealt with that.

** If you write a female!Harry, then I think canon stations are highly UNLIKELY to repeat. Her base personality might already be different. Several key people in the series, such as the Dursleys, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Draco, and Snape are all going to treat her differently. Those factors will in turn affect her decision making process significantly.

Canon rehashes are highly disliked on this sub. If you want your fic to be well received, developing your own plot is IMHO a must. But the amount of work to put in would be humongous.

--------------

As for how they should develop postwar, there are already thousands of angst/comfort/fluff/hurt relationship dramas. Writing more wouldn't add much to the fandom honestly. Considering they actually made it to the top in that cesspool known as Magical Britain, I have the following considerations:

After the Battle, the Ministry's own force was basically decimated. Voldemort pretty much drafted everyone from the Ministry for the final battle, even including then Minister Thickness. In the 2nd part of the Battle, Voldemort bought Narcissa's lie, became overconfident, and led his entire army into a death trap. Caught in a pincer movement by the original defenders, Slughorn's reinforcement, Centaurs, House-Elves, and Thestrals, everyone Death Eater, Snatcher, Ministry minion, and Giant was either killed or captured.

The Ministry's own reputation was also in tatters, after falling to two coups/revolutions within 10 months. It would become a laughing stock, a joke in any country/society. It NEEDED someone like Harry Potter to lend its credibility and rebuild its military, because after the Battle, the DA and the Order were magical Britain's ONLY credible and organized armed forces, and they ANSWERED to Harry. So, a major conclusion here is that the center of power in immediate aftermath of the Battle had shifted to them.

They were after all mentally extremely strong. They certainly knew that despite the enormous cost, they had scored a major victory over the evil. However, significant amount of baddies remained out there, and their own hold on power was tenuous at best. They knew they COULDN'T AFFORD to brood over loses or drown themselves in self-guilt, but would honor the fallen with effective actions of their own.

That's why I think their decision to send Harry and Ron into auror force, and Hermione and Ginny back to Hogwarts was a highly rational one. It meant they placed political necessities above their own emotional demands. One of their goals was certainly to have the boys taking an active role in the government, while having the girls widen their influences at Hogwarts.

After so much trauma and suffering, it should be very clear that their generation would adopt a mindset of "NEVER AGAIN"! Given Ministry's abysmal record in protecting them, they were NOT going to give its corrupt and cowardly bureaucrats any more free reigns. This generation would be taking things into THEIR OWN HANDS.

*** Thanks for the reply. I agree that it makes sense for Harry and Ron to become aurors. It doesn't seem right for them to stand by the sidelines while others fix everything. They would want to be a part of that.

Though I don't really agree with you that there's no room for more postwar fics. Yes, they have been done a lot, but very few are actually good. Not that I'm such a great writer, but in my view there aren't that many postwar fics around that are really worth reading. Same thing goes for all kinds of fan fics, the really good ones are rare.

**** Interestingly, Ron doesn't have a saving people thing the way Harry does. He won't walk by a situation where he can help someone in need, but I don't think Auror is an obvious career for him. He's perfectly capable of leaving dark wizard hunting to others, especially if he decides to settle down for a family early on. For me, Ron becomes an Auror because Harry does, not because he has a burning desire to hunt dark wizards and keep people safe.

As the characters mature, differences like that are important because they should, if they're healthy people, have divergent and in some cases conflicting desires. Voldemort was always something Harry had to do and Ron, his lapses notwithstanding, wasn't ever going to leave him to it. Now that Harry doesn't /have/ to hunt dark wizards, I wouldn't find Harry and Ron disagreeing over what to spend their adult lives doing that unusual.

I don't think they could ever be distant given what they went through together as kids and how Harry feels about the Weasley family, but different character goes go a long way to having supporting characters that don't feel like they're warping around the main character. Not to mention their own problems can be sources of conflict for a story.
