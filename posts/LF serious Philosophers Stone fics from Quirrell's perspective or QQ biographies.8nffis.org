I'm currently in the middle of Harry Potter and the Natural 20, and the Quirrell POV made me realize I'd love to read a Quirrell biography specifically focusing on how he becomes possessed and what his experience is like during the first book. Any recommendations? I loved A Difference In The Family for Snape's character, so that's sort of the tone I'm looking for - not 100% serious, but more so than HPN20.
