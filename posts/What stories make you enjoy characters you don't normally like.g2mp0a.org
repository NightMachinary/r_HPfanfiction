I'm not a huge fan of Ron, especially fanon Ron where all of his worst characteristics are usually amped up 100% but I just read linkao3(Snape's Daughter) and the sequel linkao3(Draco Malfoy and the Deathly Hallows) and for the first time in awhile I absolutely adored him and just wanted to give him a big hug at multiple points of the story.

​

Anyone else have stories that really made you enjoy a character you don't normally care for?


** Even in stories with a nice pro Ron stance I just don't like him and I have no idea why.

** Well this story called Fate :

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/Fate]])

Often, I don't like Ron because of his weaknesses, but in this story something happens to him when he's 8 - a gruesome vision of the battle of hogwarts - that drives him to make something out of himself so he can prevent it. He isn't a seer, the reason he can see the future is far more ominous.

​

Because of this, his character development is completely different to cannon. He's much more determined, ambitious, and cunning, leading him to Slytherin. There are a lot more things about him that are hugely different, but I couldn't tell you that or I'd be spoiling it.

The character development was realistic, you could definitely see how a ron would end up so differently considering the vastly different events he's gone through. He doesn't straight away end up OP, and even near the middle when people start seeing him as a prodigy, (which he thinks is quite wrong), there is still something, somthing terrible, that he can't defeat.

There are some elements of horror in this.

Anyways, although it was Ron who was in this, the story was outstanding and perfectly realistic. No one was being bashed. Although Harry was shown in a bit of a negative light, that was only because he was disliked for ron. Harry was doing what he usually does, investigating things, which is useful in cannon, but for a Ron who has a LOT to hide, it was terrible.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

  Lily brings Snape a surprise before she dies: his daughter. But, seeing as Snape can barely take care of himself, he brings her to the Malfoy family. She is raised thinking she's a Malfoy, but when she gets to Hogwarts, things start to get... interesting.Currently being rewritten. Chapter 1 has been edited and reposted.
