** To Catch a Thief by ElviraKitties. Harry steals everything not nailed down (and some things that are). linkao3(12429789)

#+begin_quote
  Severus pulled Harry into the closest alcove. “Do you happen to know where Professor McGonagall is?”

  “Nope. The last time I saw her was at breakfast. She didn't appear during our class. Rule Lover went and reported it.”

  “Granger did inform Professor Dumbledore.” Severus was trying to think about what could have happened to Minerva.

  “Severus, what is the pet policy? I have Amber, a birdie, and now a cat. Do I need to get rid of one? I really don't want to. Amber likes having friends.”

  “Amber? A cat?” Severus knew he was going to regret asking.

  “Yes, a sweet tabby. No collar and looked a bit lonely.”

  “Where is this new addition?” Severus pinched the bridge of his nose.

  Harry reached into his robe pocket and pulled out the expandable pouch. “I need to buy supplies for the new kitty.” Harry reached in and pulled out the confused cat. He held onto her, running his hand over the fur. “Isn't she pretty? So sweet.”

  The cat transformed into Professor McGonagall. “In all my years!”

  “Hey, what did you do to my cat!” Harry wasn't happy about his missing cat.

  “Potter, come with me right now.” McGonagall tried to get by Severus who was standing in the front of the exit.

  “She stole my cat!”

  Severus couldn't believe he was going to say this. “I believe there has been a slight misunderstanding.”

  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

#+begin_quote
  Harry wanted to be outraged on behalf of the castle that he still considered to be his home. Hogwarts didn't deserve to have a piece of Tom Riddle lodged inside it like a particularly vicious splinter. But there was something he was annoyed about even more than the fact that he was once again alive at the same time as a once and future dark lord. For the first time in his life, he sympathized with Voldemort, and knew that in this one instance, Voldemort might sympathize with him. Harry looked at Tom head-on, and said, "Albus Dumbledore is a bastard."*Both turned down for the position of Hogwarts DADA professor, Tom and Harry have a few things to say to each other.
