I've never seen this character fleshed out or written about and I was wondering if there are any fanfictions that try to elbarote on her personality, life, etc?

We know from canon that she was a potential spell-maker (she loved experimentation which lead to her death), was very curious hence her name 'Pandora' (way to be subtle about it, Rowling) and looked a lot like her daughter. She also loved Luna and took more care of hair since Harry notices in a photograph that she looked neater when her mother was alive. Luna also calls her an incredible witch, but I don't know how reliable that is. There IS potential for making her a very formidable witch.

If there are any such fanfictions, well written, that you know if, please tell me. *I'd prefer it if Luna isn't a carbon-copy of her mother's personality however*.


** Try Luna's Hubby. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2919503/1/Luna-s-Hubby]])\\
This starts before she dies, and then Harry/Luna save her, so you get her as a mother figure all through the story. I thought it was pretty enjoyable.

** And I vaguely remember another one where Lily somehow is stuck in a time warp, and comes out and saves Harry, and then goes over and finds Luna's Mom stuck in a similar way -- both were written as slightly unhinged Dept-of-Mysteries people. Can't for the life of me remember the name. Now I want to...

** The FateÂ´s Gambit fics by Robst have Pandora as surviving and Xeno dying...but since it is Robst, it is more about big moments and plot than actually characterization.
