Hi! I'm looking for *completed* fics where Harry has the ability to 'shadow travel', wether he's born with it, through his Animagus-form or through Black(?) inheritance doesn't really matter. Thanks in advance!


** There's a Warcraft Crossover where he can do this called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8933408/1/Wizard-Runemaster][Wizard Runemaster.]] It's what gets him stuck in the Warcraft universe in the first place. Warning: M Rated with a harem and many lemons.
