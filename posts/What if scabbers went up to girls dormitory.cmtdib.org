Ron's rat scabbers is Peter Pettigrew. He is a boy and when a boy tries going up to Gryffindor's girl dormitory the stairs turn to a slide to prevent it. So what if scabbers tried to go up or Hermione tried to take him up? I mean he is just a male mammal while in rat form.


** I don't think you can fool the magic that easily, though if you /can/, that brings up the obvious image of Lily Evans having one day woken up in the middle of the night to the sound of hooves, and finding James just standing there, inexplicably, holding a bouquet, with a winning smile.

*** Depending on what year they're in, that might end with James being defenestrated.

*** But it happened before James and Lily started dating so Lily still thought James was a prat. As a result she stunned him immediately, then she transfigured a rope out of his robes, tied it around his waist and lowered him out of the window. This is how he woke up, 50 feet above ground in his underwear, dangling from a rope. And Lily still wouldn't date him.

*** How exactly would a stag navigate a set of stairs though? Even if the wards themselves are bypassed, you have a more mundane issue to deal with.

** Crookshanks is also a male mammal.

** I don't think that the charm applies to animals. Otherwise girls couldn't have male pets. Scabbers would have no problems as long as he doesn't transform while on the staircase. Transforming in the actual dorms would probably cause no problem. I've seen fics where Animagus!Harry bypasses the protection in his animal form.

*** I also think that rule is stupid.

It should have been applied equivalently or not at all.

**** The whole point is that the rule was intended to be stupid.

It was made way back when social norms were different.

** If Scabbers went into the girl's dormitory, Crookshanks would tear him to pieces to defend Hermione. He was on to him from the start, but a more threatening action would spur him to act.

** Wouldn't put it past him to have done this as a teenager. And no, I don't think the wards would work against Animagi.
