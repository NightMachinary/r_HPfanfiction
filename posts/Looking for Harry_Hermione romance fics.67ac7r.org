  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

** [[/r/HPharmony]] is a good place to start!

I just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]] linkffn(3186836) which was really good and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance][Resistance]] linkffn(2746577)

EDIT: Reread your request and probably neither of these really fit the bill but I had just read both recently. I stand by my statement that [[/r/HPHarmony][r/HPHarmony]] is a good place for reqs

*** I wouldn't call Vox Corporis very good, it shows it's age and it was an enjoyable read but they have sex in like the first few chapters if i remember and everything just kinda goes from their.

**** Yeah I agree that the beginning could have been better, but I really enjoyed the relationship building of the characters after that. I think it's something rarely seen in a lot of romance fics. I know a lot of people seem to enjoy the more quick to develop, hot and heavy relationships in fanfic so Vox Corporis was a nice change of pace in that regard.

***** Honestly I think the best reading of it would be the M rated version, axe that scene or make it so that they literally just sleep together. I really like the buildup of their relationship, that scene is just awkward. I like smut in fics, but it didn't really fit for me there.

It does show its age in other ways, but it is important to keep in mind hp fanfiction tropes started somewhere. I really like the Harry/Tonks fic Summer of Change, but it shows its age as well.

  All anyone ever wants out of life is love, a family and home. Sometimes these are right under your nose. Harry/Hermione romance fic. Rated T. Non canon compliant with HBP or DH... probably not OOTP either.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.
