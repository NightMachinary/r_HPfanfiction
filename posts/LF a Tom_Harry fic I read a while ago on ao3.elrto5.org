:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Every other chapter was from Tom's p.o.v. when he was young and was falling in love with an older Harry. Then it would switch to Harry's p.o.v. when he was in 6th year and was picked up by a Voldemort who was in love with his alter who that he met years ago. Voldemort seems to know that Harry from his past was a time traveler as he gave Harry this drink "that Harry always ordered" and he noticed that Harry was drinking it for the first time with him... Thats all I remember...I know its not a lot. If someone knows what fic this is, could you please help me remember cuz I really want to reread it.


** I believe the fic your looking for is 60 Years in a Summer by Isys Luna Skeeter.

*** I dont think it was this one cuz Harry only meets mini Tom when Tom is in hogwarts already. Thank you though.

The story started with Harry meeting Voldemort as a 6th year from what I remember.
