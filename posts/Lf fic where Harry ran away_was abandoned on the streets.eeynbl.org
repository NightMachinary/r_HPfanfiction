Something like linkffn(Flame from the Underground by Shinigami Ace), Harry is part of the gang, living on the streets, doesn't go to Hogwarts for as long as possible

Any pairings; don't mind Dark!Harry, slash, non-magical au; prefer alive Jily but if they're not it's ok

Thanks :)


** Was it linkffn(9036071)?

I remember a gang and such, didn't read far enough to see when he goes to Hogwarts.

---edit--

are you looking for a fic in particular? I may have misunderstood your post.

  A young Harry Potter, abandoned on the streets, is taken in by a man with a mysterious motive. When his new muggle tattoo suddenly animates, he is soon learning forbidden magic and planning to infiltrate the wizarding world on behalf of the "ordinary" people. But nothing is ever that black and white. (Runes, Blood Magic, Parseltongue, Slytherin!Harry) (SEE NOTE 1st Chapter)

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhk√§se.
