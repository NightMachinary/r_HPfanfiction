Hey all,

Apologies if this isn't allowed. I combed through the rules and didn't find anything against beta requests, but I understand if this has to be deleted. I'm a bit desperate though!

I'm looking for a beta for a fest that I'm a part of. It's a Harry/Draco fic for an Mpreg fest over on Livejournal. I know the topic might be a little squicky for some, but i'm hoping someone's willing to look over it for me. I'm almost finished with the fic, so it's looking like it might be around 4k words, possibly less. Fic is due on May 15, hoping to have it finished within the next couple of days. I'm really only looking for someone to look over the fic for grammar/spelling and possible pacing issues-it shouldn't be a terribly long or difficult beta read. Fest is supposed to be anonymous, so I don't want to give away too much about my prompt but if you're interested in the beta, i'll give you more info on what the actual fic is about. It's not explicit, though, and the Mpreg part is obviously a core component but it's not overwhelmingly Mpreg, if that makes sense lol.

Thanks for considering! In exchange I'd be happy to beta for anyone or write something for you, if you like. Thanks!


** I'll look it over. You can dm me the link or your email.
