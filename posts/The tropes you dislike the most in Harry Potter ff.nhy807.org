Its probably been done a thousand times (idk tbh, just guessing) but what are the most common tropes you come across in Harry Potter fanfiction that you hate?

** Weasley bashing. What do people get out of bashing the most light family there is in the harry potter world?

** One thing I never got was people using Ron's snoring/eating as a way to bash him. Teenage boys aren't always the neatest eaters, and Harry likes to pile his plate with food too, so it's not just Ron. And why is snoring a reason to bash Ron? People can't control what they do when they're sleeping!

** Marriage Law, unless it leads to a fight of some kind. And yet I'm a sucker for contract fics.

** Using "oh, Merlin!" as an exclamation or mild profanity.

It doesn't happen in canon.

*** They do say "Merlin's beard" a ton of times though. And a few other variations pop up occasionally, including a few instances of "what in the name of Merlin." So it's at least pretty close to canon.

**** This is true. I believe it is only older characters who use "Merlin's beard" though. It's much more realistic to have them simply say "oh, God!" instead, which also has basis in canon.

***** Huh. I never noticed that it was only older characters who said it. Most of the more creative variations, including the "What in the name of Merlin" came from Ron though.

***** Well Hermione says "Merlin's pants" and Ron says "Merlin's most baggy Y-fronts" and "Merlin's saggy left [fill in the blanks since he was interrupted]"

****** They absolutely do, but you can count the number of times it happens on one hand. So I would rather people use creative variations like this very sparingly, than just throwing in Merlin all the time.
