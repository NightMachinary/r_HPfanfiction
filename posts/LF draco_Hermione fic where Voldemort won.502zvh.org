Hey!

Looking for a Draco/Hermione fic. Voldemort had won the war, Hermione had been a slave and escaped. Draco encounters her on (I believe) the Knight Bus and hides her in his apartment. Draco also has 2 neighbor OCs that are pretty cool.

Thanks!


** Pretty sure it's Cruel and Beautiful World, but seems the story is taken down...
