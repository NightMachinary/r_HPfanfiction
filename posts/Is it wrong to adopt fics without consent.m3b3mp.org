I keep getting invested in fics only to find out that they haven't been updated in years. Fics like 0800-rent-a-hero and Potter vs Paradox (you may sense a trend in my tastes here, don't judge.) which have a lot of promise but leave me wanting much more.

As far as I know nobody has picked these particular fics up and I am wondering if there is a reason why fics that have alot of promise just rot away like that. I have seen far less readable fics change authors 2-3 times so I am curious why nobody has picked these up.

I have played with the idea of writing fan fic for a while, but to be honest I am pretty ass at it and that is just original stuff, I don't have any confidence in my capacity to match my plot with another authors work much less their style of writing. I may not have confidence in my ability, but there has to be someone out there who can pick up abandoned fics right?

To get the the main point: If someone appears who has the way and the will to continue these old destitute fics is it cool if they do, like is it wrong of them to adopt a fic that has not even been formally abandoned or put up for adoption (but has been 5-6 years without an update)?


** I would suggest that if a story seems actually abandoned, go for it, but just post your continuation unless you have the author's consent. I.e. post a story as 'and ending to' or 'a continuation of' the original and link back to it so readers start there, rather than reposting everything already written.

** I could be biased but I wouldn't like it if someone picked up one of my fics without asking. One can ask if they can continue a fic but unless the author explicitly gives their agreement, it's just not cool to do so. Of course, if they do put it up for adoption or you ask permission to continue and get it, that's fine but otherwise, it's just wrong, even with proper credits. Of course, this is just my opinion but yeah. Imagine you write a fic and then life gets in the way and finally you come back and see that someone continued the fic from where you left off. I don't think that would feel good.

**** Yeah, abandoned works suck. Such amazing pieces and we'll never know the ending? Tragedy! But it still wouldn't warrant adopting a fic without permission. Most writers abandon their works for personal reasons. I read a Drarry one in which Harry had this magical terminal disease sort of like cancer. And in the last update, the author revealed that she started writing it because someone close to her was fighting cancer and then they passed and it's difficult for her to continue with the story. Imagine how she would feel if someone disregarded her pain and took on the story. Most authors probably don't have such extreme reasons, maybe it's just writer's block but still. same thing. Of course, this is not the same for all authors, some authors would love to see their unfinished works finished but we don't know who would love that unless they explicitly state that. So that's why I think asking for permission is better before adopting.

** It's fanfiction. The whole genre is taking someone's fic without permission. There shouldn't be a distinction between basing your work on the original author's and on another fanfic. The same rules do apply, of course: you should clearly state who the original fanfic author was; and you can't copy-paste their text, everything you write has to be original. But it is a good idea to try and reach out to the author first.

** Yeah it's probably wrong. Fanfic of a fanfic is fine. Adopting a fic, to me, implies you repost someone else's early chapters until you reach the part you write (which in my experience I can only think of one story where they wrote more than two extra chapters), and that's just plagiarism.

If someone wrote ‘fanfic of Skitterleap' and started somewhere just after the end or after the divergence, like we do with fanfic of canon, then that would be better. But then, it doesn't seem ‘adopting' to me, it's just recursive fanfic.

** As a matter of fanfiction etiquette, permission is required and proceeding without permission is liable to get you banned from a number of popular fanfic sites (although notably not AO3, who seem to have diverged substantially from the historic norms of the fanfiction community).

Assuming you don't care about the standards of the community and consider it as a simply moral question, I think there are a number of factors to consider.

1. All fanfiction is a derivative work; by participating in this community, there is an implication that we all agree that derivative works are generally okay.

2. An important caveat to that, however, is that JKR has given explicit carte blanche to fanfic writers to create derivative works of HP, so long as they don't profit from them. (She also stipulated no adult content, but that seems to have been ignored).

3. There are a couple of factors which distinguish first-order derivative works (i.e. fanfiction, "FF") from second-order derivative works (i.e. fanfiction of fanfiction, "2FF"). These factors may result in you concluding that 2FF is not always the same as FF.

4. FF cannot usurp the original work from which it derives because of legal protections enjoyed by JKR, as well as the basic fact that she is widely known to be the author of the HP universe. In contrast, if a 2FF becomes more popular than the FF that inspired it, the FF has no equivalent protection. The 2FF may well usurp the FF as the "primary" work of that fictional universe in the eyes of readers. In doing so, the 2FF author takes away from the FF author the right to determine what the "facts" of their story/universe are (as widely acknowledged by the fanbase), which no FF author can do to JKR.

5. FF is generally published in incomplete form, in a serialised fashion. In doing so, authors let you into their writing process, a privilege that does not exist with respect to published fiction. In contrast, JKR published the original HP works as complete works. A 2FF is therefore not really equivalent to an FF of the original books, unless it is a 2FF of a complete fanfiction. Rather, the equivalent would be if you had seen a copy of JKR's incomplete draft of a HP book, then published an FF of that incomplete draft which completed or altered it. It is an abuse of the privilege extended by authors who post in a serialised fashion. If it became widespread, I suspect the natural result would be that a lot of authors would refrain from publishing their works until they were complete, with the inevitable consequence that a lot less fanfic would get written.

With the above considerations in mind, my approach would be:

A. Always try to get permission. If you get permission, you can do whatever you like.

B. If you don't have permission, then certain types of fanfic should be avoided.

C. Specifically, do not try to step into the shoes of an author by completing their work for them or doing a rewrite of their work. This is not equivalent to fanfiction of a published work because it constitutes an attempt (whether intentional or not, whether attribution is given or not) to usurp the original author's moral rights.

D. This is especially true where the work you are seeking to step into is incomplete.

E. However, fanfiction of fanfiction is generally OK, in the sense of writing your own story which is inspired by another author's world, characters, magic, unique premise, etc.

Plagiarizing is a shit thing to do to anyone, professional or amateur

That said, no one asks permission from Rowling or other authors to write the fanfics to begin with, so I'm not exactly sure how adopting a fic without explicit permission would be all that different from writing your own fanfic.

Literally the entire basis of fanfiction is taking someone else's work and expanding on it / altering it without their permission. If someone has written a fanfic, they have absolutely no ground to stand on to tell you that you can't write a derivative work based on it without looking like a total asshole.

They already implicitly told you they're ok with it by doing it themselves, so go ahead.

**** I've seen countless fanfics in every fandom I read that exclusively consist of picking up exactly where canon has ended to continue the story.

If you were around when the HP books were still being written it was just about the most popular thing to do, for authors to write their own versions of book 5/6/7 before they came out. If JK Rowling died or gave up on the series before she finished it, you can bet your ass those types of fics would be the most popular ones in the fandom right now. And now with the books finished, Year 8/Epilogue compliant continuations are still hugely popular to write.

There's literally no difference at all. What distinction are you actually seeing here? I genuinely have no clue.

**** I may be interpreting this comment differently than others. When I see "continuing from where the author left off", I was thinking of discontinued stories, and in that, I agree that someone should not pick up that story and complete it without at least some permission. On the other hand, if it is abandoned, there is nothing wrong with another author writing their own story based on the same theme, or if is is considered complete, a continuation of the original story, as long as the original fanfic is not plagiarized, and credit is given to the original author. Take The Lone Traveler stories for instance. The Professional completely disappeared, so Dunuelos tried reaching out to them to get permission to continue the stories. After a period of time had elapsed with no response, Dunuelos did so. However, he did not complete any outstanding stories of The Professional, instead Dunuelos told his own stories, based on the theme that The Professional established for The Lone Traveller, and made sure that the original author was credited for the idea.

** I certainly don't think it's wrong. After all, that's essentially what we're all doing when we write fanfiction. I would definitely reach out to the author and ask them, but if they don't respond, I think you're fine. If you give credit where credit is due, then I would think it would be nice for those stories to have endings. Other people may feel differently, but I would actually be happy if someone someday felt the desire to complete my work. If I couldn't finish it myself, then I'd want someone else to do it for me.

I would either write my own based tightly or loosely based on those chapters or post a link to the original story from my continuation (the first chapter, which would be like chapter four if the original fic was three chapters long).

If I wanted to write a fan sequel of a fanfic, such as a Mr Black story, at this point it'd be in principle like writing Harry Potter fanfiction based on JKR's work -- ethically/morally you should ask permission. But the difference is that, although technically the same, morally/ethically the person who wrote the fic you want to expand upon by writing more in their playbox is a fellow fan/fanfiction writer, so you should ask for permission. That's good etiquette.

If I were to write a Mr. Black and the Cloverfield Paradox, for example, I'd ask R' Blot for his blessing in doing so.

Does this make sense?

What is different about this situation from normal fanfic?

That is the question I am asking you. Full stop. No other question. What in you head is the difference that makes continuing a fanfic being a "thieving asshole" but continuing a normally published original story just the normal state of fanfiction?

Nothing about what you're saying makes a single lick of sense. You haven't defined a difference between continuing JK's work or Rorschach's blot's. Yet you see doing one as ok but the other as being scum. Nobody's asked JK for permission to write fanfic yet here we are doing so.

Your statements have zero consistent logic I can identify. You just keep saying it's different without actually articulating why and rudely insulting people repeatedly.

You literally even have said it's the same thing. So where does "thieving asshole" come from? Why are people who do so disgusting? Where does such vitrolic hatred towards people who are doing what you admit is the same thing as writing fanfiction come from?

********** I suppose it's because one is socially acceptable (writing fanfiction of media and IPs, such as Harry Potter and Worm), compared to the same regarding other fanfiction writers regarding adopting their work without permission.

As I said, technically they're the same: morally/ethically, they're different.

This is just circular logic. "One is acceptable because it's acceptable and the other isn't because it isn't."

You're still not answering the question. You're saying they're different.

/Why./ You can't just throw this out there without any justification. You're still ignoring everything I've asked you. /Why is it morally different?/ Why are being so hateful to people?

***** Are you assuming that continuation fics literally just take the entire original fic and just post it as their first X chapters or something? Literally nobody does that.

** Technically speaking, having anything against it would be rather hypocritical, since they themselves didn't exactly ask JKR for permission to use her characters.

However, I personally think that you should ask before doing it if you can. You can always take the idea itself, but perhaps not the work.

** I do not think it is wrong. Even if the author explicitly.writes "Please do not adopt or complete this fic" at the start of each chapter, I don't think it's wrong to write more chapters for it if they've quit and clearly aren't coming back.

And I woukd thank you for writing more of the two.fics you gave as examples.
