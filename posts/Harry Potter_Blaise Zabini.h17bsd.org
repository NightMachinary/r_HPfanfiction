:END:
It starts with Harry wishing to be unnoticed, like a shadow and then escalates when his accidental magic leads him to learning German over night just so he could read a book on german fairy tales (this happens in a library). He then learns serveral more the same way.

It then skip forwards and he finds out about magic (somehow, i can't remember) and meets Blaise in the main book shop. Blaise drops a book/i think they bump into each other. Harry's invisibility/being unnoticed breaks when he speaks. Harry also has long hair and is mistaken as a girl. He also only speaks to Blaise in italian.

Oh! And Blaise and his Mother are Empaths of a kind.

Sorry i can't give more information but if you can find this that would be amazing!


** Was this one where he made some deal with a demon, got wish magic, spent time invisible in Hogwarts, saved Hermione from the troll, etc?

I forgot the name but hopefully this jogs some memories. I don't remember it being slash though so it might not be the one you're looking for

*** No, he was just very active with his 'accidental magic'. He manages to give himself an almost pernament 'notice-me-not' charm. Finds a book on fairy tales by the grimm brothers but its in german. He tries to teach himself german but his magic kicks in. He passes out and when he wakes up its midnight, in the library and he can now read/write and speak german.

**** Was it on ao3 or ff?

I remember another one from ao3 where Harry could wish things true, but it ended up being a Harry/LV story.

Sorry those are the only two that I remember with Harry wishing things true.

The story does seem interesting. Hopefully you'll find it.
