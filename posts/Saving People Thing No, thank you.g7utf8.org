As one might surmise from the title, I am looking for Fanfics in which Harry is devoid of his martyr complex, or at least it's diminished to some degree. I'd like to see a Harry that defends his right to live and his privacy, who doesn't go charging into danger at someone else's behalf - unless warranted by his relationship with the given person or group. Harry wants to be Just Harry, and is not afraid to speak out against those who'd put him in an arbitrary role. He's assertive and proactive, but not aggressive - preferably.

*TLDR:* Harry cares for his friends and family, strangers - not so much.

*Things I like:* Gen. fics; slice of life; character development and interactions; a (small!) dash of wish fulfillment / fix fic;

*Things I'd prefer to avoid:* Explicit M/M; cardboard cutouts; edge; overblown revenge fics;

Older, jaded Harry tries to avoid Death Eaters after being thrown back into the 70's, but runs into then all the same. Doesn't really have a martyr complex, but it isn't a plot point. Time Travel warning

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** Fits the idea of Harry not wanting to be a hero and I really liked it so far.

  Dumbledore expected a weak Harry who lived with the Dursley's. He was not expecting a Harry who grew up on the streets and has no interest in playing a hero. After being abandoned in America by the Dursley's Harry learnt to survive using his brains and magic. Dumbledore, Hermione and select Weasley bashing. Dark/grey Harry.
