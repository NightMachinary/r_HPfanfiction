Come on!

What's it called? What sort of food do they sell? Who's it run by? What makes it extra-special?


** Hm. "Floo-Food", delivery through the Floo Network. (If you don't have a floo connection, you're better off apparating to the shop and getting it yourself instead of waiting for an Owl to reach the shop.)

They have all meals in stasis, pre-heated, and simply duplicate them when needed, so it's always the same (the best!) quality, and always fresh, and they offer a very wide selection of dishes. Some of their employees do nothing but travel the world and sample exotic dishes, then stasis them to sell them at the shop.

Some people claim that it's a bit too perfect, and that getting the exact same dish each time that particular dish is ordered is boring, but most customers agree that the vast selection makes up for that. They have had some lawsuits from other magical restaurants for copying their dishes, and stick to muggle cuisine nowadays.

** In two of the stories i'm working on, Harry owns a chain of restaurants(actually, more than one but the others are just investments while these specific ones were his idea). Technically, automats. House-elves run a kitchen in the back and in the front people walk along the line, choose what they want, then pay the cashier in one while the other story has them pay at the food slot.

The idea came to me when i was trying to figure out ways for Harry to grow his wealth while watching a Doris Day movie and trying not to grumble every time they gaussian blurred her(she was getting old and she didn't want her crows feet to show). A scene in the movie happened in an automat and that pinged for me. They're so old there's like only one in the US and it became the perfect way to bridge the gap my darkness!harry sees.

** Something POTLUCK. So you could order say dinner, but you would get flood whatever was leftover from the hogwarts menu that day. And you just get what you get. Bonus less food wastage and more income for the school, and still quirky in the way all wizard things are

** Insta-meal!

Simply order via floo or owl, and seconds after your order is placed, it will be delivered by someone wearing a time-turner.

** I could see a floo-based delivery service where you order by sticking your head into a fire and a delivery person comes through it with the food when it's ready. A lazy wizard could operate out of Muggle restaurants and split the Floo delivery profits with the Muggle owners.
