Hello everyone! I absolutely loved No Longer Playing by bluecurls on AO3, but it seems to have been taken down. I'm a bit devastated, because it had everything I love in my Potter fic.

Does anyone have any recommendations for smutty/fluffy stories about a three-way relationship between Hermione, Sirius and Lupin?

Or if anyone has a downloaded copy of No Longer Playing, I'll love you forever for a copy :D

Thanks, everyone :) xx


** Linkao3(the debt of time by shayalonnie) and linkffn(one hundred and sixty nine by Mrs J's soup) fit this. DoT is really on the nose. 169 is more plotty than smutty and more Srimione than a full three way, but I have to mention it because it's my favorite fic, period.

There's another fic I'm thinking of in this vein (Hermione fix-it marauder era fics) where she's a lioness animagus and she recruits death eaters and brands them with lion paw dark marks, so they later be shown to be double agents. Anyone know what I'm referring to?

  Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

*** It's fanfic. There's no rule saying Hermione has to be the age she was in canon when she interacted with them both.

Time travel fic where she as an adult meets them as adults. Fix-its where they don't die. There are options here.

**** True enough. Sadly most of them involve a teenager and a 30 year old, which is beyond creepy.

Of course I have seen Harry/InsertBlackSister fics with a 30 year age difference so nothing can scare me anymore.

/Except that creepy one with an 11 year old Hermione in the headmaster office.../

*** The things I like are when she's grown up and they're either still 20 years older than her, or there's time travel and she's the same age :)
