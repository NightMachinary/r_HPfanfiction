Honestly got this from reading Order of The Phoenix. Want to read some fics that feature "Houses" like the Blacks, Malfoys, Peverell, Potter etc and bloodlines and maybe some mentions of family vaults here and there.


** My series, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) linkffn(The Chessmaster: White Knight) focuses on politics and world building and involves the various houses.

  Chessmaster Volume II. Tensions continue to rise both inside and outside Hogwarts with the announcement of the International Scholastic Quidditch Tournament.

*** This was gonna be my recommendation too! Normally I don't go in for ancient house stuff but I really love the way you're handling it! Hermione's story and past experiences are really interesting too. I can't wait to see where that goes. Loving your series so far! :D

** Don't know if this is what you were looking for, but it focuses heavily on the Black family (all five of the 'Marauders' era gen Blacks).

** Check out some of the stories by Aduro on ffn. She does several which focus on the Malfoy family and some of the other old bloodlines. They aren't canon but I loved the history she came up with.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11664138/1/Renewal][Renewal]] by Azenor Sage is a very pureblood type of story. It mainly details the ancient house politics. I mean very detailed. It's impressive how the author researches a Victoria Era Lords and Ladies style of politics and incorporates it into the story.
