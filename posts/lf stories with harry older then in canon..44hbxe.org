** Off the top of my head, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9939304/1/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum][Si Vis Pacem Para Bellum]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]]. Both are currently updating stories, although the former is going very slowly, and the latter hasn't been updated since August.
