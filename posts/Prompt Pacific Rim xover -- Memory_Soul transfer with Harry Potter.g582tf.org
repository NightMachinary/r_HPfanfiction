So, I just finished watching the Pacific Rim movie for the first time. I thought it was extremely good, and made me want to read a Pacific Rim xover. Unfortunately, I didn't see really any on fanfiction, so I figured I post it as a prompt. For the prompt l, I have some minor ideas of how to go about it, though feel free to ignore it all for some other idea. (or ignore this prompt all together.)

1. Harry's earth was already conquered by the Kaiju. While Harry had died, a speck of his magic and soul lived on within the Kaiju that devoured him. When Newton or Hannibal dive with the Kaiju's brain, well, you can be sure the speck decides to relocate. (Or maybe the magic -- perhaps driven by Master of Death instincts -- wrapped his whole soul and secured it into the Kaiju until such a chance to escape occured.)

2. Harry is within the afterlife train station (either during the 7th book or post-epilogue...either because hes dead or being Master of Death lets him chill out in the way station) when Raleigh loses his brother. As his brother crosses over to the other side, Harry accidently or is urged to follow the connection between Yancy and Raleigh. Raleigh is now either both Harry and himself, or has Harry in him Kyuubi-style. (Or they start as separate but slowly merge together) Oh, and afterlife/waystation treats time differently, so Harrys life couldve been in the past or in an alternate universe

Edit: In light of watching the second movie, if Harry gets connected to Newton, itll be interesting to see how MoD would handle, eh, "Alice". But if Harry does connect with Newton, it would also be interesting if the connection was weak, causing Harry to be asleep. That is, until Newtons second dive causing Harry to go into Hermanns head instead. This severing of Harry's and Newton's temporary connection could be what allows Newton to get easilly possessed by Alice, leading to the second movie.
