Dumbledore never putting on the Horcrux ring. How would it have affected things if Dumbledore had lived?

Sirius surviving and being given a proper trial after the Department of Mysteries. How much would that change things?

Fudge actually listening to Dumbledore sooner about Voldemort. What would have happened?

Sirius Black never going to Azkaban in the first place.

The first war, and the affects from not trusting others.

More stories where Cedric lives. OR stories where Harry and Cedric don't grab onto the trophy but instead get some backup first or something.

More Order Missions. Maybe some different groupings in the Order Missions, so we can see different character interactions.

Are some of mine, what are some of yours?


** The Golden Trio just being best friends and having moments together, not necessarily with any Hinny/Romione.

*** Missing Moments in fanfics are great for the trio just hanging out and doing whatever.

*** Yes! That'd be nice. They share a dorm room, even if Harry or Ron weren't as close to the other three, surely they'd have more moments together, hanging out/goofing around/telling stories/etc.

** I am biased because I write it but - Cedric lives and it isn't sunshine rainbows and Hedric. I find his fate in CC absolutely intriguing and I want more people to write about how that could have happened.

** Harry learns about Delphini when she's still a baby and adopts her, because he isn't about to let another orphan grow up unloved like he did.

** Gryffindor stays as it is in Canon, Slytherin stays as it is in Canon, /Dumbledore stays as he is in Canon/, and Harry with a different character is sorted into Slytherin, and fits in there well.

You'd /think/ many people would have written that. In practice, not so much.

*** Idk mate, from what we see in CoS the stuff Draco talks to his friends about is really quite stupid. Like who spends their free time talking about how much other people suck? Sure...he's 12, but like does he not have a single interest besides talking shit about other people?
