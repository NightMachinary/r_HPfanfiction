**** Name nerds, assemble! If Petunia had been born a boy, what would his parents have named him? The parents in question live in the west Midlands (I think this fact is technically fanon?), and it's the early 60s. Off the top of my head, the name Peter sounds the closest, and it's one of those classic names that never really fell out of style, but Pettigrew already has that name, so ... what else?

***** From the sound I agree that Peter is the most similar, but there are other angles you can use.

While there are many different sources and meanings in flower language, *Petunia* is often associated with /resentment and anger/. *Marigold* or *Calendula* by its Latin name is similar, meaning /cruelty, grief and jealousy/, but it does not make a good name. *Basil* on the other hand stood for /hatred/ in ancient greece and sometimes for satan in medieval europe and is already in use as a name in Britain.

If flower names are not your thing you could go for trees. They usually have positive meanings, but there are a lot of options. *Alder*, *Ashton*, *Linden* and *Rowan* are just a few. *Hawthorn* may be too out of the ordinary to go with Lily, but the connection to /contradiction, consequence and relationships/ that some sources ascribe to it is rather fitting for these siblings.

In case you want to keep the negative connotation and do not care for the plant theme, *Atrius*, meaning /malice/ might be a bit too much, but *Marion*, which is derived from biblical Maria/Mary and shares the meaning of /bitterness/, would be a perfectly fine choice.

I hope this was enough name geekery for you!

****** I also wanted to think of names that parents in the early 60s in a working class West Midlands milltown would have considered for a firstborn male child, but thanks for these cool suggestions.

******* I mean, Petunia has never been a particularly common name so I think we can assume Mr. and Mrs. Evans were kinda weird themselves. I kinda like the idea of them being hippies. Petunia wanting to be /aggressively/ normal was rebellion against that. Her parents did have literal "flower children" after all.
