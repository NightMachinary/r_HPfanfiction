Most of the fics that I've read contains either Evil!Dumbledore or Manipulative!Dumbledore. I'm looking for fics that contain wholesome Good!Dumbledore. And No Weasley or Ron Bashing. Hopefully NO H/Hr pairing.


** Dumbledore is pretty freaking /awesome/ in Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)

He has all the silliness of "Alas, Earwax" Dumbledore, is pretty manipulative but takes /all/ of that out on the Ministry front to get stuff done, and last but not least /is a competent adult/, near-miss with a Horcrux-ring notwithstanding.

The story in general is one of the best slice-of-life takes on the series, even with its cracky premise.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

*** I've seen this fic a couple of times, but I'm a little unsure on reading it, I think it might not be my cup of tea. I'm not honesty sure why.

**** I think the premise might be kind of a turnoff if you're used to the average power-wank fic - usually, dragon animagus forms put you firmly in "bad power fantasy written by a 12-year-old" territory.

I'll give my word that /this/ one isn't like that.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), both are from the same author and feature scarily manipulative Dumbledores. But instead of the usual "how to manipulate a teenager to sacrifice himself" BS, these Dumbledores display their skills on the political and operational level. Of course, Harry stays totally loyal to him.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] plays out in a non magical sci-fi universe in which Hogwarts is a spy school. Needless to say, this Dumbledore is manipulative and ruthless as hell. Being trained from very early on, these kids are also on a totally different level and eventually figure out what Dumbledore was up to. But since they are already master spies, no hard feelings here:

#+begin_quote
  Harry softly said, “Dumbledore was already resigned about dying. He didn't even care about getting hurt or poisoned when we went in the cave. He would've asked for help on something else. Like turning Draco. Or protecting the school.”

  Ron fumed, “You're trying to tell me Dumbles was asking Snape to kill him?”

  Hermione asked him, “Would you have wanted to go out the way the headmaster was facing? Either being tortured to death by Death Eaters or slowly dying in agony from his illness?”

  Neville said through his packed nose, “Old SS and KGB trick. You shoot your spy so everyone thinks you're on their side.”

The still updating [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13388022/1/][Albus and Harry's World Trip]], linkffn(13388022), is pretty cool.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24450217/chapters/59001382][Too Old for This]], linkao3(24450217), is a crack piece featuring 'gangster Dumbledore'. I think it's awesome, here is the first paragraph

#+begin_quote
  "Sit down, Harry, and shut the fuck up."

  Dumbledore pulled a cigar to his mouth and inhaled. Then he blew the smoke out, letting it spread throughout the room and form into obscene words.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. It has been rated accordingly. On hiatus. Note in ch. 34

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
