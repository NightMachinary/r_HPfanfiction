I would just like to see a Harry that hates Tom's guts because he basically destroyed the lives of many people, his included.


** Ooo and imagine if like somehow through Harry's non-interaction with Tom but with others in the community it somehow alters Tom from going down Voldemort's route? Or like Harry indirectly interacts with Tom and fucks around with him leaving Riddle completely rattled and indignant about it all?

#+begin_quote
  Seized by Voldemort at the end of his fifth year, in the Department of Mysteries, Harry was transformed into a cat and sent tumbling through time. Armed with nothing except teeth and claws, Harry has to handle the threat posed by Tom Riddle and his teenage followers. He intends to stop the genius young Dark Lord and sabotage him at every turn...in the form of a cat. Sounds simple?

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said, stalking closer, “is you.” He marched forward, backing Harry up until he was pinned to the cool wall of the common room. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely pleased. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro was a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer, “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.

Maybe the fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7189349][Wear Me Like A Locket Around Your Throat]] which is somewhat similar in the time travel genre but is a Tom/Harry fic? I just double checked the author notes again and this statement is the closest thing to implying a ship, with the answer implying unlikely:

"As of right now, Harry and Tom probably won't be in a romantic relationship, which is why I left it was just a "&" rather than a "/", though that could be liable to change depending on how the story develops. Rest assured, I will change the tags if that does happen, and give you guys an heads up."
