Now, the story itself could focus on Harry or one of the characters in the Golden Trio Era, but before they were in Hogwarts. Or it could be a story focused on one of Ron's brothers or other family members.

It could focus on Tom Riddle, Minerva McGonagall, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Molly and Arthur or any other character, as long as the Golden Trio aren't at Hogwarts.

Would rather it be completed, if not that's fine.

Can be Het/Slash/Femslash, though if it's focused on the Golden Trio Era, I don't want pairings with one of the Golden Trio Era characters when they are young.


** That's like half the stories out there, counting all the Marauder-era, young Tom Riddle era, etc. To pick a few favorites at random:

  Regulus wishes -- sometimes, not too often -- that he were like Sirius, able to make things up on the spot. Sirius says he has never seen a single bloody thing in his tea leaves, or his cards, or his palms, in the milky depths of a crystal ball or the glistening entrails of a dead pigeon. He just enjoys telling stories. Regulus sees water. His tealeaves: Dregs of muddy water. His cards: The Queen of Cups, waiting by the waterfront. His crystal ball: Unmoving, opaque water. His sign: Cancer, one of the Water Trigon. His palms: Somehow, impossibly, water. So, yes. He really did deserve that P in Divination. - Or: Regulus thought he knew all the horrors of Grimmauld Place, but on this stifling hot summer night in 1976, the house seems hell-bent on terrorising him in new and interesting ways. It's all Sirius's fault, of course.

  Fred and George Weasley are used to pulling pranks with a hairpin and pocketknife, but in their first year at Hogwarts, they find some extra help locked in a drawer in Filch's office.
