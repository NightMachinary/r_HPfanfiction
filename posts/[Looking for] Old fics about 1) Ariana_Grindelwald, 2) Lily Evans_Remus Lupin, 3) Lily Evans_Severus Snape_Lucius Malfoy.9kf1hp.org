Can't remember the titles or authors, didn't favorite them so maybe the writing wasn't good, definitely written before the 2010's, read them on FF.Net, already tried searching on Google but didn't come up with anything.

1) Grindelwald molests Ariana causing her to be pregnant, she dies giving birth, Albus hides the child somewhere, unfinished so I don't know if there's anything beyond this.

2) Written from the point of view of Lily about how more "in tune" she and Remus are; I think they were a couple before she got together with James and had come to the point of imagining what their wedding would be like (something simple). Her own wedding with James was the complete opposite of what she had imagined with Remus (over the top, too many guests). Later on she narrates that James gave her a second wedding which is everything she ever imagined so it's still James/Lily in the end. I feel like this was written before it was revealed that her maiden surname was Evans. Definitely written before we found out she was friends with Snape.

3) Starts with Remus and Sirius deciding to tell Harry the "real" story of his parents. Lily acts as a spy for the Order, infiltrating Voldemort's ranks by exploiting the fact that she is his long lost daughter. I clearly remember that Voldemort calls her "Lilith." It becomes a dangerous game as Lucius and Snape both try to woo her and James is against all of this. There was a ball where she danced with the Malfoy and Snape and she wore a green dress. Definitely written before we found out Snape was a half blood. This story was also not yet finished the last time I saw it so I don't know if there's anything beyond what I wrote. They had all graduated from Hogwarts already.

Pretty sure that would be rape, rather than molestation.
