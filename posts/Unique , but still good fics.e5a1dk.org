  Harry runs away at age four. After bringing him back, Dumbledore's attempts to keep him at Privet Drive gets progressively more ridiculously extreme with each of his escapes. Animagus!Harry, Crack

  To escape the cold night on November 1, 1981, little Harry Potter's accidental magic kicks in, and he manages to turn himself into a snake and slither away before his aunt can find him in the morning. Raised by snakes, he forgets that he is actually a boy...and then one day he accidentally wanders into a place known by humans as the "Forbidden Forest".

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3983170/1/Never-Say-Remember][Never Say Remember by Malora]]

Harry is thrown into an alternate universe where his mother is alive and married to Snape. But not everything is as it seems.

Meanwhile the alternate Harry is thrown into the universe we know and love where his whole world has been turned upside down.

One of my favorite fics ever. Really well written and a total tear-jerker.

** linkao3(10382739) Bat Out Of Hell, in which the Nine-Tailed-Fox, the demon from Naruto is reincarnated as a female Harry Potter. I know female Harry and female Hermione fics aren't /that/ rare but usually neither of the two are also a giant fox, sadly it's incomplete if ongoing in the second book of what is looking to be at least a 4 or maybe a 7 parter.

  When Naruto died at the hands of a civilian during his academy days, so did the Kyuubi no Kitsune. Now here the Kyuubi was, reincarnated, and bouncing around in an eleven year old girl's body, while half the wizarding world treated her like the second coming of Merlin (whoever that was)... and the rest didn't know what to make of her...[HP/Naruto fic utilising dubious canon elements. You have been warned!]

** Uniqueness for the sake of uniqueness is rarely a marker for a good story. The best stories do use cliches, because a good idea is still a good idea even if a bunch of people have used it before. The authors of the best stories just do it well.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8906032][Death of a Dark Lord, a True Story - by Gilderoy Lockhart]] has the premise of a self-insert bodyswap with Lockhart. It's locked to AO3 members (PM me if you need an invite) so no ffnbot, but here's the summary:

#+begin_quote
  A past, more sensible, less frightened version of me might wonder what I was doing with a human leg, most of a human hand, thirty gallons of petrol and a crowbar.

  Luckily, all sensible people had long since left my house.
