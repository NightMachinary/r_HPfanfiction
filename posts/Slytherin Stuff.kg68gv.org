** Of a linear Circle by Flamethrower.

It's about a million and a half words or something ridiculous. Focuses on many things, one is the Slytherin house and how it's ideals have been warped over time. What caused it, how it's rectified. It is split into books and the main story arc is rounded off. I assume they'll keep writing but you can finish the story there and it's good ðŸ˜Š

Insanely well written with a lot of detail into real history, language, lore. How translations over time get skewed which can change interpretations and meanings.

It's just incredible. People are put off by the pairing but truely there is so much more to it than that. The romance is such a tiny subplot in a world where waay more important politics and schemes and secrets are happening.

** I have no idea why you're being downvoted. I'm pretty sure the books themselves ultimately want to convey the message that prejudice is never good and that the world is /not/ divided into 'good people or Death Eaters'.

It's sad to see that the message the books bring failed to reach many so-called 'fans'.

Here's a great fic for you.

*** The books may pay lip service to "prejudice is bad", but what they /show/ is different. Prejudice against Slytherins is canonically /justified/, because any Slytherin who gets more than a name-drop is mildly or strongly hostile. /The entire house walks out on the final battle/. The most heroic Slytherin we see on screen is Severus Snape, who is certainly brave but a very nasty man.

Slytherin in canon is literally Death Eater house. It isn't even given the dignity of living up to its stated qualities of cunning and ambition, not with the likes of Crabbe and Goyle going there. Even Draco, while more intelligent, is not cunning, not with the way he runs his mouth, and he doesn't show ambition, there's no sign of him working toward goals, he just expects the world to work out according to the principles he's been taught. That's more like Gryffindor thinking. But he's in Slytherin, because that's where all the prospective Death Eaters go. The Hat didn't even have to reflect on it, it screamed Slytherin as soon as it brushed his head. Is that not the very definition of prejudice, ie making a hasty judgement before you've had time to weigh the evidence?

** That's simply not true, we only see around 20 slytherins. Of those only 10 are ever named as taking part in the stuff that goes down.

They're more susceptible to what's going on in large part because of Snape and Dumbledore's forgiveness trumps all approach. Consider it like living in a KKK neighbourhood while white.

**** Nope, as there's a good 150- 200 students in Slytherin house. Most of the Harry's year do though, but even then, only Malfoy, Pansy, and the bookends get named in that.

***** Yeah but wasn't the whole of the Slytherin spectator stand singing "Weasley is our king"? It's heavily implied the whole house or at least all the Slytherins at the game were singing along.

Not that that makes them evil tbh, sports fans sing and chant all sorts of crap at the opposition, especially when it's a "serious rival" team.

****** It's also a matter of peer pressure and fear of retribution. In a crowd we can't know how many believe what they're chanting, or even how many didn't chant.

******* Yes that's true and exactly why I said it doesn't make them evil, just caught up in the moment or feeling they have to. But I do think the book clearly implies that most were chanting- the fact Harry could hear the words clearly from the pitch proves it was more than just Malfoy, Goons 1&2, and Pansy.

****** Yeah I don't think the song was about him being poor, it was about him being shit at sports. It's an intimidation tactic (from the house of the cunning, it makes sense) and doesn't mean that they're all evil lol.

******* I think the line "Weasley was born in a bin" is a direct reference to his socioeconomic status tbh. But yeah it was absolutely an intimidation tactic, they picked on the things they knew would make him angry, cause him to lose concentration, and allow their team to score more goals because he's distracted and het up.
