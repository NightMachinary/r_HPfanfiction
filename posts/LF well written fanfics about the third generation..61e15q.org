Hi, guys! I'm new at reading fanfics and I was just wondering if out there exist a well-written fanfic with interesting plot and character development about the third generation or just Teddy Lupin.


** linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity) - Teddy's first year turns out to be quite an adventure, in part because the Sorting Hat has decided to change its process for choosing Houses.

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** linkffn(8417562) - A completed 7 year fic, extremely well written with a lot of expansions on Rowling's hpverse (magical developments made in the ~19 years since Harry was at school). Introduces lots of OC's, spells, creatures, theory and lore - would highly recommend!

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!
