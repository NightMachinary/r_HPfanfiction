My favorite is Bite Marks by provocative_envy

I like how everyone is funny and awkward. Draco and Harry's rivalry is hilarious.


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is as good as a non-magical AU can get.

*** Does it get any better as it goes on? I couldn't even make it through first year. I can't really describe what I didn't like about it other than it being very bad about telling instead of showing. It also just felt very Mean Girls like without any consistent characterization. The plot and setting are all super interesting, I just couldn't really get into it

**** I would say the interesting part begins after Year 3, or chapter 58. The weighting of years is very different in this fic, with the last two years making up almost half of the chapters.

***** You gotta go through *58 chapters* to get to the good part? That's a bit of a yikes tbh

**** I thought the story got cool, but I'm also a huge fan of spy books and also engineering geeky-ness. The writing style is a bit grating though -- I would suggest waiting out through year 2, and if you still don't like it, then you probably won't enjoy it later.

*** Personally, I liked it as I read it. Some parts are actually pretty good--the Umbridge is actually pretty interesting, and the interactions with the Detective guy are fairly enriching to the characters.

Upon reflection I wish I could have those ~8 hours back.

The plot's pretty much identical to canon, except Hermione's SMART, and therefore she figures out everything, such as Riddle is Voldemort (using an anagram computer program (can I just point how unlikely that is? First, she needs to specifically choose *I AM* LORD DEATHKILL instead of just DEATHKILL or LORD DEATHKILL (and yes, he's LORD DEATHKILL in this AU) and then somehow this computer program needs to get through 3x2x2x2x11! possibilities and it's not looking for normal dictionary words, it's specifically looking for proper nouns and names)), or Snape was good all along. What does this change? Nothing. The plot plays out identical to canon, with a few more side plots.

Also, since magic isn't a thing and LV is an actual death commando, why didn't he just use a gun on Harry. The science-magic strains credulity and ends up being unimmersive.

It's basically a reskin of canon, if you're willing to read that, but made absurdly Hermione-centric. Why did Lavender snog Ron? To get him and Hermione together.

** Linkffn(The Granger Principle)

It's updated weekly right now and really interesting, a Hermione from a close to canon but with more competent Dumbledore and Ron (typical for Starfox) universe ends up in a nonmagical AU (although her old potions still work, she can't make new ones) and she meets the nonmagical versions of Harry and Ron. Some people might have figured out that her quantum mirror cage is really a WIP dimension portal and try to kidnap her.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

** Mine is an H/G story where Harry goes to a different Muggle AU every time he manages to die. I can't find it right now, but there's one where he's a soccer star, one where he's a cop, and one where he's a revolutionary, and always he dies and moves on.

** I usually steer clear of non-magic AU fics, but someone recomended [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10868642/1/][Blurring Reality]] a while back, and I loved it.

At the start of the fic, amateur dancer Harry Potter gets drafted into playing the part of the Hero in the famous ballet /A Prophecy/. However, once rehearsals start up the line between fantasy and reality seems to get thinner, with tragedy waiting in the wings.

My assumption was that a Hogwarts ballet school AU must be a crack fic, but it's actually some great psychological horror. Sadly it's unfinished.

*** My theory is that it was real magic, but Dumbledore or someone else Did A Thing and sealed the Second Wizarding War into the play and created an AU.

  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.
