** Reviews typically pops up fics that spark discussion, which I've found does better then favourites, as a lot of people tend to just fav any fic they read all the way through. I generally go by reviews, set it to either over 60k words or complete depending on what I'm looking for. And /always/ set the rating to M on FFN - the mods used to be extremely anal about swearing, so a lot of authors would default to a mature rating even if there's nothing M-rated in the fic itself.

*** So would I just use the filter on scryer and once I've found a fic go to ffn or would I just read it on scryer

** I left ff.net because i thought the search system wasnt very good. I didn't really use it, I would just read a good fic and then go to the author's favourites list and read those, and go to /those/ author's favourites list and read /their/ favourites and so on and so forth.

*** I'd probably transition to ao3 if the search filters there actually /worked/. It's probably due to years of authors learning how to avoid the exclude filters, but every time I try to find a DE!Harry fic without HP/LV, I slap down like eight different filters, including a flat out exclusion of M/M, and still get like five HP/LV fics in the top results.

**** That's my issue with AO3 as well is that there's SO many tags an author can put on the story it's basically like the filters don't even work.

***** I'm also not very fond of the fact there's a search tag for 'Underage sexual content'. Feels like we're all on a watchlist from using AO3.

****** I use the tampermonkey extension to block out any fic with that tag, and a few other questionable ones, as soon as I open the site. I knew I had to figure something out after I stumbled upon a fic that out of nowhere had a scene between 1st years. It was tagged, I just wasn't paying attention but it shouldn't exist in the first place. Anyway Tampermonkey it's a bit tricky to set up but it is brilliant.

****** It's under Content Warnings - the purpose is to let you know if you want to /avoid/ it. The way it works means you can exclude it from your searches

******* I somehow doubt 8 is the lower limit, ao3 seems to have quite a lot of people that can only be described as degenerates. On my last search stint, I saw a fic that literally had "Pedophilia" as a tag. Reported it, but I'm really not holding my breath for it to actually get removed.

******** Well, I would be really surprised if something surpassed 8 year old twins-parent relationship. Dude was told that 8 year old cant even have a boner like he does in fic and that author is delusional pedophile. Answer was something like dont kinkshame lol

********* Just plain delusional. "Kinkshame" would imply it's a kink. Scat is a kink. Clowns are a kink. Chinese triple amputee fart porn is a kink. Pedophilia is a disgusting crime which pretty universally gets you locked up pretty much anywhere in the world.

** I use 'fav' when I'm looking for a certain pairing (Haphne, Dramione, harmony etc) and put 100k+ words. This keeps me going for quite some time, then I go for 60k+ and after that, another pairing.

Usually I loose track in between cuz I find a very good story then I start reading the other stories from the same author and if they have a different pairing that I like, I start browsing their favs. Once I have checked out the author and their fav, I continue from where I left off in my original search.

** I usually just read crossovers, because you can only read the same story being rehashed so often before going insane, and on FFN at least sorting by favourites in the crossover areas gets me good results. I've gotten pretty good at spotting fishy stories based on their description alone, too.
