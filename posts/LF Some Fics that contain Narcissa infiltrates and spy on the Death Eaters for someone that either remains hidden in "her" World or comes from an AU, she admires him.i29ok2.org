I thought that Narcissa finds someone (or that person finds her) and she infiltrates the DE to spy for him. For the whole time, she remains loyal to that Person, she admires him with nearly the same degree that Bellatri does Voldemort. Whether this Fic follows Canon or goes AU doesnt matter.

Although i would like, if its some AU, since she wouldnt be married with Lucius (if Canon, her whole Marriage would be for her cover or other stuff).

â€‹

Optionally: possible there comes a situation that keep her from reporting, for Years. When they meet atleast, he might remark:

"you have grown old", "Im sorry" he would cup her Face and look into her eyes, she mirrors the action and gets lost in his gaze. "Dont be. It suits you. Like a fine Wine that gets more delicious when the ages pass" well, this i just a wishfull Dialogue and totally dont have to be in the Fic, but maybe some similar stuff. And Narcissa would of course have grown older, but also her appearance. Because of all that Stress, maybe.

Their feelings are similar, even if his behavior or speech doesnt show it (he doesnt threat her bad).


** This is oddly specific, are you looking for a specific fic or is this just a head cannon that popped up?
