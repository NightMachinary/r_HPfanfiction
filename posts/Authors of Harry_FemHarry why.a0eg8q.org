** Harry's life is hard. He doesn't share much but carries a lot of difficult burdens. If he were to approach or be approached by someone who knows /exactly/ what he's gone through, the sense of kinship would be overwhelming.

It's wrong, inappropriate, but for a person (or two people) carrying a burden of destiny and the expectation of a short lifespan, why not reach out for that absolute understanding? If the one can forgive the other, then maybe they both can forgive themselves.

**** linkffn(Equal and Opposite by Amerision; HP and the Girl Who Lived by Agnostics Puppet; Dancing With Myself by Swordchucks; Self Reflection by Blandge) There are others, but that's a fair sampling of the well-known ones.

  Mirrors are funny things. They show us what we are, what we were, and what we could have been. When Harry and Haley Potter look into the mirror and see each other, a connection is forged that will see their destinies intertwined.

***** I quite like this pairing, (for pretty much the same reason as the original commenter in this thread) but I feel abit of a warning on "Equal and Opposite" is appropiate. This fic, is dark. It is twisted, and it is at times an almost toxic thing to read, as if by doing so, you are somehow letting something into your head that does not belong there. It is also bloody brilliant. It at least, the first part is. Its plot perfectly matches the tone and feeling it inspires in its readers, and that is something that rare to the point of absurdity. That being said, I literally cannot comment on anything past a certain point because of what I said earlier, it got into my head and fucked shit up like a bull in a china shop. I eventually had to stop reading because it felt like I was being exposed to a toxic material, I dreaded whatever was coming next and absolutely could not wait to get there. My reading experience was simply not healthy. It should be noted that I was somewhat depressed when I started reading, which most certainly had an effect on the story's impact on me, but regardless I feel that anyone approaching this story should know what they are getting into before hand. A story with an almost overwhelming intensity that, at the very least, explores some of the darker parts of the human mind and heart. If you are psychologically unstable, DO NOT READ. If you are in fact stable, and willing to brave the storm, then by all means go ahead, and try to appreciate it while you're there. Because I imagine you won't be coming back for a while.

*** Not only that, but the person who understands you best is yourself and frankly:

Loving yourself (even if that self happens to be in another body and of the other gender) is quite healthy :) - hell, you might learn something because you can bounce your ideas off of somebody with similar experiences (without talking to yourself, which often doesn't help!)

** If Harry meets fem!Harry late enough, the sibling kinship will fail, potentially leading to this. Not that it is /right/ according to normal society rules, but...

Personally I never cared much for the incest taboo in first place, as long as people are aware of the pregnancy reprecussions (and thus avoid it), and all other morals are maintained. With that said, Harry/fem!Harry isn't something I read myself. Not because it repulses me, but because I'm simply indifferent to the pairing.
