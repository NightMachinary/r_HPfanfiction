** Has anyone done a story where each of Voldemort's horcruxes contain a different slice of his personality that get removed from the main when he creates them?

The locket could be passion/sexuality (comes across with the anti-HarryxHermione scene), the diary could be his charm (sweet talking Ginny), Harry's scar is his recklessness.

Just a thought I've had a couple times.

The locket would be lust because his mother lusted after Tom Riddle and ran off with the locket to be with him

**** Lust = Locket

For reasons mentioned in parent comment. Riddle also charmed the knowledge of the locket out of Hepzibah Smith.

Greed = Diadem

An artifact of immense power which drove Riddle to seek it out.

Wroth = Harry

Rowling mentions that Harry's greatest flaw is his anger.

Sloth = Cup

The horcrux with the laziest protections (bung it in a vault) and the laziest reason for being a horcrux in the first place (he'd already done the rest of the founder's artefacts, might as well continue the set despite this one not having much significance to him)

Gluttony = Nagini

The only horcrux that can actually eat people. We know Nagini has attacked several people, including devouring Charity Burbage.

Pride = Diary

Riddle's first pride was his heritage; discovering the chamber of secrets and the significance of being able to talk to snakes. He targeted muggleborns at the point in his life he could first get behind blood superiority - when he knew that he was not a mudblood himself.

Envy = Ring

Tom Riddle obtained this ring after learning of his true heritage - of how he is actually a half-blood, and how his mother died. After learning this, Riddle killed his muggle relatives and framed his sole remaining wizard relative. This was the first point where Riddle's pride was shattered, where he discovered he was not what he wanted or had believed himself to be.

I'm a fan of the stories where Riddle realizes the negative impact creating horcrux has had on his mental capabilities.

***** It depends. Most people seem to think he cut his soul in half each time, leaving himself with 1/128th of a soul. But he might have sliced off a small fragment each time, which would leave him almost as soulful as he started. I've read at least one fic where Voldemort hadn't realized how much of his soul was being lost each time, reabsorbed his diary horcrux, and became a useful member of society.

** Tell me, what do you intend this story to be? Because a competent and realistic Voldemort would be a very nightmarish world for our protagonists.

I think with a Voldemort that didn't do convenient stupid things for the plot, you'd require a pentagram, a menorah, the undead spirit of Siddhartha, Jesus in a mankini and probably Vishnu as well just to conjure enough energies for a Deus ex Machina big enough to save the day. And it might not be enough.

To even just get the setup you have at the start of the HP books requires a idiotic Voldemort. While I understand that people here hold irrational hatred for Yudkowzky, he says it well in HPMOR; if Voldemort was competent there wouldn't have been a war in the first place. Nothing speaks of first-strike potential as much as magic.

I have a fiction similar to that in my head .

It has is own issues , i find hard to connect the Canon Unspeakable's behaviour to the idea i have sinve the DoM is a vital part of the plot. I may solve things by retconning the existence of timeturners (less headaches long run) but i like the idea of being canon-compatible.

** This is on of the central ideas of my current fanfic project. In it, Voldemort didn't come back to the UK to stir up shit. Instead, a fledgling Dark witch finds him in the forest and brings him back, 'fixing' parts of his psyche in the process... leading him to become a lot scarier because he's a lot more competent, and long story short they break Britain in 2002 and set up a new government.

I made this Voldemort rational and capable, and he has a 'calming' factor in his Dark lady ally. Together they revamped his pureblood ideology nonsense, they killed Albus Dumbledore and basically reshaped the wizarding world in their image.

You might be thinking "how do the protags cope against a smart Voldemort in power?" Well, they're all in their 30s by this point and there's a resistance growing in Britain. But the problem is that it is much, much darker and more difficult to fight against Voldemort because he doesn't make completely irrational moves out of anger, he plans and waits and uses the entire apparatus of state to get his shit done. But my fanfic is a major AU so it's kind of eh, Voldemort can be whatever he needs to be (within reason) for the purpose of the AU. I also didn't want to write a stupid Voldemort because it's been done, and is somewhat necessary because it's usually children who end up defeating him.

In my fanfic it's going to take the Resistance of Wizarding Britain, Harry and his friends, and the Unspeakables to bring him down. Mostly because /they're/ the terrorists who are still fighting a 'finished' war. These people are all adults with training and better expertise, and a fairly decent support network. Still going to be tough though!

She doesn't explicitly make him more powerful or more capable, she literally just brings him back from half-death in a way that fixes some of the damaged parts of his mind. She isn't that damaged (she's relatively normal apart from the desire to dominate and control everything, and her dubious sense of morality) and she also didn't need to come back from the dead anyway. She was all set to take over Albania and set herself up as a Queen, and then she met Voldemort and he was like "hey dollface, bring me back from the dead using this obscure and Dark ritual" and she was like "no that one sucks, let me use this one instead" and that was the end of that.

****** No, she's Albanian and it's ... it's not quite like that. She is his Mother-Wife and he is her Husband-Son. The Dark magic she used to bring him back was a corruption of ancient women's magic, and to do it she essentially birthed him a new body. She knew full well who Voldemort was and what he stood for - he's probably the greatest Dark wizard in centuries.

You're making a mistake thinking that she isn't just as much of an agent in this as Voldemort is. She's intelligent, ruthless and cunning - she's always had ambitions to take basically all of Central Europe. Working with Voldemort, and attached to him as strongly as she is, ensures that she can attain a much greater level of power than she could alone, over a larger magical population.

******* I'm probing to ensure that you are treating her as an agent because it didn't sound like it with your first couple posts, and it's far too common to find female characters not treated like agents.

If she were close to taking Albania and still wanted to work with Voldemort, it would make more sense for them to join forces, take Albania, and use that as a power base for taking Britain. Leaving Albania long enough to take Britain means probably trashing most of her plans, after all, with little certainty of recovering them. And then even if the attempts to take Britain failed, she would still have Albania.

So unless you're giving this Dark Lady of Albania the idiot ball, she must not have made much progress toward taking Albania, and Britain must be a much larger prize.

******** I mostly didn't just explicitly say all of the things in my original post because I figured they weren't really necessary to understand the point I was making. Don't worry, I've thought this through. She wasn't actually very far along in her plans (Voldemort's defeat in the 80s spurred her on to actually doing something in the first place) and Britain is a much larger, richer prize than Albania.

It's part of the canon of my story that Britain is a particularly magical place with a larger-than-average magical population. Voldemort wants it, thinks he can take it, and then wants to take the rest of Europe. She is totes down with that plan, and even has her own plan in motion because hey, she's a Dark Lady. Rather than take central Europe, wait for Voldemort to take France+Britain and then have a horrible war between them... why not manipulate the chain of events so that Voldemort is inextricably bound to her and they become allies instead? She gets more power this way. It was a happy accident that Voldemort was in the forest when she found him.

Incidentally they did play around in Albania before they left, but it was largely to raise the army with which to attack Britain.

EDIT: Female characters with no real agency or motivation are also one of my hates too so I get where you're coming from with this.

** I've written a competent Voldemort in linkffn(Patron), though my Dumbledore is also living up to his reputation. Both tend to go for plans that do not require multiple coincidences and mistakes of their enemies, and try to make plans that advance their goals even if they fail. It's an AU though, where much of the canon events happened differently, or not at all. Quirrell for example was not possessed for half a year; Voldemort used a troll as bait and got him right before the yule holiday ended, intending to get the stone as soon as the school restarted, since Dumbledore would have noticed him if he stayed in Hogwarts for longer. Lockhart is actually a competent author, a decent wizard, and doesn't steal memories since Dumbledore wouldn't hire a fraud and sabotage his students' education. Voldemort works through middlemen and straw men.
