Like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging][The Merging]].

Any story where the characters have good chemistry and share dialogue that doesn't come off as artificial.

It doesn't even need a clear pairing (e.g. The Merging). As long as there's good character development, I'm sold.

Non-slash. Age disparity in the pairing shouldn't be creepy (basically half plus seven). Preferably with Harry, but unconventional pairings are fine.


** Awww, nothing?

On the downside, I'm finishing Vox Corporis and the dialogue/story is dragging on a bit into clich√© territory.

On the upside, I've found the most amazing romance fanfic I've come across to date: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-With-Me][Grow Young With Me]]. If anyone has /anything/ like this, I will be forever grateful.
