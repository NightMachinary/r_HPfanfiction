#+begin_quote
  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD.

** Aren't they - sure the other three aren't as thick with Harry as Ron is (and it's no wounder, Ron was his first friend and he was there for all the adventures, despite abandoning Harry (temporarily!) twice! The other guys just weren't as involved, not even Neville!) - but I bet they are casual friends (and do hang out together from time to time!)

** The Other Boy Who Lived by Kwan Li opens with that sort of dynamic. Great story too, if a somewhat sad ending.

** Yes please I would love to see Harry be friends with SEAMUS or DEAN instead of Ron also! :)
