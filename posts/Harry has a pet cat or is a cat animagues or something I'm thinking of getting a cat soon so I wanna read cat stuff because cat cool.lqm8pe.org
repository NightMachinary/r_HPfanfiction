  Harry successfully manages his animagus transformation. And that's about all he's able to manage. Daphne's insistent attention seems entirely unmanageable for him and his poor heart. Slight AU.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

***** They're siblings. Adoptive, but it counts, and that's how they act.

Note that it seems at first like a fix-fic, with the heroes being better than canon at everything. Stick around, though, and you'll find that the villains have been level-grinding, too. As of the recent chapters, Voldemort has successfully taken over Britain and restructured Hogwarts to entrench blood status differences, with a good chance of obtaining international recognition as the official ruler since he's now the one enforcing the Statute of Secrecy there, and the forces of light have fled to Europe.
