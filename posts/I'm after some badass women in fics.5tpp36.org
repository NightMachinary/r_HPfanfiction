There's potential, but not many truly become it. I'm talking about a fic where Harry and Voldemort are doing their things, but that's in the background, secondary to the plot. Two of the most badass women - Minerva and Molly - don't get much screen time, because it's a young adults book and they are parents/professors. Ginny goes from broken, to a normal schoolgirl for the next four/five years. I want a Ginny that's broken, and uses her edges to cut. Hermione was a ruthless, brilliant child, hexing Neville because he was in her way, stealing, organizing dangerous potions sabotage, abusing time turner use, sending Umbridge off to the centaurs - I get the feeling her moral compass was slightly skewed. I've read stories where authors expound on this, so give me more.


** I haven't read it in a while, but I think Applied Cultural Anthropology is one of the commonly recced fics for this sort of thing. linkffn(9238861) It's humour, but The Darkest Art probably fits here too. linkffn(10742358)

Otherwise, there's A Matter of House, linkffn(9498559). It's focused on Bellatrix (and to an extent, Molly) if the two were sorted into Hufflepuff.

I can think of a few others at the moment, but they're mostly strongly AU or genderbent.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** "Divided and Entwined", linkffn(11910994): Hermione was a brutally effective guerrilla leader who had killed hundreds of Death Eaters and their sympathizers. Although her main goal was still helping Harry to defeat Voldemort, Harry on the other hand was supporting her goal of revolutionizing magical Britain.

"A Little Child Shall Lead Them", linkffn(10871795): Hermione sent her memories and powers back to her two years old self. Hilarity ensued, but also heart-breaking moments. This Hermione was brave beyond all measures.

Similarly, linkffn(Seeking Ginny by Casca) has as POV character a Ginny who's pretty effective in a civilian role, specifically philology. Unfortunately, it turns out in the end that her crush on Harry is her sole motivation for pretty much everything.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.
