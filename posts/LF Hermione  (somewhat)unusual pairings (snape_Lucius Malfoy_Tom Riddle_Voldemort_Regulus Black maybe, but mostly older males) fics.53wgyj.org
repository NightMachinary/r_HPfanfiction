** There's a great one called The Truth About Death by avalon_sunset on both AO3 and ffn! It's in progress but there's already like 30 chapters. It's my favorite Hermione story right now, it's got Tom Riddle, and all the chapters are named after a wizard featured on Frog Cards for a reason you'll find out :) it's a brilliant original plot and considering what you said you liked, you'll enjoy the surprise character!

*** I'm reading it right now and I love it ! It's amazing, certainly one of my favorite fics. I love the character of Death (or who he really is), and it's so well written ! I can't wait for the next update.

** linkffn(Ultima Ratio)

Rather long, but by far my favorite TR/HG story. It should be up your alley if you liked Shared Flame.

*** I read it already, but absolutely loved it ! I think it's one of my favorite time turner fics with HG/TR pairing. It's more credible, and no "oh, TR is finally good thanks to the power of love - and a teenage pregnancy. Eveything seems logical and well constructed. I read it regularly :)

** Hermione/Antonin Dolohov. Just finished this one, and I loved it. linkffn(11476491).

The same author wrote a parallel story where Hermione is saved by Lucius in Chapter 1, instead of being captured by Dolohov. Linkffn(11304578).

If you want a fun, light-hearted story, one of my favorites is Falsity. This is a Lucius/Hermione that is ridiculous, cute, and hilarious. Linkffn(2273802).

If I think of more, I will add them!

  After a year of litigation, Lucius Malfoy has a choice - a year in Azkaban to pay for his sins, or prove he's a changed man by passing third-year Muggle Studies, the new and improved version taught by none other than the esteemed Miss Granger. Even worse, his only son may be attracted to a Weasley. Oh, the horror.
