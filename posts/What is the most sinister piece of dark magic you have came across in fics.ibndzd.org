I would like to read something that would really make skin crawl.


** Honestly I've seen some nasty disgusting spell ideas but the ones that truly disgust me are the canon ones Imperio and Obliviate. The idea you could wipe someone's memories and remake who they are into whatever you want.. along with just taking control of another human being making them do everything you said...

That's the worst thing I could ever imagine.

Like in the old republic Star Wars games when they mind wiped Revan and made him/her into a puppet soldier to fight against his former people it honestly disgusted me even though he and his empire were evil. No one should have the ability or right to do that to another being.

*** I remember a very old and disturbing dystopian fic where Wizards would go around and rape/torture Muggles, but then use magic to erase their victims' memories and physical injuries

Anyways because Obliviation and magic removed all the trauma and injuries, the Muggles would go on not knowing that a couple hours ago they were tortured and violated

The Muggle world was like Westworld. Even worse was that this wasn't illegal as long as the Muggles were the same after the “games”.

*** I'll admit that I always found the Imperius Curse fascinating because it's one of the lesser explored ones and it's the only one that can be held for extended times, while also having long lasting consequences. We get a glimpse of the initial effect that it creates a pleasant state that makes it difficult to resist the orders of the caster (quite like in real life when you first fall in love and regardless of how shitty you feel, you always calm down and get a pleasant feeling when you interact with the person you're in love... on that note, I know it's been debated a lot on this sub, but Love Potions should also be considered Dark Arts). But Harry snaps out of it quickly so we don't get to see how a person being subjected long term thinks during their enslavement period. Also, as we learn from Crouch's experience, it can seriously damage your mind when you start resisting it.

With Cruciatus and Avada Kedavra is quite clear. Cruciatus is pure pain on every inch of your body and, while it can have long-term consequences, it's relatively short lived. Also Avada Kedavra is instantaneous, painless and it has a straightforward effect. So not quite as interesting.

For me, Horcruxes still seem the darkest form of magic because it's such a selfish act that you're sacrificing someone's life for your end goals. It's a complete disregard for other people and eventually for yourself. While, with Unforgivable Curses, the books give a few examples where they are used for relatively okay end purposes (Snape killing Dumbledore, Harry imperiating Travers and stopping Carrow from further abusing McGonagall with the Cruciatus), there is absolutely no circumstance in which the creation of a Horcrux could be justified other than for selfish reasons.

***** Absolutely. Imperio /is/ horrible and can absolutely be used for all sorts of horrific things. Hell, Crouch used it to keep Crouch Jr imprisoned for /twelve years/. Twelve years as a mind controlled prisoner by his own father.

Problem is, with all the fantasy and superhero settings and whatnot that use it willy-nilly, I'm desensitized. It's like oh, mind control, standard stuff.

Without things like building up the atmosphere, vivid but not ham-fisted descriptions, and explored consequences, it just doesn't have the emotional/psychological impact that it deserves and could have.

I mean.. Ginny's first year of Hogwarts is straight out of a horror film. Evil diary that manipulates you, possesses you and forces you to do its bidding, before stealing your life for itself. What an absolute nightmare, and she was only 11. But how often do you find fics that even /try/ to do the horror of the scenario justice? It seems pretty rare to me.

** Fidelius, Prophecies, the Oath of Enmity, the Ultimate Sanction, and similar from Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. They are essentially a global, government-sanctioned means of insanely powerful and virulent mind control magic that, because it existed for centuries and served pretty much as a foundation for the magical society (at least in Britain), no pureblood sees any fault in. So you'll have people straight-out /know/ they are mind controlled by magic to, say, hate someone Wizengamot declared a national traitor or outcast, but /literally don't see anything wrong or scary/ with it because it's part of the wizarding culture and tradition. Also Prophecies sometimes literally forcing an Idiot Ball onto people to get them to serve fate, because if they knew better, they would avoid the prediction. And Fidelius being so air-tight and solid that people can write out a clear sequence of cause and effect, but not follow it to logical conclusion if it's a Secret, even if it's something amazingly obvious. Things like that---mind control being crazy unethical and existentially scary is one of the main themes of HPatPoS.

** Eh, there's several creepy stuff, but one of the worst for me was Diary!Riddle possessing as upper-year Slytherin, finding out about demon summoning rituals and sacrificing a girl for it when Harry proved he could fight him(this was teenage Voldemort vs Teen Prodigy Harry). He was extremely ignorant that this was just NOT done. At ALL.

He summoned a big-shot demon who laughed at his attempts at controlling him then proceeded to torture him and was about to defeat Harry until Dumbledore showed up and used some OP magic to banish it.

This inadvertently opened a tear in the ancient protections that prevented demons coming to earth(there was a reason even the darkest wizards in the known didn't do that) and forced Harry and Dumbledore to follow the demon into its realm and kill it, and then start a journey to try and repair the damage or prepare the world for demon invasion.

It was such a simple act for Voldemort, that by itself was very gruesome, but brought terrible consequences upon the world.

Other stuff is fics where Dark Harry makes canon!Bellatrix look sane, and loves torture.
