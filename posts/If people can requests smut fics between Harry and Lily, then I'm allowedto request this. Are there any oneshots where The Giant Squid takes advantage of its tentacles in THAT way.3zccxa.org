******* Thanks!

That looks about how I thought it would, though the first half of the year is oddly low. It's too bad that it doesn't break that down into people without accounts, how accounts participated (vote only, comment only, submit only), and live subs. Those are the stats I'm really interested in. I say we should have The Blackout 2: Electric Boogaloo until we get it.

******** February is obviously a shorter month and January is only counted for this year, not last year. That being said, it seems to spike a bit in July and August, which is when most students (high school and college) would have a break. December is usually about half break, half school, giving a bit of a boost. (That's pulled out of my ass, but it makes some sense, I think)

********* ... Yeah I know Feb. is shorter and of course Jan. is for this year. I may be pretty, but I'm smart too.

It's shorter by a whopping 10%, which for page views is still almost 10% lower than what would account for the discrepancy between it and the next lowest month, another 5% lower than the average of the next four months, and /another/ 15% lower than the average of the other 10 whole months. It's just curious that's all.

Obviously the break bump is the main contributing factor as far as uniques go, but even that doesn't really account for the massive increase. I dunno, I blame the mods. I wonder if the bot is adding to those numbers... the pageview/unique went from ~7.2 from March to June up to ~9.2 from July to December.
