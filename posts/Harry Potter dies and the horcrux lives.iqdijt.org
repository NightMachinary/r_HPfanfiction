** Linkao3(20631227) is a fic where Harry decides to die and force the horcrux to have empathy. Tom then has to come to terms with being a person, having empathy, and not letting on that Harry committed suicide to the people who might care about those details.

  Horcrux Tom Riddle wakes up in a clearing in the Forbidden Forest in Harry Potter's body. Vanquishing Lord Voldemort is the easy part; being attached to Harry Potter's soul for sixteen years may or may not give one a bit of a hero complex. Pretending to be Harry Potter, however, is much, much harder. Especially when all of his friends are actually kind of nice. This is a story involving the start of Tom Riddle's (very, very long) road to redemption.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
