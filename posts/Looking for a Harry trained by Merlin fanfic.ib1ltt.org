:END:
As the title says I'm looking for a fanfic where Harry was raised by Merlin. I can't remember a lot but I remember

• Merlin trained Harry in this weird bright white place •Harry randomly picks up girls and puts them on his lap. I think one of the girls he did this to was Katie bell •Harry Potter was really popular •It might have been a wbwl fic but I'm not sure I'm sorry this is so vague. I know this fic probably can't be found but I decided to try anyway.


** I remember this one. Merlin steps in right after dumbles leaves harry at privet drive. The first chapter is reall cloack and dagger. Think it was harry emrys

Edit: i can't find it either; at least you know the story you seek exists?

  When Voldemort attacked he didn't kill Lily and James. When he met his downfall they mistook Harry's twin as the GWL, they send their son away to the Dursleys but he doesn't quite make it in to the Dursley's loving care. Harry will take Hogwarts and his 'family' by storm and by the time the 'light' realize their mistake it will be too late for them to fix. OOC!Dark!Powerful!Harry.
