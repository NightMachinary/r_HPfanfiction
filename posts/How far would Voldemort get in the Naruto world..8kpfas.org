** Naruto in general is just a higher power level world compared to Harry Potter. The average ninja a couple years out of the academy would be more than capable of killing a Voldemort with no horcruxes if a fight started for some reason. You give him access to plentiful potions ingredients and creatures, but we know nothign of Voldemort's herbology or magical creatures skills, he might very well not be capable of taking care of either. And being able to create a chakra network through a ritual does him no good, because he has no way to learn to control or use chakra, and would be dismissive of a force that could only increase his physical abilities.

But let's consider the situation. Voldemort has just arrived in this world with the materials you describe. Would he want to stay in this new world full of people with powers he never knew existed who make him look weak by comparison? Would he try to find a way back? If not, would he be willing to risk his life trying to conquer this world full of more powerful people, or just try to find his own place in it?

Really, most likely scenario is that he ends up captured and dissected by some unscrupulous researcher who wants to know how his magic works, probably Orochimaru, but there are plenty of others who would jump at the chance.

Eh, you lose me here. The fact that Voldemort was consciously controlling his magic as a kid who didn't know it was magic seems to make it clear he has an extraordinary ability to develop whatever powers he finds himself with. Voldemort with chakra is terrifying if given even a few years to work on it. Not to mention, if he still has magic, then he has Legilimency and Transfiguration. He could simply alter his appearance, sneak into a ninja village, and either steal rudimentary materials that describe what chakra is and how you control it, or capture a peon and rip the required knowledge out of his mind.

*** I disagree. Magic's incredible versatility gives him a strong weapon against chakra's rigidity. Plus, fighters like Gaara show that you don't have to mobile to be successful.

I think Voldemort would prefer the elemental nations. It's far more martial and an entirely ableist society, both of which play to his strengths.

When comparing ninjas to wizards I always viewed it like this; the average ninja far outclasses the average wizard, but the greatest (Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald) can keep up with the greatest ninjas.

This is just patently untrue. The most powerful things Dumbledore and Voldemort get up to barely compare to moderately high level jutsu, and are completely outclassed by the wrath of god level shit top tier ninjas like the kages and sannin. To say nothing of how far and how clearly he's outclassed by jinchuuriki and Rinnegan users. Sharingan users might not necessarily get an edge in power over him, but their foresight would be a significant advantage against his casting.

You do have a sound point about the level of versatility Voldemort has, though I'd argue that he would need to be a mobile combatant. Gaara can get away with being slow because he has a nearly-unbeatable defense, whereas I can't see Voldemort's shields being able to hold up nearly as well.

***** True, but then Voldemort can turn them into a table, or Obliviate, or mind rape them in general(in terms of mental powers HP universe is better), or Imperiose them. Don't forget the AK curse is a one-hit kill attack. Fiendyfire is comparable to Amaterasu in some ways, especially when it's sentient. He can also fly, and teleport which is considered a pretty OP ability in the Naruto universe. He also has something similar to TK with his wandless ability mixed with the levitation charm, banishing charm, locomotis, and summoning. He can raise an undead army(inferi) whose only weakness seems to be fire if I remember correctly.

Overall with him being physically strengthened with chakra i'd put him at S-class. Also him being strengthened with chakra isn't an argument, I made it a requirement to even out the scales a bit.

  True, but then Voldemort can turn them into a table,
#+end_quote

Not an ability Voldemort has ever been stated to possess. Human transfiguration is considered an incredibly difficult art that few people master, and Voldemort would likely never bother to learn it when he can just curse people. If it was that easy to use effectively, Dumbledore would have turned Tom into a comfy chair decades before canon.

#+begin_quote
  or Obliviate,
#+end_quote

Also not a spell ever established to be in Voldemort's repertoire, although it is very possible. We know he's capable of using Legilimancy to break memory charms, but there's no word one way or the other on his ability to cast them.

#+begin_quote
  or mind rape them in general(in terms of mental powers HP universe is better)
#+end_quote

You've got to be joking with this one. Voldemort's only "mind rape" ability is legilimency, which allows him to read minds and implant false visions very effectively with people he either has eye contact or strange indescribable soul connections with, and a poorly established possession ability that he's never shown to be able to do a great deal with. You're comparing this to the Naruto universe, where the Mangekyo Sharingan, the Yamanaka clan, and the art of genjutsu all exist. The ninjas have the advantage both in sheer breadth of mind-effecting abilities they have access to and relative power.

#+begin_quote
  Don't forget the AK curse is a one-hit kill attack.
#+end_quote

That requires him to say a long activation phrase and hit the target with a projectile. It's powerful and useful in battle, yes, but hardly unbeatable.

#+begin_quote
  Fiendyfire is comparable to Amaterasu in some ways, especially when it's sentient.
#+end_quote

Another spell that Voldemort was never established as being able to use, although I would actually expect he could. There's just very little reason why he would in most situations. I actually agree that, based off the little we get to see of it in canon, Fiendfyre is probably roughly on par with Amaterasu, although the latter is much more controllable and can be used defensively (then again, the Mangekyo comes with it's own laundry list of problems and isn't exactly common).

#+begin_quote
  He also has something similar to TK with his wandless ability mixed with the levitation charm, banishing charm, locomotis, and summoning.
#+end_quote

This I'll give you, ninjas don't have the sheer breadth of ability to move objects that wizards do, and Voldemort can proably do so very effectively in battle, although I think you're overstating his wandless capabilities.

#+begin_quote
  He can raise an undead army(inferi) whose only weakness seems to be fire if I remember correctly.
#+end_quote

Maybe. The implication is that creating inferi is difficult or time consuming (being that nobody other than Voldemort seems to bother with them) but there's certainly nothing that says for certain that he can't make some. As they're zombies, of course they're mostly vulnerable to fire or being cut apart (although Harry's other spells seemed to work perfectly well on them, it was the numbers disadvantage that required Dumbledore and his fancy fire whip). Of course, fire is something ninjas (particularly in fire country) don't exactly lack, in addition to other abilities perfectly capable of cutting through bodies.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes, you did, but you failed to adequately explain why he would do that. He is Lord Voldemort, his magic is great and terrible. Why should he seek to make himself more like these filthy muggles he's found himself surrounded by?

All of this, of course, is based on the theory that Voldemort would seek to conquer this new world. It's entirely possible (if unlikely) that he might try to fit in, or live as a hermit, desperately trying to find his way back to the world where he understands.

******* If you read the wikia of Voldemort you'll see that he has shown instances of animal to human transfiguration, and the ability to modify memories, and he even tortured others to madness through just pure mental manipulation(according to Snape).

Also I believe the Imperious curse has no light show accompanying it, it's instant. With Apparation at his command along with flight, and chakra strengthening him, along with inferi, and such he could go quite far in the Naruto world.

The point of this is to see how far he'd get, not become a hermit. Also it's actually said(at least in the wikia) that he's proficient in magical telekinesis, removing the masks of his death eaters in GOF, disarming Harry with a wave of his hand, lazily flinging a dead troll aside with a wave of his hand. Just read the magical abilities & skills in the wikia before you reply back, i'm not the best when trying to convey my reasonings.

******** But the Imperius curse can be thrown off with sufficient force of will, can't it? Come up against a strong enough ninja, and it wouldn't do anything to them, they do train against mind control techniques and torture so that they don't spill village secrets.

Plenty of ninja had access to flight abilities, it's not totally unheard of in the Ninja world, it wouldn't be as big an advantage as you think it is, especially with the massive area of effect Jutsu they have access to.

The body flicker technique is something every half ass ninja has access to, and tons of them are able to move even faster than that just with physical strength, so what advantage would apparition have?

********* While I agree that end series Naruto, Sasuke, Madara, and Kagyua could kill him 97/100 times, he won't be killed by a no-name ninja. It's like asking why don't they do that with every ninja. Right at the beginning he might lose to a no-one, but after a few years with training with chakra, and also brushing up on his magic more it'd take someone of at least Neji at shippuden, and beyond to stand a chance at him.

Remember in this scenario he's not insane, and he gave himself a chakra network, and just the sheer variety of magic will help majorly. Heck Tobi became a serious threat, and his main trick was teleportation, and phasing. He's not a one-trick pony, but those two abilities solidified him as a major threat to a lot of people. So when someone comes along, and can do what Ibiki can to the mind as well as transfigure people at a whim, and summon sentient fire, as well as having trained with chakra to at the least reinforce his body, as well as flight, as well as limited telekinesis, as well as summon an undead army, and a host of other abilities he'd be classified as at least an A-class threat, if not S-class. If Hidan can become an S-class, then this version of Voldemort can.

You're seriously underestimating Voldemort, and overestimating the ninja of Naruto. I mean yes Naruto can sense limbo clones, but that's with senjutsu which less than 10 people in the last 50ish years could do. Also flight is a big deal, before the final fight only Onoki, and Madara, only two-three other people could do it(not including Gaara, and Deidra since they require a tool, or substance to achieve their version of flight) so it would provide at least a battleground advantage.

Lastly considering Voldemort can basically do a better version of Jiryia's camouflage technique(which very few ninjas can detect, all of them being high level ninja) with spells, that would also be a huge advantage.

Now i'm done, you can continue being as biased as you are, and I may still reply, but i'm for the most part done. You can't convince someone who doesn't want to be convinced.

********** OK. This is an argument based on pre-canon. Five years before in fact. 12-5=7- That's a year before the Uchiha Massacre. Which means that maybe it doesn't happen which means more Sharingans running around. Which in turn means more people that can detect Chakra running around. Let's not forget the Byakugan and Sensors that can also detect Chakra. All of this makes the point of HP-based-invisibility pointless.

Flight can be either impressive, or pointless.

Now who is it that he can run into at this point: the 9 Jinchuriki(2 of them are kids, but that doesn't mean they can't rage and turn into the tailed beast anyway) + the 5 Kage's, Orochumaru, Jiraya, the 11 members of Akatsuki, 5 or so members of each village that I don't know the names off of the top of my head. All of whom could beat him without too much issue. And the Akatsuki works in pairs. And running into the Kage without at least 2 bodyguards which are two of the members from their village that would be able to fight Voldemort and be able to beat him. Then the Jinchuriki is a bigger issue, but they are usually part of a strong team. I mean for Kumo that's the Kage, a Jinchuriki and two other bodyguards. Good luck with that one.

They don't know the limits of what one can do with chakra or how things work. And ifiltrating the system would be hard as he doesn't know the system. And the system in one country is different than the one in an other. Konoha = Team 7 legacy route. Suna = Kazekage descendancy route. Kumo = Raikage descendany route I suppose. And Kiri = seemingly whoever.

Then there's the power structure used within the village in general. There's nothing that tells us this will be easy for a foreigner to comprehend as there's enough debates within the fandom regarding how it is.

You seem rather hung up on the idea that Voldemort managed controlled magic at a young age as a proof that he mastered it. Which is not the case. That's like saying that you can control your anger so that it blows when your not at work to mean that you've successfully mastered anger-management. It isn't.

And you seem rather hung up on that anything that doesn't agree with your view to be biased. You don't post something without wanting criticism or ideas. You wanted people to agree with you and call it a day.

The work that goes into a normal fanfic is easily ten times as much when it's a crossover, so have fun with that.

********** Hidan was an S-class threat simply because of his Immunity to damage. He wasn't fast, or smart, or had any special techs, you just couldn't kill him. Inferi would be patently worse than Zetsu clones IMO, as they are slow, shambling corpses, so again, IMO it would be a non-issue for even Genin to deal with. Sentient fire is more dangerous in the HP universe because people can't deal with it, but I assume large scale water techniques would deal with it, along with the seal Jiraiya used to seal away Amaterasu. I still don't see Voldemort getting past the speed wall he is going to encounter, no matter how sane he is, or his ritual given chakra network. How is he going to stop himself from getting killed by people he can't even react to? In my opinion, there are too many ninja with too many varied techniques that have to deal with crazy shit all the time to be slowed down by a mind reader that can fly and move stuff around with his mind. Otherwise the Yamanaka would rule the world.

*********** And I dislike when a person is clearly too biased to actually consider said arguments. Voldemort will have five years(until canon) to build up his speed, and with the type of genius that he is, it'll be a non-issue. He'd understand how outclassed he is, and will take steps to rectify it. Also he's not an idiot, he's not going to pull any truly dangerous moves until he knows he can win, or at the least stands a strong chance of winning. You're looking at his powers, but disregarding his intelligence. Large scale water jutsu could work, but it'd have to be either a really powerful shinobi with powerful water jutsu, or a lot of average shinobi with water jutsu, think Madara with his annihilation fire jutsu against the Shinobi Alliance. That's not an over-exaggeration either, Fiendyfire grows incredibly large, incredibly fast. You keep forgetting that this is a guy who has charisma, intelligence, and abilities this world has never seen, and the time to grow powerful enough to pose a threat. No-one knows of him, and as long as he's smart, and stealthy enough about it they won't until he's ready.

P.s. The reason I say you're biased is, because you keep bringing up the speed argument, and I keep explaining how that'll not be an issue, because of a variety of reasons, and then you ignore it.

************ I understand what you are saying, but canon Voldemort wasn't exactly what you would call a genius. Sure he was strong, and had people following him, but a genius he was not. It would take him longer than 5 years to get to the level of any accomplished ninja, especially starting from 0. He would have to develop a ritual to give him a chakra network, something he has no idea on how it works, and then do all the training from scratch, with no outside help. As smart and fearsome as he can be, not having any reference point to start with will kill his plans right off the bat. You say the ninja world has never seen techniques like his, but it also works in reverse, he would be out of his depth the second he landed in a new world. You do know ninja can sense each other across long distances right? Some unknown person in the ass end of nowhere doing traning and experimentation would draw attention in all the wrong ways. Assuming Voldemort would get to A rank in 5 years, then what? He wouldn't be able to rely on any spells that are visible, as they travel slow enough to be dodged by regular people. What then? He would have Fiendfyre, and an average level of speed, and high intellect. His flight would have an ill defined benefit and....? Levitating objects and banishing them at people likely wouldn't do anything, because of the speed factor, so he would have to rely solely on shinobi techniques to take people down. Where would he acquire those? Fresh genin don't exactly have jutsu libraries in their heads, and even then, how would he know to train in chakra natures?

Sure, make him S rank, give him every magic spell, and he would be dangerous, but it would be like dropping him into the DC universe and giving him Superman's powers.

In my opinion, the power scale between the two universes is too large to be surpassed just with smarts and charisma, unless you start stacking the deck in his favor and ignoring everyone else, but then what's the point?

** In general terms? Voldemort is /fucked./

Ninjas probably won't even lose any Gennin to him once they get a handle on his abilities. Spells apparently take long enough to cast and move slow enough for normal humans to react to them from a distance of less than 30 feet. Gennin are enhanced enough through the use of chakra that they're more or less expected to be able to fight arbitrarily large numbers of normal, unenhanced, untrained (but not unexperienced) bandits by the time they're ever allowed to leave town.

Bandits who, for the most part, don't even seem to bother with bows because of how utterly worthless they are against ninjas because of their mobility and reaction speed.

And arrows shot from any bow worth a damn will be able to be fired and travel much faster than your average human can react to if fired within 30 feet.

Voldemorts biggest advantage will be apparation. Odds are the ninjas will not have any real answer for that direction, but they have had to deal with teleporters or people with techniques that allow them to move so fast from point to point that they might as well have teleported.

Some of his more esoteric abilities will be difficult, if not impossible to counter, but he's unlikely to be able to do anything more than terrorize the civilian population in areas where ninjas are not present.

So, best case scenario, He's constantly in wraith form because the moment he gets a new body and tries to do something, he's ganked by one of the human monsters roaming narutoland.

--------------

Now, if he gains access to chakra, I'm not really sure that helps much. Chakra seems to be very personal, compared to magic. While Voldemort does appear to have developed a few spells on his own, most of what we see is just him using spells that were created by others, if not necessarily common knowledge.

Compare that to Naruto ninjas. Sure, there's a few standard jutsus that everyone learns, but even by the Chunnin level, they seem to start branching out into personal styles and customizing their techniques to suit those styles. I have a theory that Kakashi is famous not just because he copies everything, but also because he /only/ has the one original technique -- whereas most jounin are probably using a whole stable of original techniques as the basis of their style. Because what is known is what can be countered.

Almost all of the s-rank villains we see in the show/manga fight using almost exclusively original or unique techniques.

Voldemort is a powerful wizard, but his power, at least in the books, is primarily ruthlessness with a dash of speed and spell selection.

And ninja have that in spades.

He has spells that are instant(as in no light to dodge, just straight up effect), and has a form of telekinesis(with the levitation charm, banishing charm, locomotis charm, and summoning charm). He has spells that can turn the environment against the enemy(ministry of magic fight), and can create his own undead army. Don't forget impressive wandless abilities, and a host of spells designed to f*** with the mind.

*** Almost no ninja are shown to have their own original techniques, I don't know where you got that from. In fact, actually inventing techniques seems quite rare, and even then it's usually (as with most things) derivative. Kakashi created Chidori because he couldn't combine the highest level of shape manipulation (Rasengan) with the mastered nature transformation utilizing the element he has an affinity towards (Lightning). Rasengan was derived from Minato's 3 year observation of Bee using Tailed Beast Bomb. Hiruzen created the Shuriken Shadow Clone based on one of his master's techniques (Shadow Clone from Tobirama), etc.

The only characters who really seem to create techniques are a few S-rank ninja like Hiruzen and Tobirama, most others are, at best, rare techniques.

** Voldemort has a small number of spells and abilities that might make him succeed. If the assumption is that he is not insane and has chakra, he can simply slowly build up what he can of his reserves, learn how to more efficiently use his supply, and train and study over time. If he has to attack, his best choice is to attack genin, or genin to be. As long as he's patient enough, he'll eventually find someone he can ambush, stun, then Imperius and study. Using legilimency, he ought to be able to slowly steal techniques. Otherwise, AK, while slow and ineffective at some of the best shinobi, is able to kill point blank many chunin and below. He can apparate and fly, allowing him to survive dangerous situations, and Fiendfyre will at least allow him to do massive damage if he absolutely must.

Given time, Voldemort would probably figure out some insane way of using chakra and magic and how to steal chakra to add to his own power. He'd be able to steal a large amount of techniques, and his ability to apparate and perhaps cast devastating spells or use large scale techniques after many years of study would undoubtedly eventually put him at the upper end of threats.

However, early on, he'd be incredibly weak, having to rely on ambushes and sneak attacks to win against most foes, even genin.

*** My thing is the Imperius and Legilimency early on. Imperius especially, since basically no one is going to try and Dodge it since in the books it doesn't have colored spellfire like AK does. That immediately gives him an advantage even against super speed since, well, who's going to dodge when they see a weirdo pointing a stick at them? Or when he simply looks them in the eye? Granted, many are wary of looking in the eyes of the Uchiha but Voldemort doesn't have Sharingan so most wouldn't think twice.

**** Ideally, Voldemort would probably find a minor village, wait for the genin with their teacher to go on a mission far away, use a tracking spell (assuming such a spell would be unnoticeable), then wait for them to go far away. Probably use a homenum revelio while under a silence spell to check for other shinobi, then ambush and Imperius the group, starting with the sensei by apparating and point blank casting. Then slowly rip out information and use veritaserum to discover and learn more about chakra.

** Voldemort with chakra would be terrifying, especially if he keeps his magic. Apparition, transfiguration and Legilimency would let him easily acquire the knowledge he needs on how to use chakra (infiltrate ta ninja village and steal scrolls or rip the knowledge from the minds of genin). Give him 5 or 10 years (hello immortality) and that's pretty scary.

Remember, Voldemort was controlling his magic consciously as a kid who didn't even know what it was, so he could probably figure it out quickly, even with little to no direction.

** I feel like the biggest limit to this argument is that we have no idea about the depth and actual power of magic. Are there really spells for everything? Is it possible to increase casting speed (spells seem to be quite fast based off of Fantastic Beasts)? Where does magic come from? Can a wizard run out of magic like ninjas run out of chakra? How instantaneous are spells that we can't see (transfiguration spells for example have no physical form)? What about rituals? We know they are possible, but what can they do? What's their limit? I could keep coming up with these types of questions. I just think its kinda hard to draw conclusions when we understand so little of what makes Voldemort powerful while we understand chakra far more than we know magic.

**** End of series Naruto and Sasuke react to intangible clones without taking any damage from them, and they are invisible and silent. As sane as Voldemort could be, I don't think he would have any way of dealing with the ninja world's heavy hitters.

What counter would Voldemort have for a mid-tier shinobi body flickering to him and cutting his head off without making a sound? What counter could he possibly have for a shinobi of Madara's level? End of Series Naruto and Sasuke level? Reality warping Kaguya level?

I like Voldemort as much as the next guy, but Voldemort, even with access to Chakra, would be murder stomped by the majority of the Ninja world, not even a named important character, but one of the fodder ninja at that.

Trackers are still a thing, and no that doesn't just mean the Inuzuka. Every village are likely to have them. I mean Kiri has a section of their ANBU specialized in tracking down people and kill them. They need to be able to sense people.

** Hmm...I don't know very much about Naruto, despite reading a few fanfics of it...

What's the strongest destruction technique that appears in Naruto? A cut-something-in-half attack, a massive explosion attack, an incinerating attack, a total annihilation attack, a balefire-esque time-space shredding attack...?

Because, I was thinking, if Voldemort did end up making horcruxes in the Naruto world (and he could use regular innocent people, not prey on ninjas), what would be able to destroy them? It takes basilisk venom or fiendfyre (or possibly the killing curse) to destroy them in canon, to deal incurable damage that puts one beyond normal magic's ability to repair.

So, are there any canon ninja techniques that can break through almost any defence and totally destroy an object or at least make it irreparable?

*** Some of the strongest destructive techniques in Naruto consist of reducing mountains to pebbles, dropping meteors out of orbit, cutting the moon in half, destroying dimensions, and other such things. The Truth Seeking Orbs alone would be something Voldemort would have no answer for.

A canon ninja tech that comes to mind that would destroy a Horcrux is the soul ripping technique available to Rinnegan users. Possibly summoning the King of Hell and tossing the horcrux into it as well. Maybe the sealing technique Itachi uses with his Susanoo? The Shiki Fuuin could probably do it too. Amaterasu probably burns hot enough to damage it too.

**** Alrighty. Still, I assume that those sort of techniques are only held by a small handful of ninjas? So Voldemort's situation wouldn't be so different from Harry Potter canon, except that instead of needing to keep Dumbledore and Harry away from his horcruxes, he needs to keep ~quickly looks up stuff~ Sasuke and Itachi away instead?

What about divination? Is there any way for ninjas to see into the future or the past or use clairvoyance or speak to the planet or otherwise learn 'Oh come on, how is this weird noseless guy still alive'?

***** I think the only one that had clairvoyance was some chick in a movie? Can't remember her name, I think it started with an S?

Anywho, the entire last arc was about dealing with reincarnated unkillable zombie people, and they managed to either destroy or seal away the souls of all those involved. Orochimaru also had a horcrux like device with his Cursed seal, where he had splinters of himself in them and could revive himself with them. So basically speaking, some form of horcrux is already around in the ninja world.

Sealing techniques could probably handle horcruxes in some fashion, but its hard to say without it happening, so it's mostly speculation.

Those types of techniques are reserved for the God Tier Shinobi yea, but even then, the rest of the shinobi forces weren't slouches either. From what I imagine, unless Voldemort trains himself to the level of speed of even an average ninja, he won't have the reaction time to keep himself from getting killed repeatedly.

Take what I say with a grain of salt though, apparently I can't post any counterpoints without being called biased towards Voldemort. I just don't think giving him a chakra network and his sanity back would help him any against superhuman enemies, because even fodder no names are faster than anything he has ever dealt with.

But yeah, speed does seem to be something Voldemort (and the Harry Potter world in general) has trouble with; he and an entire graveyard full of Death Eaters couldn't catch Harry when he broke Priori Incantatem and went for the Triwizard Cup. So in a stand-up fight, he probably would be toast against any ninja, and Apparating away from battle could probably be matched by Body Flicker.

So, what does that leave? Stealth, staying hidden from ninjakind, laying curses and traps down (he managed to put a pretty big curse on the DADA post, after all), perhaps possessing a younger ninja who doesn't have anti-spirit techniques (Quirrel-style) in order to access their abilities?
