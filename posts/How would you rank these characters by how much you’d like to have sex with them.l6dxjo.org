*** Well, at least they've proven that the bot is not doing a great job of recognizing and tagging NSFW posts.

**** It just freaks out if you say smut and that's pretty much it

Like, a guy wrote a borderline pedophille fantasy about six year old Harry (with stuff about his glory trail) in this thread ([[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/l5t7t3/why_isnt_there_a_what_are_you_writing/gkwk1mm/]]) and not a peep

** Ok, I had to log into my alt because there's no way I'd answer this with my main, but I'll give it a go. Disclaimer, I'm not even going to try to keep this SFW, so if you're a minor don't read.

One question: Do I have to let them participate, or is this a (consensually) tie-them-down-and-have-my-way-with-them thing? Because some (most) of these characters would be terrible lovers if they were in charge of things.

Assuming it's the second option, or at least I am the boss and get to determine what happens during the entire encounter, here's my ranking, best to worst:

Hagrid (intercrural or he'd bottom, wouldn't need to be tied up)

Snape (I pick how I pictured him in the books, not Alan-Rickman-Snape)

Dumbledore (you didn't specify, so I'm picking Aberforth)

Voldemort (definitely Ralph-Fiennes-Voldemort, definitely tied up)

Umbridge (as long as she doesn't talk/is gagged)

Mad-Eye Moody

Grawp (does it count if I just give him a handjob and nothing else?)

Wormtail (he'd definitely bottom)

Uncle Vernon (same as Wormtail)

Aunt Marge (pre-blown-up)
