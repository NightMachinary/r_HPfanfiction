  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.

***** Maybe this is fanon, but did the characters in Harry Potter EVER invoke a Christian God? Why would pureblood wizards invoke a Christian deity? It's an injection of Religion where it shouldn't be. And you know it's Christian because they don't name the god.

I sometimes get tired of authors using every iteration of "Merlin's Blankety Blank!" as an exclamation, but if they every use "God damnit" I have a really hard time sticking with the story.
