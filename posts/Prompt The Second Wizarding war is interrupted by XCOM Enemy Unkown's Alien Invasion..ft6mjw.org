Basically, the Second Wizarding war takes place in the 2010s, not the 1990s. XCOM's invasion takes place, meaning the war is cancelled, since Alien terror attacks sweep the planet.


** Wizards would have to work with muggles if they are to stand any chance of surviving. Even the weakest Psionic unit could take control of your average magical. Depending on who is alive they would be able to erect a really strong barrier on their headquarters, put it under Fidelus, heal even grievous wounds very quickly, help with repair and maintenance, improve response times and stealthily infiltrate alien bases. 1v1 an average auror would go down to at most a sectoid pod.

*** You're really underpowering wizards, mate. Xcom's peeps only have guns and grenades, and they kill dozens of aliens on a single mission. A wizard with a wand basically has an infinite gun, rifle, rocket launcher, energy shield, cloaking device and teleporter. Wizards would be super-units that can dice out massive amounts of damage and support from the rear with shield charms and the like, not weak idiots who die to the first alien they see.

Aurors are trained to hunt dark wizards, most of them trained to resist the methods of those dark wizards (like mind control), so they'd not be completely helpless.

**** Maybe not all aurors would be helpless but from what we have seen of most of them; they would not stand a chance even against a sectoid pod. Harry at 15 could cast a better shield then most Ministry personnel and it only got stronger as time went by. Many of the Ministry personnel could not even cast a shield. And I am not even sure a shield would be all that effective against Plasma. It was stated that McGonagalll could have taken out all of the aurors in OotP if they did not surprise her.

If aurors play their cards right; apparate disillusion themselves and take down the enemies before they are aware about them then they would be highly effective but I don't think an auror could take on sectoid pod in open combat. They would have to work with the muggles as support units.

And I did say they would improve response times greatly, give the option of stealthily infiltrating alien bases, save grievously injured civilians and soldiers alike by either apparating or portkeying them to healers who would be able to fix them up in a jiffy.

***** A single fully trained wizard is basically a demigod, dude. They would obliterate any non-magical force with no issue, and the only real threat to them would be mind control. Resistance to the Imperius can be trained even into some teenage wizards, and even a muggle with a strong will can resist a Sectoid.

****** Harry was the only who was able to resist the Imperius and well he is an extremely strong willed person considering he was able to resist even Voldemort's Imperius even after taking Cruico from him. That resistance is not common among wizards and witches. Take Pius Thicknesse for example. He was The Head of DMLE and even he succumbed to it.

And strength of will has nothing to do with magic. The fact that even sectoids could take control of the best trained soldiers the world had to offer (like Navy seals, Green Berets, SAS the like) is incredible. Their training regimen is extremely brutal and it takes a Will of Steel to get through it.

******* Hard disagree.

If you're comparing it to stupid bollocks like Dragon Ball Z or Marvel Comics where they've had so many constant arms races of “no u!” “no u times infinity!” then sure, because that stuff is overblown to the point of becoming dull.

But when you look at what a Harry Potter wizard can actually do, they're pretty hardcore.

******** Not really. The most powerful spell is far less powerful than a hand grenade. If it were, then most scenes would end with everyone dead. In addition, don't you think the Aliens would have scouted everywhere, and therefore be prepared for magic? Possibly even inventing a way to cancel out all magic on Earth?

********* The most destructive spell is Fiendfyre, which will consume any physical matter, burns in a perfect vacuum and actively attacks any living thing. It is also uncontrollable and unstoppable without magic.

The most powerful spell instantly kills any living or undead corporeal thing. It penetrates any shield or armor, and the only way to block it is through the sacrifice of a mother's life, which still leaves a scar and a wound in the soul of the victim.

also, the aliens are muggles, and therefore can neither detect nor percieve any magical areas.

********** And even those zombies aren't actually undead, they're puppets. A single wizard can enchant hundreds if not thousands of inferi which will all act on his command.

He can unleash fiendfyre and then apparate out, and Fiendfyre is said to be able to burn anything. According to JK's writings, it can burn in a vacuum, it will consume any sort of flame retardant and water only makes it burn hotter. Without a wizard to control it, it will grow until there is nothing left. It possesses a rudimentary maliciousness that will make it actively attack any living thing in range.

He can use the Killing Curse, a spell that will break any shield or protection and which works through armor and handheld shields.

*********** But remember: You can't use anything when Psionics are involved. Psionics can get into the head of anyone, even tough-as-nails soldiers. This means that the aliens can stop wizards from being able to focus long enough to use magic. That's the Wizard's's one weakness: If you can't focus for long enough, you are as powerless as an ordinary muggle.

************* How powerful is it? Besides, your'e comparing apples and oranges. In addition, the only spell that would have any substantial effect on the invaders(Fiendfyre) is so dangerous, the wizards may end up burning Earth to cinders. They can't use it for the same reason Muggles don't carry around Davy Crocket nuke launchers. The fact is that the invaders stomp. And only The Commander can help anyone in this story.

#+end_quote

Wait, why would it need to take place in the 2010s as opposed to the late 90s-2000s? Wasn't Enemy Unknown taking place in 1999?

As an aside, that was a scary freaking game. I remember on the first play through that I made any progress, most of my good stuff was in the North America base. When I first made my secondary Eurasia base I was like 'why would I need to waste money on base defences when I've got my interceptors?' so I put them off. Sure enough, just two days before my defences were built, /while my main Eurasian squad was still coming back from a mission/, I had to fight through a bunch of Snakemen and Chryssalids with a bunch of bloody rookies and injured crew and only a dozen heavy plasmas between them.
