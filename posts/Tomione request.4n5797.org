I love /The Chamber of Secrets/ and wished there was more in the books/films about when Tom Riddle was at Hogwarts.

For someone to rally an entire army of supporters, he must've been one hell of a charismatic guy and this earlier side of Tom Riddle has always intrigued me.

I've read a few time travel Tomione fics but a lot of them are cliche and unbelievably OOC. So I'm looking for any recommendations where Hermione doesn't immediately swoon over the dark and handsome Tom Riddle.


** Linkffn(War Paint by provocative envy)

This fic has problems that cannot be overlooked, but underneath the obnoxious formatting and other little things that drag it down from "good stuff" to "read once and that's enough" is a compelling, interesting, twisted little story. Also, the epilogue is completely unnecessary. But, yeah, if you're looking for that pairing, it does rather well on that front.

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.

** linkffn(Tied for Last) I read this fic over a year ago so I'm not entirely sure if it would still hold up if I reread it. I remember loving the plot for the most part and Tom and Hermione's interactions. I think it was a little far fetched but it was one of my favorite Tomione fics.

  Hermione is killed by Voldemort, and is now dead. Well, sort of. Turns out that death is a little more complex than she knew... Ignores epilogue and last 50ish pages of DH.

** Hmm, I'm reading linkffn(Choosing Grey) , Hermione is a little OOC (if she wasn't, Tomione wouldn't work at all) but she's not as OOC as in other stories. She's still pretty smart and bookish.

#+begin_quote
  An attempt to salvage more than a Pyrrhic victory lands Hermione in 1944. With conspiracies, schemes, and difficult choices in every corner, and a charismatic young Tom Riddle who is increasingly interested in her, she will eventually have to answer the question: How much darkness and grey in him can she accept?
