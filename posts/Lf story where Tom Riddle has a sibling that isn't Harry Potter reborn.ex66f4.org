  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.

** Sadly, the only ones I might recommend are less than 100k length, and they each have their faults which make me hesitant to recommend them.

Here's one anyway in case you might be interested:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11185107/1/Stepbrother][Stepbrother]] - This is an AU fic in which Hermione was born in Tom Riddle's generation, and her parents adopt Tom from the orphanage. In my opinion the author has written a stellar plot focused on the childhood interaction between Hermione and Tom, showing how their conflict causes them to develop into different people. My only caveat is that the sibling relationship gets... weird after they reach Hogwarts. linkffn(11185107)

The only other non-Harry focused stories I know of are self-inserts with the main character an OC reborn as Tom Riddle's sister.
