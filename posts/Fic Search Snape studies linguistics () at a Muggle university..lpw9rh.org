:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I might be misremembering this, but I'm looking for a fic where Snape studies linguistics (or something along those lines) at a Muggle university. He finds himself in this situation after his wand is snapped (I think) and he's forced to live as a Muggle. I believe he gets some help from his neighbors, one of whom might be attending the university as well. Any help is appreciated!


** I have read this...I will check my bookmarks and see if I can find anything!

Edit: I think it is Semantics by coffeeonthepatio. It looks like it has been deleted from [[https://FF.net][FF.net]], but maybe somewhere will know where else it can be found.
