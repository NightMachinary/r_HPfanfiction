I get it that Harry was not in the best of places with Voldemort having regained his physical body and the Ministry slandering him, or the fact that Dumbledore was keeping him in the dark, or even that he was at that age. But why take his frustrations and anger on the few people who actually stood by him? I believe that the influence of Voldemort being more powerful than ever throughout his lifetime really made the Horcrux pull out the worst of Harry.


** A perfect storm of teenage hormones, PTSD battling Voldemort and watching Cedric die and feeling helpless because the Order (which he doesn't even know about to start with) is keeping him in the dark.

** Yeah you don't really need the scarcrux poisoning his thoughts to make him behave as he did; as already mentioned he already more than enough reasons to be angry at the world.

That being said even if his scar was influencing him, it was likely Voldemort himself that was pushing negative thoughts at him and not the scar itself.

After all, if the scar could have done that then it would have already done so. Given that the diarycrux was capable of snaring Ginny, a horcrux literally right next to his brain should have easily affected him negatively if it could do so.

This has always been my suspicion, and to me it makes sense considering that "Voldemort using the connection between himself and Harry" was an overarching plot point throughout the whole book.

**** I mean, it was. Voldemort was constantly sending visions of the DoM to Harry to try and lure him there, or at the very least Voldemort's focus on it was unintentionally sending visions of it to Harry. Same with the Nagini attack and Harry's reaction to Dumbledore, it could have been intentional on Voldemort's part or a side effect of Voldemort possessing Nagini, since Harry shared the same connection to him that she does.

Though Harry's dreams about Cedric don't need to be explained by Voldemort's interference, since it's such a traumatic experience that happened so recently he'd likely have nightmares about it regardless of his connection to Voldemort.

*** Especially we saw it first hand with the horcrux in the locket, it was an external object and still caused noticeable discomfort in those wearing it.

**** Oh I definitely considered it, I decided not use it as an example because an argument could be made that with Voldemort recorporealised in his new body that the effects of a horcrux could be stronger.

I used the diarycrux specifically because it had its effect before Voldemort's new birthday, showing that horcrux can have power even if their owner is in a non-corporeal state.

*** Your response is a bit confusing. So do you think that the horcrux was influencing Harry or not? Also I will assume that scarcrux means the horcrux attached to Harry. Please lmk if I'm wrong.

**** 1. I don't think the horcrux in his scar (henceforth scarcrux) has ever influenced him
2. I don't think Harry needs the influence of his scarcrux to explain his behaviour in OotP (or indeed in any of the books), due to everything else that has happened to him or that he is
3. any influence coming from the scarcrux would be because Voldemort himself is pushing that influence (as in, Voldemort would have to expend some effort on his part to use the connection between him and Harry to influence him). Meaning that the scarcrux would at best be the conduit through which he was influenced

** Harry was raised in an environment where he was blamed for everything that went wrong, received no therapy, and was then moved to an environment where "you have to save people" was reinforced. The end of fourth year featured a highly traumatic event that anyone, much less someone primed as a martyr would have some survivor's guilt over. Following that event, Harry was left completely out of communication and had nobody to talk to about it, much less therapy. I'm surprised Harry was as well-adjusted as he was in OotP. And Harry was a goddamn mess. Oh, and can't forget the tacitly condoned torture he went through all year.

Of course, in Rowling's "PTSD doesn't exist" world, it was entirely the horcrux.

** Funny how Harry's temper reaches boiling point right as he settles into Grimmauld Place, which sounds like a perfect combination of the Scarcrux being in the vicinity of the locket and obviously the frustrating circumstances themselves.
