** I've always had a headcanon that the Catholic Church has a magical division.

The Bible is rather specific on what types of magic are allowed, most, and what is not allowed.

Pretty much it just says, don't use magic for evil and it's all good.

So in a world of magic of course religions would incorporate magic into themselves.

So my theory is the whole witch hunts were against anyone not willing to take vows of the church.

Vows of promising to do no evil against others and similar.

European witches and wizards went full Libertarian and were like "fuck you! You're not telling me what to do!"

So I always imagined an alternative fic where Harry was dropped off at a catholic church.

They find out he is magical and he is shuffled off to Vatican City right quick.

They find out about the evil scar right quick as well.

So they do some digging and find an active prophecy.

This means he is once again shuffled off, this time to the Magical Templar's. Their active war mage division that strikes out evil.

So GoF happens and suddenly Templar in Training Catholic War Mage shows up with a Squad of Templar's.

That's about as far as my idea has gone so far but it would be cool to make.

I see them using not wands but crosses and reliquaries for using their magic.

Harry as a Templar Trainee is proficient in Healing, Holy (Buffing and Damaging spells light Bolt of Light type stuff)

Picture using Solar Flare and blasting a dragon with Plasma. Instant bbq.

*** Wait, so Harry is like a...Paladin?

Or an Inquisition Psyker, just with a different indoctrination?

Harry to the dragon:

"Ah, the spawn of the serpent, your kind may be durable, but like Saint George before me, I shall destroy you with HOLY LIGHT!"

Proceeds to try a "Holy" blast at the dragon, powerful spell, but Dragons are Creatures, kind of neutral, so it just pisses it off and it retaliates with fire breath, that Harry shields with some cool holy sounding Latin named shield.

"You may wield hellfire, monster! But it's no match for the FIRES OF HEAVEN!"

Uses some other holy sounding Latin spell that summons or shoots lighting, that's actually effective and hurts the poor animal enough for Harry to get the egg.

He proceeds to raise it in the air and dedicates his victory to the Lord.

Hermione is appalled such organizations exist, and that wizards behave like /that/.

Harry dresses like a WH40K Inquisitor(just coat, no cape or implants), but in white/gray, and crosses instead of skulls.

He also is really into speaking like one.

****** Lily was an assassin sent by the organization to discover the secret history behind the Statute of Secrecy, but she got sidetracked by James and secretly passed down her mission to Harry, who after being taken to the Dursley's by Dumbledore, was taken from there doorstep immediately after by the organization.

******* I honestly don't know the full lore of the AC world, but the gist of it I got was that it's an organization of historical mystery hunters, working against another organization who is trying to use there knowledge to control the world.
