Specifically, BDSM/bondage related stuff. Not necessarily super hardcore, but at least playing with dominance/submission.

And more specifically and most importantly, *femdom*.

Does anyone have any good fics featuring this kind of thing? Preferably with creative magic usage. My favorite example I've found so far is [[https://marjorie.auroris.net/harry-potter-cov/a-trip-to-hogsmead/][Harry Potter and the Charm of Venus]], but I'm sure there's got to be more good stuff out there.

^{sorta embarrassed asking but uh yeah thanks in advance}

*** W/ Hermione on top? I have to admit I'm not, but that's mainly because the only ones I've read have gone with the more.. maybe obvious dynamic of Snape doing the domineering. If you have any recommendations I'd love to look into them!

**** nah, they're mostly Snape. I don't think I've read one with Hermione as a dom... Then again, I've only read two... And never finished either... I'll just leave now.

  "You want your parents to come for you, fine. I mean, there's an apparation block on London, and there's not a snatcher on the streets who wouldn't be happy with a red Weasley scalp, but they'll probably find you, sooner or later." "Or?" said Ginny. Millicent actually looked uncomfortable. "Or you stay here and do what I want," she said. "For a week or two. Then I'll get you out of the apparation wards."

*** That's fine with me (and anyways, if anyone else searches this sub like I did I'm sure they'd be glad to find it) - I tend to get a bit uncomfortable if it goes /too/ ... psychological ? But I've read noncon that I've enjoyed quite a bit.

  Now Complete! Severus Snape is not a kind man, but Hermione Granger is past caring. She wants his approval and will do anything to get it. How far will she go? Even she has no concept of the depths to which she will fall in her quest.
