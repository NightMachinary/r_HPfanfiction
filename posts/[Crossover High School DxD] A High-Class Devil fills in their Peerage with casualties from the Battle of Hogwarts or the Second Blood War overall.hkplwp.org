[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15327903/chapters/60684661][My attempt at a lead-in for this idea]]

For more details, I thought aging Ravel up to around 16-17 and making her a King in her own right instead of a Bishop worshiping her brother would work well. As for who gets Reincarnated, I'd say at least Harry, Remus, Tonks, and Fred and George (since they'd prefer to be a package deal). Of course, if Harry chose to leave on the train he might be a /tiny/ bit hacked off that his choice got overridden. There's more info in the end notes of that chapter which I can copy-paste to this thread if desired.

*** Vimesenthusiast is one of my favorites on ffnet, overall a very good writer even if he does have a terrible sense of distance in space.

  A Harry Potter who has tried to take control of his destiny from second year on finds himself in need of a fresh start due to his marital status changing abruptly. Armed with some abilities beyond the norm, a Mastery of Defense and a muggle-style teacher's license, Harry takes his daughter Lily Luna and takes a job offer at Kuoh Academy. Pairings undecided save Harry/Rias/many?

** Love the prompt, and definitely like the example you wrote. Like that Hedwig was somehow compatible with the evil piece system, and see it as a means for him to not be so "hacked off" about reviving.

Good DxD crossovers are hard to come by... or rather they're there, but not updating. I'd like to see something like this actively updating. If anyone's interested, and hasn't seen them:

linkffn(12136398; 10245492) are two of my favorites besides "FILFY teacher" which is already linked :)

  [ON HIATUS] After picking up a strange paper in the Department of Mysteries, Harry accidentally summons a devil to Privet Drive. Of course, this devil doesn't look at all how you might expect. She looks to be a regular, albeit exceedingly attractive, girl. Their lives now tied together, how will Rias Gremory affect the war against Voldemort?

*** DxD is one of those settings that's incredibly ripe for crossovers. I'd love to see more from "A Demon Lord's Hero" or the "Beyond the Outer Gate Lies..." series, and I'm waiting for "Gods, Devils, and Wild Horses, Oh My!" to win in Vimesenthusiast's update polls again. Just recently I read into "Remnant DxD" and a new chapter dropped for "Xander DxD".
