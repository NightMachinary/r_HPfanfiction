OK, bring it on! I'm looking for SS/HG marriage law fics. I know marriage law fics are mostly cheesy, but that's ok. I'm cool with happy or not. I tend to like the ones with T or M rating. Thanks very much.


** Alright. This is an area I've got.

This is something that's been asked before so search marriage law and see what comes up.
