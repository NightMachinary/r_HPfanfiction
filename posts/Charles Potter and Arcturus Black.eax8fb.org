A complete fic that has these two as important characters. They always seem to end up as power house characters in some way and I want to see more.

Charlus not Charles.


** Well Honor thy blood has mentions of Charlus Potter and Arcutrus does play an important role. .linkffn(12155794)

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** They're in linkffn(a step to the right)

That particular fic is complete, but it's written with the intent of sequels.
