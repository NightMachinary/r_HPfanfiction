Terrorist from those in power's pov but if harry blows up buildings to sow terror, that works too.

I was walking back from getting coffee and was thinking about my friend's former job at the CIA and started imagining Harry as a spy with a NOC, working with shining pathesque guerillas to destabilize an african nation to stop the dictator from funding a terrorist organization.


** That's a very interesting concept. Magic is perfectly suited for this situation. Explosions and deaths that are completely unexplainable and untraceable from a Muggle perspective.

This gives me an idea for an Auror Teddy story. A Metamorphmagus who can quite literally become anyone. A US Muggle and Magical government with similarly aligned interests in stopping terrorist/destabilization activities in Country X. Teddy is assigned the task of tracking down the rogue wizard(s) and finds that everything is not as it seems. Maybe a bit of Harry's past comes back to haunt him ... Hmm ...

** Harry led a very effective terror campaign against Voldemort and Ministry in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620).

Hermione is a total terrorist in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994).

But when it comes to body count, Ginny beat them all in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185).

**** I talked with the author over PM. He said Ginny would play a major role in the final story arc.

Yes, I agree with you that Ginny in “Emperor” is a complex and excellent character, who is also a credible extension of her canon version under the new circumstances. She is still at core a good person, as her plea for Hermione shows, but she's also someone who's willing to commit terrible evil for her country.

***** I stopped reading it a while ago and I probably won't go back either. I'm just very disappointing with the direction the story took.

I would have preferred my politics, more focus on the internal power struggles of the empire and more info on the technological advancements, hell, even more info on the integration of magic in society in general; instead we got a bunch of fight scenes.

I'm not saying I disliked those, because especially the Band of Brothers style scenes following that one squad around were pretty awesome but I think they would have made a better side story instead of completely diverting the main story line.

The final straw for me was Harry taking to the field himself again. It just didn't make any sense to me for him to risk his life, hell, his empire - because it would have all fallen apart without him - just because he felt like it.

It's consistent with that Harry's character though, and a major sore point between him and his wife.

I guess I expected him to grow up a little. It's fine if an 18 year old behaves that way but I just don't find it acceptable for someone who wants to not only build an Empire but also be accepted as its ruler and maybe even the first of a new dynasty.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

The primary difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter is a terrorist targets civilians while a freedom fighter targets military. Sometimes there is some overlap (for example, hospitals can both civilian and military targets simultaneously), but the ultimate target and means used diverge quite a bit.

***** While I can understand your dislike of the cliche, america nuked two cities in a war. We purposely targeted civilians. Two acts of terror to show we meant it when we told Japan we would glass their country. These were preceded by the firebombing of 67 cities, not military targets. There were valid reasons for this but up to 900,000 japanes died in these attacks. And these were acts by a legitimate government, ratified by another country.

Sometimes, an act of terror can seem like the only way to make your point/s.

****** Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Kokura (another target that wasn't bombed because of the weather) were all military targets. Port cities, weapons factories, ammunition warehouses, etc. We were not /targeting/ civilians, they were just obscenely excessive collateral. It's also terror because we were two governments openly at war with each other. Sure, it scared the crap out of the Japanese, but it was actually to deliver a crippling blow with minimal loss of life compared to the effects of a continued war.

** Maybe not Africa, as that's rather far from the events of the main story (which would necessitate a lot of OCs, unless you want to go full AU and transplant the whole cast), /and also is kind of racist?/ Like, there aren't very many ways to interpret a white guy blowing up black people in order to destabilize their government.

If you're really set on the premise, I did some googling and there were branches of the IRA active through the 90s.
