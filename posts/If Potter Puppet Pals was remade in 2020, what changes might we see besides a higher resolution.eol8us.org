*** I love the idea that this is totally literal. Disowned people are basically under a 'Name exists and is a member of the family' fidelius and you literally can't perceive them at all. I imagine a plague of squibs wandering around drawing moustaches on Purebloods and spitting in their tea.

** There could be a McGonagall, Ginny and/or Draco puppet. So much more possibilities.

Maybe add in another Death Eater for a one off episode, like Bellatrix

*** There was a Ginny puppet in the episode Ron's Sister. And Draco's already a puppet.

**** The Draco puppet was a puppet of a puppet that ended with him burning. I feel like a good episode could have Dumbledore and Snape competing in who could spoil Harry and Draco the most or something like that

**** I totally forgot about the Ginny episode. Wasn't it just Ron in a bow and Harry getting really confused? Her character could be fleshed out.
