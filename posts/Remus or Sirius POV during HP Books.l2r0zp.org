Hey everyone!

Wondering if anyone can recommend fanfics on Remus or Sirius POV during HP books, being Cannon Compliant and not wolfstar?

Thanks in advance ;)


** I have some one shots from Remus's POV if you're interested? And one from Sirius's POV. In this collection: [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/1407286]]

** linkao3(Remus Lupin and the Prisoner of Azkaban) is brilliant!! Cannot reccommend enough. Sadly the Goblet of Fire version was abandoned half way through but what is written is totally worth it. If there's Wolfstar in this it's very light since Sirius is barely in it. I'll be honest I don't really remember but the story was worth the read.

If you want to give Wolfstar a go then these are brilliant. Ill link them anyway and sure you can ignore them

Linkao3(Remain in Light by veeagainst) is brilliant. A lot of jumping but basically Sirius survives OoTP and they run the Order. It's mostly canon and really well written. I was more scared during the Battle of Hogwarts in this than I was during the original books. But heavy Wolfstar warning.

linkao3(Stealing Harry by copperbadge) is a Remus/Sirius adopt Harry story that does the books too if you like? It's really good and there's a lot of side stories. A bit different but overall follows the storyline and very cute.

Hope they help!

  What if Sirius Black didn't die? It's been done many times. Here's my take on it.

  In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.
