Savannah, Georgia is the most haunted city in the United States, even in front of legends like Charleston, SC and Gettysburg, PA. So, why not have a magical school there; specifically one taught entirely by the dead! (Special guest appearance on December 7th: William T. Sherman on the dangers of Fiendfyre; and Principal-Headmaster James Oglethorpe gives his annual April 9th lecture on the founding of the city)


** Skipping class to go surfing instead of swimming in the Black Lake. Tybee island adventures. Girl scouts earning their Magic Badge.

Edit: Simply filler thoughts. Not a full prompt reply. Sorry.

** I think the theme in the series is that magical schools are typically to large and too magically active to be close to Muggles... but it could work as a heavily wizard-populated area similarly to Godric's Hallow and maybe have something like an elementary magical school or stuff.

*** Thing is, Savannah is a coastal city; who's to say the entire thing isn't underwater, with an entrance somewhere on River Street?

** How about this?

Certain Famous people and native Americans who died in the 15 to early 19th century were selected during their youth by a secret coven to be resurrected and teach children magic.

Many of these were selected due to their good morals and nobility.

The coven existed before Illvermony did.

They taught the founder of Illvermony but she decided to make her own school

BUT

In this timeline Illvermony never existed Instead The Savannah school of magic was founded by the coven and the previous founder of Illvermony became a teacher and headmistress at one point.

The school lies underwater. Hidden from the world. River street has a secret wall like Diagon Alley does. Activating it will show Native American like canoes. The students sit in the canoes and they have a long ride. They reach an underwater cave where a makeshift port is present. There is a underground city with shops,markets,hotels.etc. There is a carriage that will help the students to get to the school. They get off the carriage and depart into the magical castle.

Magical invisible walls have been made to make sure the water and underwater creatures don't attack.

They have a colosseum type Qudditch field with a enchanted dome and stuff.

Various mythical creatures of America teach at the school as well,such as Bigfoot,La llorona,Shapeshifters.etc.

Remember Fluffy from the first Harry Potter book?

Yeah The Savannah school has a Fluffy.....

Except the Fluffy is a Wendigo who is Sentient and friendly.

The ghosts are friendly and they teach the students. Along with human teachers as well as Native American teachers.Black and Muslims and Indians (India) also teach at the school.

The school isn't too keen on America's racist views and they are open and friendly to all.

Ya know the SCP foundation?

Well guess what?

All fictional creatures or the SCPS (as muggles refer them as) aren't fictional and are actually living in the city amongst the wizarding kind.

Yep!

And some of the violent ones and kept in locked in a astral plane to protect everyone by the Coven.

The neutral and friendly beings,whether they are sentient or not,are allowed to be free.

The Coven is a group of wizards,witches,ghosts,and sentient mythical creatures who strive to protect their wizarding world and are the leaders.

The American Wizarding Government are like the British Wizarding government,except they are governed by the Coven,not a prime minister.

So yeah!

*** Honestly, it makes sense all this freaky shit would be in Georgia. Probably explains the weird noises I hear at night if the windows are open. Good to know!
