  Voldemort is back, he can be stopped but all things come at a price. Someone called for a hero but he said no, ripped from his own reality he jumps again. Will he be more helpful this time? AU femHarry.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

** linkffn(7405386)

There's also one WBWL (the name escapes me) wherein the usual WBWL Dudley-esque shenanigans end up with the little sister dead.

HP vows to pursue reviving her from the dead, no matter the cost.

** I'm here cause I didn't notice the & rather then /. WHere's that thread damn it? :P

But ok, I'm going to be useful. Ish.

Linkffn(Too Young to Die) is a WBWL Harry being a loving (non incest IIRC) brother. Spoiler Alert: She dies rather early, and most of the fic is Harry going to extreme measures to fix that. It does have some good bonding if I recall, both at the start while she's alive, and I think later on when he retrieves her soul or whatnot?\\
It's been a long time since I read it, and I enjoyed it back then.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
