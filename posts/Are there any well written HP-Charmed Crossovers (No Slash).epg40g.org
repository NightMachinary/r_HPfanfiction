** The TV show/comic/graphic novels? I would read that.

Because the Halliwell sisters' use of magic is a good way to show off the "Old Ways" of magic. And there are some good parallels between the two series. The only one I really remember was the Oblivators and [[https://charmed.fandom.com/wiki/The_Cleaners][The Cleaners]].
