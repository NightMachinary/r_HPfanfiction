So many stories have Harry and co finding their one true love at like age 14 or whatever and live happily ever after. That's not realistic.

It doesn't have to be a major plot point but I'd like to read where it happens.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10522345/1/Relationship-Status-Pending][Relationship Status Pending]] is a great fit for what you want. It's a Hermione first person journal type fic of all of her relationships onward from victor krum. Who she ends up with is a spoiler so I won't say but there's a lot of different breakups and stuff throughout. Linkffn(10522345)

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger is edging thirty, accident prone and haplessly single. One night, she decides it would be humourous (and hilariously masochistic) to timeline her failed relationships in a memoir. From losing her v-card in a broom closet, to hooking up in a public loo, to ruining her best friend's wedding - she's done it all. (UNDERGOING REVISION 05/08/2015)

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. [Currently Being Updated.
