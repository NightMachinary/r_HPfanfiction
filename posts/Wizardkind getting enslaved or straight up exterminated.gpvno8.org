I usually prefer the reverse, where it's the Wizards taking over everything. I feel like I wanna spice it up a bit.

But nevertheless, I'd rather it not be Muggle-wank. More in the line of the MC being incredibly ruthless and power hungry and seeing the existence of Wizardkind as a threat. So she/he either looks for ways to magically enslave them, brainwash them, or straight up exterminate them until the MC and their trusted few are the only Magicals left, free to rule the world.

Thanks, everyone!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12867536/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Homecoming]] - most muggleborns are enslaved by the end of the series. It's not most wizards but it's the only one I can think of right now that sort of fits this prompt.
