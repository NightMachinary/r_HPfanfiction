** I think it would be up to us Norwegians to write.... I can see some potential there, mind.

"So, Harry, how d'you say 'I Love You' in Norwegian?"

"Why does everyone keep asking me that?"

"Oh, go on! Please?"

"Okay. It's 'Jeg er en hestkuk.' "

"Yay arr en hestkook?`"

"You've got it."

*** Hilarious. Can you write?

My cousin once told a chinese tourist that "katteb√¶sj" is "hi" in norwegian.

**** I can write... at the moment I'm plotting out my first HP fanfic, but there's not much about Norway in that, sadly. Or, well, anything at all, really.

***** Peraonally, I imagine wizarding Scandinavia to be three nations constantly at war. They form tentative alliances with each other, before they break down. Scandinavians are, without exception, the best weapon enchanters in the whole world. They specalise in axes, but also other things. They have one school on Iceland, and there is peace for three days when the ship that carries all the children sails at Iceland.

******* Yeah, was Norwegian, then Danish, and now independent. Consider it neutral territory.

I imagine the school built partially into a volcano, with sandstone and black making the exterior. It have many archs, like a cathedral, and have wmhot baths. Under the volcano, three leylines converge, and there have been made small, friendly creatures of lava. They have short, stubby legs, are fat, bulging arms, and communicate with sounds like a frog. They are the servants of the school, and feed on the magic of leylines. The school have a large courtyard, where they practice weapons, and a larfe underground pool, where they learn to swim and sail boats. They have three seperate dorms, Norway, Denmark and Swedo-Finish.

They have the standard Hogwarts classes, but with extra for culture, enchanting, trade and commerce, economy, and languages.

They have electives like mining, smithing, farming and warding.

********** Don't see why. It's a different school with different customs. Nothing inherently Mary Sue about that, long as you don't go on and on about HOW MUCH BETTER it is than Hogwarts.

********* I'm thinking Harry could grow up in Buskerud or Telemark. Far enough from Sweden, can practice magic without much trouble. Also a place for many vikings

** I recall reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1032054/chapters/2056227][be brave]] on AO3, which does actually have a Norwegian raised Harry, though not the other criteria. Don't really remember all that much else from the story (some Draco time travel shenanigans I think?), but, anyway, it's there.
