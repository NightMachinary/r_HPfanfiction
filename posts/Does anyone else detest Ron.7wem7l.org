** It seemed like JKR decided to make him the butt monkey after the first book. Couldn't have people liking anyone more than Harry!

Ron is the only one of the trio that I would want to be friends with.

** Only about half of the Internet.

Okay, that's an exaggeration. But still, a lot of people hate Ron.

Personally - he's kinda meh. He's interesting, but a bad friend and an /awful/ match for Hermionie .

** Yes, but mostly because of books three and four. He got better later on, but because of the shit he pulled, especially in GoF, Harry and Hermione should have ended the friendship at that point. He is not a bad person and definitely doesn't deserve deserve some weird love potion Death Eater plots, he is simply not someone who would be a good friend for either Harry or Hermione. There's a certain line, which puts a permanent end to a friendship, and in my opinion he crossed that one by 1st of November 1994 for Harry and at the Yule Ball with Hermione (the accusations against her spying for Krum).

*** He never accused her of spying. He accused Krum of using her to get information about Harry, which deeply insulted her, as if saying the only reason Krum was interested in her was because of her friendship to Harry instead of any of her personal qualities.

I don't think Ron's ever crossed a line, as stated in Harry's own words, and he's put up with more shit than any friend ever reasonably would.

*** Agreed. But then Harry would have to end the friendship he had with Hermione for the way she acted when Harry used the Half Blood's book.

**** Well, the thing is, much like with Scabbers, Hermione was right in the end. I mean, not that Draco didn't deserve Sectumsempra, but that was a rather dangerous spell in the book. Hindsight was 20/20, but without her confusion about Ron, Lavender and Cormac, she would not have been that dickish towards Harry, who frankly was just a target for her pent-up aggression. Yes, she is jealous and not really nice about the entire mess, but she did not make accusations which went against the quintessential character traits of her friends like Ron when he thought Harry entered himself or that Hermione was going to betray Harry for a guy on their first date.

***** What the hell are you talking about. Hermione never guessed or said that Scabber was Pettigrew. And she still insulted, reprimanded Harry for the book, while the true reason was that she can't stand being second in potion.

******** If you break the rules for years and it results in harm to you or your possessions, I'm not going to feel bad about it, even if it was my pet who ate your illegal one. You put your pet into harms way, you have to live with the consequences. Any owl could have snacked a rat, and if you blame a friend for your mistakes, that makes you a dick, not the friend.

*** Several things here. Ron is hardly useless and isn't lazy when he feels it's something worth putting effort into. He took in active role in the DA, fought in the DoM, fought in the Astronomy tower, and was instrumental in helping Harry first year, second year, fifth year, sixth year (though in smaller doses, due to most of it being exposition), and in the hunt for the horcruxes.

Harry wouldn't have fit in in Slytherin, especially since they were the children of the servants of the man that wanted him dead. Harry already didn't want to be in Slytherin because of Malfoy and Hagrid. And if Harry were to go to Slytherin, he'd have never befriended Hermione and she'd have ended up a splattered mess on the bathroom walls.
