*** Oh dear God. Started reading this, and that is such a ridiculous beginning, yet totally Dumbledorean. Oh hey just turned 17 year old, I know it's midnight, but who cares, I'll just send a fucking phoenix into your room! With babies! They're yours now, look after them! Tell you what, you name them too. My shout, don't worry about the cost!

My suspension of disbelief is running in horror, screaming.

#+begin_quote
  The summer after his godfather's death was the worse in Harry's life for many reasons. An event so horrifying takes place causing him to question if he should even go on, but in the end all it takes is Faith to pull through and find the good in the dark. Based on 'The Unknown Light' by Someryn with her permission. This is about rape and the aftermath. No slash. Ginny is not raped.

** Harry Potter and the Greatest Gift by mini-mid has Harry acting as a teenage father to a baby, and the Dursleys' neighbors believe he is a teenage father, but the baby is actually Dudley's. It's a good 'Harry as a teenage dad' fic so it may still interest you, even if technically Harry isn't the bio dad. Be warned it's not finished and the author has been MIA since 2013.
