Every since I read "the rune stone path" I've been intrigued with Harry knowing the young teachers better than he does in the books. Since we know so little about Sinistra, Babbling and Vector from the book you could write a whole lot with them. Either being romantically involved with them, or them being friendly (being a part of his life or what not). Recently read one with Auroa Sinistra taking a more active role in his life. No slash please, or non of the older ones like McGonagall, Pomfry, Sprout or Trelawney.

Thank you!

  Harry has an idea of how to break the rules of Transfiguration, and it actually might work. Maybe. Plenty of other things happen too. No slash and no pairings as yet.

** How do we know Vector and Co. are "younger"? Partially due to linkffn(The Arithmancer) stating that Vector and Umbridge were (unfortunately) roommates, I've always pictured Vector as in her 50's at least.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.
