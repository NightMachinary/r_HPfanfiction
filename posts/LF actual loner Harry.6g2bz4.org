I've been looking for more fics that have Harry as a loner and keeping to himself, but every time I read one it always ends up the same, Harry's a loner who somehow ends up accumulating a group of friends. Then the author has the gall of saying he's still a loner when he clearly isn't.

Anyway, anyone know any fics where Harry stays mostly to himself, with a few acquatances here and there.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

** linkffn(9628375) in the Malachite series harry is kind of a loner. He has some form of friendship with the bloody baron, but hes more like a mentor. in the sequel he befriends luna and their relationship is quite unique. in third year he has some form of relationship with daphne greengrass (they are neither friends nor a couple but more like allies who somehow both despise each other and have attraction between them). the fic is slytherin harry with neville as the boy who lived. the series is either on hiatus or abandoned. its quite good if aou can ignore the hadrian and tolerate the writing at the beginning( it gets better later on)

** linkffn(8541055) Neville is the BWL, Harry is a loner and poor and has to fend for himself. Fairly fast paced and some events from canon are present but bit more AU. Note that it is unfinished and looks to be abandoned for about 4 years now.
