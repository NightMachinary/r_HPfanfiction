A weird idea I know, but I remember reading something where Harry somehow frees all dementors of their 'curse', this then reverts them into a group of warriors that are then loyal to him? (Or at least I think that's how it went). Anyways I'm not exactly looking for that fanfic exactly but I'd like something similar if you get what I mean. Thanks!


** The nightmare man and its sequels.

I'm on mobile so I would link but I would mess it up. Be aware tho it's dark so.

** I remember there was a fic that Harry combines Dementors and House-elves and rules them but I don't remember the name but maybe someone remembers.

** It's not the fic where the dementors raise Harry in Azkaban?

** I don't know but that sounds like the exact plot of Return of the King.

** The Nightmare Lord, by Tiro. Harry is essentially the creator of the dementors through some time travel shenanigans.

** Hmm... Lord of Caer Azkaban maybe? I haven't read it in many years though.
