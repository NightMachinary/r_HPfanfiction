He experiences a different kind of mortality. Not an ‘I could die tomorrow' moment but rather a ‘no matter what, we all die' moment.

He experiences a disconnect where the dead can't be avenged, no justice is required, and it is simply about letting go. A death without trauma is anathema to his experience.

It occurred to me in the books the only real ‘natural' death of someone/something Harry knew was Aragog. Other than that, all the death he experiences (which is plenty) is traumatic.

His parents, Quirell, Myrtle, Basilisk, Old man muggle Riddle Groundskeeper, Cedric, Sirius, Albus, Severus, Fred, Tonks, Remus, etc, all violent.


** It felt odd. Standing around in a suit giving condolences wasn't odd. Nor was the tears or candlelight. He knew that all too well. He was familiar to the shoulder squeeze, the back rubbing, and the hand resting on his forearm. He's been to so many funerals he knew the communication of mourning better than anyone.

What was odd was there were no one to be avenged. It wasn't sudden, he didn't feel the usual ragged hole in his chest. This death was natural. Old age had finally found it's way to Arabella's house and took her to her new residence.

Harry and others in her life knew it was coming. I'm the days leading up she had clarity for the first time in months. She knew that it was nearing her end and accepted it welcomingly. She had called all those she cared for to her home. She said her goodbyes with tears and promises of never leaving their heart.

One such was with Harry. He had promised to stay with her that night. The night when she finally closed her eyes for good.

"I hope to see my mother," she whispered to him. Her rubbed her hand in response. "I haven't seen her in so long, I forgot what she sounds like."

Harry understood that. He could no longer remember Cedric's normal voice anymore. All he could remember was the panic and yelling.

"Oh dear," she pulled his attention back, "What do you want me to pass along to those on the other side?"

He thought of his Mom and Dad. He thought of Sirius, Tonks, and Remus. He remembered the faces of Fred and Cedric. There was so much he could say. There was so much he wanted to say.

"Can you tell them that I miss them all. That I love them all and wish they were still here. Tell them that I'm okay and I will see them again one day." His words came out quietly but very emotional.

"Of course, dear." She breathed out. She closed her eyes and her breathing slowed to a stop. Her face wasn't in pain or bloodied. It wasn't a young face with eyes wide in horror. It was peaceful.

He never knew death cold be peaceful.

Now he stood next to Minerva drinking a glass of water while shaking hands and accepting the condolences that were given to him. He stayed after the funeral party left. He watched them start shoveling dirt into her casket.

"It's always better to go to a funeral when the person is ready for death." Minerva spoke behind him.

"It's my first one like this," he confessed.

"I hope the rest will be like this as well."

** He felt helpless. It was a strange feeling he hadn't experienced in many years. This wasn't the first funeral he attended - far by it. He knew how it worked... but this was different.

Arthur Weasley didn't go out in a blast. He didn't die a hero death like Sirius, he didn't die a senseless death like Cedric. He just went to bed and didn't wake up the next morning.

"He was old", said someone. But 71 didn't feel old - not for a wizard at last. Harry was sure Arthur would be there when Teddy and Victoire would get married in some years. That he would be there when James, Albus and Lily graduated. Now he wouldn't.

"He had a good live. A loving family", said another one. And they were right. Arthur Weasley had a good live. He had a loving wife, seven children, four daughters-in-law, a son-in-law and a full duzen of grandchildren. They were all there. Molly with red eyes from crying, held by Bill and Charlie when the coffin was brought to earth. George, without a joke on his lips. Ron, who was shaking and shivering while Hermione whispered calming words in his ear. All their children in different states of grieve, some of them not yet old enough to really understand. On the other hand - did he?

"He was a good man", said a third. And truer words were never spoken. But death doesn't distinguish between good and bad.

"It's different, isn't it?", murmured Ginny at his side, her face buried in his shoulder. Harry nods. There was nobody to be angry at... nobody to take revenge on. And he felt utterly helpless. One could not stop death. It was natural. Everybody dies some day and dying peacefully in your bed at old age was better than being murdered... but it didn't hurt any less for those who were left behind.

** "This is kind of like how Voldemort started huh" Harry mused to himself. "Except I'm not being selfish. I'm going to defeat Death... I'll kill the concept of dying if I have to, so no one else has to lose someone they love!" he declared.

*** Voldemort's problem was arrogance. He thought that he was special, that he was the only one who deserved better than "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." And so everyone who understood hated him for it. But there's nothing wrong with thinking you deserve better, so long as you think everyone else does too.

** Natural Disasters are never really addressed in the books afaik.

But I would imagine that it would be pretty easy to defend against them.

Any natural disaster you can think of, either the magic users would already be protected against, or could easily protect themselves during the heat of the moment.

The buildings won't collapse because magic can hold them up. They won't flood because magic can keep the water out. They won't catch on fire because, again, magic can keep the fire out.

The only "natural disaster" kind of thing that seems to affect magic users are magic illnesses, like dragon pox (that is mentioned some times).
