** It depends entirely on what the newcomer likes. Comedy? Romance? Drama? Adventure? What are the newcomer's favorite characters?

** 1. Something by Northumbrian ... well written, canonical, pretty close in style to JKR. Most likely “Tales of the Battle” linkao3(1615616), that looks like a good start.
2. There are some others, mostly post-war stories, they feel like a good continuation for somebody who finished reading the books. “[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War by Mrs_Granger]]”, linkao3(1615616), or something of that sort.

** A Cadamean(I defiantly spelled that wrong) victory.

Or Noodlehammer's Harry Potter fic

Both are long, and have Hp fic tropes but aren't excessive, so it's a decent introduction.

** For just an intro? I would have no issue with showing my mother linkffn(Cauterize) as a good and short example of what fanfiction can be.

** Kaleidoscopic Grangers ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24597805/chapters/59417392]]) is a blind trans girl harry fic that's a complete retelling of the story. Personally, I think it's written as good as or better than cannon.
