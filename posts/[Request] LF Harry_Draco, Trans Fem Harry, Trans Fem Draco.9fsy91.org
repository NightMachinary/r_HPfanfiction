Hey everyone! I'm new to this subeditor so forgive me if I post anything in the wrong manner.

I'm looking for a few things that I will list here (All LGBT), along with a couple of things I like in the stories.

Harry/Draco - I love reading about harry and Draco falling for each other, especially when other people are slow to accept it. I enjoy it when Draco becomes a better person and when Draco becomes a worst person

....I think my ideal fanfic would be one where Harry is raised by Sirius, sorted to slytherin and falls for Draco, but I'd never hope for something so specific = P

​

Trans Harry/Trans Draco - I love stories where Harry, Draco or both are struggling with their gender identity , I'm trans myself so it's easy for me to see how repressing their gender identity could fit with the characters, in particular Draco, though from what I've seen Trans Fem Draco isn't popular =P I'm okay with Male Harry falling for Fem draco, Male Draco Fem Harry or Fem Harry falling for Fem Draco with these fics. I'm also happy to read Trans fics where Harry/Draco isn't the pairing.

​

No idea why I love the Draco/Harry pairings so much, I guess because they are both passionate people and I like to see people headbutt before falling in love.

I also prefer fics where they are still in school or 8th year fics, but I'm not picky on that.


** I think you're getting some negative response because finding Harry/Draco fics isn't exactly difficult.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10&c1=1&c2=6&_c1=3][This search]], for example, has almost 40,000 stories.

On the Trans/Trans parameters, I think I've seen one on [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=kudos_count&include_work_search%5Brelationship_ids%5D%5B%5D=99&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&exclude_work_search%5Brelationship_ids%5D%5B%5D=1600&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=trans&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=1&commit=Sort+and+Filter&tag_id=Harry+Potter+-+J*d*+K*d*+Rowling][AO3]] or possibly [[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/daily_deviant/tag/character:+draco][DailyDeviant]]. You might try there.

*** Thanks so much, I knew it wasn't difficult to find, the problem I had was when i search there were so many. I was hoping for some recommendations.

​

Thanks so much for your advice, I didn't know about a couple of those websites. =)

** I do have a genderqueer Teddy fic if you're interested - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/285360?view_adult=true][Being Liquid]] was incredibly well done. I also have a Trans Remus fic - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9599910/1/TransFigured][TransFigured]].

I have plenty of Draco/Harry fics! They're my favorite paring. Hopefully you like some of these choices - I tried to find as many 8th year fics that I could: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/319257/chapters/513333][At Your Service]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/876138][Denouement]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12778137/chapters/29156937][Changing Tides]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12922518/chapters/29528763][Things Worth Knowing]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966/chapters/2100285?view_adult=true][Azoth]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13079685/chapters/29921697][You Cannot Save People, Only Love Them]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5974362/chapters/13729425?view_adult=true][And the Sun Burned Through]] and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/rhysenn/IP01.html][Irresistible Posion]].

You can also crosspost on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/][HPSlashFic]] - they might be able to recommend a wider variety of fics to fit your request. :)
