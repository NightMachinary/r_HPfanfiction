If the Secret Keeper dies, anyone who knows the Secret can start passing it on.

Thus, if someone else killed Peter, they could then tell Voldemort the Potters' location. And depending on how the Fidelius charm works (ie do people realize when the Secret Keeper dies), they might just assume that Peter betrayed them even if he didn't.

Also this isn't canon but if there was some way to magically mimic the death and cause the Fidelius to drop without the Secret Keeper dying, that could be used for some additional believed betrayal angst.


** the thing is everyone would know peter was dead

as sirius would realise, hey I can speak the address

** It's implied that not even Dumbledore knew about the switch. It was only Sirius, the Potters, Peter and Bathilda. So regardless, anyone could be a suspect. Also the fact that all those who knew the secret become secret keepers once the original secret keeper dies seems like a major flaw of the charm. I liked NoahPhantom's take on it in his Albus Potter series where the secret was basically erased from existence and was buried deeply in the soul of the secret keeper. Also the secret keeper had to give it willingly. Nothing would come out of their mouth if they tried to say it under torture or trickery.

*** So when the original secret keeper dies the charm ends, but it doesn't reinstate the secret from where it was erased. It just becomes a regular piece of knowledge that can be told by any person who had become aware of the secret. Perhaps there is a separate part of the charm that keeps the location hidden to those that don't know where it is, and that doesn't break when the other does.

That's canon. Death Eaters always showed up in front of Grimauld Place while Harry was there in DH but they couldn't see it, nor could they see the trio (or Lupin) when they appeared on the front step. It only became a problem when Hermione accidentally brought Yaxley over after the MoM infiltration.

** It's very incomplete, sadly, but I think you'll find the beginnings of linkffn(The Forsaken Fidelius) to be quite on-point. It appears to be canon-compliant /and/ has a non-villainous Peter.

  Peter would die to protect James and Lily. But Lord Voldemort won't make the choice that easy for him.
