*** Every now and then I drop in on the asoiaf community to see what utterly insane theory is currently flavour of the month. I couldn't live there though, I think after a certain amount of time you stop seeing the absurdity and start to honestly think 'No, you know what, Hodor totally /could/ be a secret targ.'

**** I'm a huge ASOIAF fan, don't get me wrong - I wrote a paper on it for crying out loud - but I cannot handle the fan theories.

R+L=J is as far as I'll go and I personally think it's too perfect to be true. Every time Martin hints at something the opposite happens, so meh on that one.

Then A+J=T happened, and that was a crack theory at first (I think?) that somehow turned into a massive circle jerk.

And now I'm done with ASOIAF fan theories because I just can't. They get so ridiculous that it puts anything the HP fandom comes up with to shame.

***** Oh, thank god. When I go onto that forum and read those theories (A+J=T in particular) I start to question my own sanity.

I'm unspeakably grateful that at least one person is with me in this.

***** R+L=J atleast has many hints. You can actually argue about this theory as you have canon ground for it. Many other theorys are sole based on a single sentences if even.

****** Yeah, I'm not contesting that the hints are there for R+L=J. I can see the reasons for it seeming true, I just personally think that it's too perfect for it to be a GRRM^{TM} subplot. But I can acknowledge it as a viable theory.

Meanwhile, some of the others really do read like a crackfic.

**** I haven't been on there much lately, but I'll crawl back there once the sixth one comes out. There's some pretty crazy stuff and I can tell you that after a while, you start to believe some of it.

** These "clues" do an equally good job of proving that the fanon idea of Draco as a homoerotic sex god is canon. To wit:

1. Harry Potter could have bitten him. They both lived in the same boarding school.
2. No proof he's had sex with a lady.
3. Voldemort asks him to "babysit the cubs", which would only make sense if Draco is a bear.
4. Draco isn't treated like a Death Eater, and most Death Eaters appear to be heterosexual.
5. Hermione is pretty much never wrong. I'm not sure what this has to do with either theory, but I'll take it as read.
6. Draco wouldn't reveal his secret, except to 14-year-old girls who are super into it.

** It has all the signs of a good crackpot theory:

- Absence of traditional logic.

- Absence of proof is proof of /anything!/

- 'Voldermort'

- If Chewbacca lives on Endor, you must acquit.

And, finally, 53% of readers agree with them. The people have spoken!
