** No fic, sorry, but can we just talk about how amazing Changeling was??? I swear to god that's the best fanfic I've read in my life, it's better than most books I've read. It was stunning, I read it all in like 6 hours, and in the end I cried my eyes out for an hour.

** Just about to start the second sequel, am mid-binge and loving it.

I think that You'll be the Death of Me linkffn(9738656) is the most similar in terms of theme and quality, but is more NSFW (if you are likely to read fanfiction aloud at work).

  AU. OC: Graces Malfoy, Draco's twin sister. Neville, with his usual bad luck, ends up partners with Graces Malfoy for Herbology, just after landing her father in Azkaban, after the Ministry ordeal. Will this partnership prove to be as awful as it sounds? 6th year. Rated M for sexual content.

** If you're looking for slowburn romance and Ginny coming into her own, I highly recommend linkffn(the yellow submarine by deadwoodpecker). It's got some pretty intense trigger warnings though.

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.
