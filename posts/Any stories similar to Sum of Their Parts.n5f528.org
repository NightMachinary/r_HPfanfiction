I'm looking for any story where Harry goes against the ministry because of corruption and its unwillingness to change. He doesn't have to be a dark lord I just want to see him lead a revolution of some sort against them. Over 80k words or completed works only.


** Made of Common Clay is similar - tries to change things, ends up being perceived as a dark lord in order to /force/ that change.

  Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.
