I probably didn't post correctly. I'm looking for a fiction where Harry and Hermione are head boy and girl, but Harry has lost his memory.

Ginny sorta tries to get in between them because of this and fails, IIRC.

The only other thing I can really remember is Harry gave Hermione an otter necklace, again IIRC.

Help?


** I think I've read that one. Is it this one?

*** Dude we read fanfiction.

Not only that, there exists within hpfanficdom a sub-genre dedicated to male pregnancy. It's so common it has its own standardized abbreviation: *mpreg*.

And a story involving /memory loss/ is where you draw the line?

**** oh god i'd forgotten about mpreg XD

How does it even work anyway? Like i haven't read many mpreg fics, but in the 2 or 3 that i accidentally read they never really explain it XD

***** Judging from the story summaries I've seen potion accidents?

What's always confused me about it most is /why/ that "plot" was used in the first place. Stories exist to explain (Thor and Thunder), reinforce or retell an underlying mythos (Good/Evil wins, Bildungsroman), or to entertain (Shallow aren't we, wish-fulfillment, Crackfic)

One or two I could see as an experiment. New perspectives and fresh insights can be found in subverting typical forms.

But there are so damn many of them! The only thing I can come up with is sexual -- either gratification or an exploration of gender, homosexuality, and/or pregnancy. It permits the author to maintain a male/masculine character and still integrate female/feminine "traits", physiologies, and gender roles.

Although frankly if that's what the author is attempting, they should go read Eugenides' /Middlesex/ among other works.

***** Harry Potter has the advantage of explaining it away with magic. In other fandoms they don't have that luxury, but they don't care and have mpreg anyway...
