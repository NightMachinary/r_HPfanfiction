Hagrid has a Cerberus that he considers cuddly. Hagrid has a bigger than Car sized Pet Spider with an entire army of Spiders who he'd make a good snack for but they wouldn't harm him. It could get crazier. Hagrid has Conqueror's Haki, and he's unconsciously taming every animal he meets. "Harry, meet Purr, he's mah Nundu. Isn't he the cutest" could totally happen.

Hagrid instead of giving Dudley a Pig Tail, when he gets angry, the Dursleys pass out. as he used the other part of Conqueror's Haki.


** Interesting but Hagrid does not have the typical stereotype characteristic of a person who has conqueror's haki. It would be a nice kind of crack fic to laugh about though. I actually really like the idea in my opinion contrary to what I said earlier.
