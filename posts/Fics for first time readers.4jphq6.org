I want to introduce some of my friends/teachers to fanfiction (esp. because I'm doing a research paper on fanfiction later this year) so I was wondering which fics are the best for introducing fanfiction to people?


** Have they read the series? If so, then any of: linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian), linkffn(The Golden Age by Arsinoe de Blassenville), or linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity) would be great entry-points into the fandom. All are high-quality, post-Hogwarts continuation fics that would be easy to read.

I'd also suggest linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle by Inverarity), which has many novel ideas for the Harry Potter universe, yet is canon compliant and won't grind gears.

Of course, getting your friends to read novels for a study might be a bit tough. A quality one-shot might be in order. Perhaps linkffn(Dark Marauder by BajaB), linkffn(Cauterize by Lady Altair), linkffn(The Twine Bracelet by CheddarTrek), or the impossibly awesome linkffn(India by Perspicacity). (I kid.)

** I would probably start off with well written, canon-compliant oneshots, such as linkffn(Cauterize; Out of the Fire and Into the Cupboard; The Wendell that Wasn't; The Last Straw - Oneshot)

Then, I would go for oneshots that show a twist, an element of AU: linkffn(Geminio; Yes, Minister; The Greatest Minister of Magic)

From there, I would recommend stories that diverge from canon, such as linkffn(Forging the Sword; On the Way to Greatness) although it might be better with complete fics at first.

By this point, I would also start introducing some common tropes, such as time/dimension travel, dark!Harry, and so forth.

Finally, I would recommend slight AU fics, such as linkffn(An Unfound Door) and then later, full AU stories like linkffn(The Skitterleap; Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic I)

Generally, I would advise against linking smut, at least at the beginning, since fanfiction generally has a bad stigma. I would also recommend against shipping stories and EWE at the beginning, as that may turn off readers who really enjoyed the canon.

TL;DR: Start off with canon-compliant short stories and progressively introduce more aspects of fanfiction with well-written stories.

** Start with canon compliant fics.

The first HP fanfic I read was *Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince*, linkffn(5677867), a wonderful year 6 story from Ginny's POV.

[[/u/FloreatCastellum]] writes great canon compliant fanfictions: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum]] *Not From Others*, linkffn(11419408) is imho the best year 7 Hogwarts fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]'s excellent 83 story series is mostly focused on postwar. I like these two from him the best: *Grave Days*, linkffn(5486257 ), is about what happened immediately after the Battle. *Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126 ), is about Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2010

--------------

My personal preference leans more toward AU (Alternate Universe) though because there are simply more options and possibilities available:

Want a good laugh? Try *Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106), where Harrymort finally got his long sought DADA position in the most hilarious fashion. You especially don't want to miss out the Chamber and Graveyard scenes.

Like time travels? Try *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), where Harry got thrown back to 1975 and had to team up with Bellatrix. The first half of the story involved lots of actions with the Marauders, and the second half saw what a sane, non-evil Bellatrix could accomplish.

Not satisfied with the Epilogue or curious about what could have been after Voldemort's fall? Try *The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), where the Ministry kept sucking up to pureblood extremists after Voldemort, and how Harry and his friends decided to fight back. This story is brilliantly written, and I so enjoyed the Trio relationship.

Right now there is a new, very promising fic called *Divided and Entwined*, linkffn(11910994). It's set after Voldemort's return in year 4. But instead of ignoring his return, the Ministry chose to appease Voldemort by passing discriminatory pro-pureblood laws and increasing Muggleborn persecutions. Hermione quickly saw chilling parallels to 1930s Nazi Germany, and began preparing. The story feels brutal, grim, and realistic, as things about an underground resistance should be. It's still in early stage, and the author will update it every Saturday.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I'd say it's definitely going to hinge at least somewhat on individual reading preferences, and how old your friends are. Because that can change your recommendation from 'sweet, fluffy one-shot' to 'serious, novel-length piece'. Shipping pieces may be offputting to some, especially if said stories lack proper justification for doing so, (e.g. 'random AU where <Slytherin Girl> coincidentally moves next door to Harry #557'). That said, there are some excellent shipping stories out there. It all depends on your audience, really. My recs, should I make them, would likely be coloured by my own preferences for long, serious femslash, so I'll try to avoid that unless you want examples of LGBTQ stuff?

With that bias in mind, I'd recommend linkffn(9238861) for the latter, as an unabashed Hermione lover. It's solidly written, has no random shipping thrown in (shipping for its own sake - a romantic plot tumour, if you will), and tries to tackle some of the core conceits of canon in a believable way.

For the love of god, don't recommend anything by Robst, no matter how popular the man's stories are. Those things would get ripped apart by anyone with a functioning idea of literary critique.

** I'd go with something that is canon and post DH but before the epilogue, also complete if possible. If they are into harry potter at all this will probably catch their attention better then some kind of intense AU where harry is a wheel of cheese and Hogwarts is a grocery store or something... I'd probably read that. Anyway that was a bit of an extreme example but I think I made my point, for beginners you want to ease them into it, give them something they expect and doesn't freak them out to much.

I'd suggest linkffn(The First Day by little0bird)

Or something like that, that one might be a little emotional in the first dozen chapters or so for a beginner and it isn't complete haha but it's a good one.
