by Post-DH i mean quite literally after the battle of hogwarts to say the least, not years after where the characters are already full grown adults with jobs. preferably where the story just focuses purely(if not mostly) on the romance and almost nothing else(dark lords, escaped death eaters etc) oh don't forget some smuts/lemons is kinda a must for me.


** Eeeeh, if you're willing to deviate from some of your criteria (which I find is generally the case if you want something worth reading), you might want to have a look at linkffn(Came back Late). The romance is there, but isn't not dominant, and there's plenty of political intrigue.

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?
