#+begin_quote
  Follow Rodrick, grandson of Gellert Grindelwald, as he struggles with his own identity in a world both magical and dangerous. Will he ever be able to step out of his grandfather's shadow? Maybe if nobody finds out his family name in the first place. Of course, things don't always go to plan... Disclaimer: J.K Rowling owns Harry Potter. Credit to Episoph for the summary.

**** Why doesn't your main character have a last name in the first chapter? Everyone in the modern western world has a last name, even if it's given by the state to a ward. This does not compute.

I skimmed to chapter 3 and he still doesn't have a last name. WHY? This doesn't make sense. Is it explained in the text?

****** I read Chapter 25 and it still problematic because he should still have a last name as an orphan provided to him by the British Government. At least I think he should, even if they just slap "Foster" or the British equivalent of "Smith".

If he was in a Magic Orphanage and I missed that it could be an explanation. I could be wrong about that but I found the lack of name jarring to say the least.

******** Yeah, I'm going to give this story a pass. It STILL doesn't make sense since his Hogwart's letter should have been addressed to him. He should have a last name. If you had just had him referred to as "Foster" or "Smith" or anything and said it was a name given by the state so not his real name everything would be fine, but instead he's the only person without a last name because of reasons that don't make sense.

Best of luck with your writing.

** 100% the actual character.

In HP fanfiction I come for the characters of the Harry Potter universe. For an OC protagonist to catch my attention they need to be extraordinarily interesting.

Which is also probably why I have never seen an OC prota in HP fanfiction that I spent more than two chapters with.

** With OC-focused fanfiction, I look for two main things early on:

- How compelling is the premise?

a.k.a. Why use an OC? The greatest strength of writing OC based fanfiction is that it allows you to explore character-types and aspects of the world that couldn't be easily explored with the canon characters. If you're going to take your OC and just cover the same ground as the source material, what's the point? So the use of OC has to be justified in some way and not just a lazy self insert.

- How strong are the character introductions / early characterisation?

Without canon characterisation to act as a crutch, my enjoyment is /much/ more reliant on the author's ability to create interesting and/or likeable characters and keep them consistently in character. So I put a lot of weight on how the author introduces the characters, and how well their personalities and motivations are established in the first couple of chapters. I don't need the introduction to be epic, or even super memorable, as long as I'm convinced the author know's how to write compelling original characters, and I have a solid gauge as to what these characters will be like.

** The OC has to have a reason for existing. Like, it's one thing if it's just a background character like a teacher. But if Harry suddenly has a brand new OC friend that exists just to take some of the shine off of him, then I start to lose interest.

The bar for an OC is very high. Like, if they're not on Meciel, Nathan Cassane, or Kwan Li levels, the author is going to have to work extra hard to make them compelling. They all have something about them that make them interesting.

** Have a good entrance of the OC! I don't really care about your cool exposition on why this guy/gal is totally awesome. Write a memorable scene to introduce them. If they have interesting character traits write scenes that exploit and show them. Think along the lines of the first train ride in philosopher's stone. In particular the introduction of Draco and Hermione. It's brilliantly done. There's no heavy handed narrator explaining to us that Draco is a snob or Hermione an over-achiever, it just flows naturally.

** While I don't mind a good placed OC character in a minor role I avoid all stories with an OC main character, the same goes for Crossovers. I read fics about this universe because I want to read about the characters in this universe. I usually don't even read fics when the locations are outside Britan. And no, I'm not British.
