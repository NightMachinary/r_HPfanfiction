** Tbh the most unique thing would be if you could find one where they're just powerful magic artifacts, perhaps symbolic of death, but don't give Harry superpowers.

*** Or, better yet, the Hallows are evil. Not just powerful or unique, but just holding them corrupts the person into /believing/ they are the master of death.

Insanity is the bedrock of brilliance after all.

**** No, there a lot of fics that take it literally, where it gives him godlike powers, immortality, supermagic, time travel abilities, etc. That seems to be what generally gets associated with "Master of Death" Harry in particular. It's far less common to see an MoD story that either treats the artifacts as just that or mimics Harry's journey into accepting death.

A lot of people also (mis)interpret canon to mean that Harry survived Voldemort's second killing curse because he had the Hallows- my interpretation is that it's largely due to Voldemort using Harry's blood for the ritual, and maybe the existence of the Horcrux/Harry's willing sacrifice. Harry being the master of the Elder Wand allows him to defeat Voldemort at the end of book 7, but his revival specifically doesn't have anything to do with the Hallows. I like Dumbledore's explanation that the Hallows were merely powerful magical artifacts created by three talented wizards. I think a lot of people/fanfics either misintepret canon or actively choose to go in a different direction by making the Hallows Harry's route to immortality.

***** I mean that's kind of the whole point of having a Master of Death fic, the idea that there's something special about it.

I could see one being written about this though

  Harry's journey into accepting death.

If you have a fic where the Hallows are merely powerful artifacts, then it's just like canon and most fanfics. The vast majority of fics feature 'mundane' Hallows, following how they were in canon. It's just that they don't present themselves as MoD fics. So I don't really see how it would be unique - pick any fic at random and chances are that that's what you'll get.

  A mistake by a dying man drives Hermione to obsession as she seeks to unlock the secrets of the Deathly Hallows. Harry, wanting only peace, tries to rid himself of the taint of death. Two friends clash in a tragic struggle for identity and destiny.
