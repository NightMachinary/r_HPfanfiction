I'm looking for epic romances, preferably completed but consistently updating could work. Hermione is my favourite character and I don't mind slash or threesomes. Likes: HG/HP(as long as it's not a Lord-Harry-better-than-everyone-else), HG/LM, HG/SB, HG/RL,HG/JP, HG/SS, HG/DM, HG/any Weasley other than Ron, SB/RL. Dislikes: HP/GW, HP/FD, HP/DG, HP/DM, HP/SS I like angst, sometimes tragedy and slowburn. I've been reading fanfic for several years and I feel like I've read everything. So, any recs that are new to me would be awesome! Thanks very much.

I'm cool with trying any pairing not listed here.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/Here-And-There][Here and There]], linkffn(7525570), is a great Hermione/Ginny romance and shows how time turner travel should be done (unlike that abomination known as TCC). I especially like how others reacted to their relationship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028), is a great Hermione/Bellatrix romance in a Voldemort free AU. The main plot goes through 4 crime mysteries.

--------------

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), is my top H/Hr fic, even if they didn't get 'officially' together by the end. This fic is very emotional.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059), is a beautiful and refreshing time travel that doesn't focus on fighting Voldemort, but on how Hermione helped Harry to rebuild his 2nd life.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542), involves excellent world building. Dumbledore and Hermione kicked asses here, but opposing them was an utterly terrifying Voldemort. The final battle is one of the best I've ever read.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.
