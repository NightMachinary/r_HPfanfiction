** Imma be real with you chief, I didn't even know that one of those existed, besides the one where the summary is like, "he is not the boy who lived, he isn't neglected, and he isn't abused, so why is he going dark," or something like that. Been a minute since I saw it.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
