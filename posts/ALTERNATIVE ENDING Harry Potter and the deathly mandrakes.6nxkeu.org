After rereading COS I paid closer attention to the lines where Pomona Sprout ( herbology teacher ) talks about mandrakes.

" Hermione's hand narrowly missed Harry's glasses as it shot up again.

'The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,' she said promptly.

'Precisely. Take another ten points,' said Professor Sprout. "

Couldn't Harry have killed Voldemort with a mandrake? That would have made for a much faster ending, and all the trouble Harry, Ron and literally anyone against the dark lord went through wouldn't have happened. Plus imagine how hilariously heroic the scene would have looked like.

" Ron's trembling hand went once again touching his ears to make sure the earmuffs were fitting, but his jitteriness was nothing compared to the girl standing to his side. Hermione in fact, in the past minute had dropped her want about a hundred times due to the amount of sweat her hands where producing. It was around 9pm when smoke shining different hues of green started lighting up the cloudy skies in the horizon. Harry Turned to professor Sprout and in a feeble voice said 'They are coming, tell everyone to get ready'. Pomona sped through the orderly placed rows of students accidentaly knocking wands off of some hufflepuffs' hands. As she reached out of the crowd she screamed 'I'm going to seal everyones earmuffs: make sure your hands are not touching your head if you dont want to get a few fingers chopped off. After I do so wait for prefessor Dumbledore's signal before extracting the mandrakes from the pots. I wish you all best of luck and try not to die please.' Everyone was standing still. Professor Sprout took out her wand that Harry had never had the chance to see in use. As soon as she started mumbling flicking and swishing around everything wend dead silent. Harry could still see Professor Sprout's lips moving but not a single letter could be heard. After she was done Professor Dumbledore brought his hands up in the air and a fire above the students started shining in different shadows of Purple. Four tongues of flames flied around over and under the clouds forming what later became clear as Hogwart's emblem, representing in shining glory the four houses of the wizardry school. Ron shouted in Harry's ear 'Well that's a signal!', but as he did so he realized that Harry wouldn't have been able to hear him and turned to the other side and facepalmed himself. From the fog in front of Harry the silhouette of Voldemort became clear and everyone grabbed the leaves appearing from the soil in the vases rignt in front of them. Behind voldemort stood the person Harry would have never thought he'd see. Holding a twelve inches oak unicorn hair wand was none other than Uncle Vernon, wearing a glittery pink coat. However before Harry could think of anything Hermione's hand hit his shoulder and he realized he was the only one who was not holding a mandrake in his hand. As he turned around to grab his, the earth under his feet started trebling and Voldemort and his followers laid on the ground, dead. The fight was finally over. "

Sorry for this disturbing experience

P.s. dont hate on uncle vernon he was fab in that pink coat


** IIRC, in DH, Hufflepuffs dropped mandrakes on Death Eaters during the Battle of Hogwarts. Presumably, Death Eaters had some countermeasures since they didn't /all/ die.

**** I think they would have to be within the field of effect to be affected. Also, The borg in this story are... very different due to outside factors so mandrakes may be ineffectual.

*** The real question is "Can I transfigure or conjure antimatter".

Although I very much like the way you think.

I wonder how soul- and mind- affecting spells interact with a collective...

**** The first is something I've thought on as well. I decided the tech to MAKE antimatter could be magitek possible but actually transfiguring antimatter from matter would be too dangerous due to a lack of containment as one does so. As for the latter, still debating that due to how I'm changing the collective's abilities due to their assimilating two specific species.

***** :)

BTW, just added your story to my queue. I very much like stories that go magitek.

Out of curiosity, how are you addressing Undetectable Expansion Charms?

From what we see of them in the books and Fantastic Beasts, I think I could fit a space the size of any of the Enterprise's interiors into a very small space, whose external mass is very small... which breaks the rocket equations (which has a far greater effect on reaction-based movement methods)...

****** Lightening spells to counter the added mass. I THINK I mention it in the cargo vessel scenes but if not I'll come back to it(I just started rereading it to prep myself for a hopeful return to working on the story). Tsu Doh Nimh's Havoc Side of the Force has a great scene in regards to modifying the capability of a ship due to magic.

** Well, they could have given tons of them to SNAPE (disillusioned and silenced he could have planted them in the dark lord's headquarters...with a timed spell (or some kind of remote-release-spell) they could have been activated without him being in any danger!), to take the DEs out (might not have worked on Voldemort...or at best he would be disembodied again, but even that would help if he has no more servants left (set them off during a DE-Meeting and give Snape some protection and tell him to RUN, just in case Voldemort isn't incapacitated))

Yeah, I like such solutions because it's thinking outside the box! Most wizards only think of duelling when they think about fighting the dark lord (ok: scratch that, most think about surrendering probably!) directly, instead of trying to outsmart him or using remote methods of fighting (hell: Give Snape a freaking locator beacon to plant (I don't think Voldemort wards against muggle-radio-signals!) and then fire some cruise missiles at that location! Problem solved...for a while, now you can deal with the horcruxes at your leisure without DEs chasing you around and taking over the ministry etc.!)

*** If it came alive (or possessed) somebody like the diary did, then maybe! The container itself would probably not be affected (a horcrux can't hear unless it's possessing somebody or trying to gain a body IMHO, so as long as the horcrux doesn't do either of those things? Nope, I' don't think a mandrake would have any sort of effect!)
