So i was reading Linkffn(30 Minutes That Changed Everything by Radaslab) and i really liked it, it sad that the sequel got cancelled... so im searching for similar fanfics... I'm also into Harry founding a school or a country like in Linkao4(A Place Apart) I've searching for something similar to: Release that witch (this is not a HP fanfic) I just love a good World building and how the actions of Mc affects the other's

  AU. Year 2148: Gobal Population: 1. He made a mistake 150 years ago or so and now the human race no longer exists. For a century or so, he has sought a way to fix it all. Can he, or is the end of the world inevitable?

** Have you tried linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic I by Taure)? It's seemingly abandoned now but the world-building in it is pretty intense. Super AU though.

A little more close to canon storylines but with much more expansive world-building is linkffn(Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man). If you can get used to his writing style, it's a great read with super cool magic developments.

linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches) is an acquired taste imho, but those who love it, really love it. Give it a go if you don't mind a harem story. It's not a smutty or squicky one (yet), so I find it very enjoyable for the moment.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) is a classic one when it comes to building on HP lore and making it bizarre. It's a long read and it's complete - so bonus points for that.

Also the version of Harry created in linkffn(Lie I've Lived by JBern) is super badass. His performance in the Triwizard Tournament is legendary.

  Massively AU. Assume nothing. Harry Potter is born into a very different world than the one in canon. A world where the Greats of history walk among mere men. A world where power is all that matters, and young Harry Potter is a commodity desired by many.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** I am rereading a WIP I like a lot. It's genderbent harry. Not the girl who lived, that's neville longbottom. Has ravenclaw female harry and the story is pretty au and unique. It's also very long (around 700k words and being actively updated)

- fic contains bigger enemies than just voldemort
- smart and gifted femharry
- 4 schools for year 4 tournemant and it's completely overhauled from canon tournements
- gives story arc time to dudley and his friends (won't ruin how)

There is a lot more but too much to list.

It's called the odds were never in my favor
