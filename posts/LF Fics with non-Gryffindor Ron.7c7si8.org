I was reading an old article on Mugglenet today, about whether Ron should have been sorted into another house other than Gryffindor.

And that got me thinking. I've read plenty of fics where Harry and/or Hermione are sorted into other houses, but I don't recall any where Ron is in any house but Gryffindor.

Can anyone suggest any for me to check out?

I don't really have a preference for pairings or genres or anything like that.

Thanks in advance!

That's the first one that comes to my head. Although I know of a fic where an SI in Rons body is sorted into Slytherin with Harry(its a fanfic of a fanfic). This fic:

** linkffn(12141684) its a ron who is reborn in the body of a au ron and he gets sorted into slyherin, its not that great but you may enjoy it. it also hasnt been updated for a couple months.

linkffn(3766574) prince of the dark kingdom mainly focuses on harry in a world where Voldemort took over Britain. Ron gets sorted into slytherin, his personality is also different. Its a good story with great world building and a good premise but sadly its abandoned and ron is a minor/side character

  For a thousand years the Sorting Hat has put students where they fit best. Only a handful of times throughout history has it ever been said the Hat picked wrongly. In the year of 1991, that's the only thing people were saying. On the one-thousandth-and-one year of Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat decided to change things around. Pity it didn't tell anyone beforehand.
