What's a story (the plot doesn't even need to be good) that you've read and thought "damn, this is well-written"? I can't think of a single example right now, and that saddens me somewhat...

No restrictions, throw me anything you got! Right now I really just feel like reading something well done, regardless of plot, characters, pairing, length, etc.


** Linkffn(Prince by SallyJAvery)

A Venetian AU that somehow fits and manages to still make the reader get the Harry Potter vibe. Incredibly well written, I drooled over some of the phrasing.

****** Sure, but you have to remember that children's books are 110,000 words max. Going by that logic, we have over ten books of content already, with the first four chapters at 132,000 words. This length is impressively ridiculous from a publisher's standpoint, and things would have to get changed for the deal to go through.

This would lead to a ton of things getting cut, to the point where Violet would have to rewrite the story and dumb it down. This would probably be a good thing for some of it (it /is/ too long, but I have never minded it), but you would definitely lose /something/ in the translation from fan-fic to a published novel.

I could go on, but you probably get what I'm driving at. Making the chapters smaller would be a band-aid - not a solution which would be remotely acceptable for the average book publisher.

Fanfiction has vastly distorted many readers concepts of word counts in actual books. Publishers won't touch something over 400k usually as it becomes almost impossible to bind. A Dance with Dragons was released as it was because they literally wouldn't have been able to physically publish it with any more content.

Most actual novels are somewhere between 80,000 and 150,000 words. Yet people on fanfiction often want things to be almost comically longer than that.

The longest Harry Potter book is Order of the Phoenix at 257,000 words. It is SIXTY THOUSAND words longer than the next longest one. Deathly Hallows at 198k.

Most general readers of fanfiction that I've encountered have absolutely no idea about word counts. Most publishers will flat out reject anything longer than 250k. And most of the time that's just a sign that the author can't get to the point.

******** To add on to this, there are only a very small amount of HP FanFic writers (which I consider you a part of, TE7), that actually know what they are doing.

This is because most people use fan-fiction as a jumping off point, and it shows. This isn't to say that /The Pureblood Pretense/ is bad, (it's not) but it definitely follows a different standard and there definitely is a different demographic that consumes it. Fan-fiction is just a hobby for nearly everyone, while for a select few it's a passion that is nearly possible to quench. For myself, I'm a huge lover of /What-If?/ scenarios, so fan-fiction is something that continually fascinates me.

Basically, fan-fiction is a whole different breed from regular fiction as a whole. It allows for amazing ideas to properly explored (like identity politics in /TPP/ or the idea of a more focused, saner, and /female/ Voldemort in /Limpieza de Sangre/) but for most fics the extra breathing room encourages bad habits (like the 50,000 word chapters).

TLDR: fan-fiction is fun, but let's not kid ourselves about the quality of it. Almost all of it is terrible save for a select few, and even for the select few most fics need ruthless editing.

****** Yep. First person POV fleshes out and acquaints you with the main character like no other. If done right that is. There are fics that just tells a 1st person story like a 3rd person narration. Like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]]. It's a good story but it could have been so much better if some of the MC's personality colored the narration. As it is, the MC just tells the story like a robot programmed to tell whatever's happening and nothing else.

There are fics though that really uses the strength of first person POV to the fullest. For example in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7217938/1/Etc-Etc-and-Life-Goes-On][Etc Etc --- and Life Goes On]] the main character has this really active mind but has a rather quiet personality. I'm not really into how wacky it is(it's satire) but the story-telling, told by the very eloquent and verbose MC, just makes this so much more enjoyable for me. It would've been bland as hell if it was written in 3rd person.

** linkao3(Third Time's the Charm by steph7of7) is amazing on multiple levels. Post-War Snape Lives fic with impeccable characterization.

linkao3(Snape, Head of Hufflepuff by sheankelor) is funny and heartwarming and not as cracky as it sounds.

linkao3(Power by Jaxon) has chilling and brutal Death Eater Politics, which I love.

linkao3(Picketing For Peace by Chuksha) has the Muggle world actually affecting the Wizarding world realistically, plus some interesting character development for the minor characters.

Finally, With Nothing On My Tongue by ms_anthrop ([[https://snapecase.livejournal.com/50627.html]]) is an amazing music-based fic that made me cry and forever associate Hallelujah with Snape (tho me reading it shortly after the 1-year anniversary of Alan Rickman's death didn't help that association).

  New Death Eater Thorfinn Rowle suspects that Snape is loyal only to those whom he is sleeping with.Unfortunately for Rowle, Snape grew up in a tough 70s working class Muggle community, where being accused of being anything other than heterosexual was an insult of the highest order. Surely Malfoy and Yaxley won't permit Rowle to make such an accusation?Set during OotP.

But when news of the 1984 Miner's Strike, and subsequent sympathy picket in Cokeworth, hit the Daily Prophet front pages he couldn't help himself, even if that meant facing his estranged father.This story was a submission for Age range category 3 (20-30 years old) in the 2018 Snape Showcase over on LJ which has been publishing Snape!centric fics to coincide with Sev's birthday and #SnapeWeek.

And personally I think this story is close to me because I read it after the awkward clusterfuck that was "A Marauder's Plan" (because I was looking specifically for "Harry raised by Sirius" stories) and this is wonderfully written and well plotted in comparison. Besides, semi regular updates FTW!

******* Ill jump in and say your analysis is really well done. However, prettier sentences and an adverb count based on one dude (albeit a phenomenal writer) saying too many adverbs make poor writing does not make a story badly written. In fact I would say that too much dramatic rephrasing and flowery descriptions can, sometimes, take away from the story. This is ESPECIALLY true when you have a story like MOR. The whole thing is so pretentious and "look how smart I am" that the very descriptive writing helps that idea along. A good writer not only has to make a good plot (which MOR doesnt) but know when to write straight forward and when to be descriptive..

In conclusion the writer of HPMOR can write, but the story is so shitty that it doesnt matter.

**** No. It isn't.

The first paragraph of the damn thing is riddled with sentence structure errors. As is pretty much every single paragraph of prose in the thing.

It may well be brimming with interesting and fascinating ideas and executed, from a 'story' perspective, well. But, from a technical writing perspective it is very poor. It would not pass a high school level grammar test. It is not clear from reading it if the author is even aware of such things as fragments or run-ons or has any real understanding of tense and agreement.

****** Ironically, a lot of the dialogue is much better, technically speaking, than the prose. There's odd word choice here or there but nothing overly grating. The longer dialogue starts to suffer from the same problems as the prose.

But the prose is horrible. Literally chapter 5 starts with: "The Moke Shop was a quaint little shop (some might even say cute) ensconced behind a vegetable stall that was behind a magical glove shop that was on an alleyway off of a side street of Diagon alley."

That's it. Verbatium. Not only is that a terrible sentence as a whole because from a plot standpoint it tells you nothing of importance. But, it's also a run-on of epic proportions. And the entire fic is like that.

As [[/u/Lord_Anarchy]] says above. It's more the author being able to sell it than anything technically good. I mean he uses "ensconced" correctly in the sentence I cite. Which is a good word that can certainly be a 'look how big my vocabulary' is even if he didn't just get it from the synonym tab of Word. But at the same time, the sentence itsself is horrible.

I'm not usually one to nitpick. And I've never read more than exerpts from the fic itsself. But, when I can open up any chapter, go to nearly any paragraph, and find multiple issues in sentence structure, it's not well written. At least, from a grammar standpoint.

******* 1) No one in their right mind would publish HPMOR anywhere other than Kindle for 99 cents.

2) TE7s writing is amazing. It isnt Tolkien or Shakespeare. But what it is is telling you the story very clearly, cleanly, and in the best way possible. His true strength however is in his perspective based storytelling. You havent read the story so you dont know just how well he uses the writing as a way to tell the characters perspective and use this to create his plot. And thats just my biggest compliment for it. Writing is more than using big words and showing off your vocabulary and knowledge.

  She always had a soft spot for kids; the ones in this life definitely deserve better. The wizarding world needs a superhero anyway: a Wonder Woman who can talk to animals, breathe underwater, has a secret cave, and dreams up someone else's memories. The inglorious kind.
