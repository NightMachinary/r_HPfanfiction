  Sequel to Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them! Harry is captured by wizards and brought to a castle. The wizards are obnoxious, but there's a lovely wood nearby which is quaintly named the "Forbidden" Forest. Harry thinks that's adorable.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** So excited to see the author active again! He/she updated Magical Relations twice pretty recently, and it had been on a pretty long hiatus before that!

** Woooooooo! You have no idea how much I love that series. I've read it so many times, and I've recommended it to countless people.

I actually haven't read the update yet, because I think I'm going to go back and reread it all first, but I'm ecstatic to know the fic's actually complete now.
