Are there any fics out there where Regulus survives and basically takes Snape's place as professor and/or spy? Thanks in advance!


** Linkao3(He Comes Out of the Black Lake Quite Mad ) Regulus doesn't take Snape's place but he is a professor.

  Regulus Black comes out of the black lake quite mad, very much his mother's son. Hogwarts will keep him safe, says Dumbledore, who offers him the post of Charms professor.But Regulus hasn't stopped drowning (lungs saturated with water, mind torn apart) and the face of Harry Potter, who looks too much like James, makes him realize the war is never over.

** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25404448/chapters/61607203]])

It's ok, but personally I feel there are character personality changes that aren't great

  This is an alternate timeline in which Regulus survived The Cave and brings the locket to Dumbledore in hopes of destroying it. He, instead of Snape, becomes Potions Master after the fall of Voldemort. Like Snape he begins as an untrustworthy character, but over time becomes a more trusted ally.I'm rating it 'General' because there's nothing that I'll include that would be out of place in Rowling's original work.

** I know a few Professor Regulus but I know none where he takes Snape's role.

But in this Not!Fic Snape isn't a teacher. Plus, it's fun to skim through.

  What if Regulus Black, and not Severus Snape, ended up being the turncoat Potions Master of Hogwarts? A not!fic written in bullet points, ignoring the Deathly Hallows entirely because they annoy me. Beta by my immensely patient Best Beloved, Turn_of_the_Sonic_Screw, and by the delightful starbirdrampant.

  Regulus agrees to be a spy for the Order of the Phoenix shortly before Voldemort's downfall. Thirteen years later, he's a reluctant potions master under the watchful eye of Albus Dumbledore, just trying to get through his days without cursing the meddling Headmaster. Now Regulus's estranged brother has escaped from Azkaban, and Dumbledore has had the grand idea to invite Sirius's pet werewolf to teach at the school.

** I have read a fanfic on Wattpad where Regulus takes Severus's place as a professor after being saved by Kreature. Each chapter is a school year. Any who, it's called *R.A.B. Chronicles*

It's currently on-going but it is still very enjoyable
