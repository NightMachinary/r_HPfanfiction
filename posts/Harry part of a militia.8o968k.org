I remember reading a fanfiction in which Harry and a bunch of young people were drafted into a militia by the Ministry. they were given tattoos in order to control them, however a lot of people would get aa hydra tattoos on top to disguise it. If I remember correctly Harry is in a squad with a female vampire, Astoria Greengrass and some others. The main plot is that Harry is called to another world by Dumbles and co. There Voldemort has not been defeated and the whole boy-who-lived thing is slightly altered. Anyway if anybody remembers which fanfiction it is then could you please, you know, tell me. However it is NOT 0800- rent a hero so no point in linking that one. Thanks
