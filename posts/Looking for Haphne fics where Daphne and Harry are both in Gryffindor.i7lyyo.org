There's probably a lot of Haphne stories where Harry is sorted into Slytherin. Are there any stories where Daphne is sorted into Gryffindor with Harry? I'm not too picky on length, but at least 1,000 words would be preferable.

Feel free to use this as a prompt in the comments as well!


** I know I have seen one unfinished Harry/Daphne work that had her headed towards Slytherin until she meets Harry on the train and realizes that her new friend will /not/ survive there and asks to be sorted elsewhere. Tracy gets upset with her for her "betrayal." I cannot remember what it was called though.

** Daphne's canon characterization:

- Female
- Slytherin
- Not part of young wannabe terrorists posse
- Sister marries wannabe terrorist

Since she is basically an unremarked Slytherin, I am not sure how you remove that and keep anything beyond the name. Maybe if you were going for a Daphne/Astoria where their path mirrors Sirius/Reg?

*** Yeah, I'm thinking of Daphne along the lines of a mix of Sirius and Regulus. Not disobedient to her parents at the start (so, not quite the level of Sirius), but realizes that being a pureblood supremacist isn't good a lot sooner than Regulus realizes. I'm thinking that she wouldn't like where she was sorted at first. I don't see her getting along with Hermione at the start, but she later comes to respect her and other muggleborns.
