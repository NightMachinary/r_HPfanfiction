This is a bit from partway through the final fight between Harry, Dumbledore and Voldemort. I'm not 100% sure WHY Harry's not siding with either of them and instead represents his own faction yet, as I just wrote the scene and will figure out the whys later. Also the shield glasses mentioned in the scene are designed to block legilimency (I imagine they took several years to develop). I'm also not sure what rituals Harry did, but at least one to allow him either the ability to force magic through his muscles to strengthen/control them or one that boosts the ability.

Harry ran on autopilot, not thinking, just casting. The target of his spells shifted with the battle. One minute both Voldemort and Dumbledore would focus on him, until his defense left one open for attack, and then the spells flew toward Dumbledore or Voldemort until they focused on him again.

He was pleased that Dumbledore no longer had time to express any remorse for his choices in life and Voldemort had yet to get a chance to taunt him for his "inevitable failure". But he had no time either, barely had time to breathe and even then occasionally he had to resort to silent casting until he could magically force air into his spasming, hyperventilating lungs.

He hadn't stopped moving since the battle began, the rituals all he had left to keep him standing. He couldn't afford to slow down, not until they did. Calling down a crack of lightning to char one of Voldemort's summons, he flung his shield up just in time to intercept a barrage of explosive hexes then forced up a wall of stone to block spears of silver crackling with energy. He grit his teeth. They were focusing on him again. A tornado of freezing wind curved around his wall and he frantically conjured a counter-gust to push it toward Dumbledore, hissing when the chill froze his hand to his wand. As soon as the tornado was out of reach he began healing his frozen fingers, groaning at the burning sensations.

In the time it took him to regain use of his hand, Voldemort had destroyed another handful of Dumbledore's creatures though he lost just as many. The earth itself was burning between them, a battle of fire and will.

Above them, clouds almost black with rain let loose a torrent of water, doing nothing to douse the magical flame but creating a blanket of steam. The air itself was charged with magic, wind swirling and howling faster and louder with each spell cast. Beneath their feet, the ground shook and rumbled. Lightning flashed across the sky and thunder threatened to deafen them.

The focus returned to him, possibly because they thought the rain would blind him. He twisted lightning into the paths of their spells, curling it and hurling them back surrounded by electricity. Both dodged and he cursed internally, jabbing his wand at Voldemort. A cone of wind tore the dirt and grass up around him, sweeping up some of the fire and igniting into a gust of flaming air. Dumbledore refocused on Voldemort, allowing Harry to draw a vial from his pocket. He tossed the vial toward his enemies, blasting it apart in mid-air. The expanded space within collapsed with a shockwave that flung all three of them back, the lake's worth of water within crushing the remaining summons and threatening to drown anyone caught in the flood, ripping up trees with ease.

Harry himself had unshrunk a broom and flew above the rushing water not a second too soon, not slowing down lest either enemy get him with a surprise attack. On his left, a broken and bloodied Voldemort shot from the water on a trail of smoke and immediately they began to duel. Harry was flinging and blocking spells almost faster than his mouth could keep up, and it was only his shield glasses that kept him in the game, though he could do nothing to prevent Voldemort from slowly beginning to heal.

Being able to look Voldemort in the eye also gave him the split second warning as Voldemort's eyes widened and glanced behind him. He dove downwards even as he rolled the broom, just barely dodging the golden spike that whistled past. He risked a look and saw an equally injured Dumbledore standing on a cushion of air above the water.

Though he hadn't expected the trick to actually kill either of them, it was still annoying. Harry used the seconds the two spent focused on each other to draw as much of the water up into the clouds as possible, saturating the air with the rest. Hopefully this would dampen a good portion of their abilities with fire, as he was no match there.


** I'm sure with more context as too why they're all fighting each other, I would absolutely love it. It's way better than a standard HP fight scene in this fandom, where it's a bunch of screaming incantations and hardly any real action.

*** Thanks! I don't know much about the context either. All I know is while they fight, their armies are fighting somewhere else (where, I don't know)
