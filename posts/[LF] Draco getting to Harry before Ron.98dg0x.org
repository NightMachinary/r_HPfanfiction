Have you got any decent fics where Harry ends up actually hanging out with Draco, and his family, before Ron puts prejudices in his head.. Preferably no slash, at least in the main pairings..


** Hang on, Draco /does/ get to Harry before Ron does, weeks before. He meets Harry at the clothes shop, and makes a /thunderingly/ bad impression.

***** "What house are your brothers in?" asked Harry. "Gryffindor," said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. "Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw /would/ be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin." "That's the house Vol--, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?" "Yeah," said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.

Everyone had a pretty good reason not to like Slytherin. Even Snape, the sole heroic Slytherin, is an unrepentant asshole who abuses children for shits and giggles.

***** Yeah, to be honest, this is kind of a weak point in the series for me, and something I think JKR has kind of realized after the fact. Slytherin is pretty much the evil house, with the occasional benign person from it.

****** I honestly think it makes sense

voldemort was a slytherin, so his first followers where all slytherins there children also followed him as well

creating this bad reputation for slytherin, as voldemort gained more power and the first stages of the first war happened the house of slytherin would have found itself isolated and alone so as a slytherin your only source of friends would be the children of death eaters and then you just fall into the crowd

By harrys time its been three generation of the worst parts of slytherin in charge

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
