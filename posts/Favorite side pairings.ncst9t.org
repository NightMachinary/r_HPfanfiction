What are your favorite side pairings in fanfic? Such as Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, or something more like Luna/Pansy. This can also be a “who do you think the characters should have ended up with if not each other” thread, but for every character as opposed to just the main ones you read for.


** Romione is useful for slash. They can just go off and do their own thing whenever Harry is trying to find a man.

** I love pretty much any background wlw or mlm. Dean/Seamus is a classic of course, and I always love seeing Parvati/Lavender as well. Luna/Ginny will always be one of my favorites.

If Ron's not in the main pairing I do like to see him in a side one, cause he's underappreciated and he deserves love.

I'm pretty happy with most pairings if they're done well, I'm not the sort to hate ships just for conflicting with my faves, it's just another way things could go. Then again, my favorite "pairings" are big complicated webs of polyamorous relationships, so maybe I'm the outlier lol

** Harry/Ginny is my current favorite side pairing. Writers often make them the stable, drama-free pairing, and that's really refreshing especially if the main pairing is currently on the outs. They can get really cute and sweet too which I really enjoy.

**** I generally prefer the canon stuff. Not a big ship fan though. Dont really like reading romance. Mostly skip those fluffy stuff ib the stories.

** By side pairing you mean one that isn't the focus of the fic?

It can depend, as writers can come up with some interesting combinations or can write ships I don't particularly like well, but here are a few: Bill/Fleur, Theo/Daphne, Draco/Astoria, Ron/Pansy, Ron/Luna, Theo/Harry, Theo/Luna, Blaise/Ginny, Ginny/Luna, Victor/Hermione.
