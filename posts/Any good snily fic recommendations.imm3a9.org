** Come Once Again And Love Me is very well written, great flow, and I liked its handling of the Shrieking Shack incident. Would have liked a bit less strong language and less of Severus putting deliberate distance between them, not because those are mistakes, just what I like.

My own preference for "Severus goes back to his teenage years and tries again" fics is The Peace Not Promised, which is not yet complete but probably not far off. Fairly slow moving, but I actually rather liked that; it highlights the fact that there was more to their friendship breakdown than just a few words spoken in anger. And where Come Once Again just talks about their marriage in an epilogue, The Peace Not Promised is long enough to cover years of it.

  JK said that, given a second chance, Severus would pick Lily. I'm giving Lily a second chance to pick Severus, instead. AU, of course. Some deaths, too.

Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but for what?
