I've come to notice that I've developed a peeve with fic where harry turns his back on hogwarts. I just find that that plot device can drop me out of a story faster than almost anything unless its handle delicately.anyone else have this or any other little things than can drop you from a fic


** I have grown quite annoyed at muggle-wank. Yeah, the wizarding society is not perfect, petty much all seven books are dedicated to deal with the great problem with racism, but generally the author take it beyond the absurd. An example is the tendency of making intervention and cultural colonization from what amounts to a foreign nation seem universally good for everyone at the same time it makes muggle society seem unreasonable better than the magic one, hand-waving any real world problem as insignificant at the same time it makes any problem at the magic society overwhelmingly terrible. Or when fanfics make all witches and wizard, even power-houses like Dumbledore or Voldemort, seem like defenseless sitting ducks compared to muggles, I mean, come on, Grindewald essentially was a Deus ex machina away from razing Paris to the ground and Voldemort freely attacked the muggles of Britain petty much since the forties.

** I don't have that pet peeve, but I also don't encounter that storyline much! Something I can't stand is when people don't know how to write about abuse/violence, particularly when they make adults seem like they're doing the right things when they're doing literally all the wrong things.

** I think my peeve is when character behavior is inexplicably illogical, or runs counter to the established plot.

Like a character being given a passphrase to make sure the other person is the real deal, and not an imposter, /uses/ that passphrase, and /still/ fails to spot the imposter.

Or another example, when a character has had a best friend for years, spends an entire bloody day crying in a bathroom when an acquaintance tells her she has no friends.

** I dislike it when some authors refer to characters with 'the Gryffindor', 'the Slytherin', 'the blond one', 'the brunette' or such. ("Harry looked baffled. He wondered what the blond one meant with his outburst." for example. This is not from any actual fic.) Use their names please. Harry's (just) Harry. Not 'the green eyed boy'. It's cute on occasion but not in constant use.
