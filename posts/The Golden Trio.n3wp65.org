Everyone is always going about saying things like how much it hurts if Fred dies and leaves George, or how inseparable Fred and George is. It's very true but after so many fanfictions, I've come to the realization that it hurts just as much if not more than when Harry, Ron, and Hermione are separated, be it by death or another world. It's just not the same without them together.


** I must agree with you, any sort of trio separation, whether it be death, almost death, parting of ways, or they simply cannot spend time together (like the summers) actually makes my heart hurt. Especially when Harry is stuck alone with the Dursleys

** You'd be surprised how many people would disagree with you. There are a lot of fics that take pleasure in splitting up the Golden Trio.

I can take fics where Harry goes on a solo journey after Hogwarts, or if he has a different upbringing so he makes different friends in first year. But i do find it weird when 4th or 5th year he suddenly stops talking to them.

That said, there are also some fics where the Golden Trio are a completely seamless team who understand each other on a deep level. It doesn't feel natural if they aren't a little awkward around each other. It works best when they think differently and debate.

I'm thinking up a story with Slytherin Harry, Ravenclaw Hermione, and Hufflepuff Ron and I was trying out some Express scenes but it felt the best when they were poised to become friends even though so much will be different for them.

*** Yes, I have read many fics where they weren't together and even enjoyed them. But my favorite are the ones like you said where they are seamlessly together. Good luck with your story, it sounds very interesting.

*** Yes, and usually it is one sure sign that such story is not very good (looking at all Ron!bashing Harmony stories).

** Losing a best friend is of course terrible.

But you are saying its as bad if not worse than losing a twin? And Fred and George are the type that spends every moment together, not just siblings like some twins irl. For me it's not even close.

*** No, I know that losing a sibling, especially a twin, would be terribly painful and something completely different from a friend. However, for me, the trio is so close and dependent on each other, depending on the fic, I take it very hard when they are permanently separated.

** Meh. They're separated in the canon books quite frequently. Book 4 Ron turns on Harry and it takes close to half the book for them to reconcile in the dumbest way possible. Book 7 Ron turns on the other two (albeit briefly) and is separated from them for quite a while. Book 6 Ron's so busy with Lavender that he's essentially gone and Hermione's so jealous of Harry that she kinda avoids him.

I don't mind a well-written trio fic, but they're the exception rather than the rule.

** There's a fic that did this really well, though the name escapes me.. It was a 6th year AU, where Harry either didn't think of the bezoar or got it too late or something along those lines, and Ron dying from the poison Draco wanted to use on Dumbledore.
