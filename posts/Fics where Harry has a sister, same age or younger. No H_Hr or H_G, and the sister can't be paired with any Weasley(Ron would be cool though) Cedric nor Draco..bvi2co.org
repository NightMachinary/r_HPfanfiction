**** I'm not a fan of the pairing, if that wasn't clear. For some reason, I find HarryxFemHarryFromAnotherDimension much more interesting.

The only HarryxSibling that I know of that is any good is Potter's against the World linkffn(12200475). But that is just because Temporal Knight could write a story about a fling between a flowerpot and a whale and have it ready good.

(Note: if you read this TemporalKnight, do not take inspiration from this. At least not until we have a sequel to hourglass)

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

******* I had to check out when Harry drinks a potion to age him up, then immediately has sex with that 20 or so waitress or whatever. It was too weird man. He's 11. If the author wanted to write in sex couldn't they have started from year 5 or something where it'd be substantially less weird? The timeskip could just be played off as Harry biding his time to learn more, or maybe the sisters death could have happened when they were already in school. I'll give the fic credit though, I did skip ahead and read the ending and it was actually pretty good. It's pretty rare to see both a fic that's finished and that has a good ending to wrap it up.

******** For me it was one of those fics that I knew was complete, so I had to see what would happen and his path to it. Overall, I enjoyed, even if it was pretty bad at times, and the fact that I hate when Lily is bashed(even if there's a good reason) James though, I couldn't care less. The ending was... bittersweet. It gave what it promised from the start, but we didn't get that cathartic reunion, it soured it to me a bit.

Bout the sex with ageing pot, IDK, it makes sense that the author would want to "clear" himself from having a perceived 11yo having sex with a 20+, but it honestly feels useless to the plot and could've just gave another reason for the pot affecting him later on.

*** Yeah, been reading it since the fourth chapter. Not the best of fics, mostly because I feel that James is too indecisive, Remus is the same as canon, so he's a pussy, Morgan is ok, but Veronica is just meh, and the whole plot feels bland, even though its a really interesting premise.

Its one of those fics where you keep reading just to pass time(when its updated) and to know how it ends. Not a bad fic, there are so so many bad fics out there, but not a great one either. Enjoyable enough I guess.

**** Thanks for the honest review. And thought it pains me to say, you aren't entirely wrong. I got bogged down and in trying to avoid an op 13 year old may have made Jame a bit boring. Hopefully, now that the first arc of the story is done things will pick up going forward.

***** Looking forward for it. I do have to say that for me, one of my favourite things about it is the offshoot joke that makes me giggle. I also have to say that your werewolf-head-canon is by far one of the more enjoyable ones in the fandom, so there's that. One thing that weirds me out a lot, though it makes sense in the context of the fic, is the use of "bitch" for females. Even if its right, it feels wrong.

I'm sorry if I sounded too harsh, but those are the actually only holdovers for me for this fic to be a great one, meaning that the rest are actually really good and keeps me around. I couldn't stop laughing for couple minutes on the first time you called Sirius "Princess". It came out of nowhere and it was such a natural joke that fit perfectly to James' character.

To expand on why I think Veronica to be meh, which isn't a really good, well, explanation, I feel that at times she's the "perfect" hen mother without any flaws, and then it just fliped out during the Greyback fight. It came out of nowhere and even though it was explained later on, just felt OoC. She's also not a charismatic, for me, character, for some reason. I just can't relate to her the same way I can relate to Hestia, which is by far the best Carrow I've read in fanon. Or Kate, or the Twins. She's bland and yet not. Its weird. I guess I wasn't as clear as I wanted to be.

That being said, I'll keep reading it and I do want to know how you'll progress through the story, and the fact that Snape knows/assumes he's Harry, I want to see what he'll do with that info, and how you'll make the story go on if you're planing on getting them back to the US.

****** So with regards to the Bitch thing: I thought about that a lot but went with it at the time... Don't expect to use it anymore and will probably take it out if I do another review cycle of the whole thing.

Do not feel bad about being harsh. Part of why I am writing the story and posting it is to get feedback. When I don't get much feedback I don't know what parts of the story are working, which aren't, where I am week and where I am strong.

I am glad you liked the Princess thing. It felt natural for a bunch of teens to do something like that. ii

As for Veronica, she is suffering from panster writing. I had no clue what her background was aside from bitten, saved by Remus, bites James. That is what she started as. Since then she has grown. The Larimont thing came because if I was going to do a top man and top woman Greyback needed a partner. Insert Veronica's deepened backstory and what happened with that.

I am glad you are liking the side characters that are being beefed up. Fair warning, Katie is in for a rough time the next couple chapter.

As the story goes on please feel free to level criticism and feedback. One of my Goals as a writer with Wolf Lord is to focus on show don't tell story telling. I know I haven't always succeeded in this, and part of the slow pace and bloat is showing when I probably could just tell. The other is realism, in so far as character's act rationally from their own personal perspective and suffer logical consequences for their actions within the story. That said, if the character is batshit insane what they consider rational probably isn't to anyone else.
