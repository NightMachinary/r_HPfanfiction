She often tells Dumbledore to sit down and enjoy a dessert she had baked. Or to just relax.

Severus is such a stick in the mud that he tries to leave right after every Order meeting. Molly often stops him. She will either give him a Tupperware filled with food to take with him or will force him to sit down and eat before he leaves.

Severus being who he is tries to intimidate her with his glares. Molly who is used to raising a bunch of boys is unimpressed.

"You better stop glaring at me, young man! I've raised 6 sons and a daughter, your temper tantrums aren't going to work on me!"

"You better just eat, Severus. You'll never win an argument with Molly when it comes to taking care of people." Arthur says with a chuckle.


** Harry's not the first lost child Molly takes under her wing.

She's noticeably concerned for Luna's well-being, since Xenophilius cannot cook. When he goes on expeditions and Luna's too young to accompany him, Molly takes her in--Ginny is delighted at having a sister, for however short a time.

When she found out about poor Neville, she sent him a Weasley jumper, a package of fudge, a package of treacle tart, and a Howler for Augusta.

** I always wished that the Burrow was more like that, that there were more kids over at the burrow, like the twins' friends and Percy's girlfriend and even Bill and Charlie's friends even though they aren't even in the country anymore Molly's still like ‘Nymphadora Tonks I haven't seen you in so long! Come to dinner and tell me about your new girlfriend!'

And even Arthur's underlings from work as well. Or like, I can imagine Arthur making friends with random muggles and some of them end up being related to Muggleborns, so he can bring them home to their magical house.

  After a normal Saturday breakfast at The Burrow, Hermione discovers that a marriage law is about to be enacted. Unless she finds a suitor over the weekend, she will be paired by the Ministry of Magic, possibly with an ex-Death Eater. Ginny decides the solution is to offer Hermione her choice of Weasley brother. But George is determined to share his thoughts before Hermione makes her decision...

** Wasn't she hostile to Fleur when she met her? And wasn't she disappointed in Percy but she slobbered all over Harry?

She'd be assigned as a sexual predator in mundane society seeing as how she used a love potion on Arthur. I say she used it on Arthur because he seemed to be the only one she was interested in.

And this is just Molly, Arthur was a low key useless father.

If you want to know what kind of parent she was remember her two oldest moved the hell away from her as soon as possible. Complained about Percy not wanting to be poor wizarding trash, but as soon as Harry pops up she smothers him to death almost.

Molly is what Ginny was going to turn into a screaming shrew, they both behaved pretty badly to Fleur, mostly because she was French, and well off.
