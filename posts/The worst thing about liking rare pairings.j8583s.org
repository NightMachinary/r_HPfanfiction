Even if there are some fanfics about it, a large chunk are going to be painful to read. No character development. No grammar. All spelling mistakes and cliches.

It's painful.

But you still read it because you can't find anything else.

****** Hi pls don't think I'm making fun of it I'm serious, but Haphne seems quite popular (see it mentioned a lot on reddit) but I was wondering how did it all get started? Maybe it's just me but I don't remember Daphne being very prominent in the books, but that might be because I didn't read them in so long.

******* I've been in Fanfiction (and Haphne fanfiction) for a while but I wasn't there when the deep magic was written and thus cannot recite it to you. The commonly accepted reasoning behind Daphne's evolution as a fanon character is the desire to place Harry with a Slytherin girl his own age. Pansy comes with the baggage of being connected to Draco so any decent fic has to devote effort to solving that. Daphne is a blank slate canon character that any number of plot points can be ascribed to. Even today, when the persona of Daphne has been generally accepted by those of us that read and write her, circumstances around that character vary wildly.

****** One thing that struck me as odd is that Harry said Hermione says he has a ‚Äòsaving people thing'\\

******* Fun fact: a 'hero complex', or 'hero syndrome' actually refers to someone who usually creates the situations they try to save others from because they have an intense need to be seen as the hero by others or to feel themselves that they are hero's. So his 'saving people thing' is probably more accurate than a hero complex. I have heard people call it an 'Atlas complex', or 'atlas personality' instead, which is when someone feels they have to take all the stress and responsibilities of the world on themselves, usually caused by being forced to take too many adult responsibilities as a child, which does fit Harry a bit better.

****** WARNING: EXTREME LANGUAGE AHEAD, READ AT YOUR OWN FUCKING RISK FUCKERI'm reading the first chapter of I am not a Hero and I think Dumbledore is a bloody fucking idiot.Like, what the hell dude?If the soul latched onto Harry, then don't you think he would be the kid if the prophecy. And he should know that prophecies aren't exactly the most literal and specific, thinking of them so could be seriously damaging to your physical and mental health. Why should he want to die so young?

Idiot.It just makes so much more sense for Harry to be the kid of the prophecy.Bloody fucking idiot, he is.

‚Äã

Edit: Read the next paragraph and holy fucking shit in a grave what the fuck is wrong with that fucker? He's causally thinking of killing a kid who went through some traumatizing shit. He's actually fucking /hoping/ that Harry's fucking aunt and uncle fucking kill him.Again, what the ever fucking /fuck/ is wrong with this psychopath?

edit: at the comment about Dumbledore's dress sense I said aloud ‚Äògay as all fucking hell, he is.'

edit: his personality is /exactly/ like mine. Like, he's a carbon copy of me, save for the blonde hair and honey eyes.

In canon Harry had to die at the hands of Voldemort due to the blood protection and other things so He can live after Horcrux is destroyed But remember Lily didn't die so the blood protection isn't there and Horcrux can be destroyed by destroying the container so if The Dursleys did kill Harry somehow the Horcrux would have been destroyed with him living Dumbledore's hand clean. What he didn't knew was Harry was the actual BWL so he can't die unless Voldemort didn't kill him or Voldemort is dead himself. So if Harry wasn't the BWL his plan would have been perfect

I think the misconception regarding the idea of Tonks' character as a whole and the fact that people are generally unable to navigate the substantial age gap causes a lot of problems.\\

***** Pardon me, I didn't exactly communicate properly. Second language issues.\\
So the problem with the age difference that I've found is that it often leads people to go into a certain trope, that I personally dislike.\\
It is always, Harry is really mature for his age and Tonks is immature and/or insecure. There isn't anything organic in this for people to get really invested in the relationship. It usually ends up with an OP Harry who is ultra-capable and understanding while Tonks is the one with issues. Some may like it, I don't mind it, but I feel like it has a lot of potential wasted.

Generally when writing characters with an age gap, in a heterosexual relationship, if the girl is older, writing a way for them to fall in love is difficult. At least when they are in school/academic surroundings. Most people get the question in their heads, why would an adult fall for a kid, which is fair I suppose. So people push the Overly Mature Harry trope and put it through which really kills the romance.

I like Tonks as a character. Lots of potential there. I think with Honks as a ship, the focus shouldn't be on emphasizing Harry is mature as done thus far in most fanfics, I think the focus should be on organically developing feelings between the two, which is often forgotten by people, and then the story slows down and often ends up incomplete.

In defence of my first statement, that the age gap is a problem, it is because people don't fundamentally understand the reasons why an older female would like a younger male in school, and it's understandable because it isn't really common. So they don't really look into how a junior and senior might fall for one another beyond the fact that one is really mature and the other is insecure. Hence the pushing of a trope that doesn't really pack much of a punch.

Two fanfics that come to mind that have navigated this problem really well recently is Court of Flowers by DavidTheAthenai and A Different Kind of War by Ajaxx, I think those are the names. Here you can find a more organic relationship growing.

So to conclude, the age gap doesn't have to be a problem. It can be navigated well if the effort is put into it, but thus far, it has led to a problem that plagues most fanfics.

***** Yup.That's why I think this is a better ship than Hinny(Drarry too is better than Hinny). As I remember, Ginny was the equivalent of a obsessive fan girl in the first few. I love the concept of her character, don't get me wrong, she's beautiful, smart, kind, badass, and her name is amazing.But she saw him as ‚ÄòHarry Potter: The Boy Who Lived' for the beginning of the story. Irregardless other wether or not she got over that and saw him as //Harry// she still, at some degree, remembers and can't help but see him as the boy who defeated Voldemort.That's not something he needs, nor wants.Tonks doesn't do that. Neither does Draco. Not in the praise and worship sort of way, at least. They see him as Harry, or Potter(Scarhead).

side note: Harry Potter took place in the 90s(91 to 98) and Scarface the movie was around 83. I just think that's a bit of a funny coincidence that Draco calls Harry Scarhead and Scarface came out around then.

A 50 year old married to a 60 year old raises /way/ fewer eyebrows (and moral concerns) than a 16 year old dating a 26 year old. (Ages are just an example, as I'm not sure how old Harry and Tonks are when they interact the most during the canon series).

  This would be Harry Potter, the boy who defeated Voldemort years back, dating an Auror (one of the highest upkeepers of the law)
#+end_quote

So? So because he wasn't killed as a child, he's mature enough at 14 to enter a relationship with someone 7 years older? I disagree with your assertion that any of the student-aged characters in canon are written as emotionally mature enough for a relationship with a much older adult to be without issue. There's no way that they could have an equitable relationship as partners, and it would absolutely be predatory IMO. In canon, Harry didn't even pursue a relationship with a peer until after events described in GoF. It's out-of-character to assume he'd be in a committed relationship during GoF, especially with someone so much older, unless you imagine he was pursued and groomed by Tonks (ugh).

#+begin_quote

Disagree. The British WW is very much modeled on contemporary British society, and there are no similar relationships to this in canon.

I'd be with Rita on this one, tbh... this dynamic honestly gives me the creeps. Honks in general? Sure, but at least make Harry an adult. But I don't like it, so I won't read it. Won't say other people can't.

Which is fine, I guess, if they weren't traditionally static characters. Luna's backstory and personality set her up perfectly for a character arc. Unfortunately, some many authors, including JKR, fail to give it to her.

On of my favorite scenes between Harry and Luna isn't even from a Harry/Luna shipfic. [[https://fp.fanficauthors.net/harry_potter_and_the_years_of_rebellion/index/][Harry Potter and the Years of Rebellion]] by Full Pensive has a scene wear a recently injured Luna and emancipated Harry go on a "date" to annoy their respective crushes.

What are your favorite "rare pairings" OP.

I am struggling to think of any I like outside of Harry/Katie Bell that I PERSONALLY would consider a rare pairing. I am sure one persons rare is another persons not so rare.

*Edit:*

Example... someone else in here said Honks. I love Honks stories but I wouldnt consider them rare. Clearly they and I differ on that opinion lol. Same thing for the Harry/Fleur, Harry/Luna, Harry/Daphne comments in here. Kinda surprised folks consider those as "rare".

** Incidentally, this is actually what caused my interest in Harry/Bellatrix a couple of years ago to fizzle out after a major interest in the ship for me for a time. I read Delenda Est, and liked the first half of that fic, and I wanted more. But the sheer impossibility to find anything that wasn't just smut or one of those "Pair All The Things" fics caused me to stop bothering looking for it alltogether once the novelty of the ship wore off.

The other 2 ships I've had explicit interest for beyond just "it's a cool ship" (as in, enough to go looking for fics with it) are Honks and Snily. Honks has a similar problem as Harry/Bellatrix, in that there's basically nothing good (almost every fic I've seen with it deals with True Form shenanigans, enough that the very trope is explicitly mocked on several occasions in other fics). But I decided to quit looking for it while I was ahead to not lose interest in the ship entirely, and now only read whatever people recommend for it nowdays. Snily, while not as popular as some other ships, is popular enough to not be a rarepair (the 19th ship on ao3 in terms of fics written), and has its fair share of good fics. But it's still rare enough that the reading list of good fics with the ship can be exhausted, even if it took longer than for Honks. I'll pickup any new fics I see with the ship, but usually lose interest in them quickly if they repeat worn out plots (Severus-centric Peggy Sue in particular is done to death for that ship, although I've only seen a single one where Lily went beck).

**** That is understandable. I haven't read it myself (because I dislike bad endings) so I can't comment on its quality, but maybe linkffn(Lily and the Half-blood Prince) would interest you?

Personally, I think that too many people put too much focus on that particular scene. Don't get me wrong, it was a horrible thing to say. But what I mean is that the problem wasn't that utterance directly, but the circumstances around it. Obviously he didn't mean what he said. But why was the slur even on the tongue? It means he has used it in the past. I always figured their friendship (and the potential for more, something JKR herself mentioned as a possibility in extracanoncial material had circumstances been different) was on the precipe of destruction even before that scene. They had communication issues with each other's problems and tried to pretend everything was fine when they weren't.

The reason I like the ship, for what it's worth, is that I always loved the idea of a young Severus, making less terrible choices, rising above his station and proving everyone wrong in that not all Slytherins end up becoming Death Eaters, in spite of his upbringing and harassment in school. In such a case, Snily would be him obtaining some happiness of his own as a result, and I always liked the thought of them together after being close friends for years.

***** I see your point, though I still don't ship them. Though, a side note about a prospective fic someone could make in the future that I would read, a fic that highlights the toxic dynamic they had, the fragile relationship they balanced on a lily. I would read that. But it ends with her stopping seeing Snape and giving James a chance. Possibly ending with a scene like this: Potter---the arrogant git---stood up, climbing to stand on the Gryffindor table. Peter whines loudly about him stepping in his food. She widens her eyes, surely he wouldn't go this far? Would he? ‚ÄúMiss Lily Evans, would you make me the happiest Chaser in Hogwarts and accept my invitation to Hogsmeade this coming Saturday?‚Äù He bows dramatically, if unsteadily given he's balancing on silver platters of food and plates piled with probably unhealthy dietary choices, and holds out a hand, as if asking her to dance. She chewed her lip, not missing Potter's glance at her lips and visible gulp(although only to those close who had been paying attention, like her). After the rather disastrous parting with Severus, she'd noticed that he wasn't as terrible as she thought him to be. Don't get her wrong, he was still slightly arrogant and seemed to have a high opinion of himself, but she starting taking note of the little things. How he seemed to care about his friends---Lupin and Pettigrew mostly. She didn't miss how he'd stood up for her after she left that day, after Severus had called her...that. She barely considered her answer, not needing too. She'd observed enough to respect him, and talking to Frank gave her an insight to her feelings. ‚ÄúYes, now get off that table you over dramatic idiot.‚Äù He blinked as if not computing what she'd said. Then, as if a freight train had struck him, a blinding grin took over his face, radiating enough charm to convince a Grindylow to bake you biscuits. He jumped excitedly, shouting ‚Äòshe said yes! She said yes!' enough times to make an anthem, nearby student's plate splattered soup on his robes, staining the already dark fabric. Potter---she supposed she should start calling him James now---pauses to apologize, but even that is overtaken by obvious joy. ‚ÄúThat's great mate, she said yes, but now get the bloody hell down and eat. You have History of Magic next.‚Äù She shook her head as he jumped down, still grinning like a loon who won the lottery, a mumbled ‚Äòidiot' though now it was fond instead of reprimanding.

** Agreed. Another point, even ships that aren't considered rare(Harmony, Drarry, Dramione) have shit fics.\\
Really, in my experience, it's difficult to find a good fic that has one of those pairings. All the good ones have the canon ships.\\
It's not as big of a problem, I ship some that would be considered rare too, but it just gets on my nerves sometimes. I've seen so many with cool concepts, but they never get finished or are just plain terrible in writing and grammar. I'm not trying to be mean with that comment, but I can't lie and say it's great even though the concept is really interesting.

** I have that problem with Harry/Pansy, in my mind I always figured people could easily write 100+ stories with her, I mean it's such a common trope, the school bully who either secretly loves or falls in love with her victim due to something he did. Granted Draco was the one who more directly harrassed harry but the idea of changing stuff around or creating new events has been common practice for fanfic writers since the dawn of time. The story literally writes itself and that's just me accepting a mediocre story plot at best but even those aren't written.

Although having your ship become popular has it's downsides as well, my main ship switched from Harry/Fleur to Harry/Daphne back when there was maybe a handful of stories with that pairing, now there's dozens and people always complain the ship is written the exact same way (which is kind of true) in the end either we get no stories or we get so many eventually everything feels like a carbon copy.

Idk what the fic was called but I remember harry started dabbling in dark magic and got an addiction to it, he was in Slytherin and Draco and Pansy would protect him from the Gryffindors. They would also do rituals and what not...

Anyways I enjoyed that friendship dynamic and hell I could even get behind Harry/Draco/Pansy if it was written well enough. I think that could be interesting.

** I'd say that outside of canon pairings, Harry/Hermione, Harry/Draco & Harry/Tom or Voldemort that any pairing with Harry is at least sonewhat rare.

Harry/Daphne is my favourite pairing and is definitely becoming one of the more common and popular ships (slowly) but is still somewhat rare when compared to Harry/Ginny.

I've also grown to utterly adore Harry/Astoria. I've read a few adorable fics with the pairing.

I like quite a few other rare pairs - Harry/Pansy, Harry/Tracey, Harry/Flora/Hestia, Harry/Lilith Moon, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Gabrielle, Harry/Tonks, Harry/Susan, Harry/Hannah, Harry/Fay, Harry/Fem!Tom or Voldemort, Harry/Fem!Draco, Harry/Fem!Ron, Harrry/Luna, Harry/Narcissa, Harry/Victoire, Harry/Fem!Harry, Harry/Griphook/Buckbeak, Harry/Demelza ... I have a lot of ships. But generally Harry/Slytherin Girls are my favourites.

** Another really crappy thing about rare pairings is that when you CAN find them, more than half are harems and the sig other that you like is pretty much just a replaceable OC with no actual decent dialogue.

** Just gonna throw it out there but Lavender/Tom is the hill I will die on.

I like fics with Pansy in them (with Percy, Ron, Charlie, Neville, Lucius, literally anyone, I adore her) but have yet to really find a long fic that does a true study of her character.

** I feel sad that certain rare (and I mean rare) pairings only exist as part of an author's wank fantasy or pointless harem stories. Yes, I include strict HP characters and crossover characters, too.

Examples? Harry/Katie Bell, Harry/Lavender Brown. Harry/Kara Zor El (preemptive fuck you, Megamatt09).

The latter HP character I'd love to see a story where her character evolves from being the overbearing girl seen with canon Ron to someone more... down to earth? Realistic?

I can count on one hand the amount of fics I've seen that have Lavender act as a person and not a "teenage girl stereotype", including one after the War where she's proud to show off her scars (her parents worry that no-one will want their "marred daughter", only for them to goggle when she introduces Harry as her boyfriend).

*** I just got into this pairing so I'm going to give that a shot. It was actually a triad fic of Harry/Daphne/Pansy that got me interested. I know most multi pairing fics are terrible but I would recommend it because it's post-Hogwarts and deals with the emotions involved in a mature way (also, much lemons, but well-written at least). The series is Triplicity by idleside with 3 fics so far but the first one is only 4 chapters and more of an introduction to the pairing.
