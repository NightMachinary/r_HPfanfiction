Just finished one shot 'Harry gets motivated' and I'm looking for something like that. Just what it says on the title. Maybe Harry putting himself in Ä°mperio or another kind of mind control trance where he goes around in an improvement streak.


** Go check White Angel of Auralon on ffn, they have a bunch. Linkffn(10434054;10192722;9670280) to get you started.

  Harry overhears a conversation between two of his teachers early into the first year at Hogwarts. What he hears makes him ponder about how he's going about his school work. He decides to take action and make his parents proud of his performance. Just how will that little change influence the events taking place at the school?

  Some investigations in the true performance of his classmates starts Harry on a different path. After all, he was really curious what reason his best female friend could have to try so hard to make people believe that she was the smartest witch. No pairings

  What if Harry woke up to his underperforming before his third year and decided to take his studies more serious? What if he was more observant and also decided to find out how Hermione got to take all classes offered? What if he took things into his own hands properly for once and didn't mess around so much? The answer: A wizard awakes to his true potential.
