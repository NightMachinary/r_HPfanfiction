** Yes! I absolutely love this trope as well. I've read a few really good ones. There's this one fic (which also happens to be my all-time favorite fic that I recommend at every opportunity) called, "The Darkness Within." It's pretty popular, so you may have already read it. There's two sequels as well.

I want to give you a summary, but I don't want to say too much. Just, please read it. It's the best story ever. You won't regret it. Do it. Now.

*** Yes I already read that! Really one of the best.

Do you have any more to refer me? I would be forever grateful for that!

**** I have two more, but I'm a little wary to recommend them.

The first is, "A Shattered Prophesy." You may have read this one as well, because it is actually the story that inspired "The Darkness Within." Either way, I'm wary because it's a tragic story and I'm not sure if it's what you're looking for. Either way, I'll link it.

Second is called "Light Up the Sky." I haven't read it in a while, but I recall it being pretty good. Though I will warn you now it is NOT finished and will never be finished. It didn't end on a cliff hanger though, and the plot was pretty much tied up. Here you go.

***** Thank you wholeheartedly for the recommendations!

I'm writing a story, I actually started now!

​

I'll give a summary of what I thought:

​

-Lily and James forget about Harry in favor of their other son, so Harry is neglected, at the age of 5 he runs away from home.

​

-But they don't do it on purpose, Peter before he runs away, passes by the Potter's house and casts a very strong "confundus" spell on Lily and James, (Sirius and Remus too) making them forget about Harry over time , and then they think that Harry's twin brother is actually the WBL!

​

-Harry appears for selection at Hogwarts

​

-Lily and James try to have Harry's trust again, but Harry doesn't take it easy, because he went through many things, had to learn to live alone in the alleys of London, until he was captured and sent to a homeless children's shelter . There he goes through abuse, so even trusting adults again will take some time, and also Lily and James try to understand what happened and why they did this to Harry!

​

It is! I was wondering if it looks interesting to you!

Bad news is that it won't be released in English (but with the Google translator it's easy to read)
