As it says in the title.

No Weasley Bashing as I love that family.

Can be as canon as possible, or as AU as possible.

No super smart or super powerful Harry. (Note: Harry being smarter or more powerful than he was in canon, is fine; but please make it believable enough).

No Harem Harry. (Note he can have multiple girlfriends through out the story, but not at the same time).

No Seer Luna.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Am fine if the story is outside of Harry centric fics; as well as looking for other Era stories that are a good long read.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione.

Am fine with super dark stories, super light stories or anywhere in between

As I said would rather it be completed, or at least regularly updated. Can be from fanfiction.net or another site.

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

******** Well, now, that's a tough one to crack, because to my eyes, this is one of the best romance fics out there, and you want a complete one. Well, though it isn't exactly romantic, only alluded to, in linkffn(Stages of Hope) Harry and Hermione , and even Neville and Luna, have that chemistry, or fairly close to it.

linkffn(Grow Young with Me) has a wonderful romance, but so far, and considering the snippets she has posted on her Tumblr, they aren't together yet.

One fic with a lovely romance and fairly different, with both characters having to balance and support each other is linkffn(What we Lost)

Another one that I love is linkffn(The Legacy) mostly because it happens so naturally and it feels so lifelike, similar to what happened in GYWM, but it is abandoned, and you wanted complete fics, which is harder.

One that I liked, but is fairly judged as a less than average fic, mostly because the author uses -- instead of " for speech (common in latin-based writing) is linkffn(Paid in Blood)

linkffn(Valeriana Natassa) is also really nice, and you could say its complete because it has a really big extended plot that really doesn't matter to the HPverse, but make of that what you will.

If you want more, or different ones, let me know, those were the ones that came to mind.

No Super Harry? Uh, yeah sorry but very much so.

Everything else is a checkerooni too.

It is excellent, it doesn't really bash anyone and offers every deserving character (and a few undeserving ones) redemption.

It takes place after 4th year and is mostly about Harry's personal issues as other characters turn their world on its head

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  This story follows the Battle of Hogwarts in the fantasy saga, Harry Potter. It considers how some of the main characters might have moved forward from the harrowing events described in the seventh novel. In the parlance of the Harry Potter fandom, this is an After the Battle storyline. The main characters embark on their journey of friendship, healing, relationship, and growth toward the Deathly Hallows epilog scene nineteen years later. In places, you might find some attempts at humor or a few serendipitous thoughts included for good measure.This storyline aims to be canonically aligned with the Harry Potter novels, as written by J. K. Rowling, and to some extent, the Warner Brothers produced movies.Story: CompleteRating: T+ or PG-13; non-explicit suggestive adult themes and references to some violence.Pairing: Harry/Ginny, Ron/HermioneOther Characters: George, Katie, Luna, Neville, Angelina, McGonagall, Arthur, Molly
