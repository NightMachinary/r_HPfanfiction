If someone could help me I'd be very appreciative! I've been searching google for keywords with no luck because I think the keywords lead to several similar stories. But here goes the summary that I remember:

For Harry's protection, Harry and Snape are forced to spend the summer together (by Dumbledore I believe, possibly around 5th year). The first part they're essentially on the run, Bellatrix is chasing them down and I recall them staying at a muggle hotel for a night. Eventually they make their destination, a cottage with a neighbouring kindly muggle couple who have a dog (not too sure why they dog sticks out so much, but I remember it was pretty much Harry's only source of joy).

Snape must train Harry but it turns out that Harry is much more powerful than anyone realized and must also help him hone his power, at one point Harry accidentally unleashes it on Snape. Eventually Bellatrix, and maybe Voldemort plus death eaters, attack them and they're able to ward them off.

They return to the castle at the end of summer with newfound respect and it's very much a mentorship type of story. If anyone has any hints I'd be very grateful!

**** Not a problem. When I first started reading fanfiction, I didn't have a fanfiction.net account, so in order to re-find fics, I had to figure out some serious google-fu.

That's why I made the guide in the first place, I wanted other people to have the same methods I did.

  The Death Eaters have come for Harry Potter but this slightly crazy Gryffindor has plenty of tricks up his sleeve.

Sigh... Another one of those. Out of morbid curiosity, in the fic, why didn't anyone notice it before? What reason is given for nobody noticing it in canon?
