There is that trope, of at some point of Potions class, some potion explodes, then Harry or everybody, or Snape, or Draco, are turned into infants.

Then, the characters that didn't transform, have to take care of the kids.

Then, everybody is happy and friendly, because ”Who cannot love any child??" (Insert one Lord Voldemort smirking).

Please, explain to me ... why people like this??

I see no plot.


** I personally never saw a deaging fic that I liked, never got the appeal of the trope. But why do you say they don't have a plot? They have any plot that the author writes, right? Like going through the school year, finding a cure, coming to terms if it proves to be permanent, experiencing the war while being a helpless child having to watch your friends fight and die, and so on (just some ideas off the top of my head).

I mean, I can replace the "deaging" in your post with any other trope, like Lord Harry or OP!Harry, and then claim any fics that use that trope don't have a plot. I will be equally wrong of course.

Maybe you just read a fic that was actually limited to the deaging being the whole plot? And from that one fic came to the conclusion every fic with that trope is like this?

*** Also, just because something doesn't have a plot (or has very little of it) doesn't mean it shouldn't exist. Sometimes the interactions between the characters in that particular situation is the point of the story and that's more than ok, they can be entertaining by themselves. Although normally even those have some plot like you said, it just isn't the kind of plot the OP likes.

**** Yep, agreed. I focused so much on his complaint about the missing plot that I forgot to write that. There are many great fics that can be totally interesting and hilarious, without any story progression or plot at all. Just from the character interactions and conversations.

** I've read only one de-aging fic in this fandom and it was rather good. It was some random witch “cursing” Harry who forgot everything with his new age. And after being adopted and raised in a much better family than the Dursleys, Hermione and Ron (and the Weasleys) finally found him and tried to change him back. And it ended with Ginny being “fuck no, leave him be happy”. And it was really, really well made. It may have been a cliche trope. But it was surprising, interesting and well thought out. It really touched about Harry's PTSD and life in the wizarding world etc.

But in other fandoms it's usually just a fun type of fic. Just some good comedy. Which is nice too.

** Well, there was one I liked. Hermione discovered some method of time travel, but it could only be in her own lifetime. So she goes back as a baby and has a hard time convincing her parents to believe her. It was a fun read.

Another one I remember reading (somewhat guiltily, as I usually don't go for Hermione/ Draco) was pretty crazy. Hogwarts had a parenting class and students were split into groups of three and one would take a de-aging potion and the other two would act as parents. Harry and Hermione got paired with Draco. My point is that teenagers are better at hiding their emotions and feelings. Children are usually more open and vocal and the author used that to show the abuse Harry and Draco had been through. Hermione was a nightmare. A hilarious one, but still a nightmare.

I know it's not a request or looking for thread, but if someone is interested here are the two fics I'm talking about:

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  Complete DHr & HG Sixth years at Hogwarts are now required to take a parenting class, what fun! Hermione, Draco, and Harry are paired up in which they'll trade off being children. Can they live through the class or will being a parent prove too hard?

** Ok, two things: Why it might be interesting, and why it might be popular.

​

It doesn't take much to give an idea enough legs to make an interesting exploration, it doesn't have to have intrinsic appeal. A lot of sci-fi/fantasy is escapism, but not everything. Sometimes it is social commentary, a story device, or just an interesting idea to play with. (I mean, I certainly don't dream about what life would be like if my brain was removed as a child and put into a ship. But still, great books).

​

From that perspective, de-aging is a fine idea to play with related to magic. Just like anything else you can do with magic (Time Travel, Transfiguration, Merging, magical bindings, etc). There is certainly enough potential problems in a world where magic can deage someone you could have a good story.

​

As for why something is popular/a trope, usually that is because it ends up enabling some of the more engaged desires of the reader/author base. Love Potions and Soul Bonds could be an interesting idea to explore, but they are popular because it allows people to force unconventional pairings/situations. Self Inserts are popular because escapism and everyone (i mean **everyone**) wants to be a dragon rider. Go ahead, deny it.

From the sound of it you have read mostly things that are more... shallow. Not a "Lets explore what this is and what it would mean" but "I'm gonna use this to do what I want". I really don't know why deaging would appeal for that. Maybe just another way to force unconventional pairings? I'll admit I usually see it mostly in time travel fics, as a way to avoid the ick factor involved in certain pairings. (And that is really strange. The lines on what people consider acceptable and unacceptable are... don't make much sense?).

But then, I haven't read many baby deaging fics, except the good ol' Hermione goes back and time and fixes everything as a baby, which I don't think is the type of fic you are talking about.

** Saw a use for deaging that I thought was clever once - can't remember the fic, but basically Sirius de-aged him so they could sneak out of the country. Harry somewhat reverted mentally (I think it made him 4ish?) and everyone thought he was super adorable - Sirius found it hilarious, and afterwards Harry was mortified.
