Would anyone know where I can search for assistance in writing a fic summary ? Something so short should be simple, but I'm finding it harder than coming up the name for the fic !

It's for a WIP that's been posted for awhile now. I've had a couple reviews and PMs about the summary being completely different to the story, and apparently it's a bit of a turnoff.


** [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]] has 'Fix Your Summary Friday', but you could always try us. Alternately, this is something good to ask a Beta, if you haven't tried that yet.

*** Thanks for your reply ! I've had terrible luck with Beta's and have yet to find one that sticks through half a chapter with me. I ditched looking for another quite a while ago unfortunately.

I took a look around for this â€˜Fix your summary Friday' but I have no idea what it is, or where to find it. If you could provide more information, that would be lovely.

How successful do you think I would be posting my summary and asking for assistance ? Do you think they'd need to read some of the fic to be able to give valuable advice ? It's a bit of a long read :/

**** They make a new post every Friday for it, so you'll have to wait till then. I think they can give you helpful advice without needing to read your fic; they'll give you tips what to change, add or remove that would interest them enough to check out the story. The goal of your summary is to draw readers in, not necessarily to encapsulate your fic entirely.

The general advice is to give an idea of your plot and the tone of the story (humorous, bleak, mystery, etc.) with some sort of hook that leads to questions the reader wants answers to.

Edit: As wordhammer said, you could always post it here, too.

***** I'll keep an eye out for the Friday thing. Sounds interesting.

I agree on the goal. The complaints I get mostly relate to the story not being in first person, fair enough, and that they didn't realise how angsty it would be.

These damn links never seem to work, so we will see how we go !

****** Okay, I'm no summary expert but I'll give you my two cents here. Right away I notice your I's aren't capitalized and a few 'I'm's are without apostrophes. Grammar details like this are a big deal for . . . not /most,/ but a good portion of readers, I'd say. If there are errors in your summary, people will tend to assume your fic is filled with them, and they'll avoid it.

The summary itself seems alright to me, maybe could use more detail on the plot. This is what I'd change it to:

#+begin_quote
  I'm Charlotte Evans. Never heard of me? I'm not surprised---I bet you know my twin Lily, though. I'm stuck sitting with James Potter because of a stupid deal. Lucky me? You're sorely mistaken.
#+end_quote

I cut out unnecessary information. I think you should use the extra characters to expound on the story, whatever aspect of it you think will interest readers most. Although, if multiple people whose word you trust have told you the summary is 'different' from the story, you may want to make further changes to bring it more in line.

******* You know what, I can really be blind to my own writing sometimes. I didn't even SEE those grammatical errors. This is why I need a beta.

Thanks so much for your help thus far ! Better already!

Multiple people have messaged me saying that they almost didn't continue reading because they thought they were heading into a fun first person fic, and found a third person angsty slow-burn instead. Do I trust them? No, I don't know them. I do believe them, however, and agree what what they are saying.

The stats on the first chapter compared to the fifth has an enormous gap of readers, and it looks like quite a lot of people drop out after the first chapter. If readers are saying they /almost/ stopped reading because of it, it's highly some have already.

#+end_quote

Okay, perfect, you can act on this. Change the perspective and the tone, and throw in some detail on the MC's motivations. I'll give it another shot real quick just to jog some ideas for you.

#+begin_quote
  Though Charlotte sat beside him, holding to their deal, James Potter had eyes only for her twin, Lily. He was yet another in her life to whom Charlotte was a mere shadow of an afterthought. As she watched his wistful stare, she felt it was time, at last, to shed her lifelong cloak of obscurity and step into the open.
#+end_quote

I dunno if that's properly angsty or ridiculous melodrama, but you get the idea. Given the bot description I assumed the plot revolves around your MC trying to win James' affections. Hope this helps mitigate that drop-off!
