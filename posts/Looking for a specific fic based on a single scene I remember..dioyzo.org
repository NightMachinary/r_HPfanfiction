:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I recently remembered reading this story where at one point McGonagall finds out all the first years are terrified by the idea of being named prefects when they reach the required age because the current prefects are atrocious at their job, Ron in particular. Does anyone know which fic I'm referring to? I remember finding the whole sequence hilarious and I'd really like to read it again, so any help is greatly appreciated.
