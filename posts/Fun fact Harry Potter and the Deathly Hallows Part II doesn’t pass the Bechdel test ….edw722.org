*** Well, originally the test was made by Allison Bechdel, a lesbian comic writer, to discuss how women in movies often don't have relationships outside of men. In that context, both of your described situations would pass the test. Honestly, the Bechdel test was never made test how feminist a movie is. In fact there are several very sexist movies that do pass the Bechdel test, such as /Weird Science/ and /Twilight/. Moreover, some movies have really good depictions of women despite failing the test, such as /Pacific Rim/ and /The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo/. The test is only supposed to point out how often women are relegated to supporting the story of a man rather than having their own personal relationships with other women.

On the other hand, think of how many movies would fail a reverse Bechdel test. Is there any movie you can think of that doesn't have two male characters having a discussion that doesn't center on a man?

So, your idea of the test is correct. It is not about how "feminist" a movie is. Rather it is only supposed to indicate women's agency and their interpersonal relationships with other women.

This goes further to show the test, while it can be helpful in some instances, doesn't really tell you a lot about a movie's actual portrayal of either sex. Rather it gives you a baseline of how the movie approaches female relationships. I still find it wild though how many movies do fail the test.

I was starting to think about the 'men' version of the test but didn't know how to word it to post here....I started trying to think along the lines of 2 men having a discussion that didn't involve some authority figure (actual or social) or the ideas they have which came from authority figures in the past (fathers, teachers, etc telling them what it 'means to be a man'). When the only other types of conversations I remembered were about work or hobbies I kind of ran aground on something profound (in my own mind or in general society) which I don't quite understand.

If they are two women. And they talk to each other. And the topic is not /specifically/ a man. It passes the test.

Two women talking about shoes would pass the test. Two women talking about their uteruses would pass the test. Two women talking about a third woman, or a romantic interest who isn't a man, or a pet, or the plot, would pass the test. Two women talking about how /women shouldn't have rights/ would pass the test.

***** To be honest, as someone who is both a minority and a writer who has struggled writing underrepresented people, I blame it on the way that genres and tropes are so encoded in how we talk about stories and how we market them.

A lot of my own work doesn't pass the Bechdel test, and usually it's because I wasn't really trying to write in a way that felt like a snippet of a complete world.

Instead, I was going "this is the scene where the hero does this thing". "This is the scene where the villain does that thing". I was writing from the Monomyth and with a /structure/ in mind, and the fact of the matter is that a lot of sexist assumptions are built into the structure of stories, because /most/ stories were written by sexist people from within sexist societies.

E.g. - Most of my characters get along fine with their mothers but not their fathers. Why? Well... because "confrontation with the father" is a persistent trope of character development that I am aware of and have in the past tried to include in my works in a way that "confrontation with the mother"... isn't. So by default, most of my more family-focused stories will feature father-child conflict, and since I aim for 50/50 male/female protagonists, that means that 50% of my stories that have a family focus will feature father/son interactions (which would pass the reverse-Bechdel) and 50% of them will feature a father/daughter interaction (which does not pass the Bechdel test).

The answer there is, fairly obviously, to just... write more conflicts with moms. But that's hard when I realize that the only mothers I have seen in fiction who play the role of the antagonist are like... cartoonishly evil. I don't want to write a cartoonishly evil mother figure, so I have to figure one out from first principle or from historical accounts of real people, instead. It's much, much easier for me to write a misguided but ultimately well-intentioned father than it is for me to write a misguided but ultimately well-intentioned mother, because I have a dozen little archetypes for the different ways the dad could work, but I have to design the mother "from scratch" in my brain.

Ultimately, my antagonist-moms are actually /better characters/ than my antagonist-dads, because they're more /carefully written/, because I had to /actually think/ about how I wanted to write them instead of doing it from an instinct that has been honed by writing stories and consuming them. So obviously it's "worth it". But it is also /harder/ and people tend to avoid doing things that are hard.

I have a story that I am writing that is more autobiographical than usual for me. Everyone who has read it has said it feels "more authentic" than my other stuff (whatever the hell that means). But... I don't know how to sell it to people.

"Oh, it's an immigrant-fantasy-political drama about authoritarianism being ignored by people who see the nation in question as little more than a rhetorical tool in an argument they are having about themselves" tells you a general idea, but when I ask other people, they want a structure. "How does your second act end?"/ "Who is the love interest?"/etc. This story... does not have that kind of structure. It's harder for me to explain, or to pitch to people.

I think if stories weren't that commodified, and if people were pushed to write from reality instead of from archetypes, it would be far far easier to do things like pass the Bechdel Test. But because you need to have these structures, and people need to know what boxes to put characters inside of in their heads, it becomes much harder as a writer to change what should be incredibly easy things. Which is why stuff like #OwnVoices helps.

The protagonist of my "more autobiographical" novel is not... a hero. Or a villain. Or an antihero. Or an underdog. She doesn't fit the "I came into this country with fifteen cents in my pocket" immigrant narrative, and she doesn't fit the "I am a [nationality] in every way except that my parents are foreign weirdos" immigrant narrative either. She's not inspiring, she's not particularly strong or kickass. She's also not a "loser hero" who sucks at everything. She's... a person, in a situation, who has /some/ skills. I have spent probably thousands of hours in [[https://TVTropes.org][TVTropes.org]] and I don't know what tropes would actually apply to her. I'm sure there are some, since there HAVE to be some, but none come to mind. I keep not being able to tell people "oh, she's like this character, but with this". Or "Oh, she's X character meets Y character".

I can do that with my other stories. "Oh, this guy is like, if a mad scientist became a soccer-dad". "James Bond, but she's an adorable grandmother". "If Jesus was also George Washington". "What happens when you mix Danny Phantom and Buffy the Vampire Slayer". "What if Rambo, but trans?".

With a story based on much more real things, with which I have personal experience... I don't have a pitch of ten words or fewer.

****** This is a nice honest evaluation of a writer's own work, thank you for sharing this. It really gives me a sense of how it is from the other side.

I know for myself that I find it easier to put time into a movie/tv/story if I can identify some tropes which give me something to 'hold on to' and provide me a framework to take in the story. I think...if we learn how to distinguish between masculine/male and feminine/female then we might get more use out of tropes which are overwhelmingly masculine/feminine without feeling that a male must be involved?

-------------------------

One show that had conflicts from a well-meaning but not villainous mother is Malcolm in the Middle. Her children were all boys so no test passing, but the conflicts seemed natural to mother/children.

I never saw Roseanne, but maybe some conflicts there?

Maybe. Part of the problem with this kind of bias in writing is that it shows up even in the macro-structure of certain stories.

For example, look at the Hunger Games. Katniss is the Strong Powerful Female Protagonist... but also she's kind of coded masculine (she's rough, and tough, and she /hunts/ and she's emotionally closed off) and all of the bad guys are these... campy vaguely-gay-coded people who are all delicate and bright-coloured.

I think that children's shows are actually where the most progress is happening right now. The She-Ra and Carmen Sandiego reboots have been great at providing blends of feminine and masculine things, vilifying none of them, and My Little Pony probably paved the way for super-girly heroes who are still seen as kickass.

Something I would love to see is a story with a very feminine /man/ as the protagonist, in a way that isn't just making fun of him the whole time. Unless feminine men are seen as just as "legitimate" an option for a protagonist as masculine women (who are the default for Action Hero Female Protagonist), there's still going to be that subtext that being masculine is always better and being feminine is always worse. Which will hurt stories that have feminine people, men or women, in them.

I have only watched a handful of episodes of Malcolm in the Middle, I liked how she was written in the ones I watched, because she seemed to ultimately love her children while also winding up in conflict with them. I have also never watched Roseanne, so I have no idea there. BoJack Horseman's treatment of Beatrice is pretty amazing, I would recommend that show as well.

But... so are a lot of people in BoJack Horseman.

In a way, that show does what I said incredibly well, just because /every character/ is fucked up in some way. So nobody ends up in that "weirdly perfect" position (even if some people think Diane does, which in my view is just... those people not paying attention to the many ways Diane is screwed up and screws up). They all have areas of competence and areas of incompetence, and they all.... fail. Often.

Very often, women are portrayed as victims, or as "just" victims. Beatrice is a victim AND an abuser. She is sad AND cruel. She's not just not perfect, she's a terrible person. And yet, her life is so sad and broken...

I don't know, I really like that. It shows her be a /person/, even if she's a terrible person. That's good.

As for not a mess, or coping in healthy ways, I like Mr. Peanutbutter's view, and what about the kids in a trenchcoat - they seem to have it together?

Huh, I guess that does make Beatrice a sort of complete person. Wow, I now have a better appreciation of what the writers did with her, and can maybe get a handle on how I feel about her.

And what you said about the rest of the cast, I am starting to think it may be why I don't stop watching once I start. On the surface there is nothing positive about them, but maybe the point is that they are all shown to be human...

***** The one show I've noticed that obviously made an effort to pass the bechdel test every (or most) episode was Star Trek Deep Space Nine. For most of the series, there's two main female characters, Kira & Dax, and a lot of episodes will start off with the two of them having a random conversation about their career or their cultures or meeting up at the bar or something about their personal lives.

I think it was in response to the criticism The Next Generation got because Troi & Dr. Crusher were overshadowed by their male colleagues and didn't have a relationship together outside of work. I was glad Deep Space Nine made an effort.

Voyager was the first Star Trek with a majority female cast, so passing the bechdel test was natural.

*** You've hit upon the problem of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operationalization][operationalisation]], I think: we have a concept ("spirit") that we want to assess that we can mostly agree on, but coming up with an instrument (a "test") that we can use to decide what movies (or what fraction of movies) incorporate this concept is much more difficult, and it is likely that any test will exclude some cases that we would, in retrospect, want to include; and include some cases that fit its letter but not its spirit.

The bottom line is that social sciences worth the name are /hard/, and Bechdel Test is just one, imperfect operationalisation, which caught on because of its simplicity and first-mover advantage. For all its imperfection, it has certainly proved to be a useful one.

***** My Christian friends also hit on the depiction of sex in the Hollywood (especially) films. The question is “Is there any love relationship between married husband and wife? Is there functional working marriage described?” (I am not sure whether there is a name for it).

The point is that in the most films all romantic relationships are between unmarried couples or if they are married, their marriage is almost without exception heading towards divorce, and then we are the square one. There is almost no film (some TV shows, e.g. just finished “Madam Secretary”) where married couple would live happily together and they would just do something else than having their marriage on rocks.

To get discussion back to the HP universe. Is it really normal in British schools that no teacher is married? (Yes, later on Pottermore JKR made Professor McGonagall married and widowed), and that aside from Weasleys and paradoxically Dursleys (who both perfectly fit the above test, BTW) there is no functional married couple in whole HP universe?

But while Harry Potter does have a remarkable lack of married characters, your overall point is misplaced. There are lots of happily married couples in film and TV, they just tend not to be the main characters. This is for the same reason that we don't see lots of films about someone sitting around watching Netflix all day, or filling out paperwork (unless those are starting points for them to go on to do something else) -- audiences want interesting and unusual scenarios from their fiction, and everything that makes it into a film has to be justified in those terms.

The ordinary everyday emotions of a long happy marriage may be wholesome, but they have no dramatic interest. So either the main characters don't get involved in romance and focus on other things, or else they're in a more uncertain situation like starting a new romantic relationship or salvaging/getting out of a dysfunctional one.

I am still thinking about “Madam Secretary” (or “Joan of Arcadia” from the same author) ... there is a lot of drama outside of their marriage, there is a lot of drama inside of their family (even though mostly about their kids), there is even a lot of sex (well, kind of in the background, it is PG-13, but it is obvious, it is there), and still they don't fight for salvaging of their marriage all the time.

It does not have a marriage on the rocks, instead it shows the fights and arguments married couples have in a positive light. It happens, we work through it, amends are made, and we are moving forward now.

My wife and I love that show, it's one of the few where the husband isn't useless and the wife isn't trapped in some loveless marraige.

Test for that would be really interesting, how many times is the husband portrayed are near incompetent? There are shows where they push that premise while advertising it.

  The Bechdel test has inspired others, notably feminist and antiracist critics and fans, to formulate criteria for evaluating works of fiction, in part because of the Bechdel test's limitations.[53] In interviews conducted by FiveThirtyEight, women in the film and television industry proposed many other tests that included more women, better stories, women behind the scenes, and more diversity.[56]

  The "Mako Mori test", formulated by Tumblr user "Chaila"[57] and named after the only significant female character of the 2013 film Pacific Rim, asks whether a female character has a narrative arc that is not about supporting a man's story.[53] Comic book writer Kelly Sue DeConnick proposed a "sexy lamp test": "If you can replace your female character with a sexy lamp and the story still basically works, maybe you need another draft."[59][60]

Looking back at Harry Potter, arguably some characters fail the Mako Mori test off the bat - Fleur, Cho, even Lily would potentially fall down that rabbit hole off the bat. In terms of sexy lamps, a lot of 80s movies with plucky teen boys & their wise older mentor have them as a 3rd act motivator - and a lot of modern anime, too.

** I do think that it's true that while the HP setting is nominally egalitarian (and has been for longer than Muggle), the storyline pretty male-dominated when it comes to dialogue and importance to the story, even when it didn't have to be. To reuse a list I wrote a while ago,

- All of the top-tier magic users actually involved in the story, even tangentially (Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grendelwald, Flamel?) are men. None of their genders are plot-relevant.
- The highest-ranked woman in the books is Amelia Bones: head of DMLE and an influential member of the Wizengamot. She shows up for one scene, then gets killed off-screen. Probably the highest-ranked woman in the books who gets meaningful screen time is /Dolores Umbrige/.
- Harry's ongoing rivals and enemies (Draco, Lucius, Snape, Voldemort)---all men. It just so happens that the Malfoys had a son, and it just so happens that it's Lucius who goes around playing politics with Dumbledore and doing DeathEatery things, while Narcissa stays home and mothers Draco. Snape's love life and rivalries are too important for the plot, so let that pass, but if it were Tamara Riddle, who is no more capable of love than Tom, what would it have changed, really?
- Ditto pretty much anyone who knew Harry's parents, including his godfather. Apparently, Lily had no female friends who bothered to show up in the story.
- More generally, when influential adult female characters do show up, they are almost always schoolteachers, love-interests, mother-figures, or some other traditionally female role. (It's telling that Molly's drive to fight Bellatrix came from her own child being threatened. Bellatrix is a deliberately 1-dimensional character who has nothing but her sadism and obsession with Voldemort.)
- Remember the Triwizard, when one of the Champions broke down and failed a Task? The same one who had previously worn impractical clothing to a confrontation with a dragon? That must have been the Champion who was entered against their will, the underage, unprepared one. No? Must have been the Hufflepuff, then. Not the Hufflepuff either?
- But, of course, there's Hermione Granger, a hard-working, competent, proactive witch. But, remember how she become friends with Harry? The most competent witch in her year was placed, through a contrived sequence of events, in a situation in which she was helpless, so that she could be rescued by the male lead and his best friend's heroics.

*** JK Rowling's general approach is that magic should be able to solve /material/ problems but not /human/ or /societal/ problems. As such, while wizarding society is depicted as materially different to the Muggle world - different consumer goods, different professions, different currency and institutions - the way the people relate to each other and how society is structured are intended to be essentially familiar to a Muggle observer.

I think this was exactly the correct approach to take: it means the books simultaneously capture the wish fulfilment element of having magic, while also keeping the characters and conflicts relatable. It also helps to make the world feel more genuine, as changes in the nature of human relationships/society will strike readers as much more odd than changes in material circumstances.

The result is that wizarding society generally reflects the real world. Sometimes this is via a magical analogue (such as blood-prejudice for racism), but often it is a direct parallel (such as the class conflict between Malfoys and Weasleys). Only very rarely does wizarding society possess a genuinely novel societal problem with no Muggle counterpart (most obviously, inter-species relations).

The way in which the sexes relate and their position in society falls into the "direct parallel" category.

For reference, here's a picture of John Major's cabinet in 1996:

[[https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03301/1996cabinet-group-_3301234k.jpg]]

All characters specific to Harry Potter's story (excepting Flamel, whom I had tagged with a question mark for a reason). The setting, as far as we can tell, gives wizards and witches equal educational opportunities and other opportunities to gain power (however defined). If we postulate that Dumbledore-grade genius/talent/power (however defined) has a higher probability of occurring in wizards than in witches, that would make it a part of the setting, but I don't think there is much of a case for that with a sample size this small.

******* The qualifications "that appear in Harry's story" or "in Harry's life" are pretty meaningless qualifications since, you know, basically everything we know about the setting is via Harry's life. If a character doesn't appear in Harry's life, they don't appear.

For example: the top-tier magic users that appear in Harry's life are also the only top-tier magic users we know of, and they are all male.

Similarly, Amelia Bones is both the highest ranking (living) female Ministry official who we know of, and the highest ranking female Ministry official in Harry's life.

Etc.

The point is that in all these categories, men dominate the top levels - magic, political power, wealth, etc. This is a faithful depiction of real life gender inequality. But what it /isn't/ is an egalitarian utopia.

To say that the HP world is egalitarian because women have the same magical potential as men is like saying the real world is egalitarian because women have the same intelligence as men. Nonetheless, men dominate society, especially in the 1990s... and similarly, in magical society, it's a very male-dominated society.

As for Bagnold, a Margaret Thatcher analogue, unless you think Thatcher being Prime Minister meant Britain had become an egalitarian society, then Bagnold's existence doesn't do much to make the world seem more egalitarian. But in any event, I think the focus of this discussion is on the society /as depicted in the books/. Of course JKR has added in a load of extra female Ministers for Magic in the "extended canon", but that doesn't suddenly make the society depicted in the books more egalitarian. If anything, it would seem to introduce a strange regression to wizarding society whereby women seem to be reducing in role.

******** I recognise the challenge of separating the lead character's experience from the setting, but I don't think the qualifications are as meaningless as you say. For example, the fact of Amelia Bones's existence contributes to the egalitarianism of the setting; but her negligible role in Harry's story contributes to the imbalance in the story.

We also get our fair share of historical references. For example, as far as we can tell, Hogwarts founders were the top-tier wizards for their time, and they were gender-balanced. More generally, top-tier wizardry is a category that simply does not exist IRL and has nothing comparable IRL. IRL, a tyrant cannot exist without followers to enforce his or her will; in Potterverse, Voldemort empowered the Death Eaters far more than the other way around. Thus, even if the author set out to mirror RL society, it is a far more arbitrary decision than the others.

The reason I had asked you if you replied to the correct post is that in a different post I /did/ speculate about what a hypothetical "egalitarian utopia" may or may not look like, and your reply would have been a very meaningful reply to that.

It's only logical that we are going to have a more strong male lead. The magicall world as portrayed by Rowling reminds a lot the kinghts' age on the times of King Arthur (since she is British that's not really eye opening), that's why a lot of the women are "trophy wives" That stay at home without real power. Also McGonagall is a strong female character that we see a lot in the movies, but of course in a more motherly way. In conclusion when you watch a fiction that appeals to male teens most of the times you will see the females toned down the opposite happens in female appealing fiction.

**** I also have an opinion and (like to think I) can discuss things!

+Firstly, I'm not sure if the target audience of HP is teen males. At the very least, it starts as more of a general children's series.+ (Edit: didn't address what [[/u/mrcaster][u/mrcaster]] actually said.)

Secondly, while the wizarding world may be styled after medieval times, it's also quite entwined with our modern world and addresses issues like racism rather blatantly. It certainly doesn't have to address sexism openly, but there's no reason it couldn't simply because of the knight-era inspiration.

Thirdly, I really don't think men are "toned down" in the relevant way in books targeted at teenage girls. Stereotypically, you've got Twilight, The Hunger Games, Divergent, etc. -- some of which have strong female leads, to be sure, but also have extremely strong male leads and powerful men. It might be true that books aimed at girls are less likely to be examples of unconsidered patriarchy. However, there's no reason other genres couldn't try to avoid it too. And just because something is in a genre which typically has patriarchal tropes does not excuse it from falling into them.

In fact, and this may be controversial, I'd argue the opposite: showing a world which has detrimental ideas and structures -- racism, sexism, homophobia -- without condemning them is something of a tacit endorsement. It doesn't have to be the central thesis of the story for it to be addressed. It doesn't have to be spelled out for the reader, it doesn't have to be dwelt on, it doesn't have to take someone out of the narrative; all it needs is to be slightly framed as detrimental, rather than something that just exists. What HP demonstrates is the insidious nature of these structures: they exist passively, in the background, unintentionally reinforcing the ideas. Unconsidered patriarchy.

All that said, I had never noticed everything [[/u/turbinicarpus][u/turbinicarpus]] pointed out about the elements of patriarchy in HP. Whether that's an indication that I've been so exposed to blatantly male-dominated media that I didn't think about it, or that this really doesn't matter after ...well. I don't know.

I didn't want to get into the whole big discussion, though.

I do wonder if HP was, in some sense, a missed opportunity to showcase an egalitarian society that has been egalitarian for literally millennia---with wands being the Great Equaliser between the sexes when it comes to capacity for labour and violence alike, and with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition][demographic transition]] that took place millennia before any Muggle society.

**** Fair points, all. I haven't read many stories that took place in a British school, so I don't have the same benevolent-headmaster stern-headmistress association, but there might be one for all I know. (Still doesn't preclude Fem!Grindelwald. :P) And, I agree on "default" gender of antagonists.

That said, I think that you're overstating the difficulty of convincing the reader a bit: readers generally take this sort of thing in stride and might even remember the character better. For a somewhat distant example, the character of Toph Beifong from /Avatar: The Last Airbender/ was originally conceived as a boy, before ultimately being written as a girl. I think that it's fair to say that she is a far more memorable character as a girl than she would have been as a boy. However, we don't have a way of resolving what-ifs like that, and I don't have much interest in psychoanalysing Rowling about why she did something in a certain way, so I'll happily concede that you may well be right.

Regarding Ron's brothers, I don't think they contributed to the male-ness that much, since they don't actually show up that often. However, I've focused on decisions that wouldn't radically change the storyline or the spirit of the series and didn't involve too many moving parts and, as you say, gender-swapping Ron's brothers would have been something that would have affected Ron greatly, so I omitted it.

**** I get what you are saying, I think, about going the easy route, but I take exception to some of your examples.

In the books, the Headmaster is very much softer than almost any other adult in the school, and Minerva is the Deputy Headmistress who I generally assume to be in charge of discipline and would need to appear stern regardless of gender.

Draco, if female, would change a lot. First, it would look like 'princess-bashing', something that seems gender specific and different from the generic privileged-useless-child bashing we get in the books. Also, any antagonism between the female Draco and either Ron or Harry would take on a strong sexual component due to their all going through puberty together while having such strong feelings toward each other - just see the numerous fics with Harry/Draco or Hermione/Draco tags.

Ron as female could have been very workable, and quite interesting - having her be something of a rough-and-tumble sort would have added a lot to the story. I don't think we get a tomboy anywhere else in the story....maybe some of the quidditch players, but I don't remember it being explicitly presented.

Lucius is a bit tricky, to my mind. He is so subservient toward Voldemort... the way it is it shows the dangers of patriarchal systems. If female....I think it might have hurt the story from gender politics angles. Bellatrix at least seems bloodthirsty, only going along with Voldemort since he engages her in what she already likes...though I have no clarity on what she was like before Azkaban.

******** Actually, female YA is usually girl/boy/boy. The Mortal Instruments ends up having an ensemble cast, but at the very start of the series, the main "trio" is Clary (girl protagonist), Simon (supporting lead/friend), & Jace (love interest). The Infernal Devices, another Cassandra Claire series, has a much more straightfoward trio with Tessa (girl protagonist), Jem (supporting lead/friend), and Will (guy love interest).

The Hunger Games is weird in that it doesn't have a standard trio for all the books, but in the first book it would probably be Katniss (girl protagonist), Peeta (guy love interest), & Haymitch (mentor). The third book firmly establishes the YA staple of Katniss (girl protagonist), Gale (supporting lead/friend), and Peeta (guy love interest).

Twilight has Bella (girl protagonist), Edward (guy love interest), and Alice (female friend), one of the only female YA novels to do so. By the third novel though, it's settled into Bella (girl protagonist), Jacob (supporting lead/friend), and Edward (guy love interest).

I think the only "mainstream" female YA series I've read that has the girl/girl/guy trio is the Uglies series and maybe Delirium. Both have been praised for their "unusual" focus on female relationships and both /also/ have a male supporting lead outside the trio. The female friends in both turn antagonistic.

It is fun to read the HP books, especially bashing!fics, as a cautionary tale of unconsidered patriarchy - the same way I see Star Wars sometimes.

Both Dumbles and Yoda f'd things up very badly, despite having ridiculous amounts of influence and personal power.

Most of the villains and men who made bad decisions can be seen (canonically even) as suffering badly (if unconsciously) from lack of important feminine relationships (be it guidance, support, or even simple understanding).

I don't know about Star Wars, but there are women in HP who went against their own instincts because some man told them to (Minerva, Narcissa, others?) which led to bad results for themselves and those they might care about.

Given how well Bones performed in a position of significant power, and how Minerva might have done if she properly executed her position of Deputy, and Hermine and several other women showed themselves to be both able and rational in general....it might be said that it all illustrates that women should be encouraged to make their own decisions and trusted to carry responsibility when they choose it.

***** It just seemed appropriate to the concept.

I tend to ‘go intellectual' rather than feel so I like to see people think things through. I get a bit disappointed when people hold to things or argue points based on habit and comfort rather than thinking things through.

Re Patriarchy, it has been the ‘norm' for so long that even some feminists are just ‘so-called', saying that women too can occupy Patriarchal positions. This saddens me more than I like to say.

People are starting to recognize that women bring a lot more to a situation than just being able to act like a man. “Feminine” needs to be given proper regard, not just for women as people do but also on how it effects boys/men, society, and human engagement with life and its experiences.

****** Interesting. In some sense, this is the opposite of what I have just posted in response to your other query---that it would be good to see more "normal" or even "mediocre" female characters in film. (To paraphrase one professor whose quote I can't find at the moment, equality will be judged not by how many extraordinary women get tenure but if as many mediocre women will get tenure as mediocre men.) I do recognise that this presumes that the positions remain as they are, and, as you say---patriarchal.

But yes, I agree that in the present context, women do bring more to the situation. Once we've had perfect equality for a few generations (i.e., not any time soon, if ever), we might be able to tease out how much of that is innate and how much is societal conditioning.

******* I don't think they are exclusive.

What I was saying about unconsidered patriarchy was big-picture societal stuff. It is something that affects everyone and most aspects of culture.

When we talk about movies and other depictions, especially those that intend to portray some representation of modern reality, I think it is very important to have as thorough a representation of the reality of women's experiences as possible - not necessarily all in one film but over all the offerings.

And, in general, the more people can appreciate the real life experiences of gender issues currently the more likely we are to move toward something better for everyone. We have seen this with racism, cultures, even religions. Anytime there is some attempt at bringing new aspects of any segment of a population's lives to the attention of society in general things seem to improve, with everyone (including the people depicted) gaining a more holistic view of how people are affected.

Basically, Feminine aspects coming to the fore or at least deeply imbued into masculine roles.

It's a feminist movie, in that the female characters are independent, make their own choices and have their own struggles that actually inform the plot. Galadriel is offered the ring, and unlike Gandalf and Elrond, we literally see the process that tempts her, and her ultimate decision is more final and self-sacrificing than theirs. Arwen doesn't let her father's wishes interfere with living her life the way she wants, and willingly puts her life on the line for that belief. And obviously we have the 'I am no man' moment.

I mean, aside from army movies and such, women make up the majority of the population. How hard could it be to find, in 90+ minutes worth of film, a scene with two named women talking to each other about something other than a man? Should be trivial and be found in an overwhelming majority of films, right?

The "named gay Mexican women with one leg" comparison is hyperbole at best and strawmaning at worst.

It doesn't have to be an awkward, “Hi, I'm a woman and so are you and here are our names and now let's talk about our jobs for five minutes before getting back to the real plot.” There are so many films where there's one main female character and she is surrounded by men and only has plot-relevant conversations with men. It can kinda feel like that character is a token woman. It's not that hard to have two. (Although I acknowledge it can be harder when there's source material, like a movie adaptation of a book)

The Bechdel test isn't about what films are good or bad; it's a surface-level evaluation of the inclusion of female characters and the quality of their dialogue. There's a lot of good films that fail the Bechdel test. Would they have been even better films if they had passed? Maybe.

******* Why do they have to be forced?

Like, if literally every Marvel film can have multiple characters who are men talk about topics that are not women (say, for example, the fucking plot maybe?) why would it be "forced" to have women appear and be relevant enough to have an actual conversation with one another that doesn't revolve around a man?

The idea that in order to achieve this, it would have to be "forced in", is the idea that it's somehow not natural for women to exist around each other in an interesting or useful fashion, and interact, unless it's about men somehow.

In the original comic that introduced the test, /Alien/ was the movie the character said was the most recent one they saw that passed it. You know, /Alien/, the beloved science fiction horror classic? There is no reason to believe a film that passes the test would have to be, or would be likely to be, a bad film.

Adding in a random scene "to pass the test" is obviously going to be detrimental if it doesn't add anything. But adding in a random scene to have two men talk would also be bad, because adding in random scenes that don't do anything is bad regardless. Yet nobody worries about people "forcing in" scenes that don't add anything to the plot when they involve two men talking about some random thing. It's almost as though writing for underrepresented groups is held to a higher standard than writing for the default, so that having a random shitty scene is a problem if it involves women talking but not (or not as much) if it involves men talking.

MM could have been written as a man or woman without changing fundamental aspects of her role in the plot. The same can be done for other movies without detriment. Easy peasy.

********* TBH, I am not much of a movie watcher, and context matters. (See /Moonlight/, for example: if any movie wouldn't need a Bechdel Test, it's that one.)

What's missing? Maybe women as normal people? Female characters who are not in traditional female roles but are also /not/ extraordinary, who screw up as much as male characters with similar level of importance and similar consequences? Or, while every character in a typical major film is better-than-average-looking unless they are specifically intended to be ugly, deformed, or disfigured, female characters have a much higher bar than male. (The classic example in this fandom is Hermione's character played by Emma Watson, who I suspect is much more beautiful than Rowlings's mental image of Hermione when writing the books.)

It's complicated, because films need to at least somewhat relate to reality as it is, but the reality as it is is quite patriarchal today and was even more so in the past. So, for example, if you have a female soldier or officer, it is, in fact, realistic for her to be extraordinary, because in a patriarchal society, only extraordinary women join the armed forces (loosely speaking). Or, along similar lines, it's common to see an all-male team on the "bad guys'" side and an all-female or mixed-gender team on the "good guys'" side, and almost never the other way around. But, would that have its own baggage? Almost certainly.

In addition, some occupations (such as delivery) are disproportionately male in part because of differential threat of sexual harassment and assault man and women face when doing this type of work. Should a movie pretend that this is not the case for the sake of equal representation?

But, to summarise, outside of genres and subgenres collectively referred to as "chick flicks", female characters, when they show up, are considered big deal, special, in some sense representing something bigger than themselves. (This is, of course, the case in RL situations as well.) We need to make it so that it's no longer a big deal.

To quote myself from the other subthread, I do wonder if HP was, in some sense, a missed opportunity to showcase an egalitarian society that has been egalitarian for literally millennia---with wands being the Great Equaliser between the sexes when it comes to capacity for labour and violence alike, and with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition][demographic transition]] that took place millennia before any Muggle society.

Flamel is a historical figure---fine---but gender-flipping Dumbledore or Grindelwald would probably make no difference. (It helps that they're both very old by the time canon rolls around.) Gender-flipping Voldemort depends on how much the difference between the way males typically express psychopathy differs from the way females do is due to societal conditioning and how much is due to biology---AFAIK an open question.

But, I don't see why in a millennia-egalitarian society, Fem!Draco wouldn't be expected to carry on the family name, socially dominate her year in Slytherin, and get into fights with Harry Potter. Nor do I see why Florus de la Coeur couldn't put a dragon to sleep but panic when attacked by gryndilows and fail the second task; while Viktoria Krum hexes the dragon in the face, transforms herself into a shark, and asks Hermione out for the winter ball---and Hermione accepts, because she is flattered by the attention and curious, but eventually decides she prefers men.

Maybe Molly could show up in more of the Order's plans, rather than just when her own children were in jeopardy.

The trouble with speculating about these things is, of course, that we /don't/ have an example of a millennia-egalitarian society, so we have no idea how people would act there.

********** *Demographic transition*

The phenomenon and theory of the demographic transition refers to the historical shift in demographics from high birth rates and high infant death rates in societies with minimal technology, education (especially of women) and economic development, to demographics of low birth rates and low death rates in societies with advanced technology, education and economic development, as well as the stages between these two scenarios. Although this shift has occurred in many industrialized countries, the theory and model are frequently imprecise when applied to individual countries due to specific social, political and economic factors affecting particular populations.

However, the existence of some kind of demographic transition is widely accepted in the social sciences because of the well-established historical correlation linking dropping fertility to social and economic development. Scholars debate whether industrialization and higher incomes lead to lower population, or whether lower populations lead to industrialization and higher incomes.

********* Not the person you were responding to, but like... nerdy women who are just nerdy.

Most "nerdy women" in fiction are also /incredible overachievers/. See: Hermione, the girl from Percy Jackson who was better than him at everything, and in general that trope of "hypercompetent female sidekick who is there partially to make the hero look incompetent at the start, but whose story takes second place to the hero's" (Trinity from The Matrix, Wyldstyle from the Lego movie, The Wasp in Antman, Alice in The Magicians, Gamora from Guardians of the Galaxy... I could go on).

But there are women who... suck at things, except they have certain interests and they're good at those things. Just like there are men who suck at things except for whatever their specialty is.

One of the BEST FEMALE CHARACTERS (TM) I have /ever/ watched in /anything/ is Entrapta from the She-Ra reboot. Not just because she's "smart" and a woman (which is the default at this point, since most trios that do ego/superego/id don't make the woman the protagonist, so it's either superego or id, and having the woman be the "emotional one" isn't just annoying but /boring/ because it has been done to death, so she ends up being the "smart one" instead. Heaven forbid you had two women in a trio...). It's that she's a.) allowed to be wrong, b.) allowed to do things that are morally bad without being painted as /irredemably evil,/(a lot of women's representation is either "this person is morally perfect and how dare you question her?" or "this woman is heartless and cruel" without any in-between) and c.) very clearly incompetent at certain things (social things, mostly, but also other things as well). She's also autistic-coded in a way that isn't insulting or shitty but actually feels well-thought-out.

She's not a hyper-competent super-person who is still relegated to the role of sidekick despite that. She's not a love interest for the protagonist or the /one guy/ who is also interested in robotics. She's allowed to be a person, and a /weird/ person at that, and have that... acknowledged. Everyone who knows Entrapta knows that she's a genius. They also know she's weird and quirky and confusing. She is the mad scientist, not the hypercompetent female assistant who has to keep track of everything because mad scientists aren't expected to have executive skills. For a villainous take on the same archetype, Dr. Bellum from the new Carmen Sandiego is done pretty well.

I would also like more representation of disabled women generally. It always seems like if you're a man and you're missing a hand, you're a cool/scary villain or a badass hero with a dark backstory. If you're a woman and you're missing a hand... you don't exist, because you lost too many hotness points or something. I can think of two notable characters who are both women and disabled (Bennett from Dollhouse and Oracle/Batgirl from Batman, post-Killing Joke). And while I love both of them, one went from being Batgirl to being a hypercompetent genius sidekick who can't do the story thing because she's stuck in a room full of computer screens; and the other appears in less than half of the episodes of one of the two seasons of the show, and is basically used to give another character trauma points. It could be better.

********** First off, thank you for answering. My question was in a reply to someone but I am very interested in reading people-in-general's answers. I doubt any 1 person could cover the topic thoroughly.

So, would it be over-simplifying to say you would like to see socially awkward women?

I have four examples I would love you to comment on:

1) Leslie Winkle from Big Bang Theory. She was nerdy and not they typical 'female' represented in media. I think Chuck Lorre (show runner or something) said they stopped having her in the show because they couldn't figure out how to write her character. To be fair (sort of), they did start to make her a bit shrill toward the end of her appearances.

2) My Little Pony. I am 99% convinced that the portrayal of a variety of genuine-feeling female character types is why it became so popular with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic_fandom][Bronys]]. I think people /want/ this sort of honest variety of female representations. This included Pinkie Pie.

3) General 'nerd' shows. The women mostly seem to come across as judging the men, as if thinking "I hate having to spend time with them". Do you know of any shows where this is not the case? It always seems to me that the female is just biding her time until some knightly figure sweeps her away to a 'normal' life. The only exception is Amy Fowler from Big Bang Theory who is a bit over-awkward but in a way that can be seen as just a slight exaggeration of a normal female (within the context of the show).

Other more serious movies seem to have this too, but in sometimes less obvious ways (Gina in The Girl in the Cafe, Arlene McKinny in Pay it Forward?).

*********** u/Eager_Question:
#+begin_quote
  So, would it be over-simplifying to say you would like to see socially awkward women?
#+end_quote

Yes, because they don't /have/ to be socially awkward. Entrapta is a great example, but for a more socially capable one, perhaps we could use Applejack from My Little Pony? Applejack is a fairly smart, competent person /in her field/. And she's a not-so-smart, incompetent person in other fields. And... that's fine. Another good example is Rainbow Dash, when she got into reading. She has a very specific thing she loves a lot and gets very excited about that thing, but it doesn't magically make her competent in other areas. Rainbow Dash doesn't pick up a book once and then spontaneously become Twilight.

What I am concerned with is the fact that very often, because people want to make a "Strong Female Character", they write incredibly hypercompetent, broadly amazing people. Which is fine, but then somehow those people are still relegated to second fiddle, and don't have a lot of clout, and are generally treated as if they weren't an incredibly competent person. Which means a lot of female characters "feel boring" to people (because they don't grow, because what the fuck direction is left for them to grow in?) while at the same time seeming like they could just solve the story if they had to and it's weird that they don't.

I want a mixture of competent and incompetent. A character who is a specialist in some thing, very good at that thing, and... really terrible in other things. Where that's okay, and not treated as though somehow she's /supposed/ to be perfect at everything. For a good example of this done "better" and "worse", compare Book Hermione to Movie Hermione. Movie Hermione is a lot more of the "hypercompetent girl who is not the protagonist for some reason" type of character than Book Hermione, who has clear areas of incompetence (not knowing shit about magical world culture, for example, where Ron does).

1.) I like Leslie Winkle a lot, but she kind of grew stale after a while. Also the way she was written was as having some sort of superiority complex(?), which would have been fine as a general character flaw if not for the fact that the guys (especially Leonard) were so consistently inept that it seemed like she was right about her assessment. She seemed to me to be something of a wasted opportunity.

2.) I love My Little Pony, and I think it does a lot of things fantastically. Sadly, I don't think it is in a position to tackle certain issues (especially when it comes to how it treats its villains). One of the virtues of My Little Pony as a show IS that all of its protagonists (and most of the side characters we know!) /are/ a mix of competent and incompetent. They're written as /people/ with /problems/, not as "role models". That's not to say they're not nice people, or that young children seeing them as role models would necessarily be bad (none of them are evil or anything). But it is to say that they are better written than, for example, The Wasp in Ant-Man.

  1. General 'nerd' shows. The women mostly seem to come across as judging the men, as if thinking "I hate having to spend time with them".
#+end_quote

You are super on the money with this. I think "nerd shows" are one of the only places where having women be "the emotions one" is still so persistent, where men are "the brains" and women are "the heart". In superhero shows (SHIELD, Supergirl) there is usually at least one token nerd girl, but I don't know that it's a /lot/ better. In The Big Bang Theory specifically, I think one of the best characters is actually Bernadette, because she's a young mother and pharmacy PhD who is also a bit of a crazy person and incredibly hostile sometimes. It's a good take in a world where mothers are often written to be perfect and mostly there to die tragically.

If you look at The Bing Bang Theory specifically, you can see a lot in the first few seasons where basically every female character is a Straight Man in terms of their comedic role. Their job is to be normal, so that when the guys are weird, the weirdness is accentuated. Compare that to later seasons, where the female characters are also allowed to do crazy things (go to Disney World and dress as princesses) or to get wrapped up in something weird (the episode where they start fighting over whether Red Hulk could lift Thor's hammer) etc.

I don't know if this is because the writers got sick of the repetitiveness of having a good quarter-to-half of their cast being the Straight Man at all times, or if it's because general attitudes about "how funny women are" shifted in the culture during the run of the show, but either way I think it's an improvement.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yeah, this is just the problem with women's agency in stories. "Men do, women are" means that many men feel like they aren't allowed to just "be", and many women feel like they're not allowed to /do/ anything unless they can do it backwards, and in heels, and while looking perfect the whole time. It's not just bad writing, real people often feel trapped by having internalized those ideas. A lot of women are scared to ask men out, even though /every straight man asked/ says that he would love it if women asked him out, because of that kind of thinking that they are supposed to just "be" and if they step out of line that would be bad.

#+begin_quote
  Do you know of any shows where this is not the case?
#+end_quote

Star Trek: Discovery, actually. Every character in DSC is a nerd on some level. So since every character needs to be physically competent and intellectually capable, what you get is differentiation by style and personality as well as skillset. None of the characters are "the strong one", they just... have specific skills (piloting/shooting/whatever) that lend themselves to specific missions. Tilly from DSC is another good nerdy female character. Being /excited/ about learning things is something I like.

The protagonist of DSC is a little bit one-note, and the first season is kind of lacking. But I think it's pretty good and the second season is a great improvement over the first.

I know nothing about the two movies at the end of your post, so I can't comment either way.

I like your definition here - and looking back it seems right on for when I found characters believable as actual people.

I too liked the Disney Princesses scenes in BBT. I think the women there became far more interesting as they were fleshed out to be more than representations of some single aspect of how men sometimes perceive women; I would guess that they needed more stories and had more room to experiment as the show lasted longer and grew in popularity.

About women acting rather than being passive, do they still have "Sadie Hawkins Dance" in schools? (USA) That was all about having the girls approach the boys.

I haven't seen DSC yet. I heard so many bad reviews at the start of the first season that I never really considered watching it.

I thought of another female character from Sci-Fi, the FBI agent from Limitless (TV show). She is not 'pretty' or 'sexy' or 'shrew'. She comes across as a real agent with real family issues who just happens to be female.

Also yeah, season 1 of DSC (to be honest, mostly the first half of season 1) is kind of... lacking. I think you could probably just start with Season 2 and you'd be fine, though it does have some important setup in Season 1.

The subject of the test (female characters) represent about half of the population of the planet and yet are often reduced to a single topic of discussion in fiction: their relationship with a man. If named gay Mexican women with one leg were a large percentage of the population and yet, in fiction, were reduced to discussions between themselves only about their relationship then go ahead and propose a test.
