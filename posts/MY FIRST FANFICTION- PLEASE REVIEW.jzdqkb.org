I've been reading fanfiction for several years now and just thought of publishing one for the fun of it. The fanfic will mostly cover the parallels between Tom Riddle and Harry Potter and Harry with Tom Riddle speaking through his mind. The Fic will diverge heavily from canon and will cover years 1-7. Harry will be smarter, and will eventually get op, but the process will be a long, hard journey and don't expect any “Lord Gryffindor Slytherin Ravenclaws Potter” Stuff in the Fic. Dueling will be a heavy focus as well and I'm not sure of pairings as of now.

All in all, the Fic will be a well written, and slow buildup of Harry as a character.

Please offer constructive criticism in the reviews.

** So this will be a work where Harry is more similar in upbringing with Riddle and where the Horcrux in his head is more active/influencial?

The chapter is alright although some looking over the sentences and some of the scenes might be beneficial. For me it seemed sudden that Harry as you noted is not abused or bullied but the instant a boy insults him in a childish way he straight up has magic cutting the kid's forehead. Now I know he is a child and sensitive but some scenes where he has previous altercations with the boy would work as a build up. The same with the rest of the orphanage's population avoiding him, some more incidents and build up would make it more realistic. Also this accident happening a day before his 11th birthday is iffy(?)somehow, maybe moving it earlier would be better, as to give Harry time to ponder on the accident and how he triggered and influenced it?

The transition to the letter is sudden. Maybe you want to cut straight to the chase considering this will be a full 7 year work but it does not need to be a lot just enough to give an indication.

The interaction with Dumbledore is alright I suppose although it is weird how first thing Harry asks about his parents is how they died? Maybe thats the horcrux's influence? Still he could've askes their names (does he know them) first at least or for Dumbledore to say smth like "... names where James and Lily Potter, some of the bravest/best/corageous/kindest etc. people I've had the pleasure of knowing."

To keep it short, though rough a bit around the edges and this being only the first chapter, it's not bad at all for a first fic. Good job!

**** Ah no worries glad to help.

Also the "...rahter die." is a bit extreme, just say smth like "... he has better things to do" or "doesn't really appeal to him." or "hanging out with kids like him is not something he finds appealing/ he'd enjoy/ he fancies."
