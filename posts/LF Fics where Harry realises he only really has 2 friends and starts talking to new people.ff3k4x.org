Recently read this fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13490793]] and i'm looking for more fics where Harry realises he only really talks to Ron and Hermione and that the other students think he's arrogant or that he just doesn't want more than those 2 friends.

Or perhaps Hermione and the Weasleys have been keeping people away from him

** Easier than Falling Asleep is a good one! I'm very fond of it in general but in this one, Harry's advised to seek out other friends due to time traveling and hesitation in telling Ron and Hermione. I think it does a good job looking at how maturity and friendship are connected and not. Harry talks to a variety of people in this.

** Omg, now that you've gave me this, I really want more of them too. But also had a quick search through the authors works and they really hate having gay ships dont they? They're completely fine with shipping say Draco and harry as long as one of them are female

*** Ellory used to be really big into gay ships, but then something happened then they left the Fandom and came back as a het shipper. Most of their stuff used to gay ships, but after they came back they changed it to be het stuff. But their pureblood culture stuff is still pretty cool.

** I remember one where the quidditch team was helping him basically learn everyone in the school's name. He was learning each year in each house. I don't remember the title though

** I can't remember what fic it was from, but there's a scene that's been floating around my head for a couple of days where someone (Hannah Abbot? Susan Bones) is becoming friends with Harry later in life either later in schooling or after the war. I remember her talking about other students that Harry knew next to nothing about and her commenting about how he had never gotten to know anyone. That by Halloween of first year "auditions for the roles of Harry Potters friends were over and the positions filled." or something.
