Harry and co wrote down every possible senario where people regularly meet in groups from classes to sleeping to feasts and quidditch. They make a list of hundreds of scenarios and ask her to sign each of them individually or just sign it at the bottom. They wrote the DA amongst the list and she gets so frustrated she just signs it at the bottom and they go ahead with the rules on their side


** I read a fic a ways back where Umbridge became minister and thought she was signing a bill to make werewolves beasts, which in context meant legal to kill any time of month and legal to sell their parts, but it had been changed to "Death Eater" at the last minute and she didn't notice, and Hermione presented Lucius a completely legal Draco-heartstring wand

But seriously if you like the idea of Harry tricking Umbridge with loopholes you will love What Would Slytherin Harry Do?

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

** The thing is that the DA was never actually against the rules. Proscribed organizations were the the *regular* meeting of 3 or more students. The DA never met regularly.

** If I remember correctly the decree went "...is defined as regular meeting of three or more..."

So since, provided my memory is not betraying me, they were constantly rescheduling due to quidditch and scheduling conflicts, the DA could hardly be considered regular. Thus one could argue it was actually legal. XD
