#+TITLE: The Marauders were many things. Animagi, rulebreakers, practical jokers, unrepentant slackers from schoolwork. One thing they weren't, and refused to even associate with, was bullies. In fact, when they came across one Severus Snape being bullied in his own house, they took him under their wing.

** I don't know if I've ever seen a fic like this. I honestly love the idea of him having a prank war that looked like it was vicious on the outside so certain parties wouldn't interfere with their friendship but the idea of Snape not only using the Marauders as a whetstone to sharpen his own wit and sneakiness (and potions expertise) but collaborating with them? I love it

  "I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just -"

  "Slipped out?" There was no pity in Lily's voice. "It's too late. I've made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little little Death Eater friends - you see, you don't even deny it! You don't even deny that's what you're all aiming to be! You can't wait join You-Know-Who, can you?"

  He opened his mouth but closed it without speaking.

  "I can't pretend anymore. You've chosen your way, I've chosen mine."

  "No - listen, I didn't mean -"

  "to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?"
