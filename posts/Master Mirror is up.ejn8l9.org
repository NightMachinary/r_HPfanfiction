Just posted the Prologue and the first chapter of Master Mirror! An dark AU adventure spanning the events of the Half-Blood Prince.

​

What if the Mirror of Erised was more than a cursed artifact? When Harry is offered a Faustian Pact that seemingly offers to fix all his problems he does not even think twice before taking it. Voldemort, Death Eater plots, and a dying wizard. Will Harry and Dumbledore manage fix everything before the time is up? A dark adventure across an AU HBP, following a trail thought long lost.

​

I am really looking forward to some feedback. Ill iron out any editing/small typos problems later on, as it's quite late here. Hope you guys enjoy it! Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13469465/1/Master-Mirror]]


** My first recommendation would be to split your paragraphs up. It's kind of hard to judge on my phone, but I can't recall the last time I read a story where a block of text took up literally my entire screen (and then some).

*** Thanks, will do. I was just trying to update the chapters, but when I open the story it still shows the original versions. Is that a sort of bug, or am I doing something wrong?

​

Edit: Nvm, it worked.

** Just curious, how much knowledge about 'The Witcher' should we have before starting this work? Would a lack of knowledge of that series hinder our ability to understand what's going on?

*** None. I even wondered if it's worth tagging it as a cross-over, but since Master Mirror is a Witcher character, I figured it would be best. Him and his persona will be explained in this fic, and so far I don't plan any other additions from that Universe.
