Why is Dumbledore referred to as an “old coot” so much? I tend prefer fics that don't view him as perfect/weirdly all-knowing (which unfortunately means I come across a lottttt of awful bashing fics)

But

Dumbledick, dumbdork (shudder), old coot (why not literally anything else please), meddling, goat fucker, etc. All these are overused to /death/.

To me it's a sign of lazy writing, especially if third person narration calls him a meddlesome old coot or whatever. I can buy that an angry emo 14 year old Harry would call him a goat fucker in a moment of anger, but not that literally everyone in the entire universe will do so at random and inappropriate times.

Not only is it highly unprofessional for some adult in the context of their job to randomly call a respected member of society a stupid name, coot is so /mild/ in its word choice. (Looking at you, fics where Amelia Bones or whomever meets Indy!Harry and immediately calls Dumbledore an asshole)

Was this done in some super-popular fic early in the fandom? Why has “meddlesome old coot” taken such deep root?


** My guess is that "coot" is such an unusual and old-fashioned sounding word that authors think it fits the Harry Potter universe. And it doesn't sound out-of-place for a politically powerful young Lord Potter-Black-Peverell to say it in a formal Wizengamot setting, as it would if he'd said "Dumblefuck".

Once it entered mainstream fanon, authors began using it because everyone was familiar with it, and probably assumed it was canon or based on canon. Because Voldemort says something similar - he calls Dumbledore an "Old fool" at some point in the books.

Epithets tend to be lazy writing, especially if they're recycled and regurgitated common ones. "Bushy haired bookworm" and "Green-orbed Gryffindor" are the worst. If you're writing a fanfic and use epithets in narration instead of actually using people's fucking /names/, you're doing it wrong.

Don't do this, for the love of Merlin.

*** Man “orbs” instead of eyes is the /worst/

I just picture these horrible green painted pebbles lodged in someone's eye sockets. Makes me think the whole eye has become distended and bulging and entirely green. No thanks

Yeah epithets suck. My pet peeve is slash where the author constantly uses “the shorter wizard” because it has weird sexual power dynamic implications and also like, come on. How often are you thinking about someone's hight/eye color/crappy hair irl?

**** The reason why slash authors do it is because they're trying to avoid ambiguous pronouns. Compare "She took off his shirt" to "He took off his shirt" for a sexy scene with two partners. The hetero pairing makes it obvious who's doing what actions, but with the slash pairing it's unclear.

#+begin_quote
  He took off his shirt.
#+end_quote

vs.

#+begin_quote
  Harry took off his shirt.
#+end_quote

vs.

#+begin_quote
  Harry took off Draco's shirt.
#+end_quote

They think that it's clunky and slows the flow of a sentence to refer to someone's name every time they reference the character. Because they can't use pronouns (he/him/his) without it becoming ambiguous who's doing what action, they instead refer to hair color, eye color, Hogwarts house, or broomstick preference.

#+begin_quote
  The green-orbed Firebolt-owner took off the blonde Nimbus 2000-owner's shirt.
#+end_quote

Now we're cooking!

***** Hang on! Draco owns a Nimbus 2001, not a 2000. This is a grossly inaccuracy, and took me right out of this otherwise flawless sentence.

****** It's because in this fic, Harry is a partial metamorphmagus able ton change the color of his hairs. It is not a "Harry took off Draco shirt scene " but a "Harry took off his shirt " scene

** I've noticed it was especially a theme with post-OotP "Independent" Harry fics. Every author seemed to need to throw in a "Moldyshorts", "Dumbles", "old coot", a shopping trip, and I don't even remember what all else.

** I thought it was one of these canon details that I forgot. It's really strange how it's always exactly the same phrases.

I read some fics where it was Petunia (or Vernon) who made sure to mispronounce his name, just because she's bitter and they have history. And it made sense, you know.

It's a real mystery why old and new fics alike make sure to use it. It really does not bring anything at all, and is even less impactful now that it became a gimmick.

But I'll guess that it's probably more like the use of Voldyshort (which makes no sense at all, for me) and others in this vein; a way to take part in the fanon community more than anything else and to show that Harry is not in league with either/has no respect for them?

** There's a really great bad-guy-but-relateable Dumbledore ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12987401/10/Not-as-Clever-as-He-Thinks][Chapter 10 of Not as Clever by Averagefish) on ffnet.]]

​

I think fanfiction's basically full of lazy writing, because it's mostly young people trying their hand at something they're not very good at.

I do some betaing rather than ranting, though. I reckon once you start a rant it'll never end.

But yeah...shopping trips. What's up with fanfics and shopping trips? Like, really?

*** I think you may have misunderstood what I was asking. (Also I think I've seen this block of text before?/copypasta?)

I'm not asking whether or not people think Dumbledore is good/cool/whatever or not, I'm asking why people refer to him using the same terminology across hundreds of different fanfics
