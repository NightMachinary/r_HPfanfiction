Hi, I'm hoping someone out there has a few recommendations for a fic with Harry having an affinity with animals like in *No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim* linkffn(8541055) or the Fantastic Beasts movies?

â€‹

Ideally a long fic, bonus points if it has him become an animagus and no real love interest until he is much older.


** While it's not harry in linkffn(13640390), the main character is an OC who is very similar to Newt and is actually an Obscurious very skilled in magical creatures. It's a reincarnation fic tho, but it does it better than anyone else by far.

  I'd spent seventeen years in my past life as a veterinarian and now, as they say, I was a wizard. Or, well, I would be if I could use magic without possibly dying. Oh, and let's not forget how my fondness of animals was about to get me into a load of trouble. "W-Why'd you just stand there!" "It was a three-headed dog." "He tried to eat us!" "...H-He was cute..."

  The voices Harry heard, those no one else could, were the only ones that spoke kindly to him growing up. They had spread their whispers across the world to rescue him and at last, found a way; by creating a queen of serpents. The birth of the amber-eyed empress triggers a permanent change in Harry's life, as he enters a world of magic that may protect or destroy him.

  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.
