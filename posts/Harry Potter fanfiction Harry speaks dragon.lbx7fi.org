Harry Potter fanfiction where Harry speaks dragon talk that's in Skyrim


** I think you'd like 'Viing Gut Zii Yah" of ffnet; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11327665/1/0]]

It does have m/f and m/m relationships, but the story is really well done. ( Harry travels to Skyrim before the first task of the Triwizard tournament).
