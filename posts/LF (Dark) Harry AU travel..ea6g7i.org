Basically I'm looking for these kind of fics where Harry travels into an alternate universe (or time travels) where the war against Voldemort is still ongoing but he already lived through his universe. Preferably slash if there is a pairing, no fem!Harry.

(Would love to see Dark!Harry fics in which he joins Voldemort or fics where he's kind of fed up with the order. Also I'm into MoD!Harry or Insane!Harry. But I will also read light!Harry, I'm not picky if it's well written)
