It's not terribly difficult to find fics where Ron betrays the trio, becomes a Death Eater, etc. However, all of those I can find are about bashing Ron. I'm not looking for that. I'm looking for a story that is more sympathetic to Ron. I think there's potential for a good story exploring what would cause Ron to betray his closest friends, showing events from his perspective and looking at his motivations. If anyone knows of any fics like this, I'd be rather grateful to hear about them.

** I know why you're doing this, pretending you actually care what I have to say, that you want to give me a chance to ‘set the record straight' and ‘clear my conscience' or whatever you think will make you feel better about your own cowardice. The simple fact is that /you weren't there/. You weren't forced to scrape by in some wretched tent as the world burned about you, Death Eaters, Snatchers and scrotty, /Imperius/-addled politicians... You all hid in your manors with your House Elves and protective magic, hoping for it all to end.

Yes, you make me sick, and I was a bloody Death Eater! So now, when things are all over and you've had your parades and speeches, you've patted one another on a job well done, you want me to just offer up some sort of long, drawn-out confession where I tell you how I'm just a pathetic, jealous yob who deserves whatever ‘justice' you decide, you and the masses who think only what the Dictaquills tell them to? Moral superiority, my arse...

Sod that. I'm giving you nothing and I sure as hell won't be sharing my story with the /Daily Prophet/. I know how you operate.

Hell no, not to Skeeter. Look, the only person I'll talk to, maybe, is Luna. She can decide whether or not to print whatever in her father's paper.

He's dead? Oh, I didn't know. How did he die?

Of course I didn't have anything to do with it. Why would I be asking if I did? Idiots.

No, I'll never speak with that bitch again, no matter how much she natters on about how I need ‘closure.' She and Potter and what they got up to were what drove me away from that bloody tent. I took a walk to clear my head. Anyone would after seeing that. And then /they/ abandoned /me/, not the other way around, no matter how much she might say otherwise. Fuck. I'm done talking.

I have nothing to say, to you, to her, or anyone else. Except maybe Luna.

No, I won't go into details. Look, bring her in here or throw me through the Veil, I don't care much which. I never expected to live through the end anyway.

I'm chuffed as hell how things turned out. I had a part to play and I played it. And I at least took Harry Bloody Potter down with me when I went. At least there's /some/ justice in the world.

Yes, you can quote me on that. Now get out.

** One of my good friends wrote a fanfic from Ron's perspective...Harry had been murdered by Voldemort, and Ron joined the Death Eaters to secretly take over the job of killing Voldemort. Can't remember what Hermione was doing, but she was a part of the story. It was super good, too, but it died when the website died (she was a moderator on it)...as far as I know, she never published it anywhere else. This was like pre-DH.

*** That was more Ron being an amoral bastard really... but thanks. Reinterpreting a Ron in line with canon as a Death Eater would be really hard. Though blackmail and horcrux/dark magic corruption could do it, Voldemort wanted his recruits to willingly join him in the end. And given that Ron essentially marries a muggleborn down the line, you'd have to pull a major twist to make it believable.
