** Well I've never seen that in a story before. But I have read a story where Sybill admits that the prophecy is fake. The Story is a fun read and is called Saying No by Bobmin356.

Tell me, Albus, what rational man tempts a dark lord into a school full of innocent children, all in the hope that a mere first year student could destroy him?" Dumbledore squirmed uncomfortably. "But Harry, the prophecy said only you could vanquish Voldemort!" The crowd erupted, shouting questions at Dumbledore. A high pitched whistle echoed through the Hall and all eyes returned to the front of the room. Before Harry could speak, a cackling laugh came from the staff table.

Sybill Trelawney stood up on unsteady legs and raised her glass of cooking sherry in salute. "I think you're the only one I didn't fool with that little gem," she said, grinning at Harry. "What?" Dumbledore asked, staring at her in horror. She shrugged. "I was broke and had been evicted from my home. Great Aunt Cassandra taught us well. Find your mark's weakness and exploit it to gain what you need. Though I will admit, she had more luck than I've had. Many of her predictions came true. But then, she was better at reading people than I am."
