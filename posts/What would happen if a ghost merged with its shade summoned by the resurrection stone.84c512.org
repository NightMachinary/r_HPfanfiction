What would happen if a ghost merged with a shade summoned by the resurrection stone?

If you have to have know the person in real life to summon there shade with the resurrection stone Dumbeldore could try with myrtle since she was his student.


** Why stop there? Have the two merge with their /Priori Incantatem/ image standing on a Wizarding portrait of themselves. Do this all inside a Pensieve memory of themselves.

**** priori incantatem cast by elder wand, of course. Also I'm pretty sure that the wands just need to be brothers or whatever its called, not phoenix feather.

*** So myrtle would be the proof of concept and if it works with some sort of positive effect Dumbeldore would do the ghost,shade,portrait,pensive memory,Priori Incantatem image.

** That seems a ludicrous idea, because it's pretty clear the ghost /is/ the soul, and the Resurrection Stone pulls a soul from the Afterlife. So presumably you can't use the Stone to summon someone who became a ghost rather than moving on, or if you could it would summon the ghost to you, not a different shade.

**** The quote, from Sir Nicholas, is /Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod... But very few wizards choose that path./

But I think that by "imprint" one means an imprint of the physical body --- ghosts' ethereal body --- which will house the soul, which does not move on. Mark that Sir Nicholas says wizards can "choose that path", implying it is a choice the wizard makes for themselves. If it were just a matter of leaving a copy of yourself behind, with your consciousness moving on, again, why would it be seen as cowardly to do so? It would be quite the same thing as leaving a magical portrait.

****** I really can't answer under such premises. My entire headcanon on how souls, ghosts and the Stone work requires that ghosts and stone-shades both be the original soul, so I can't make any predictions if that's /not/ the case.

******* Would the stone simple make the ghost closer to what they were in life mabye giveing them back the colour like the stone shades have?

Sort of because the Souls of ghost are not in the after life, whatever the stone does has a stronger effect on them because the extra power that the stone would have used to call the soul from the after live can be used for other thing?

Does that work better with your head canon?

******** That might work. The tale doesn't say anything about it, but it's not /impossible/ Cadmus might have added a ghost-summoning function to his Stone.

** IMO, the stone would just summon the ghost to where the stone is. Maybe it's giving them the ability to choose a second time whether or not to stay as a ghost.

**** No, that's just what Snape mistakenly reckons, but Snape is no big expert on the afterlife; I suspect he doesn't actually believe in it, and thus rationalizes ghosts as a nonsentient echo. At all other times, ghosts are clearly treated as people, and Sir Nicholas (who should know how ghosts work!) clearly explains to Harry that it's the choice of a soul who dares not move on. The choice would be pretty hollow if the result of choosing not to go is to go anyway but have an echo of you left behind.

** If a ghost is just an imprint left behind by accidental magic, then I think the ghost would see they aren't "real", have an existential crisis, and most likely fade into nothing.

I was hope for some sort of positive change

What about a shade,ghost and portrait of a person merging?
