** So, the Of A Linear Circle series is very Snape heavy, with a LOT more. It's not solely a character study of Snape, but I really like it and early on it's got some great scenes with Snape dealing with becoming a new teacher.

The Hogwarts Potions Professor is also awesome. Basically a "what if Snape was safety conscious and engaged in any level of self care or introspection and therefore was somewhat less of a giant twat" type of story.
