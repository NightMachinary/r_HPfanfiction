I am asking if anyone can recommend a well written story with a Ravenclaw as the main character. Could be canon characters, could be an OC, I'm not picky at this point. Any era, and any type of story works, but I would really like to see a collection of one-shots that's just Ravenclaw's getting into wacky scenarios from Harry's year. FYI I already read 'Tell Brave Deeds of War', so maybe something like that would work. Thanks.


** linkffn(Goldstein by Laazov): well, maybe less "wacky scenarios" and more "Trying to learn magic while continuing to practice Orthodox Judaism", but interesting nonetheless.

  What's a nice Jewish boy like Anthony doing at Hogwarts? Well, for starters, his name isn't really Anthony. Winner of the Fanfiction Booker's Prize 2014. Year One complete.

*** I've seen this on my searches and have been unsure on whether it interests me or not, the religious aspect honestly isn't appealing, but I'm willing to give it a shot.
