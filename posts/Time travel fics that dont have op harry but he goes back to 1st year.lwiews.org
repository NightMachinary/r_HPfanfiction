** This would be difficult. Unless you go with the "immature magical core," a Harry who goes back in time /should/ be OP as a first year. Any semi-competent 17-year-old should kick butt in a class of 11-year-olds. Even at that, he knows all the spells and should get them right on the first try.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23976052]]) I quite enjoyed this for a time-travelling Harry who doesn't just curb stomp his enemies, also conveys some of the loneliness of being an adult hidden amongst children.

#+begin_quote
  When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.

  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love.
