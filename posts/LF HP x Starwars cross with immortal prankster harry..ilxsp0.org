[deleted]


** "Treacle tart side" or even "treacle side" is a unique enough phrase that it should make it easy to find, but it didn't bring anything up. So I tried searching for every combination of Harry Potter, Star Wars, Veela, Fidelius, Death Star, space station, space ship, prank, troll, and fanfiction that I thought had a chance of working. None of them have me anything.

I'm starting to come to the sad conclusion that you may have come here from an alternate universe that has better fanfiction than we do.

*** Would it still show up if it's been deleted? Not to pc savvy, so wouldn't know. I'm hoping it's not, but...

**** If it was deleted and no one posted a copy of it anywhere than it probably wouldn't show up in Google, so that could be the case. If you could find a dead link to the fic, you might be able to put it into the Wayback Machine to get the fic. The best bet might be to try to find a tumblr or forum post or something that talks about the fic, if you can.
