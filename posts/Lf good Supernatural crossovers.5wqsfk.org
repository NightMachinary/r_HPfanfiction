Specifically I'd be interested in a story where Harry (or whoever, I don't have a strong preference) gets joined up with the brothers in a hunt and is able to help them with his knowledge of supernatural creatures? Or a different plot is welcome if the story is good, that's just what I was imagining..!

Slash ok if it's not gross and well written.

Here are a couple I liked, the only one to really fit what you're looking for is the dementor one though.

  Crowley didn't even know Death even had a master, so when he met him, he was understandably confused and shocked. That reaction swiftly turned into disturbed and annoyed once the being introduced him to an identity confused Archangel in Witness Protection

** *Illusions of Grandeur* linkffn(8957424) is complete with a currently updating sequel. Harry is a minor god of sorts in the story, and is treated as such by the Winchesters. It focuses on the events leading to the fifth season finale. Probably one of my favorite reads.

  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.
