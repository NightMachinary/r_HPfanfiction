Hi,

I'm putting together a team to create a fully-featured wizarding world with its own history, diverse magical cultures, fleshed-out subjects, and more.

Anyone interested can contact me on Discord for more information. My Discord handle is glisteningsunlight#1954.

Thanks!

*** Same here: I thought this was something to do with the Avengers, given Fury's speech. XD

A few fics had that, with Harry typically rejecting him but only to get roped into the mess that is Marvel, heh.

IIRC one where Harry helped out during the Battle of New York (Avengers) had him labeled as an Avenger, and the rest of the team were like "wtf?" until they met him again at his bar.

Oh, and apparently his clout basically had the ICW/Wizarding Britain basically go "lol nope what Statute? I haven't heard of no Statute!" after they try to bring him up on charges.

It was fun, but I lost track of the fic half-way though, didn't pick it up again, and I've heard mixed things about the direction the fic went (and Marvel as a whole has gone a bit odd -- the new Phase in particular looks like a disaster in the making, sooo)....)

**** Actually it's Batman who's putting together a team. In Justice League. But I know what you mean. I remembered Fury for a second.
