I remember that the fanfic started with a girl (self insert or transmigration?) Who arrived on platform 3/4 or Hogwarts (I think there was an accident and something happened to her brother)

McGonagall or Dumbledor talk whit she and said that she came from America. She classified in Griffindor and it was about the marauders era because somewhere Lucius said he wanted them to attack the mudblood not the pureblood in the forbidden forest (there was a scene of her and lily in the forest, I think they were looking for something) and he insisted on approaching her or In a marriage contract, I think his surname was St Michel or St something.

That's all I remember, thank you.
