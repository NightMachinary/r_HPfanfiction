*** ooh, That's easily my favorite Addams Family Crossover and top three of crossovers in general. Also, the hyperlinks not working because you did it backwards. The text to be linked (title, in this case) goes first in the brackets, then the actual link in parentheses).

** I adore a good Stargate crossover as well. Sadly, a lot of them are just super-Harry who blasts through all obstacles with little thought or care.

*** Try [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/][The Stars Alone]]. Harry, Hermione, and Luna are still super powerful, but their enemies have lots of advantages too. It's not a curb stomp at all, and definitely not 'Fuck Yeah, America!'.

** For Doctor Who at least my favourite are linkffn(4922483) and linkffn(7156582). Visited by a Doctor and That Which Holds the Image. The latter at least can be read without knowledge of Doctor Who and I can definitely recommend it, it's so creepy and cool. Visited by a Doctor inserts Harry into the Doctor Who universe and explains what he was doing while the events were taking place in the background.

If you like Lord of the Rings, linkffn(11115934) The Shadow of Angmar is essential.

The Stag and the Dragon, linkffn(2104141) blends Star Wars/Harry Potter universes very well as Dumbledore enlists Vader to teach Dark Arts, and although it looks like it's dead linkffn(11647919) The Winchester Brothers and the Students of Hogwarts is a supernatural fanfic that inserts Sam and Dean into the events of the third book where of course, Sam has read the books. It's one of the better ones where the Harry Potter series is a work of fiction in the crossover universe that I've read.

Your mileage may vary on this one but I enjoyed Traveller Among Wizards linkffn(10076000) too, which inserts a pre-Man of Steel Superman and eventually the Justice League into the events of the seventh book. It was written before Batman vs. Superman and if you have a basic knowledge of Superman you can probably get by reading this one without having seen the film. It's also complete, too.

I've got no idea if any of the links work as I've never used this system before successfully, so we'll see.

** linkffn(3473224) is considered one of the best crossovers out there. Not sci-fi , but much better written than about 99.9% of crossovers.
