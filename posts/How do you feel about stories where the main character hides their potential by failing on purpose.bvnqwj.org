I just find it super frustrating. I get that it might fit their character or make their master plan easier if they're underestimated but it's just so annoying to read about them getting berated in class while they think a out what a genius they are. While it might be interesting it tends to be so frustrating that I have to close the story or skip to the point where they reveal their the next Dumbledore, because no one ever does these things half way. Not saying they need to be like early Hermione or anything.


** A gifted character even need to be faking it to fail his classes. Irl a lot of geniuses are failing school, and even in canon you've got people like Fred and George.

Just write them not putting efforts in schoolwork and not caring much, it's way more logical than failing tests on purpose and your character can still be smart outside the classroom. And please show us that, don't just tell.

Obviously theres no way to tell if someone is copying but if you're not even doing the entirety of the homework instructions then of course youd get in trouble.

It's like, you don't get full points on an essay if you write your hypothesis. You actually have to prove your points and give evidence and show why.

What I'm saying is that wolfram alpha, the software, when you input a calculation, shows how it /reached/ the solution.

***** Yeah, maths teachers need to do a better job of communicating that what the students are learning is a methodology. Being able to solve problem A or problem B isn't the point - demonstrating knowledge of a methodology which can be used to solve /any/ problem is.

It's a similar point with Harry and the potion's book in HBP. The point of Potions class is not to brew potions, it's to develop the skills which allow you to brew /any/ potion. This is why Hermione is right about the book - Harry is not doing himself any favours by blindly following recipe Y rather than recipe X.

*** Agreed.

It's even more frustrating when the protagonist goes on and on about how they're underestimated and they have the inevitable conversation with someone where someone says something along the lines of, "yeah, well at least I'm not an idiot" and Harry internally replies, 'Oh, ho, you fool! You've fallen for my cleverly crafted persona, you peon of low IQ pickle dust.' while externally all he says is "You'd be surprised."

*** In my opinion it's immensely cliche. I don't mind a character underperforming due to a lack of effort. But tanking to hide their intelligence only works if you do evil Dumbledore. I've never seen a good evil Dumbledore fic.

** I'm not sure that I've ever actually witnessed it as an ongoing plot point. Every time I have encountered it, it is introduced as /backstory/ which Harry is now abandoning.

E.g. in a post-OotP fic, Harry is revealed to have been holding himself back from PS through OotP, but now he is fed up of hiding and will reveal his true power.

I've never seen a fic where Harry /continues/ to hide his talents for the duration of the story. It's generally just a way to give Harry an instant power boost.

*** This kind of retconning is the worst. If Harry was secretly a genius who saw through Dumbledore/Weasleys/Hermione's machinations (TM) and hid his power and knowledge to present a certain image, it should still affect his decisions and change the plot. Hiding your powers and trying to lie low by needlessly risking your life time and again is moronic.
