In which Harry is normally quite reserved and close to canon but when he needs to, he allows the Horcrux to take control and deal with the situation at hand, whether that's an argument, a duel, a full pitched battle or whatever. Bonus points if he struggles to contain the Horcrux and has to fight to regain control/stop the Horcrux from doing anything too extreme.


** That would be an interesting idea.

So would Harry still have control over his actions while he's switched? Or would he take a back seat while watching the horcrux fight?

Maybe a side-plot for the story could be Harry getting 'Locked out' of control, and having to fight for dominance.

It could possibly alter his appearance as well; turning paler, irises change to red, letting the dark magic fill his veins (Edgy!).

*** Very much a backseat driver once the Horcrux takes control. One of the character arcs I'd like to see with this mechanic is Harry using it at first unwittingly or unwillingly, and then gradually using it more and more, losing himself to the power of his other side. Eventually, the Horcrux makes a full-blown grab for power and Harry seems to be locked away permanently in his mind.

***** Ooor Kingdom Hearts! Riku and Ansem SoD's Heart inside him, which is totally basically a fucking Horcrux omg. xD Ansem routinely takes over his body in the series to protect his host, and to try and goad him into accepting his power to give him further control. Always loved that dynamic. It'd actually perfectly translate to Harry/Horcrux, urging him to be all, "Let me take care of this for you, weak child."

** This could be really funny if done properly. Have the Horcrux only come out when Harry's life is in danger, playing on the survival instinct of the soul shard, boosted by Voldemort's natural fear of death. The moment the danger has passed however, the Horcrux lack's the ability to overpower Harry's soul. The internal frustration of a piece of Voldemort who can only ever protect his hated enemy out of sheer necessity but can't ever do anything else would be hilarious. Not to mention the reactions of everyone involved in say, the Troll scene or the Graveyard scene in particular could be priceless.

  The first time Harry became a snake slithering through a forest, he thought he was dreaming. But he soon realised that in fact he was switching bodies with a magic snake. A very special snake who swiftly became his childhood friend -- for when he came back to Privet Drive after body-swapping things were always better for him. Harry & Voldemort friendship, pre-Hogwarts, Dark!Harry.

*** One of my favorite series, for the dialogue (witty, reads like a movie or comic book), the worldbuilding/character interactions, along with the setting being Irish, which you don't often see in urban fantasy stories, and as a native, something I greatly appreciate.

I'll admit I'm kind of losing my liking for the most recent books. Something has been lost in the feel of them; and I'm really not liking the new character, Omen Darkly. He's designed to be a pathetic character but it's honestly just a slog to get through his perspective sometimes. Huge fan of Derek Landy though.

But holy fuck, the magic systems! The progression of elemental magic into increasingly complex techniques, the scope of China's symbol magic, Tanith being just a badass in general, necromancy being super powerful but only so long as you have your weapon/ring with you.
