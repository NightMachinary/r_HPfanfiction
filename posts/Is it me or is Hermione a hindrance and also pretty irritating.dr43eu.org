** Yes, but not for the reasons that you're saying, but because it was a mystery series and JKR needed someone to slow down the progress. Noticing Snape, but not Quirrell, encouraging the making of polyjuice and focusing on Draco, the amount of protesting she did between books 5-7. In fact, Dumbledore, the original mouth piece, said this was her purpose that last book.

** Calling her a hindrance is one of the most ridiculous interpretations I've ever seen. The argument could be made in HBP that she hindered Harry but that is it. In every other book she is a huge aid.

How did she 'fuck Harry over' in POA? The broom thing? She didn't handle it in the best of ways but that in no way hindered Harry...and her logic was sound.

You seem to be taking your frustrations with fanon Hermione out on canon Hermione.

** I wouldn't say she's a hindrance. She's unquestionably intelligent, and she's on Harry's side, for all 7 books except the start of book 1 and the middle of book 6. Sure, she is frustrating at times, and sure, I'd probably find her a touch annoying in real life, but she definitely helps more than she hinders. Things that wouldn't have happened without Hermione include, but are not limited to:

Figuring out who Flamel was, Getting past Snape's riddle, figuring out the monster was a basilisk, breaking Sirius out of his prison inside Hogwarts, Harry being able to do the summoning charm to get his firebolt, the DA, and just generally Harry staying sane in book 7.

I'm not a massive Harmony fan who will screech at you if you insult her, but she is an important character who has her flaws like any other.

What is this, the 1950s? That's by far not the most popular opinion.

In canon I dislike how she's used to speed up or slow down progress. I dislike how her story arcs fizzle out. I dislike that she grows less than Ron and Harry.

In fanon I dislike how she's put to two extremes, Miss I can do no wrong or Miss I'm telling Dumbledore and stealing from your vaults and cheating.

Having issues with her intelligence as a personal affront is odd. She's /fictional/. You can dislike how it's portrayed, but it's never personal, but rather how the story goes.

There's an ebb and flow to favored characters in fanfiction on this subreddit. But "Genius" is a very strong word. Rowling had to add the adjective "borderline" when describing the character, and I think that fits perfectly. We don't deny she's intelligent. At least those of use that aren't extreme.

But maybe you need to think of the other adjectives that go along with fictional geniuses. Arrogant, presumptuous, stubborn, in quantities that poison a protagonist. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/drdnww/what_makes_a_main_character_likeable_for_you/f6hzw6w?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x]] is a good example of what makes a protagonist likable.

And then there's also the weird fact that there are complaints about "Hermione Sue" - yet none of the same people complain when other characters have the same qualities. Daphne Greengrass is commonly portrayed as smart, beautiful, cultured and graceful, old nobility (or something like it), independent/neutral, and politically/socially savy. How often do the same people who froth at the mouth when Hermione's not dissed as ugly and socially inept complain about "Greengrass Sue"?

We do complain about them. Pretty much every day in fact. Besides, the ebb and flow of fanfiction can be blamed here. "Greengrass Sue" is apparently a fad in fanfiction, mostly because she has a really cool sounding last name. And also is an excellent counterargument to Hermione being disliked for her intelligence. Apparently, there's something about the character the fan doesn't like. I personally prefer canon Hermione over fanon Greengrass though. At least Hermione has relatable problems. And looks are a different bias that I'm trying to normalize against.

No Indy! Harry please. Please. You can get away with an increase in intelligence/skills up to the level of teen Tom Riddle if you do a fic correctly (for Hermione, Harry, and maybe Ron). But damnit, no one does that.

There is a strong bias against smart women, fictional or not.

There's also a bias against intellectuals in society, at least in certain parts of it. You also see it in canon, from Hermione's "Books! Cleverness!" quote down to the fact that in the end, it's guts, luck and bravery, not smarts, that wins the day in every book. The villains are never outsmarted/outplanned in the climax.

And many can't stand the "swot". The smart kid who doesn't hide her intelligence in class. Many want to see them taken down a peg. Unlike sports prodigies, smart kids rarely get admired by their classmates.

Greengrass gets a pass since she's usually the love interest, and subservient to Harry. In many Harmony stories, Hermione ends up the same - eye candy, research assistant, and side-kick. Anything but someone who might outshine Harry the Hero.

*********** Those studies don't conclude bias against smart women, just bias against women.

I do have some issues with the experimentation on the first study (case studies are fraught with issues), although I don't doubt the conclusion has some basis in fact.

I like the second one's point on introducing interest in STEM young. I think people are pretty much set in their interests by college. I always feel sad when I hear about a friend who graduated with a 4.0 not working because they were a humanities major.

The third is harder to judge. All I'm seeing is that some careers tend to be dominated by men, so people assume they're better.

I think the issue is that we were talking individual vs societal. I don't think there's individual hate of smart women. I don't think smart women role models get publicized a lot.

Guys deal with that as well, although showing off that you're better in general is a poor trait for civil people. No one likes to be seen as stupid. Not that children are rational individuals.

But that was my point. It's not a personal intellectual bias. Disliking a smart woman and disliking smart women are different things. Disliking a woman for being smart and disliking a woman who happens to be smart are different things.

I would like to make the point that outshining the hero ≠ intelligence in fics. It's not the intelligence that's the issue.

It's "/Harry's/ research assistant" that I have issues with - taking Hermione, and reducing her to Harry's assistant/gopher/sidekick. Hermione being /Dumbledore's/ research assistant would be something entirely different.

And sports prodigies don't suffer for "showing off" - Harry gets praised for being an outstanding Seeker. Guys get dissed for being intellectuals, too - but they can evade that by being cool/handsome/charismatic, especially in fiction. Girls can't; that'd make them a Mary Sue in the eyes of many.

And yes, there's a wide-spread hostility towards smart women. Misogyny is a fact in our society, and smart women suffer even more from that.

Hermione just ticks a lot of people's "buttons": She's a girl, smart, outspoken, a muggleborn, won't shut up and follow the lead of her "betters", cares about human and animal rights and on stage, she's even a person of colour.

I actually dislike that because reading is pretty cool. And to be fair, by the virtue of the books, she is a sidekick of sorts. Blame exposition, the first book did it right with the trio looking for the answers. Having her go to the library cuts out mystery.

I think pretty much the girl and outspoken part are relevant. SPEW was right in it's goals. Hell, if you read her manifesto, it's actually pretty reasonable. But her trying to trick the house-elves into freeing themselves just contradicted it and showed poor judgement. The rest is meh. People like fanon Daphne for being smart.
