You know: just a bunch of linkffn's without pause, promptly followed by a huge list of fics from the bot. Does anyone else just gloss over those without reading? I even feel kind of guilty about it. I know I should be grateful someone's taking the effort to give recommendations (especially if it's in response to a Request thread) but I can't help but feel that I fall prey to choice overload, because in order to figure out which ones of those I'd like to read would mean actually clicking through that whole entire list and then reading/skimming the first page to assess writing style, maybe peeking at reviews, etc. And that's just too much work. So I don't.

On the other hand, if I see a single recommendation followed by a brief explanation of /why/ it's recommended (what was good about the writing, how well the characters were described, etc.), then that rec feels just a little bit more special than if it was part of a list. Which makes it more likely for me to click it and /actually/ start reading it.

Overall, I guess I'm saying that lumping recommendations in a list diminishes their value...for me, at least.

Thoughts?


** I do like it when a person actually tells you a little bit about a fic. It generally helps save you from sudden dumb shit like Mokuton Sakura.

But what I really hate is when every single rec list contains basically the same fics that everyone recommends over and over.

That's another great point. Sometimes, you'll have two or more posts with huuuge lists of recommendations, but half of them just end up repeating recs by other posters.

**** Or, even worse, its the same list of fics that have been dead for years.

I never understand that. Why does anyone recommend a fic that dies, just as it's getting good, and has remained that way for years? No matter how good the chapters are, the fact that there is no resolution whatsoever is galling.

***** Some abandoned stories still have one or multiple complete arcs and can be seen as "finished" if you see the last chapter as an open ending or ignore one or two of the later chapters to get the same effect.

For example, "A different introduction" was supposed to be a first year story (at least) but was abandoned at September 1st. It is one of the better "Harry gets introduced to magic" stories around and has an adorable friendship between Luna and Harry. It is abandoned but still feels complete if you are content with it being a pre-Hogwarts story.

***** Idk some of the best ones I have read have been incomplete, and I feel like a lot of times the resolutions, even to otherwise good fanfics, aren't very satisfying (looking at you, Cadmean Victory).

I'd rather read 12 GREAT chapters, even if it remains unresolved, than 30 chapters that just slowly peter out to an unsatisfying conclusion.

***** there are too many in progress fics. If you only read the complete ones, you miss out on a lot. Though I agree with you if they are literally only the first few introductory chapters. Ugh, those are the worst. Especially the ones that are genre breaking and get you excited about a new concept. And then, bam! Nothing. And no similar fanfics exist to stuff the void...

Still, like I said, I know I should appreciate the effort someone put in. Personally, however, I always try to add a line or two to my own recommendations, explaining why I think it's a good fit. I feel that makes the rec more valuable, although that could just be bias.

I get where you're coming from; it's somewhat annoying to just get a list of 20 fics with no real context. A lot of times people's summaries are bad anyway, so that's not much help.

It makes much more sense to give someone your single best recommendation, maybe 2-3 if you only have partial matches for their request. If they really want to read 20 fics, then they'll doubtless be back once they've finished reading what you gave them, and if their tastes matched yours, they'll have that much more incentive to listen to what you recommend next.
