Yes, I know it's toxic but what can I say, it's my guiltiest pleasure there is.


** Aurelian is my all time favourite!

​

I also just wrote my first fanfiction, and it's Dramione (shameless self promo haha) It's called Watch out, it's hot.

I just finished this. I am not a dramione fan, but I've heard really good things about this, and gave it a shot. It's REALLY well done. Really dark though, and long.

*** Colubrina is a great start, though I'd personally recommend her later works a little higher. Especially The Pretense.

**** Oh, I love you. I wrote Green Girl years ago and every time someone recs it I want to whisper, ‘I got better at writing. Try the recent stuff.'

***** I started with 'Green Girl' and then literally read through everything on your profile. The reason why I like 'Green Girl' so much is the beginning when the Slytherins say: "you're one of us now" and they also back it up throughout the story. It just makes me feel so content - of course Hermione will succeed, her housemates always have her back...

If you're unhappy with it, could I beg you to rewrite it?

*** I second The Green Girl and would say that, hands down, Colubrina is my go to when I want Dramione fics (that said her Pygmalion is Hermione/Tom Riddle and it is also amazing)

*** It seems very "whitewashing" for the entirety of Slytherin tbh. I can see Voldemort not giving a fuck about blood purity given his parentage, but the instant acceptance of most Slytherin students for "their mudblood" seems very off.

  Hermione is sorted into Slytherin; how will things play out differently when the brains of the Golden Trio has different friends? AU. Darkish Dramione. COMPLETE.

**** Colubrina is also one of my favourite authors. I think she has also two stories that are Blaise/Draco/Hermione which are wonderful.

I love Green Girl, let's say that there aren't many fanfictions that I read more than once...

I'll give you some stories, but I'm new and don't know how to link them...

Colubrina: The Diary We Carry No Greater Love (the first two are also with Blaise, give it a try anyway) The Pretense (especially if you like intrigue) The Muddy Princess

RavieSnake: To Be Himself (short, cute and fluff)

Lady Moonglow: Reverse (dark dystopia, perfectly executed, wip last updated at 2015)

Hunger Games xover - Frostfoot-Dreamleaf: The Green Games (much darker and realistic than the original hunger games)

Guilty Pleasure fics- Bex-Chan: Isolation + Hunted Bookworm1993: Simply Irresistible Countess of Abe: A Wonderful Caricature of Intimacy elizaye: Turncoat

** Lady of the Lake by Colubrina is my all time favorite Dramione. It's pretty dark though!
