Harry is adorable, his relationship with Hestia and the other Gods and Goddesses is cute as hell and i'm pretty sure Helios is James. I can't get enough of this fic and anyone who hasn't read it yet should read it.

** Eh, mediocre, but I'll admit, that puts it in the 99th percentile as fare as PJO fic is comcerned. That fandom is full of absolute trash (even more so than usual for fic) and I don't quite understand why.

*** It's practically canon Dumbledore, but looked at from the a different perspective.

- Stuck his nose into something he had no business doing.
- Messed with something he had no knowledge about.
- Too many jobs.
- Did nothing when he could have done something.
- Thinks too highly of himself.

Then you add the fact that it's from the POV of the Gods. They have infinite hindsight and extra knowledge. Add in the fact that some of them are curse-happy. It's not bashing, it's all accurate reactions and representations.

**** .... the books are for children, mate. Most of those titles could be nothing more than just that, titles. Not actual job description. Besides, his plan worked, no? Harry won against a wizard with decades of experience, and Dumbledore had to sacrifice himself to do it. He is NOT incompetent.

Also, canon Harry is an idiot. He had to have his hand held from the start by Hermoine. Seriously. Wtf? He barely studied, antagonizes Snape, can't concentrate for shit in Occulamancy, etc etc. Easily baited by freaking nightmares, and Dumbledore had a damn good reason why he avoided Harry during his fifth year.

Harry thinks too highly of himself when Dumbledore refuses to meet him during that year. I mean, wtf?

#+end_quote

These are my points...

You are using things that aren't canon, you sound incredibly biased in your views (Dumbledore good, harry bad), teenagers have actual reasons for being stupid and hard headed (they are teenagers and have hormones) especially considering that no one was there to help Harry grow other than other teenagers.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

You realize that trauma is a serious thing, right? This sentence is so infuriating to me.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore had a damn good reason why he avoided Harry during his fifth year.
#+end_quote

What reason?

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore had to sacrifice himself to do it
#+end_quote

What? No! Dumbledore died because he put on the cursed ring. He didn't prepare enough/wasn't able to resist the pull of the resurrection stone (since he wants to talk to his dead sister).

Dumbledore didn't have to die for Harry to kill Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Besides, his plan worked, no?
#+end_quote

Just because a stupid and extremely dangerous plan worked, didn't mean it wasn't stupid and extremely dangerous.

#+begin_quote
  antagonizes Snape
#+end_quote

Snape, /a teacher/, started antagonizing him from the very first time Harry entered his classroom.

*** I don't know if I believe that is the case for James since Hades said only one parent disappeared from the afterlife. My theory is that since Helios hasn't fully faded and is once again receiving prayers and offerings via Harry that he will regain his godly form and take a fatherly role for Harry.

** I really liked it. Read it last night. I would have liked some sort of thought and backlash to Harry's actions in some moments (mostly in relation to Artemis and her Hunters) but I get it so I ignore it.

... well maybe not backlash but I dunno, he's very pushy and it's painted as cute, and I know where it's leading up to so it just nags at me a bit. Especially when he's painted as so /special/ in relation to it while they just sorta support him along. I like that Artemis and ZoÃ« does draw lines with him but would have liked to see more of it and some introspection surrounding it but he's also nine so... /shrug/.

His relationship with Hestia is so sweet though. 10/10.

**** Sure, but it's all about what an author decides to do with it and what aspects they wanna explore. Gods are entitled, it comes with what they are, but there are sides to them too and I am more forgiving of that since they're old and stuck in their ways. Even with HP raised in that kind of enviroment he is exposed to Hestia the most and I want that to balance it out /personally/ since his past is what it is. I can understand a direction an author takes with a story, still wish differently and even so enjoy it.
