We all know Voldemort did some pretty stupid strategies, but what if he did things the showy way because he wants to see if he could? Looking for any stories where Voldemort is so godlike powerful he could own the world in a day if he wanted to, but chooses to do limit himself to have more of a challenge because otherwise he'd be completely bored after a day of ruling the world.
