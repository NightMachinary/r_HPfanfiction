:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So first time here trying to find a fic. So the Fic starts as as harry is Awaking out of a coma and he hears Ginny talk to an doctor who she is engaged to but don't want to marry. Harry has a daughter who is around 8 I believe. Harry wakes up from the coma and goes to Hermione, who lives in the US. She is studing some medical degree and she got there because she thought Ron cheated on her in their flat but what she doesn't know is that it wasn't him. Harry has a new identity and some glamours and they go to the burrow and he is introduced as her fiance. Ron is engaged to lavender. If anyone could help me, please do.
