Something similar to The Evil Overlord List.


** There's Roundabout Destiny where Hermione is reborn as James Potter Sr.'s twin sister, but original-Hermione is a voice/presence in new-Hermione's head.

Not entirely the same, and I don't recall how long that happens for, but who knows. linkffn(8311387)

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.

** Here's a fic that subverts the "travel back in time to your own body" trope that has past-Harry retaining control and future-Harry becoming a voice in his head: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10127452/1/Schism]]) Too bad it didn't get very far before likely being abandoned.

  AU. Time Travel. Harry Potter knows he is a wizard. He knows he is going to Hogwarts, where he will make friends for the first time in his life. He knows this because the Voice in his head told him so. The Voice says it is Harry from the future but Harry just wishes it would stop trying to take over his body.

** There's also "My friend Tom". Not quite a reincarnation, but so close, it's almost the same.

  When Voldemort gave Harry that scar he gave him two other things; a part of his soul and a friend. The last remnant of Tom Riddle's humanity mentors Harry. (1st year complete, now on hiatus until inspiration for second year strikes)

*** Yup! This is a current favourite of mine.

The author updates very rarely, but he just updated his other story the other day after a year plus of inactivity, so I have faith!
