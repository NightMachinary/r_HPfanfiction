I made a prompt like this yesterday but go no replies despite lots of upvotes. So I'm now asking for some writing.


** The [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jgln12/magical_strength_is_proportional_to_physical/][thread]] you posted yesterday with the exact same prompt - which is still the 9th highest thread on the sub - had 70 comments in response. Posting the same thing the next day because you're insisting that people write your ideas for you, after they have clearly chosen not to in response to the first thread, kinda comes across as entitled.

The vast majority of prompts do not generate any content, for the obvious reason that writers generally prefer to write their own ideas. If you're so desperate for someone to write this concept maybe you should do it yourself.
