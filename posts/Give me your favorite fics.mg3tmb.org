I'm looking to build up my (already quite long) to-read list. To that end, give me any recs you have! I'm not picky, but I do prefer long fics that are complete or nearly complete, and ones in which Harry is the main character. No Hinny please. Crossovers (SPN, LotR, Hobbit, Twilight, MCU) are okay too! I'm also a big fan of WBWL, Time/Dimensional Travel, Dumbledore Bashing, and Harry being taken from the Dursleys and raised by someone else with Dumbledore being none the wiser. Thanks!


** Sorry man, if I give you my favorite fics then I wont have them anymore.

** Darkness visible by plutoplex

It is dark, intelligent, well written, touching, emotionally draining, cruel story to leave many in tears.

It is Snape centric, it gives an incredible in depth portrayal or him, many order members, Dumbledore and Grindelwald...

When l read this story it just hit me how all of the characters could very well be in canon written like that.

I am not sure if l could define it as Snape bashing story, as he does indeed do the worst things possible, probably the worst of all l have ever read so far. However this story helped me understand many of the characters and question all what Rowling wrote. It cemented my opinion of Severus Snape as my favorite /[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11625127/1/][darkness visible]]

*** When they took his memories forcibly, it really put me off. It is a great one though, and plutoplex is an amazing wroter

**** Yes, it was so unsettling. And even then he got no mercy or sympathy from the Order. I think only his death could redeem him in everyone's eyes. He was unworthy and inferior in every way to them, and he let them. Very sad and disappointing.

I strongly remember the time where he bleeds during Order meeting due to his injuries and Sirius Black insults him and complains about bloodstains on his carpets. That level of insensitivity astounds me.

Incredible and horrifying portrayal, especially because you would actually expect they would do and say such things.

***** The bit where he carries a phoenix boggart into the room is hilarious xD Really creative too, the way they used the boggart's shape shifting ability and severus' control due to occlumency

****** Yes. The phoenix made him question his own sanity.

The only thing l did not completely understand is how could he kill Harry if he made a Vow to protect him. He could have died there. Although, l am quite happy with the existing ending as well, truly poetic.
