** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13145491/1/][A Timely Development]] Is weird, very poorly written, and a bit insane, But I can't help but love it. We are seeing the after effects (or lack of?) of Harry, Hermione, and Neville being sent back to the 60s during the department of mysteries from the perspective of the Drs Granger.
