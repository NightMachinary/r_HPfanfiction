:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I remember reading a fanfiction a while ago, I think it had about 50 chapters or so. Every chapter was about a phrase one character would say to another. For example, “from Harry Potter to Tom Riddle”. One of the chapters was an unknown german woman saying something to Grindelwald, another was the Montgomery sisters and Greyback. Sorry for my english, it's not my first language.


** Maybe this?
