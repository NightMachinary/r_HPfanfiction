The Uber rich Harry fics where he finds out he's the heir for 258 Lordship's are unrealistic yes, but I do believe that there is a way to write rich Harry in a realistic way if it were strangers leaving him their money.

Think about it: Harry is the person people believed stopped the Dark Lord that people were so scared of they couldn't even say his name. They lived in terror for years because of Voldemort. I think it's kinda realistic to believe that some people would leave him their money because of how grateful they were. There were probably people who had their whole family destroyed due to Voldemort. Those people would be so happy he was gone that they'd want to leave their money to the person who destroyed him.

Now not all these people will have a lot of money to give but I do think it could add up with the amount of people that could leave him money.

I can also imagine greedy relative's who didn't care for the person before they died being mad that they didn't get anything and hating that Harry got "their inheritance". It could create a whole new layer on why some people seem to hate Harry so easily and believe any slander that's said about him, they're just mad they didn't get the money they thought hey deserved.


** A sinister idea came into my mind when writing this. What if Lockhart received inheritances from old people but it was because he manipulated them into leaving him all their money?

It's why he personally goes through all his fan letters despite being so popular and getting so many of them- he wants to see if there are any lonely old women sending him letters that he can manipulate.

*** Man, now I want to read a Harry Potter/The Producers crossover with Lockhart in place of Max Bialystock.

Gilderoy Lockhart, Serial Killer? (What you've described is the modus operandi of one of England's most notorious serial killers, albeit he picked his victims from the patient list of his GP practise.)

** My only real issue with fics like that is that he rarely uses most of it or even remarks upon it after the chapter in which he gets it. "Welcome to Gringotts, thanks for remembering my name. Here, have this pile of stuff, most of which will never be mentioned again throughout the entire story."

So long as the inheritance meets the internal logic of the story (ie. inheritances are a thing, holding them in the event of no inheritee is a thing, etc) then I'll probably buy in, it's just everything after that so often falters for me. Same with Shopping Chapters. If you're gonna have him buy something, have him buy it for a purpose. People will buy shit like books and video games obsessively and then never use them, but nobody will buy a sports car or an industrial drill and never use it, and that's basically what "Harry gets yet another enchanted whatchamacallit" comes off as.

So, to bring it back to your original topic, if Harry did inherit a whole bunch of stuff, I'd care more that he did something with it than if he got it due to "Reasons? /shrug/".

Also, I wanna twist that last point of yours slightly, 'cause I really do kind of love the bitchy energy of a tired old Magical Parent seeing their kids fight over who gets what in the will and going "You know what? You children are being fuckwits, so I'm leaving everything to the fucking Boy Who Lived. See if he appreciates this inheritance more than you argumentative pricks."

Either that or 'leaving it to the Boy Who Lived' is like the magical version of those kooky old European rich people who leave everything to their pets. :D

** Harry learned he's rich and does Hogwarts shopping by himself. He never had money before. Since he was used to save up and be frugal he splurges a bit.

Two new pairs of socks. The luxury! New underpants. Wow. A nice sweater. Just ligtly used and a bit big. But heaps better than Dudley's and good for a couple of years too. Maybe in the end he treats himself to a bun. Nothing fancy mind you he needs to stretch the riches for 7 years.

*** Played with in Magical Relations. Harry begs Vernon for the money to go to Hogwarts and promises to pay him back with interest. He gets a part time job as Filch's assistant to pay for school. Later his housemates (Slytherin) find out what's going on and they start cracking up, "LOL, you're rich. Didn't anyone tell you?" linkffn(3446796)

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*
