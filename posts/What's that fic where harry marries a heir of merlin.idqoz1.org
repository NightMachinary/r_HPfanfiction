It was not very great but it was one of the first fics I ever read and it has been bugging me for a week now. From what I remember of the fic, it is after dumbledore dies that an OP girl comes to order of the phoenix and claims that she is heir of merlin. In the end it stopped at a cliffy where it turns out that the girl's brother was the one who killed her family. Also her and Harry's daughter comes to them from future.
