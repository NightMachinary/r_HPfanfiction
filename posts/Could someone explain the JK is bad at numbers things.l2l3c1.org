** When PS was first published, Charlie Weasley was seven years older than he is canonically.

Dumbledore's age being revealed to have been 150 in 1991 (birth in 1841), before the 6th book... then becoming 110 (birth in 1881) for the 7th book.

McGonagall's age at the time os PS being revealed to be 70 (birth in 1921), before the 6th book... before we learned she became teacher two years after graduating (that info comes from Pottermore) which means (since we know she became a teacher in 1956 thanks to OP) she is supposed to be born around 1935. Then The fantastical beasts: crimes of grindelwals comes and we have McGonagall being contemporary of the events of the movie (set around 1927, before she was even born), and now... we don't know.

The quite established fact there are 40 students in Harry's year, meaning there are 280 students versus PoA where there are 200 students supporting Slytherin in one of the matches, while the three other houses supports Gryffindor.

I think she gave an estimation of 3000 wizards and around one thousand students at Hogwarts... which is consistent with the 4 times 200 students, but 1/3 of the population are kids?

Also, the fact that Merlin, the King Arthur's wizard was in Slytherin... which I don't know if that's an inconsistency but I think the timeframe for King Arthur is around the 400-500, not after 1000.

There is so much errors about the dates, (for example, every year Harry and his friend take the Hogwarts Express, the 1st September, and they start the classes the day right after, Lupin who should not have been able to get in that train since that day was a full moon in 1993).

********** You're just wrong.

Most sports are played mostly by amateurs, including at a high level. Even today a very large number of international athletes are at most part-timers. Take, for example, the United States team at the rugby league world cup in 2017. Out of a squad of 24 players, 5 were full time pros. Another 8 played their club rugby for teams that I think are semi-pro (which doesn't mean that all their players are paid, just that some are). The majority were amateurs. Only five of fourteen teams in the competition were made up entirely of full-time professionals.

Or consider the Olympics. Until quite recently it was entirely amateur - professionalism only really took off in the 1968 games (did you know that the Olympics used to include arts competitions, but they were dropped after the 1948 competition because artists sold their work and so were professional?). Before then governments put a ton of money into sponsoring the games [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics#/media/File:Olimpiai_Stadion,_a_n%C5%91i_magasugr%C3%A1s_eredm%C3%A9nyhirdet%C3%A9se_(1._Cs%C3%A1k_Ibolya,_Magyarorsz%C3%A1g][for their own purposes]]._Fortepan_17417.jpg) but the games themselves, including the vast majority of athletes, were amateur or at most part-time pros.

Most domestic leagues in most sports are played and run by amateurs. Doubly so when you start to consider leagues that draw players from tiny populations.

Think about the professional sports in your country: they need literally thousands of paying ticket-holders for each game, because they need to make enough money not only to build and upkeep a stadium but to pay the salaries, etc. Yes, only wealthy people can own a team, but nobody is wealthy enough to throw all that money away just as entertainment: they need to be making money off of it.

*** If they are only 3000 witches and wizards that is too few to support a healthy population. Especially when it seems from canon that a single child is more common than lots of siblings. So we have 2000 adults and 1000 children. So then if the 1 and occasionally 2 kid birthrate applies. We will only have 500 new couples (assuming 50/50 gender) that means next round only 500 kids. With each generation getting smaller numbers let alone having the genetic diversity becoming non-existent.

So there have to be a much greater number of magicals (like around 30-40K). And Hogwarts has to be considered as an "upper crust" school for the movers and shakers in the magical world. And the birthrates have to be higher than what the books seem to imply as even 15-20K "breeding pairs" is too low to keep the population up without a lot higher birthrate.

** Actually, the thing I hate most about her "bad at numbers" is the way she changed the exchange rate for Galleons.

At the beginning of the series, a Gallon was said to be worth about 50 pounds. I don't know if she ever outright stated this, or if it was just calculated from the first book. When the owl arrives at the shack with Hagrid's paper, it cost 5 knuts. If you equate that to 50 pence, the going rate for a London daily paper at the time, that makes each knut roughly 10 pence. Multiply by 493 and you get roughly 50 pounds. So far, so good.

But somebody decided that exchange rate was too high. Don't know where that came from, since they're supposed to be made of gold. Maybe they were concerned that people wouldn't be spending galleons: after all, how often does anybody run around with 50 pound (or 50 dollar) bills? They're not the most common currency. So maybe that was the idea behind it; they wanted more galleons used in the stories rather than most of the prices being in sickles and knuts.

In any case, in 2001 --- after four books and a few months before the first movie was released --- she said the exchange rate was variable but around 5 pounds per galleon.

There are two problems with this:

- The first is just my personal thing: in a monetary system where she deliberately used prime numbers---29 knuts to a sickle, 17 sickles to a galleon, for a total of 493 knuts (not a prime number) per galleon---for some reason she wants an exchange rate that is an easily-multiplied number (50 and 5).
- Because she changed the exchange rate halfway through, she changed the Weasleys from "struggling" to "abject poverty." At the beginning of the second book, the Weasley vault has a SINGLE GALLEON and a few other coins. This means that the Weasleys, instead of having just over 50 pounds in their account (we've all been there), had just over 5 pounds in the bank. This for 5 kids at the BEGINNING of their school shopping. That wouldn't buy even one of Lockhart's books.

Not exactly expensive for what it is, but certainly something a struggling family would have a hard time coming up with which would somewhat justify Ron being sent off to school with a lightly damaged hand-me-down wand.

But at 5 pounds a galleon? 35 pounds is a lot easier for someone not in abject poverty to swing, even if it means a lean month of eating rice and ramen (even easier to justify since all the boys will be off at hogwarts which should cut the grocery bill down to next to nothing, even if they grow most of their own food)

He treated his wand somewhat poorly if after only 7 years at Hogwarts it had the unicorn hair poking through and likely wanted one in better shape to take for his dangerous job working with dragons. He probably thought he could help his parents out by giving his wand to Ron rather than making them buy a new one; two birds, one stone.

Honestly, given that Unicorn and Ash are all about consistency and loyalty its a little surprising that the wand worked as well for Ron as it did.

But Charlie's OLD wand indicates that Charlie has a new wand, probably the first thing he saved up for when he got his job. Since at this point Charlie had been out of Hogwarts for 7 years (before the ages were adjusted), it makes sense that he'd give his old one to his parents in case somebody could use it in the future.

Edit to add: Just because it was Charlie's old wand, does not mean Charlie was the first owner. Even at the very beginning, the wand had a bit of the unicorn hair core sticking out. That indicates the wand has seen either many years of use, or some rather hard use. Quite likely it was a hand-me-down for Charlie is well, just another reason he'd want a wand that chose him as soon as he could afford one.

*** And if it's Gold, well that's an exploit if I've ever seen one. The only reasonable explanation would be that the exchange rate was fixed at 1G = 5£ many years ago by treaty, and the Ministry is refusing to renegotiate that to screw with the goblins...

And speaking of goblins, given how many rebellions they had, it is surprising that there's even a single one of them left alive. Because rebellion usually meant traitors' justice, where hanging would have been a mild sentence compared to eg the wheel or being quartered. And since so many rebellions happened, it is unreasonable to assume that the goblins were overly successful since they needed to rebel again and again.

**** I look at the so called goblin rebellions as simply rough negotiations. In other words the goblins want a change in the treaty, the wizards don't want to renegotiate, the goblins rebell and once again they fight to a bloody draw (I can't see the wizards winning and not wiping the goblins out (for the reasons you stated), likewise for the goblins winning.)

So the only way I can see this working is that neither side is able to truly get the better of the other. So they fight, members on both sides die or get injured, they negotiate a truce with a treaty that gives a few things that the goblins want. And then they go back to an uneasy peace.

I could never understand the story arc that JKR came up with for the goblins. I mean come on why would you give your enemy control of your wealth irregardless of whether he is easily beatable or not.

*** I once wrote up my own big document comparing prices of things over the course of the books and it becomes clear that around Book 4, the decision was made to basically treat Galleons as a pound equivalent in that costs are generally defined in their relationship to galleons rather than anything else. To me the Wizarding Currency issue isn't so much a "Rowling can't math" issue as it is a "Rowling can't consistency" issue. Some things work better with the 50 to 1 rate, some work better with the 5 to 1 rate, others even work better with a 25 to 1 or a 1 to 1 rate. Rowling obviously never bothered to consider what things actually cost and chose to just write values that sounded good on paper.

** Here's an example relating to the population.

JK has stated that the population of wizarding britain is 3000ish, this is impossible.

In /The Goblet of Fire/, Arthur Weasley states that a ministry task force of 500 have been working all summer on the stadium for the quidditch world cup. This alone would mean that 1 sixth of the total population of magical britain was working on building that stadium. That's not all however. Let's forget the stated population, what would that task force imply?

So, it's a task force of ministry workers. That means it's a government function. Governments do not have the liberty to dedicate 100% of their resources to any one project. When not at war, they cannot even dedicate fully 20% of their resources to any one project due to the sheer number of other things they have to do. Let's be /extremely/ generous and assume that the ministry task force building the stadium accounted for 10% of the /entire government of magical britain./ That means that the Ministry of Magic is composed of, at minimum, 5000 people. (500 = 10%, 500 × 10 = 5000). So that means that the government /alone/ has 2000 more people than the stated population. But we can go further. According to the *UK Office of National Statistics* 16.5% of the total /working/ population was employed in the public sector, aka working for the government. ([[https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/publicsectorpersonnel/bulletins/publicsectoremployment/march2019#:%7E:text=For%20March%202019%2C%20there%20were,percentage%20points%20on%20December%202018.][Source found here]]) We can make a rough comparison between the wizarding and muggle worlds. Not a fully precise comparison as wizards live far longer than muggles, but any innacuracies on that account would mean less people in government not more so we can safely find a minimum. So if we take the ministry as having 5000 people, (remember, a generous estimate based on the government of magical britain dedicating /one tenth/ of their manpower to building a /stadium/), and apply the same statistics as found in the UK, then the minimum /working/ population of Magical Britain (not including children and retirees) is 30300ish (30303.03 repeating) as illustrated by this, JK Rowling's stated population for Magical Britain is frankly impossible.

But wait, there's more.

It would not be an unreasonable assessment to say that I am unfairly basing my analysis on a single excerpt from a much larger series, so I shall rely on a far more established example. The population of Hogwarts. Rowling has gone on record, ([[https://www.therowlinglibrary.com/2016/11/06/how-many-students-are-at-hogwarts/#:%7E:text=It%20was%20in%20Pottermore%20where,its%20own%20house%20and%20gender.][here]]), saying that Hogwarts has around 600 students in it. As found [[https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/demographics/age-groups/latest][here]], roughly 21.3% of the population of england and Wales is under 18. If we take as granted that Hogwarts is the sole magical school of britain, and that enrollment is free aside from the cost of supplies, then we can assume the vast majority of the population goes through the school. But there's another problem. Hogwarts only accounts for people between the ages of eleven and 17-18. I couldn't find any statistics that specific, so we will guesstimate that of the total under-18 population of britain, Hogwarts students account for 40% of them, (Seven years at hogwarts, half of that age range is nine years so 40% is generous), and that leaves us with a total under age population of 1500 (not including homeschooled students or part-humans barred from education). So, we've got an under-18 population of 1500. Under-18 accounts for 21.3% of the population of britain. Doing that math leaves us with a minimum population of 7042.25, more than double what JK stated, and again not including any homeschooled people, or part-humans denied education. /But there's more./ We know that witches and wizards live for longer than muggles with a stated life expectancy of 137 (and three quarters) in the 1990s, ([[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wizardkind#:%7E:text=Wizard%20life%20expectancy%20in%20Britain,times%20as%20long%20as%20their][Source]]), which is nearly double that of muggles at the time, who had a life expectancy of 75.14 years. The number of students at hogwarts remains the same, as does the number of under-18 individuals, but given that wizards live twice as long, then we can safely double the total population that we calculated based on those percentages. So instead of 7042.25 minimum, we get a minimum population of 14,084.5, or 1000 short of five times the stated population. So again, JK's stated population is /impossible/.

*/But wait, there's more!/*

You're probably sick of maths by now, so this has less than the other examples (still quite a bit though). Think about Diagon Alley, Knockturn Alley, and Hogsmeade. Think about their infrastructure. Can a /total population/ of 3000 support that kind of commercial infrastructure? What about the sports teams? We know that there are, at least, 13 professional quidditch teams. ([[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/ministry-of-magic/department-of-games/british-and-irish-quidditch-league/#:%7E:text=The%20thirteen%20most%20successful%20Quidditch,Ministry%20of%20Magic%20(OP7][Source]]). But how would that work? If you divide 3000 by 13 that's less than 250 fans per team, that's not enough to financially support a major league sports team. Hell, 1000 is barely enough. What about the wizengamot? It has roughly fifty members, one sixtieth of the total population. Is it really reasonable that the highest level of government, the equivalent of a legislature and judiciary rolled into one, would account for one out of every sixty people you meet? No, it wouldn't. And so, based on the institutions of Magical Britain, the stated population is impossible.

** The number of wizards working on The Quidditch World Cup means either the vast majority of the population work in sports entertainment, there are hundreds of other schools like Hogwarts that just aren't shown, or the wizarding world underwent an apocalyptic levels of depopulation if Hogwarts students make up the entirety of the underage wizarding population. One of these three must be true to make the numbers work, yet all three seem to be unsupported by canon or common sense.

Not to mention that extrapolating from the population, even if we give JK every single possible ideal scenario the percent of the population working in sports (IE even just counting the number of quidditch teams alone and ignoring the rest) is extraordinarily above muggle proportions.

Edit: just to elaborate on that last point ; They have leagues filled with teams like we do, despite having a pathetically small population proportionally

**** I think I remember somewhere in the books it's said that hogwarts is the best /in britain,/ which would imply more in the country. but in book 7 when hogwarts is made compulsory, a weasley (maybe bill or arthur) says even though most kids are educated there, the parents have the choice to educate them at home or send them abroad, with no mention of other schools in the country. one sentence doesn't disprove anything, but you'd think if there were other notable schools in britain, that's where they'd be referenced.

**** IIRC the canon of JKR is that there are thirteen great schools of magic, 8 of which we know. While it could be the other five are all scattered around Britain, it would be unlikely, and insufficient population anyway unless they accepted several dozen to hundreds of times more students than Hogwarts did.

** The biggest problem I have with that is the age of James' parents. I took the information on Fleamont Potter in the Harry Potter Wiki as a starting point. According to it, Fleamont was born before 1909, but his exact date of birth is never stated. This creates a lot of problems for me, as it could well indicate that he was born either one or several years before the aforementioned 1909. In the event that he was born a year earlier, when Euphemia (his wife) became pregnant with James, he would have been 51 years old (Euphemia became pregnant in 1959, and the following year James was born), so where is the "advanced age" that Rowling was talking about? Another problem with this has to do with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. In the opening scene of the film, in a page of the Daily Prophet you can read a note that talks precisely about Fleamont Potter and his hair potion Sleekeazy and how he had enchanted the American wizards and witches. The date when this happened was 1926. At this point Fleamont would have been in his final year at Hogwarts or he could have graduated earlier. My headcanon on this is that Fleamont was too prodigious to brew potions and had been working on it since he was at Hogwarts (as far-fetched as that sounds). How would you folks fit all this in?

** I don't think /any/ of the books have an accurate calendar for which weekday lines up with which day of the month, for one. Da Wiki dedicated a few paragraphs to it: [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Dating_conventions#Contradictions]]

There's also the Curious Case of Marcus Flint: In most editions of Philosopher's Stone, he's a sixth year - meaning his entire presence in Book 3 is a plot-hole (did he have to redo a post-O.W.L. year? Did he just show up for Quidditch and the staff didn't care? Neither explanation makes sense in the world). This one was eventually retconned so in newer editions he's a fifth-year.

The size of the magical population, too, is basically unexplained and inconsistent - at one point, J.K. stated that there's about 3000 wizards and witches. Goblet of Fire states that a task force of 500 Ministry employees worked on the Quidditch World Cup stadium - so that's 1/6th of the total population of Magical Britain not only working in government, but presumably /in just the one or two departments relevant to that task/ - the Department of Magical Games and Sports, and /maybe/ the Department of International Magical Cooperation since the stadium would be used for an event of international significance.

In Book 1, it's stated that the Gryffindor team hadn't won since Charlie Weasley graduated... Which according to later books, would have been the year before. Similarly, Ginny wanted to go to Hogwarts "since Bill started" - which doesn't make sense in any timeline.

It's something J.K. Rowling herself admitted in interviews, as well - she's self-admittedly very bad at numbers, and IIRC has actually stated something that boiled down to "please don't over-analyze the numbers in my books, they're probably rubbish" at some point.

For a story with a detailed economy... I'm beginning to sound like a broken record, but [[/u/Taure]] keeps track of the main-character's finances in quite a bit of detail in side-material for Victoria Potter: linkao3(13795605).

** As for the recommendation: HPMOR (Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) by Eliezer Yudkowsky. If you're interested specifically in the economy, exchange rates etc. then in Chapter 4: The Efficient Market Hypothesis it's all explained but I highly encourage you to read the whole fic, overall the wizarding world presented in it includes more complicated system of politics so it's all really interesting. Also if you prefer to listen then there's an audiobook called Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality Podcast by Eneasz Brodski and you can either download it or for example listen to it on Spotify

​

edit woah that's got rather downvoted, can someone explain to my why? I'm just genuinely curious what's wrong with the recommendation because I think there has to be something I'm not aware of
