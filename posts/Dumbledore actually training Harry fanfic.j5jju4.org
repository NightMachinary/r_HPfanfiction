I know this i probably a long shot, but I would really love to read a good fic where Dumbledore trains Harry, where none of the are fucking psychos, but are acting quite close to canon, or at least ish. Hopefully some of you can help me!

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
