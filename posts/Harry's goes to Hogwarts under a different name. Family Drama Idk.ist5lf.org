:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Guys I really need help looking for a fic. I read it a while ago and unfortunately can't remember any real details about it. I want to say it was on FF but could have been AO3 as I use it as well.

Okay. SO what I remember is Harry is raised by someone else (Not the Dursleys or Potters) however the the Potters are alive and they have a daughter. I swear her name was Rose (but that could have been a different fic) and she is (a year?) younger than Harry.

The big difference in this one from others like it was that NO one knew who Harry was outside of whoever raised him, might have been Sirius but i don't know. I just know Harry knew about his magic and was powerful, trained Might have even been Voldemort, as I know I've read one like that before.

I don't think it was a Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived (but It could have been) because Harry was older than his sister (not twins) and i'm pretty sure everyone thought he was dead. Now the big thing I remember was Harry knew who he was and while he didn't want anything to do with this parents (I think.) he watched over his sister while they were at school. During the Tri-Wizard tournament, I swear she gets entered and Harry ended up jumping into the arena to stop fire (Dragon probably) when she was about to be hit and killed. This might have been a part where he was outed but I honestly can't remember. I just know he saved her and it drew attention to him, and i think whoever was his guardian wasn't happy about it. I really hope someone knows what this is. I want to read it again.

  Nearly born at the same time, twins but still different. Daniel is declared the boy who lived. So what's a good brother to do? Create his own legend... and protect his brother. Careful World, here comes the Black. Contains Harem, some Femslash and Powerful/OP Harry.
