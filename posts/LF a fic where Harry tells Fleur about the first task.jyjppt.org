:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So from what I remember, Harry tells Fleur about the dragons in the first task of The Goblet Of Fire and he wants her to tell Krum. Harry thinks that the dragons are too dangerous for the champions not to be prepared.

I'm pretty sure it's a Harry/Fleur fic.


** I think that you will need some more details, because I am pretty sure there are at least 10 fics I have read where this happens.

*** If i remember right, he goes to Fleur who is talking with a bunch of other girls and asks to talk in private. He tells her about the dragons, she already knows and is a little confused why he is telling her this. Harry was pretty sure that she already knew but he wasn't going to risk it.

Sorry if this isn't much, anything you could send my way would be much appreciated, especially if it's on Fanfiction XD

**** Yea, I'm sure I have read it. But since it is a more or less common thing, and really only one scene that doesn't really define a story, I am having a hard time figuring out what fic it was.

Have you searched the subreddit for Harry/Fleur? Maybe some of the fics recced in normal Harry/Fleur request threads will ring a bell for you.

** Maybe All It Takes is One Girl, by StevenTLawson over on Ao3?

I won't link it as it's got lots of smut, which is against rules I believe.
