I was thinking of trying to find a ff where Harry can talk with Fawkes about his quest. Wondering if there are any fics of Fawkes possessing Albus after the funeral and decides to teach Harry (equalling instant transportation, a teacher who hopefully won't die, and an ally who has the power of the former Headmaster and the soul of a phoenix). Anything remotely close to this exist? Thanks!


** Honestly, I'd missed the after funeral part, and thought of it more like this:

One moment Fawkes was a phoenix, with everything that entailed. He was a bird, obviously, and one who had a particular fondness for Frost Elderberries at that, and a magical creature symbol of Light and Good. It was a pretty sweet gig, actually. Having to take a bullet for his human and acting like an avian evil-detector were important duties, of course, but not ones that infringed significantly upon his free time. Most days, his primary concern was to find and 'liberate' some berries to devour in place of that ridiculous seed that the human insisted was 'healthy'. He was a phoenix, for Flame's sake! Health was not an issue!

And then, he was not.

Fawkes woke up, stretching out his wings, ready to take flight and survey his domain... and noticed his wings had an alarming lack of feathers. The temperature was also rather low, and his memories most certainly didn't feature him wearing a hot pink robe dotted with authentic green olives and artfully weaved hay.

"Squeak!" voiced Fawkes, alarmed and in a voice that was not his own. I fact, it was quite familiar. A look into one of the many silvery instruments showed the currently less-than -fiery firebird a bearded visage of Hogwart's headmaster. A look at his perch showed signs of rapid departure by fire travel - Fawkes would have never singed his own perch.

Now, when it comes to phoenixes, 'bird brain' is woefully inaccurate descriptor. Upon realizing that he was stuck in the old, human boy and that he had no way to arrange a disappearance without a large scale manhunt, he utilized the three hours he had before the start of Opening Feast to examine all his memories of his, disloyal and treacherous!, human. It was a credit to his intelligence that when a time came, Albus Dumbledore came strolling into the Great Hall.

He did stumble occasionally, but it didn't look like anyone noticed - they were more focused on his robes, whuch were much less offensive than usual. Yellows, oranges, reds and obviously some actual fire - Fawkes already felt much better. Not as good as if he had his majestic plumage back, but beggars, choosers.

Fawkes as Dumbledore managed tosit through sorting of new humans and waited until the hall was quiet. It was time for his speech, and Fawkes spent more time than the customary three minutes Dumbledore took for writing one! He'd go over all the needed points and even make it interesting! Fawkes moved his body to stand and started to speak.

"Scree! Squawk! Scree-tchrrr!"
