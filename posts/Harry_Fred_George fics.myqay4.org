If anyone knows any good H/F/G fics please suggest them!!


** The proper flair for this is Request. Recommendation means you're telling us about a fic you liked.

That said, I don't have any recs that are strictly H/F/G.

I've got one where an older Harry travels back in time and adopts his younger self, starting with the trial for underage magic before 5th year. Older Harry with Snape, younger/canon (sort of) Harry with the twins. Dumbledore/Hermione/Molly bashing, some Sirius bashing. The Games They Play by DebstheSlytherinSnapeFan linkffn(11321032) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4167129][Also on AO3]].

There's also one where Harry and Snape are attracted to each other, but refraining because Harry is still underage (that's crazy talk!). So they both have encounters with the twins in the meantime. So there's H/F/G, S/F/G, and eventual H/S (lots of pining), and ultimately H/S/F/G. A Question of Etiquette by SwtAlmnd. It's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1297678][on AO3]] but members only, so the bot is blocked.

  Thirty-Four year old Harry Potter travels back in time, adopting the name of Blake Slytherin - he interferes with his own trial and messes with Dumbledore's perfectly laid plans. What happens afterwards? will Blake have bitten off more than he can chew? Will it be left to Harry to do what needs to be done? SLASH HP/FW/GW BS/SS NO MPREG
