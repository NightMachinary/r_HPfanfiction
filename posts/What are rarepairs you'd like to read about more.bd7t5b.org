*** Because JKR secretly stipulated that no less than 80% of HP fics must contain Hermione Granger. If the percentage ever dips below that, she'll pull an Anne Rice and withdraw her permission to allow others to write HP fanfiction.

**** I guess, but a dynamic between Harry and femRon still feels unique and interesting to me. Ginny isn't a developed as Ron is and with femRon you can start their frienship the same way and go from there.

I vaguely remember a few fics that had these, but it's very much a case of "pick two: either quality writing, long length or an absence of nauseatingly raunchy lemon scenes arbitrarily thrown into the story"

Makes a lot more sense to me than Victor/Hermione. This will be the ultimate Quidditch couple.

Victor even showed some interest in Ginny at Bill/Fleur Wedding.

** A while back, I wanted to read some Harry/Cho. I was genuinely surprised over how rare the pairing is with the brief, but legitimate (it's clearly reciprocated even if it failed to go further than a mere crush) presence it has in actual canon. Tons of fanon pairings is far more common, such as Harry/Hermione, Harry/Luna or Harry/Daphne.

I get the impression in most Harry/Cho fics that Cho ends up being a "backup pairing" in most fics. Basically, for reasons, the canon pairing (Harry/Ginny) are off-limit (Ginny is paired with someone else). So instead Harry gets Cho to tie up a loose end. It's not very satisfying reading.
