There have been plenty of fanfics and discussions that criticise how the wizarding world works, but are there any fics that look at the opposite viewpoint where wizards judge and criticise different aspects of muggle society?


** I'm now imagining Luna Lovegood presenting a Wizarding Wireless programme which is a David Attenborough style nature documentary where she narrates (her observations on) Muggle life.

*** Maybe, if we ask [[/u/Full-Paragon][u/Full-Paragon]] nicely, he'll write one for us.

** Huh. It is mostly positive, isn't it? The impact of technology and the effect of pre-Hogwarts muggle schools are often used in 'muggle-wank' stories. And if I had a nickel for every time I read that a pureblood (Draco, insertSlytherinloveinterest, Neville, the odd Weasley...) is shocked speechless by a cinema or an amusement park.

As far as criticizing goes... Mad_Fairy's [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447?hide_banner=true][Mischief's Heir series]] does a whole bit around halfway through about muggle's ruining the environment and having to charm the pollutants out of their system and clean up landfills while it becomes harder to hide.
