Some that I dont like:

I dont like Snape being purely evil. It just feels like a betrayal of Dumbledores character to have him be fooled by Snape. The closest I come to accepting this is in Harry Potter and the Dangerous Choice.

Also hate how all Slytherins get portrayed as bad. Draco comes under this as well. I prefer him to not just be evil and have a bit more character to him. Ive read fics where there is Slytherins that arent bad, just see the world differently than people like the weasleys.

Also Ron being physically protective of Ginny towards Harry. He can be annoyed, not like PDA, but Ive read fics where he threatens to, and gets, physically violent at Harry over his sister. To me thats a betrayal of rons character and his relationship with Harry and Ginny

and lastly, I dont like when authors write a character as the hyperbole of that character. Big ones for this are Hermione, Ron, Mrs Weasley, Snape. They write hermione as strict as possible, where she always demands to know things. Thats not how she is in the real books, shes more complex than this.

Ron gets written as lazy, insecure, angry and just eats all the time.

Mrs Weasley is extremely over protective. This comes into play more in a Seventh Book fic where shes trying to protect Harry from things like The Order meetings etc

and snape, where the author will take his snide, angry lines towards Harry and make that every singe piece of dialogue Snape speaks


** The one that gets me is the pureblood trained uber cunning stuff. A properly raised pureblood spots an eyebrow a milimeter out of place and deduces the correct strategy to elevate themselves to supreme commander over the backs of the helpless noobs who aren't trained in the subtle exercise of cunning and ambition. Poor Daphne gets this a lot.

** There are too many to list, but one I thought about today, is "best friend Neville". Many fics just replace Ron with Neville, and that isn't so terrible by itself, but in most of those stories Neville completely lacks character. Oh, he doesn't abandon Harry. He isn't jealous of Harry. He doesn't ever argue with Harry. He's grateful to be Harry's friend. In other words, he becomes nothing other than Harry's little pet - you can replace him with a puppy and nothing would change, because he's just scenery, a non-entity. I can hazard a guess that many writers replace Ron with him because they believe Ron wasn't a good, +submissive+ loyal enough +minion+ friend for Harry, which really explains their (lack of)characterization of Neville - who, at most, comes off as a Mini-Harry (which I suppose is how he looked like in the last book).

**** You're right. He wasn't very interesting in canon. And here really lies the problem - why replace Ron with him, if you're not even going to develop his character in interesting ways? he's the most boring sidekick in existence. At least Ron was funny. But, as I said, seeing the attitude towards Ron shared by many in the fandom, I'm inclined to think that they just want a "friend" who would be totally submissive to Harry, and would never do something that clashes with Harry's needs.

*** Whenever I've thought on that (and by that I mean the prospect of Neville replacing Ron in canon) I've always subconsciously imagined Neville as being effectively Peter Pettigrew II but with less of a reason to go dark... However, weighing that up, I'd say that there's an equal opportunity for him to go dark because of his past and because of how he might be treated in that environment.

Ron is human in the original stories. He's a flawed individual but that's what makes him human and loveable. He adapts, he changes and ultimately he comes through at the end for Harry. Neville becomes a champion of his own right and a hero without Harry's help. He's inspired by him perhaps, but ultimately he makes his own choices and forges his own destiny alone.

So as far as they go, I've always put aside those fics as soon as I see it happening. Neville is always played down and abysmally written. I also despise Ron bashing which tends to happen in those fics. As quite often it tends to happen for no reason other than him being the most down to earth and realistic person. Either that or they've thrown all the stereotypical anti-Ron personality crap into him. Where he's constantly insecure, rude, stupid and excessively eating. Eh... It's silly stuff really that adds nothing to the plot except for this overwhelming amount of hatred aimed at Ron by the author.

** I also don't like over protective Ron. I don't like the puritanism that gets heaped on Ginny at all to be honest, authors read lots of older brothers as this terrifying force for Harry to overcome and it just doesn't ring true. We see Fred and George lightly tease Ginny about boyfriends and we see ron getting grumpy at times (but not with Harry), so I think it's an odd leap to suggest that the entire Weasley family is so evangelical about sex and relationships. Lots of people tell me they think wizarding society is more conservative than normal society, but I don't think it needs to go that far.

*** theres one fic, The Seventh Horocrux by Melindaleo, that really annoys me with this. Its a seventh book fic so weve already seen that Ron is Ok with it in HBP. In that one theres many scenes where Ron threatens Harry, not in a funny sort of way, and even one scene where he attacks Harry because hes tickling Ginny. The reason this really annoys me is because in her previous work Power of emotion and Curse of the damned (which are book 6 and 7 fics), Rons completey fine with it, he just gets annoyed at the PDA

I also hate ones with custom wands where they simply wave their hand over a bunch of items and get some super wand (that is nothing like everyone else's wand) and everyone is /shocked/ because he is so powerful.

In fact, I would love to read a story where harry goes on this insane shopping spree and comes home to discover his super fancy gem was simply glued on and he was completely ripped off by the store owner and his wand is no better than an Olivander's.

And his trunk isn't worth sleeping in because a train goes by every hour on the hour and the vibrations make all his potions ingredients vibrate and fall over because it's in "wizard space"

LOL. or perhaps a month after getting it he gets a heft property tax bill for all that wizard space. I mean come on, there must be a downside somewhere.

And for once, in a marriage law fic, I'd like to see Harry and Ron secretly high five each other under the table because they "dodged that bullet" and someone else is stuck with her. LOL

** Slavish adherence to canon stations annoys me the most.

When you change characters' personalities and some other conditions, you have to use your own logic to determine whether canon events could still unfold in the same way as in the books. When I pick my favorite stories, I look especially for logical and plausible plot developments.

For example:

*Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106), generally follows the outline of the books, but makes necessary changes along the way, and it is always very hilarious, such as what happened in CoS: [[/spoiler]["You stop this nonsense and get back in your diary, young man"...It was necessary evil. I had enough competition without another me running around.]]

*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382), starts out with the troll incident, but only Harry showed up to save Hermione and he had an interesting, non-canon, power. As a result, year 1 events diverged significantly. However, Arthur Weasley searching Malfoy Manor still happened, and Lucius Malfoy retaliated by slipping the Diary into Ginny's cauldron. Year 2 then followed canon closely, until Harry went down into the Chamber. From that point on, the story truly diverges from the canon.

*Backward with Purpose I*, linkffn(4101650), initially falls into the 'strictly follows the canon stations' trap, but the author smartly explains it away as protagonists' mistakes after near disaster in CoS. Year 3 and 4 diverged significantly, and things became completely different afterwards.

I also agree that there shouldn't really be any abuse scenes, because that's far too overdone now and just feels pretty cheap. But as for actual torture scenes? Very often they've set the fic in one of the wizarding wars. It's a war with no rules (or at least none established by canon). Torture is gonna happen one way or another.

The cruciatus curse is one of the ways, the other is more physical. But there should be a balance for it. An understanding of how much is actually appropriate in a fic. How much is actually story and plot essential and what is extra flavour and unnecessary waffle. Far too many people get the balance wrong and as a result it just turns into a book version of Saw.

** The entire concept of a 'soul bond' makes me immediately drop a fic. It's just a half ass way to justify a relationship without putting any real work into it.

Hermione being a pureblood; It's not the worst thing I've seen, but it's pretty fucked when she drops her 'boring' muggle parents for her kickass pureblood ones-typically the LeStranges.

Lily being a Pureblood; I still don't get why people do this. Harry doesn't need to be related to Merlin from his mother's side, people. The Potters are an old family, if you really want him to be a god just make it from the Potter line instead of making a crock and bull story of Lily coming from a bunch of squibs.

Harry being raised by Death Eaters...but still becomes friends with Muggleborn!Hermione. Like damn, if you're having Harry be raised almost exclusively by racist bigots-with his only interactions being with other children raised by racist bigots- then chances are he'll be a racist bigot, too.

Hermione as a genius; she's not some kind of billion IQ genius, guys. She's just really diligent at schoolwork and studying.

Voldemort/Harry. Just...if Harry would become a Dark Lord, why would he pair up with a 70 year old man? Draco, sure, that at least kinda makes sense, but Voldemort? Snape is already pushing the line...(That includes Snape/FemHarry, btw)

Pick any fic where Harry is addicted to drugs; chances are, he's gay in it. I know many straight drug users, and many gay people who don't use drugs at all. So why is it this is so prevalent?

** - I (used to) read a lot of Hermione/X fics where she'll start out in a relationship with Ron and then dump him because he's a boorish, misogynistic mamma's boy (in the fic). He's an easy foil for the older, more cultured wizard. Usually stories like these aren't so great. There a few exceptions.

- I've seen this even in genfic, but I'll often see stories that take Mrs. Weasley's personality and make her over-the-top evil or a huge nagging burden to Arthur. On an odd note, I don't think I've ever read a Weasley-bashing fic that wasn't just mostly bashing Ron/Ginny/Mrs. Weasley.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama][Rape as Drama]]

I understand that everything is up for grabs in creative writing, but the instances where this appears in all the fan fiction I've read (as well as most original fiction) are just so unnecessary. Death Eaters are evil enough already, as is Voldemort. Uncle Vernon, Snape, Lucius and Co. are already Knobheads International. Instead of going straight for the jugular, why not be a little more creative with how unpleasant these characters are?

I.e. Vernon cuts off the central heating for a week and puts halogen heaters in Dudley's and the master bedroom. Diabolical, right?

On that note, trigger-happy Voldemort is so infuriatingly ubiquitous in fanfiction. This is the dude who made a fool out of Lucius Malfoy by depriving him of his wand while squatting in his home. He was known for putting strange Curses on people during the first war, rather than outright killing/torturing everyone in sight.

After all, he does still think that "every drop of magical blood is precious". He only purged those who were a threat to his prospective regime. So can we put the AK down for a second, maybe?

Eh, depends on how it's written. Most times I've seen this written about, it focuses on house elves and Hermione's crusade and SPEW. This can go very right or very wrong in my opinion. If house elves are actually written as simple-minded and misguided creatures that "need" a master simply because that's how it's done, then that's a problem. However, I have also seen it written as though the bond between house elf and master is symbiotic and beneficial to both parties. In these cases, I don't see the problem with slavery of nonhuman races.

As for it being "sick," that's just applying your modern morals to a culture that doesn't necessarily share them. Over the course of human history there have been--and there still are--many cultures who do not see slavery as sick. And that's slavery of humans--often justified by the people looking differently.

This is a man who has simultaneously delved further into magical theory, especially dark magic, than anyone else in the last several centuries, if not millenia, while also leading a political rebellion that was within a stones throw of victory thwarted whatever it is Lily did.

******* Well, just because his plan worked flawlessly doesn't make it a good plan. It was convoluted and riskier than it had any right to be. It worked, because it's a book and the author needed it to work.

There were far too many things that could have happened for it go otherwise to call it a good plan. A good plan keeps as many variables as possible within your control, this plan kept almost none of them in Voldemort's control.

Harry was put up against kids older and more magically experienced than he was. And although Moody gave him help, it wasn't game-changing, he should still have been the overwhelming favorite to lose.

The only place where Voldemort seemed to take control of proceedings was in the final task, through Imperius etc.

But all of that could have been avoided if he'd just had Moody take Harry at some other point in time.

Why do you think Voldemort has strong tactical abilities? I don't think we ever get any evidence to support that stance.

Although you are right in that the only reason he loses to Harry is due to arrogance (of the nth degree) and plot armor.

The best fanfictions are the ones where you honestly feel like the characters are not going to be able to reach a resolution for the conflict.

He clearly had innate talent beyond that of most others.

For most people, no significant difference can be seen in innate ability, but saying that it doesn't exist, or that it goes against canon seems incorrect to me.

Harry, for example, is innately better at flying than most wizards and witches.

**** I don't think it's the same. Riddle being able to do violence at an early age speaks to the boy's intense curiosity about his powers, and pushing them to the max from day one. As someone else mentioned, Tom Riddle is a person who pushed magic to its absolute boundaries whenever possible. It'd be folly to think that his abilities came from an innate magical core, rather than endless training, and an obsessive need to strive for more.

#+end_quote

So, I'm posing that Riddle is innately talented, and my 'evidence' is that he caught onto magic in a way that almost no one else in canon is shown to.

As a child, before he even went to Hogwarts, Riddle could do things without a wand that some people struggle to do with one.

He could levitate and move objects, he could inflict harm (vague as that is) on those that annoyed him, and he could control the minds of animals and creatures. And the most impressive part is, he could do this consciously without a wand.

No other witch or wizard is shown to be capable of such control over their magic at a young age.

You argue that it's a matter of endless training. However, why would he endlessly train if he has no knowledge that magic exists? What would he be endlessly training towards?

Even if he had one case of accidental magic that spurred him to try do something else, it's likely he caught on quick because otherwise there would surely be at least a few more cases of children learning to control their magic without wands and before Hogwarts.

As it is, there are only two other cases in canon of partially controlled magic prior to Hogwarts. Lily Potter floating some leaf petals, and McGonnagall summoning toys (inadvertently).

And away from Tom Riddle, what explanation would you have for the other example of innate talent I offered? Harry's innate talent on a broom compared to those of everyone else?

****** Fair enough! You're absolutely right that the speaking to snakes /is/ an innate ability, because his mum died long before Tom had the ability to speak at all. In that one at the very least, I feel like we're both on the same page, right?

Hmm. I was thinking of the Dudley snake zoo incident with Harry. It might well be way too many fanfics, or actual canon, but I do recall something about accidental magic from young people being a perfectly normal thing that the wizarding world doesn't get alarmed about, you know?

In my head, Tom Riddle is an unusual child insofar as he had the perfect conditions to become powerful long before a wand came into the picture. Like, if we accept that kids perform accidental magic all the time, or that it's nothing to be alarmed about (even if it is relatively unusual), then it would follow that at least one kid out there would put two and two together, and figure out that there's something about these unexplainable incidents had something to do with him. Someone who's as naturally intelligent as Tom would have noticed these incidents, and automatically assumed it's because he's something special, right? So even before being introduced to the rest of wizarding society, he'd have figured out the minor things that he can sort out on his own.

All that said, I hadn't thought of things in quite the way you've laid out here, so I thank you for giving me some food for thought. I really enjoy reading other people's opinions on HP canon, and their theories for why they support this or that particular line of thinking. I especially like how you're having me consider (and reconsider) the whole concept of innate abilities in the HP world in general.

You've got the genetic component, with Harry being naturally good at flying. You've got hard workers, like Hermione. You've got nature and nurture with someone like Neville coming into his own much later, and really showing his heritage of being the son of two very accomplished parents.

You've given me a lot to think about, and I respectfully thank you for it.

I get it. You want a powerful character. Sometimes a person is powerful because of the intelligent choices he's made. Sometimes a person can be powerful because of the skills they wield in combining charms, curses, and hexes in such a way as to get the job done well. The over 9000 thing is a cop out, and a cheap way to get to "this person is powerful."

This. All of this. Though to be fair, I'm content with Draco being portrayed as a spoiled little shit, because that's all he really is with regard to canon. He doesn't really "come into his own" or show any sign of real intelligence or leadership aside from being a sheep leading other sheep until the Deathly Hallows.

I'm sick of the plot device of "oh we can't think of any decent originally named Death Eaters to save our lives, let's just have every Slytherin ever mentioned in the books be one and all of them be super evil too." Or every Death Eater is a member of the Sacred 28... Just please... Show some originality.

Agreed. Though I've also read fics where Ron does this when Harry/other males are being overly perverted and creepy in general and Ron does this and yet still gets a ton of flack over it. I'm not sure what's worse really, Ron getting flack for being characterised as a protective older brother or him getting flack for being lazy, insecure, angry and eating all the time.

Other plots that irritate me: Draco being the "bad boy" of Slytherin... Just no. He's about the furthest you could get from a bad boy. Pampered spoiled prince doesn't mean bad boy.

Any concept of Harry/every woman ever. Just no.

Marriage contracts and soul bonds pretty much make me drop the fic instantly... But that's mainly because the majority of soul bonds fics I've read have been absolutely abysmally written and are generally appalling in content. Marriage contract fics tend to be a thinly disguised attempt at the Harry/every woman ever trope which is something I'm just not into. It's a bad device either way designed to force two or more characters into situations that they wouldn't otherwise be in... And all in all, it just comes across as a lazy and lacking in originality attempt.

I could go on, but I really feel like this would turn into a super long rant that would eventually exceed the Reddit comment character limit.

Harry apologising to Snape. The dude was a shit teacher, and a complete fuckwad to you. You were a child. You wanted revenge on the asshole who's putting you in harm's way by being a shit teacher at BLOCKING THE DARK LORD FROM YOUR BRAIN. If anything, Snape should apologise to you for being a failure of a human being.

Super evil Dumbledore. Yes, the man was cunning, and had plenty of machinations in place to move the people around him into the right spots. However, I don't see him as pulling wings off of flies evil. He didn't throw Harry to the Dursleys and then ignore flagrant abuse because he's a monster. He was literally scared for the baby's life, and was resorting to something akin to blood magic to make sure the baby is safe from the most dangerous threat to the entire world.

Super oblivious Ron. The dude can spot a chess move from a mile away. He's not stupid. Making him into a clueless jock is insulting to the character.

Spaced out Luna Lovegood. Luna is one of the few characters that has extremely good insight into her friends (even if she lacked a few social graces). Making her into a space case is insulting to her intelligence, kindness, and overall awesomeness.
