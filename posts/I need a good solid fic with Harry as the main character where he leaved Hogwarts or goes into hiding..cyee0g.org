As stated above, are there any fanfics that are *COMPLETED* and over 100k words that involve harry going to another school or going into hiding and training. I like OCs and the longer the better, but complete.

Something similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][*A Second Chance at Life*]] By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/100447/Miranda-Flairgold][*Miranda Flairgold*]]

​

All suggestions welcome :)


** Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) has young Harry going into hiding pre Hogwarts with Sirius. Tonks, Remus, Moody, Malfoy hunt them.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** Harry goes to America, plenty of OC's and a thoroughly developed story. I enjoyed it.

Paring is Harry/OFC not H/G like the link suggests

** Linkffn(Finding a Place to Call Home) fits. I'm personally not a huge fan of it, though, and the author's writing can be . . . spotty.

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria
