Hello [[/r/HPFanfiction]]!

I'm currently an admin over at the [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com][Harry Potter Fanfiction Wiki Project]], and I'm looking to buff up some of our Themed Lists. Today I'm looking for "Sibling-Who-Lived" stories. I know I've read a bunch... I just can't think of them at the moment.

[[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Theme:_AU:_Sibling-Who-Lived][Here are the parameters for what kind of fics I'm accepting]]:

- A sibling or relative of Harry Potter is or is believed to be the One-Who-Lived.

- If Harry is actually the Boy-Who-Lived, then the public must believe that he is not.

The only one I have listed so far is the Saving Connor series (also known as the Sacrifices Arc). What other fics of this type did you enjoy?

We're really new, so please feel free to help out and contribute!


** I'm partial to The Santi's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]]. Note: the Work By Author section of DLP has several chapters not on fanfiction dot net (membership required to read).

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

No character bashing.

**** Fair enough, though I'd contend that the story is told primarily from Harry's POV and as Harry and Ron don't get along at all (in large part because of Ron's role in driving a wedge between the brothers), he's not going to come off favorably. I don't consider it bashing if it's a reasonable, not overly exaggerated extrapolation from canon Ron. (I also think it's clear that Harry is unfair to Ron in the story.)

*** This one is amazing. One of my favorite fics. It's been abandoned though.

H/Hr which may put people off, but I enjoyed it. Starts off in 5th year (I think) and shows some stuff in flashbacks. It's been a while since I read it so I can't remember if his brother knows Harry is his sibling as Harry has changed his last name to Black.

There was another one where Harry was a bit of a badass but I can't remember it...

** This is definitely my favorite sibling fic right now. It's really long but totally worth the read. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7724057/1/Family-Bonds]]

"When, after that fateful Halloween night, the wrong Potter twin is hailed the Boy Who Lived, how will Harry's life turn out? With a power he knows not, an ancient prophecy and one Severus Snape practically raising him, interesting at least is a given."
