  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** Since OP's request is pretty vague and they didn't elaborate on specifics and I feel like reading something from a few years ago that fits the request:

I recall a fic where a bunch of death eaters attacked Harry, I think during the summer before sixth year at the Dursleys. If I recall correctly Harry ended up taking a killing curse to the chest and got a cross shaped scar or something like that, I'm also pretty sure it was Bellatrix who did it and he jumped in front of it to save Tonks.

I'm pretty sure shortly after at Grimmauld Place Dumbledore basically said it that the prophecy was literal and both Harry and Voldemort were unable to die to anyone but the other.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

*** I think you missed the point of fan fiction requests. OP isn't asking for canon rules (which are fuzzy anyway), they are asking for fan fiction where a specific rule is altered. Telling them that what they are asking for isn't canon doesn't help anyone. If you're trying to be funny, it's coming off as mocking instead.
