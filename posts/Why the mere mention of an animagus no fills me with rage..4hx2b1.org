** I admit, I much preferred one author's headcanon that your animagus form would always be a species native to where you were born/grew up. Actually consistent with the Maurauders. That author stuck to wolves, deer, badgers, rabbits, crows, sparrows, etc. Wolf would have been the apex predator, the most advanced one possible (for a Brit).

Black rats, brown rats, domestic cats, grey squirrels, fallow deer... They are all introduced species.

And would a frilled lizard count? They are kept as pets and it would give Harry an awesome threat display.

**** I'm going to decide on something a bit airy fairy, but it doesn't really matter since I don't write. I think when enough animals of a species has returned to the earth, that animal has an affiliation with that land mass, and the wizard who lives on that land mass, also has a magical and spiritual affiliation with the earth, and his magic and spirit gains an affiliation with the animal/s that match them best. I include the potential for plural animals because not every person is one dimensional, and have many facets to their personality - plus, patronuses can be different to animagus forms

****** Animals raised for slaughter change the dynamics a bit, which magic recognises, so it actually becomes less likely. So someone could easily be a wild boar or pheasant, if that was their spirit animal, but not a farm pig or chicken. Always exceptions of course, someone might gain an affiliation, like a farmer maybe.

It's an interesting idea, the strength gaining with more deaths, and I think it does apply, to a certain extent

** Animagus seems to be a bit excessive really, something you can learn, that isn't all that useful. From what I'm aware, its a rather difficult Transfiguration ability to learn, but if you needed to be an animal for something, human-to-animal transfigurations exists, so seems like a FAR more useful skill to master. This is, of course, ignored in all fanfiction(that I can recall).

** Well, it really depends how it's handled (hell, multiple forms can be handled well, too - unless it's only Harry who can do that), sure if often turns into a (BAD!) cliche, but that's on the author (if you can't write a good story then even a totally original plot-line etc. won't save you - a good writer however can handle cliches just fine!)

ps: I don't hate cliches (as in: I will read cliche stories if I think they are well writen!)

pps: The non-traditional route (sadly I haven't seen that done often) is that changing shape can be achieved by other means (like say it's some for of druidic or shamanistic magic...hell, alternative forms of magic aren't done nearly often enough IMHO!)
