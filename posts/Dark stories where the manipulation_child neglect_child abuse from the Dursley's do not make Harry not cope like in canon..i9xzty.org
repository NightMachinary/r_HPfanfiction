Looking for a more real fics that a abused child doesn't cope well with the world and isn't fun and loving right out the get go from living under the stairs.

Can be canon abuse or non canon abuse. Can be as AU or as canon as possible.

Can be on any site/anyone can be the main character/can be any length/anyone can be the main character.

Can be completed or not.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash, Threesomes and the like.


** I think your title has an extra "not" that reverses its meaning.

Have you come across linkffn(Harry's New Home)?

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS!
