I recently read *The Heir of the House of Black* by RavenclawBlues. I hadn't read something about the black brothers for a long time and it made want to read more. So any suggestions with both brothers centric stories? No slash or romance in general would be preferable.

P.S. I was reminded of a fic i read a few years ago with Regulus being an auror who lives in Australia (at some point). If someone can also remind this story it would be great.

Thanks in advance!


** I'm starting a new comment :) Most of them include Sirius but as you will be able to tell, I like Regulus' and Harry's dynamic very much.

  Regulus Black comes out of the black lake quite mad, very much his mother's son. Hogwarts will keep him safe, says Dumbledore, who offers him the post of Charms professor.But Regulus hasn't stopped drowning (lungs saturated with water, mind torn apart) and the face of Harry Potter, who looks too much like James, makes him realize the war is never over.

#+begin_quote
  The underlying fact is that Professor Black is the brother of the mass-murdering, You-Know-Who supporting, escapee: Sirius Black. And Harry's feelings are quite mixed---because Professor Black was never really a teacher Harry got along with yet, at the same time, Harry knows too well the feeling of being blamed for something you didn't do. (In which the events of PoA are retold with a surly, sneering, Slytherin Charms professor).

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.

  Regulus was five when he learned that his mother was a cruel woman. Fresh from the cave and with revenge burning bright in his heart, Regulus was determined to restore his honour and rectify his mistakes - starting with his brother's godson. Faced with the inevitable return of the Dark Lord, Regulus prepared as best he could, but not even he foresaw all the consequences of his decision.

  At the end of the war, one man lost his freedom and one child went missing. Regulus was unable to act at the time, out of touch with his brother and unaware of the Dark Lord's actions. Now, nearly a decade later, Regulus's world changes again when his brother is released back into his care- damaged but alive. Regulus can do nothing for Sirius's sanity now, but seeing his brother reminds him of who Sirius used to be. A fighter. A Gryffindor. A proud man. A good friend. A strong ally.A godfather.

  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

  I'm going bonkers, Harry thinks to himself as he tears through the pile of Muggle pamphlets. He scowls at the titles, things like ‘Foolproof Guide to Losing a Loved One' or ‘Navigating the Stages of Grief.' Like another tasteless advert in the Daily Prophet: Muggle Therapist Version.But what can he do? One, he's desperate for any answer, magical or not. And, two, he's pretty sure that it is not normal to cope with Sirius's death accident by hallucinating his dead ex-Death Eater little brother as his personal pet ghost.Which is why, as he checks over his shoulder, he's hoping really, really hard that the problem is gone. But---“Loath as I am to say it, Potter,” drawls the flickering, irritated spirit of Regulus Arcturus Black, “I'm inclined to believe that we are stuck together. Indefinitely.”...( Or, a foolproof guide to mourning your dead godfather, getting haunted by his dead brother, befriending snakes, smashing lockets, and defeating the Dark Lord in the process. )

** Ummm... Am totally not reading The Heir of House Black on my other device at all right now!

The fic with Regulus being an auror in Australia - it might be the infamous Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, though you might remember it if it was. POS is a WIP on the fourth book at the moment. There are a couple of prophecies, and a secret power in Slytherin. Regulus does end up in England, and I will not give too many things away because honestly, the second book has an inumerable number of plot twists and is completely amazing. Jut saying.

Even is it isn't the fic you're looking for, it's an amazing one to read and I would recommend it many many times over. It takes the usual WBWL, Slytherin!Harry trope and turns it into something amazing - loads of people have tried to copy its style, and the only one anywhere close to it (that I've read) is ACI100's series.

** Ah, my two favourite boys!!

I love everything by TheDivineComedian, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413][Blackpool]] linkao3(14760663) is magnificent.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20233435][Bindings, Bindings]] linkao3(20233435) is an ongoing work, but there are great moments with Regulus and Sirius, the other Marauders, baby Harry, and the wider Black family!

And if I may throw in a couple of my own?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24095437][is this hell?]] linkao3(24095437) is from Regulus's POV and explores what might have happened if Kreacher didn't leave Regulus in the cave as ordered, but took him to Sirius instead.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26691385][Brother]] linkao3(26691385) is from Sirius's POV, set during his first mission with the Order during the first war.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Regulus waits for hours. For hours, he stands on that cursed cliff, the black waters churning and gushing and crashing far below. Even as far up as he is, the air is heavy with spray. He breathes in the salt, and tries to cast his mind back to childhood visits the seaside. He can't. It smells too much like blood.There is an odd noise behind him, inhuman footsteps, nails on rock-Regulus spins around and finds a large, wet, dog. It's huge, and black. The dark eyes are wide and intelligent; far too intelligent to be a convenient stray.  Regulus laughs hysterically. He has been sent a Grim. An omen of death that should be sent to the unwary, not to someone who is attempting what is tantamount to suicide.   The Grim walks closer, eyes wary, and Regulus tells it helplessly, "It is alright, I already know." His voice doesn't waver, and he takes a moment to be viciously proud of himself for that. "I am going to die."Or:Regulus hopes for a chance to say goodbye to Sirius, and somehow that changes everything.
