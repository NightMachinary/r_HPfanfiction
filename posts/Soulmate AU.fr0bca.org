  "Scars can come in handy." --- Magic gives the gift of a soulmate. Separated by war, alliances, beliefs, and blood, but connected by skin. What if you shared the scars of the person that magic has given you? What if you really, really wished that you didn't?

** Reckless by down-in-flames (James/Lily, 12k)

Lily Evans' soulmate is a complete idiot. Although she's never actually met him to confirm this.

A Soulmate!AU tale of rugby matches, incompetent medical interns, and a broken rib or two.

Two certainties by facingthenorthwind (Sirius/Remus, 7k)

The tattoo on Sirius Black's wrist meant that he knew two things: one day, he would be loved, and on that day, it would all end.

[[http://hpfanfictalk.com/archive/viewstory.php?sid=2086]]

Coffee and Curse-Breakers by Pixileanin (Bill/Tonks, 22k)

Then she saw it. Two broken, wavy lines across the top of his wrist, not pink from the coffee spill, but actually glowing from under his skin.
