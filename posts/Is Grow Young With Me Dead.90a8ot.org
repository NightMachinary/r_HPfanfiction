I know it got an update recently, but in my experience, an update after such a long hiatus (it was 2 years since the last chapter, iirc) is usually just death throes- often the author finishing up and publishing the last chapter they had written. Taliesin19 is silent, too, so I'm concerned that one of my favorite fics may just be dead.


** Taliesin19 has a tumblr blog where she seems to still be working on the story. Don't have a link handy though.

**** For the lazy people, she replied to someone asking "And what percentage of the chapter is complete?" on the 17th:

  Still about 25% I'm afraid :/ But I have been writing. I'm just at one of those scenes that drag a bit.

**** you have to go into the archive and find the post, hover over it to see the date it was posted. July 17th was when she said she was at 25% so there's hope

** Always assume that a fic is dead after extended breaks between chapters. Keep it in your follows and be pleasantly surprised should it ever become active again.

Usually it's dead though.

** I don't think it's dead. Somebody asked this question a couple months ago and, if I remember correctly, the author was quite adamant they were going to finish the story, so I'll be optimistic and stand by their word :)

** Unfortunately it is more than likely dead. The Legacy and Passageways both did something similar; updating once in the past 2 years only to never be heard from again.

If you want a romance I can't recommend You'll be the Death of Me by dominikki enough. It is Neville/Graces Malfoy who is an OC. I really like how the author handled their relationship with both on different sides of the war.

*** Yeah, like i said, this is usually just death throes. I've seen a very few fics that truly got res'd, but not often. But like, it's one of my favorite fics, and I'm hoping against hope.

Tbh, I don't actually normally like romance. Idk why GYWM struck me so hard.
