It's not been updated in a year, and some would claim it's the longest individual HP fanfic.

Help me Obi Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope...


** It's probably just abandoned, which honestly blows my mind. I don't understand how anyone could write 1.2 milllion+ words of a story, get close enough that they can probably see everything that's going to happen all the way to the end, and then just stop.

** I wouldn't write it off as abandoned, just yet. Many fics take long or extended breaks, you just have to hope. It's been in production for 8 years, what's another 1.5?

*** Also, if I'm remembering right, there was a long break between the ... most... er... recent chapter(gah does that hurt to say about a chapter over a year old) and the one that came before. I want to say at the least 6 months but more likely longer than even that.

But, real life happens, the story is 8 years old tomorrow, and things change for authors, even for the shorter fics with 2-3 year life spans.

All we can do as readers is hope, pray, and send some reviews their way. Tho, if you do, make sure they're happy "I love your story, can't wait for when you have time for the next one!" and not "Hurry up, you lazy %^{&*@!"}

** Sadly abandoned. The Fifth Element is longer, though.

*** ah yes! i love the arguments where people claim MoR is the longest fic. Well, it might certainly be the longest fic they've read, off the top of my head I can remember some of the Saving Connor arc are longer, Brave New World.... I always glaze over The Fifth Element, no idea why...

**** Long =/= good.

You know who writes really long fics? Lionheart does. HPMOR is a literary masterpiece if you stack it up against Kissed Hero.

** I have been afraid to start Prince. I hate reading unfinished fics but that one looks amazing. It would take an emotional toll on me if i commited to it and they never went back. Hope everything is well in real life for them

** Abandoning something like that, that's both amazing and extremely long, this far in isn't something I want to accept. I'm just going to go with it's on hiatus.

*** In a nutshell, Voldemort wins the First War. Just before that, the Potters flee to the continent, where James and Lily are killed a few years later. Harry ends up back at the Dursleys for a short while before being whisked away by Snape, gets sent to Hogwarts (which is an elite school), stuff happens, and Voldemort takes an unhealthy interest in him which evolves into an apprenticeship of sorts, but it's more than that, I suppose.

Nominally not slash (and both Harry and Voldemort have possible love interests) but HP/LV subtext abound.

It sometimes shows its age, but it's still good.

EDIT: Oooh, necro. Sorry 'bout that.
