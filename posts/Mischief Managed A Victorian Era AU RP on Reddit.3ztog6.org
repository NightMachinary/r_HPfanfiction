[[/r/MischiefManagedRP][Mischief Managed]] is a Victorian Era Roleplay set in the same fictional world as the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. The roleplay, while technically set in that same world, is meant to be considered an alternate universe as our timeline of events will almost certainly begin to diverge from the history of the known world that Harry Potter encounters more than a century later. We want our writers to have the freedom to create and shape a world of their own rather than forcing them to conform to known events in canon - this is why we chose to set our story so that it predates everything in the known Potterverse, including /Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them/, because it's always more fun if you don't already know how the story ends.

While the action in our game will take place primarily in the village of Hogsmeade, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and the city of London, characters of all classes, both magical and muggle --- as well as non-human --- are welcome to explore all areas of the wizarding world. *Our goal is to build a community of players interested in creating adventures and stories in a cooperative atmosphere that values the quality of writing and roleplay over the quantity of subscribers.*

The [[/r/MischiefManagedRP]] subreddit will serve as our roleplaying platform in which our plot unfolds and character interaction occurs. If you are new and looking to create a character for the roleplay, then head on over to our community sub, found at [[/r/MischiefManagedOOC]] . If you have questions or need assistance in completing your application or character template, feel free to visit us on IRC in our [[https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.darkmyst.org/MischiefManaged][chatroom]] and we will be more than happy to help.

** The Story
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-story
   :END:
Our story begins at the end of December 1888.

Queen Victoria's reign reaches the close of its fifty-first year, marking an era that many historians will later recount as peaceful and prosperous for the people of Great Britain, where technological advances usher forth an industrial revolution, allowing for a burgeoning middle class, while an empire expands its reach. But progress does not occur in a vacuum. To move forward, there must be change.

Science, after all, has done much more than simply bring incredible new technology into the homes of everyday people. With it comes a new way of looking at the world - one based on observation and logic, rather than the ideology found within age-old traditions.

In the upper echelons of the Wizarding community, however, there is an order made up of men from only the most elite bloodlines known as the /Septemvirate/. The secret council of seven has dedicated themselves to the preservation of magic by enforcing edicts of their own in an effort to ensure the prosperity and safety of their world through the guarding of long held, highly prized customs for fear that their age of magic may be on its way out as a new century looms ahead.

Then have a look at our [[https://redd.it/3zhrcm][Guide to Character Creation]] which details our character application and biography process. Feel free to check the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/MischiefManagedOOC/wiki/charactermasterlist][Character Master List]] as well as the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/MischiefManagedOOC/wiki/hogwartsroster][Hogwarts Roster]] in order to see which families have already been claimed for roleplay. Even if your chosen family has already been established, you might want to consider contacting the player at its head to get permission to play another family member. If you are interested in playing as a character with a predetermined initial story arc, or picking up another player's supporting character/NPC, then please check out our [[https://www.reddit.com/r/MischiefManagedOOC/wiki/classifiedswantedcharacters][Classifieds: Wanted Characters]] list to see if there are any there that spark your interest!

Once you've made up your mind and are ready to put in your application for your character, simply find the appropriate Character Application Template ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/MischiefManagedOOC/comments/3xva7h/application_template_student/][Student]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/MischiefManagedOOC/comments/3xvcup/application_template_professorministry/][Professor, Ministry Official, Other Adult Wizard]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/MischiefManagedOOC/comments/3xvda1/application_template_mugglesquib/][Muggle, Squib]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/MischiefManagedOOC/comments/3xve65/application_template_magical_being/][Magical Being]]) in the sidebar for the type of character that you want to play. When your character's application is approved, you are then free to begin writing your character in our setting over on [[/r/MischiefManagedRP]].
