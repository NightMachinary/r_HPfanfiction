I've just been reading some meta about gender-flipped characters, and I'm curious as to whether there are any well-written, non-romance-focused stories about a female version of Draco Malfoy. Any suggestions?


** linkffn(Harry Potter: The Serpent Lord by NHunter)

270k words, femDraco.

Great fic, and is not too focused on the romance side.

  "Unfortunately, the first magical child young Harry Potter met in Diagon Alley was a Malfoy. Draconica Malfoy to be exact..." Harry/Draconica Harry/fem-Draco. This IS HET! will eventually contain Intelligent!dark-medic!strong!Harry, likeable!Draconica and some bashing for others.

****** I read like two chapter of this thing before giving up. I think it's the one where being a parseltongue give Harry superpowers, a snake is like is familiar and friend.

I think "canon" in this fic is like this vague concept that you can put in a scrabble board but can't really define
