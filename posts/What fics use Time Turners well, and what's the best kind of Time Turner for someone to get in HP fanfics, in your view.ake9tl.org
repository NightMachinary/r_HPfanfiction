What fics use Time Turners well?

And what's the best Time Turner in your view? One that goes back an hour? A day? Ten minutes? Or one that does additional stuff a standard Time Turner can't do?


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

Time travel, badass!Regulus, first Wizarding War Era. Also contains the best lawyer scene in fanfiction history.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** Not a time turner fic exactly, but the time travel matches with how it functions in canon: linkffn(4198643)

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

** Linkffn(the Minister's secret) is a time Turner fic. Hermione is sent back after the final battle, and gets involved in the first war, before the deatheaters became death eaters. I was pleasantly surprised by it and it's now on my favorites list.

  The love of the Minister's life disappeared just before the end of the First Wizarding War. When he finds her again, he can hardly trust his sanity. His first action as the new Minister for Magic is to break at least a dozen international laws to bring her home. Hermione soon finds herself in the early 70s surrounded by future followers of the Dark Lord. **Causal Loop Time Travel**

** I like the uses from linkffn(A Cadmean Victory; Eclipse of the Sky)

Both have somewhat different approach to canon time-travel, but stays with the same core concept. Just a headsup, the time turner in Eclipse just comes into the story around 750k words in or more.

** I have written a Cursed Child fic which is certainly Time-Turner heavy. I know there's general resistance to anything CC related but I'm happy to link it if you think it might be of interest. It's complete and I hope better than you would expect.

** Royal by Batsutousai [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5758675/1/Royal]] Time-turners don't play a huge roll but they are used pretty heavily.

** Harry Potter and the methods of rationality did pretty good. It had to nerf them in a few ways. You can only go back at most 6 hours from when you started even with multiple turners. Even if you wait and do one hour at a time, you can only stretch your subjective day to 30 hours. There are also wards against them. Azkaban has those. And there's a soft limit on how contrived the stable loop can be, before time starts issuing warnings. ("DO NOT MESS WITH TIME!")

Enough of the big players in the plot know about or have them for some fun plots.
