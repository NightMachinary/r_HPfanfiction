** You can read one of the thousand stories where the polite goblin greeting is. "May your enemies blood flow and your vault overflow with gold" or something like that.

** this would make alot of sense, and harry not grasping it saw it as rude.

​

this reminded of a a thread defending pureblood's and sometimes halfbloods being wary of muggleborns. the reason being that they never use their wands as toys being raised around them and seeing how deadly they are, and how many muggle borns will point it at someone very frequently. this was sorta backed with only muggle raised wizards <harry and hermione>, hot heads < weasleys at times and hotheads> or assholes like draco did it often, most kept the wand down or at ready but not raised.. its like raising a gun.

​

i am not supporting pureblood just an intresting idea how it could be viewed different.

*** Mad-Eye does note that good wizards have lost asscheeks to wands stowed in a back pocket carelessly.

A clap for the fallen.
