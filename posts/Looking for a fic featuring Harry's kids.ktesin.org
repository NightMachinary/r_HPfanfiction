Hello! I'm looking for a fic with Harry as an adult and one or all his kids have a main or at least significant role. Can comply canon or AU. Thanks!

2. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8402590]] has the kids play a major role but you will have to read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1623053/chapters/3460562]] to understand the first story better. Both are part of a series of stories: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340]]
