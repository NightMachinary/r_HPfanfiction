Maybe because of the genres/tags or plot, maybe some other reason.

Anyone can be the main character, can be from any ERA, Can be on any site, can be old or new, would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

Some extra points of what I don't want:

NO Character bashings. Characters not liking each other/what each other are doing is one thing, but an author going out of their way to make the character evil/bad when they aren't, is a no go.

No Seer Luna, Please.


** I wish this had more recommendations, but with the POV being a child OC and the genre emotional hurt/comfort and angst, plus it's over 10 years old... Since it's under 9K words, it's a really quick read. I've always found either interpretation of the ending devastating.

Brief non-explicit sexual content that can easily be skipped over by not reading the section beginning, "It's the third night watch.", and then starting again after the line breaks with, "Someone's shaking the house."

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][“The Very Secret Diary”]] is an oldie but a goodie. The original author no longer has the story up but somebody else preserved it, luckily. It's so old that it still calls Ginny “Virginia” not “Ginevra”. It's basically a retelling, sticking perfectly to canon, of Chamber of Secrets, but just using the diary entries in Tom Riddle's Diary. It gets almost uncomfortable at points (in a ‘good' way) - we know what's going to happen but Ginny doesn't and there's nothing we can do to stop it. It's well worth a read if you haven't already.

** My personal fave when it comes to crossovers is HP and the Illusions of Reality, an HP-Matrix story. It's really well done!

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4135485/chapters/9325320]])

I also enjoyed the /There is Nothing to Fear/ series, which has a bunch of one shots and shorts about a Tom Riddle who decided to champion the rights of muggleborns and magical creatures. It starts with linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15449145]]) but then circles back towards Riddle's time in Hogwarts.
