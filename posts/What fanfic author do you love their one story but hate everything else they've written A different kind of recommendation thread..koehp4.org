** Enterprise1701-d has a story called The Transfer Student that I liked way more than anyone really should. They pulled it off FFN years ago for whatever reason (it was about 80k words), probably because the OC was the biggest Mary Sue ever, but it focused on alternate cultures which is one of my favorite niches.

** JanuaryGrey on Ao3. All their work is amazing I'm sure but some of it is too smutty for my tastes so I'm always annoyed I can only really enjoy 1/2 of their stories.

linkao3(The Practical Applications of Arithmancy by JanuaryGrey) is my favourite.

  Sirius knew there would be consequences for taking Muggle Studies rather than Arithmancy like his parents wanted. His father always had a way of driving the point home though.

** linkffn(What Am I Signing? by megamatt09) Megamatt is infamous for the sheer volume of smut he has written. And, while I haven't really read it myself, it's infamous for being bad smut. But he also wrote this, which is actually a pretty good oneshot and doesn't feature any smut at all (or even romance for that matter).

  You would think at least one person would have questions about signing a piece of paper in a magical world of magic without any knowledge of consequences. And in this world they did. AU set during initial DA formation meeting at the Hog's Head in Book Five. One Shot.
