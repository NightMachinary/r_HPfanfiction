It's a fanfiction about Remus' life, I don't even know if it's called this. Anyway, I have been reading it and for some reason the server has stopped working, so maybe a different link would work? If any of you could help me out that would be great :)


** Someone already found it, but I just wanted to say that I'm totally in love with that fic.

*** I feel the same way, this is the only Marauders era fic that I've ever really enjoyed and followed.

** This fic has consumed my life since finding this thread two days ago. I almost feel as though it's made up for all the suffering I experienced at the hands of JK, and I don't want to ever leave this cosy little room.

But like, for real, printing this off and binding it. Books 1-8.
