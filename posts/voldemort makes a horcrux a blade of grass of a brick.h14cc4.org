** This probably happened in Methods of Rationality, but no one really knows; he was in the habit of erasing his own memory of the hiding places.

Not a blade of grass, though; that would die. Pebbles, though, are a good choice.

*** Horcrux blade of grass will be protected by magic. It will grow while it's surrounding wither with time. The magical signature of a ripped soul will be openly accessible to everyone. Else he put wards on a field around the grass. But that would make it even more suspicious. He can use a grass in a death Eater manor, though. Well protected
