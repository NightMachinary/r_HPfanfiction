I read a fanfic that opens with the battle at the ministry and Harry realizes he loves Hermione when he sees her hurt and sends her roses while he hides away for a little while. I would love to read it again but I can't find it, does anyone happen to know the name of it?


** I knew immediately this was a Robst fanfic so I just checked his ff.net profile and I think it's this one.

  Remus was so shocked at seeing Sirius fall through the veil that Harry had raced past him before the boy's intentions even registered with the werewolf. Screaming "Sirius!" Harry followed his godfather into the veil before anyone could stop him. H/Hr
