Hey, all! I didn't know there was a fanfiction sub, so this is pulled from the main HP sub. /(TL;DR at the end, but I'd like to explain what I'm getting at to be clear.)/

I've read a LOT of fanfiction over the years and fallen in love with many stories out there. I started as just a Severus/Hermione girl but have expanded to several other themes, prompts, and pairings. I have tried to keep an open mind to styles of writing, but I have one major obstacle that I fear might be holding me back from some great stories. I'll read almost anything for a few chapters if the writing is good.

It's probably my stubborn streak, but I absolutely hate writing from the forced perspectives of "I said..." or "you said..." It makes me feel like I'm being told what to do or being forced into feeling a certain way. I hope that if the writing and story are good enough, I could overcome that feeling, and I hate that I might be missing out on something amazing.

The ONLY story I've made it through that isn't 3rd person POV is The Fallout (Dramione), and that was a struggle at first. And so.....

*TL;DR -- Can you make any recommendations for good fanfiction written in a POV other than 3rd person?*

*** As they are written in 2nd person, you will be Harry within the narrative. I enjoyed them despite that.

The only 2nd person stories that made sense to me to be written that way were choose-your-own-adventure books. The problem with those, of course, is that you're buying a 200-page book but only reading 50-75 pages of story.

** Oneshots might ease you in? Second person doesn't usually work well beyond that scope anyway, and first person needs a strong voice to carry a narrative. They're harder PoVs to write well IMO. You could try a published first-person (non-fic) novel, too?

For some reason, all the oneshots I thought of are of Lavender: my favorite (also the longest), [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?chapterid=468340&i=1][A Lightness]]; a cynical Cormac/Lavender, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?chapterid=413260][It's Only Love]]; one of mine, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?chapterid=468340&i=1][730 Whispers]].

*** Perhaps that's another hurdle for me? I usually read stuff that is several hundred thousand words long so there's real character development. This might be a good approach to trying something so different. Those stories are cute and I like yours better in all seriousness. :)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1784066/1/Armilla][Armilla by Coral Grace]] is a first-person OFC (Original Female Character) story with Snape as the other lead.

Summary: Follows the troubled path of fifth year Ravenclaw student, Armilla Kemp, when she is suddenly placed in the care of Professor Snape. NOT a romance fic or cliched story. Set in OotP. Complete.

It's an epic at 360K words, with an equally long sequel. It's a bit dated as it was first posted in 2007, but since it follows the OOtP plot line, it aged well. Highly recommend - it's pretty famous in the fandom.

An even older and famous fic, published in 2003, is [[http://mirrordance.net/aashby/bnw/bnwindex2.html][Brave New World: The Account of a Muggle Teacher at Hogwarts by heatresm]]. This also features an OFC, a heavily featured Snape, and epic length (probably around 500K with all 3 books). It was written pre-OOtP but focuses on the main characters activities, so don't let its age keep you away.

Review from reccers Liz and Teanna: "Every now and then, you find a fic which reminds you of why you fell in love with a fandom in the first place. "Brave New World" is one of those. It is the tale of the professor of Muggle Studies, as she raises her troubled nephew and comes to terms with her job, her colleagues, and the difficulties inherent in being a Muggle teacher at a magical school.... it is remarkably compelling, and well worth the mental time and energy it will consume. Miranda may look like a Mary Sue, but she is a million times more interesting than the beautiful exchange students and mysterious Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers that populate fanon. Her integration into the universe is helped by the fact that every other character is perfectly written, especially Snape, who is as snarky and cruel as his canon incarnation, and as intriguing and attractive as the fanon version."

That's all I can find for now. Happy reading!

*** Oh, the age of a story is of no import to me. I just want something well written and interesting. Part of the joy and beauty of fanfiction to me is the exploration of the possible and impossible. I'll check those items. Snape is my favorite bastard in all literature. :) Thanks!

*ETA:* Two chapters into Brave New World and I've already said "whoa!" once, laughed twice, and discovered a rogue eyebrow movement. I think I may like this one considerably. Thank you! I NEVER would have found it on my own.
