Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of most crack fics. Usually when I hear "crack", I just think of a really poorly written fic (bad grammar, no real plot, random with no direction, etc.). But thus so far, I've only read two which (I think?) the general community would consider crack that I enjoy, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12703694/1/Harry-Potter-Geek-of-Magic][Harry Potter, Geek of Magic]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]].

Are there any others of this similar "crack style" that y'all would recommend? That is, amusing while not being trash? EDIT: Some(/many?) might consider these two stories just humorous, or almost parody-like... but either way, I'm looking for something of that humor (maybe not "full on crack"). I understand the definition may vary from person to person, but hopefully I'm getting across what I'm looking for. If in doubt, I'd love to see your recommendations anyway!

Harry-centric preferred.


** There's a reason linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) is the most rec'd and on top of so many people's(including mine) favourite list. It's very cleverly written, damn funny and an overall masterpiece.

Also, a few other amazing ones: linkffn(A black comedy; Where in the world is Harry Potter; Harry the Hufflepuff; Oh God not again). There are a lot more, so if you like these, ask me again.

*** Oh yeah, I have seen Seventh Horcrux recommended a few times. For some reason, I always forget that it's supposed to be crack/humor/parody/whatever. I have that, A Black Comedy, and Where in the World is Harry Potter bookmarked. I've read Harry the Hufflepuff and Oh God Not Again and liked them both. :)

More recs are always appreciated, but whatever you have time/patience for! ^{^} Even if I don't end up bookmarking or reading, I always like discovering new stories.

**** Dunno why the bot's not working, but you should definitely read Seventh Horcrux at the very least. I'm not kidding, I've read it about 7 or 8 times now, and it's still amazing.

Also, let's see what else I can remember. linkffn(The Horror! The Horror!; Dear Order; The Inner Eye of Harry Potter; The Wendell that Wasn't; Inspected by Number 13; Escapologist Harry; We, Harry Potter; On a Train, Switching Tracks; In the mind of a scientist; Parseltongue lets me talk to WHAT; The Ultimate Escape Artist; Dimension Hopping for Beginners; Just a Random Tuesday; Scorpius Malfoy and the Improbable Plot; Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion) are all varying levels of crack and humor.

***** A few more : linkffn(When in doubt, Obliviate; Whatever Happened to Bromance; Timely Errors; Two Weeks in the Alley; Sphere of Influence; Reunion; The Parselmouth of Gryffindor; On a Pale Horse; The Original Naked Quidditch Match)

Oh, and just one thing, most of what I recommended is more on the side of humour than crack, as at least Make a Wish and the first chapter of the other fic you said you liked (which seems nice, thanks!) aren't really all that cracky. Crack fics, to me, become crack due to sheer absurdity or a level of ridiculousness you wouldn't expect in even a humorous fic. Something like linkffn(Oswald the Ottoman) is a great example. Or maybe something like linkffn(Oops by michaelsuave), while something like linkffn(If I were a Superhero, I would be) is more borderline.

All this is, in the end, just my interpretation of the genre.

****** Ooo, I'll definitely read some of these soon.

And no worries, that makes sense to me. I think you're right, though, that what I'm looking for is maybe more humor (or borederline crack, but still humor). I think that's definitely the first one I listed, although Make a Wish I think does have aspects of absurdity (especially once the scientist and apprentice come in) that would make me call it crack.

But you do make a good point. I'll edit my first post a bit to see if I can be more clear (and maybe get some more recs). :)

** I've only ever read two gen fics that genuinely made me laugh out loud. One is the ever-controversial HPMOR; the other is Scorpius Malfoy and the Improbably Plot (and the other various crack fics by the author).

That being said, if anyone can recommend a fic or writer whose humor is more like opalish's (the other of the Improbable Plot) than Seventh Horcrux or A Black Comedy, I'd love to hear some reccs too.

*** I have them both bookmarked! :) Unfortunately I haven't read Seventh Horcrux or A Black Comedy yet (again... bookmarked), so I can't recommend any like them, but I hope you find some!

**** No, I... I meant that I didn't like Seventh Horcrux and a Black Comedy because their "humor" is just randomness without logic or drive. I guess I didn't make that clear enough lol.

***** Oh, whoops! I actually read it and understood it as that, but then when I was replying, my brain just went skdflasdf.
