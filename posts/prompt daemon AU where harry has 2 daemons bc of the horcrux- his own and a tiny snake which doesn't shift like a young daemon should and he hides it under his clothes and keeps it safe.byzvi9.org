HDM crossover

The snake doesnt have voldys memories, but is highly distrusting/suspicious/paranoid/survivalist and only speaks parseltoungue.

The Dursleys beat it into him young to never tell anyone about it because its "abhorrent" even more-so than the magic to them so he keeps it hidden even at Hogwarts.
