***** You're welcome. It is a fun series - and it's still semi-actively updating. :)

Just a note, in case you weren't aware - if you reply to the bot and not the original comment, the person doesn't get a notification about your message. I only noticed because the 'full comments' thing on the message said there were three in this thread now. :)

** Oh my Holy bagonyes! So I see another kind user has linked you the story. I still needed to just say: this is spectacular! I'm hooked, but they haven't updated since December time (?). They use to update once a week and hells bells did I live for it. But now I'm a grateful Henry hoover sucking up whatever crumbs come. I still live in hope they get bit by their muse again for it! ü§ûüèª
