I'd like to read a fic where Harry starts from the same point as everyone else. Not rich, not famous and not someone destined to win via a prophecy. If Harry is powerful that is fine but make him work for it. An alternate boy who lived would work for this.

Preferably a longer fic but i wont be too picky.

Thanks guys!


** linkffn(Luna's Hubby)

Harry gets adopted/married into the Lovegood family. While he attends Hogwarts in relative peace, Dumbledore searches in magical schools across the world for Harry Potter, the boy who disappeared.
