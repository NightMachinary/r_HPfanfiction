Dumbledore I beleive has been one of the most critiqued characters in Harry Potter universe. Many people say that JK messed up while building his character. I have tried to find out why most people would say dumbledore's action's were wrong (dumbledore bashing), but mostly it boils downs to 5 points:

1. ** He left Harry at his Abusive Relatives, right at their doorstep**: This argument has been put in a lot of fanfics, especially in those character read the books ones. I beleive the most solid counter argument would be the blood protection that kept Harry safe and sound from voldemort. While the Dursleys were abausive towards Harry, I dont think Harry would have loved Hogwarts so much without the Dursleys treating him like a menance.
2. ** He mishandled Sirius and let him rot in Azkaban**: Well this argument is actually quite stupid. If Remus believed that Sirius had betrayed James and Lily, I don't think Dumbledore would have ever thought otherwise. Every evidence pointed at Sirius, and he himself never tried to falsify the eveidence and beleived he himself was responsible for James and Lilys murder. Dumbledore didn't even know that they were animagus. And they never mentioned about the switch in Secret Keepers to anyone else.
3. ** He constantly let Hogwarts and Harry be in danger **: This argument comes from the general understanding that Dumbledore knows everything that goes on in Hogwarts. No Dumbledore was a wise and powerful wizard, but he was not all-knowing. Although I do admit that Dumbledore never forced Harry into a dangerous situations, but also he never stopped Harry from constantly putting his life on the line. From his words from snapes memories, he wanted to let Harry test out his strength. Well I am not really sure what else to make out of this argument.
4. ** He should have started the Horcrux hunt much earlier **: People don't understand exactly how rare something like a Horcrux is. I do believe he became aware of the fact the Tom created horcruxes only after Harry gave him Tom Riddles dairy. During Tom's years at Hoagwarts, Dumbledore mearly disliked him, but he might not have ever thought that Tom would on and create Horcrux, and that too more than one. Someone as powerful as Grindelwald did not go down that route, so there was no reason for him to suspect that Tom created Horcrux, even though Tom still was able to escape the killing curse that rebounded back from Harry.
5. ** He was Manipulative **: Yes he was manipulative. I will also go as far as to say that he even tricked Snape into spying for him. But thats all, both Harry and Snaped could have walked away from Dumbledore when ever they wanted to. Dumbledore never forced others to believe that everything he did was right, nor he himself thought that way.

The only other real critism that Dumbledore should recieve is for conceiling the prophecy from Harry until it was too late. Atleast after Voldemort came back, Dumbledore should have told Harry of the prophecy.

Other than that, I think, JK Rowling built a very good character who I thouroughly enjoy reading about. And finally I dont think Hogwarts would have lasted that long without Dumbledores presence.


** When it comes to the points about official power (I'll only note on the other ones that I think Dumbledore does not deserve much of the criticism), I'd note that his action to place Harry with the Dursleys was entirely above board with magical law. People always seem to forget that the ministry knew where Harry was and entirely preferred it. Fudge got worried when Harry didn't seem to want to go back to Privet Drive. Sirius would have been convicted if he had gotten a trial and I don't recall an instance that shows that Dumbledore had the power to force a trial. It was the ministry that decided to forgo a trial.

** 1) "Right at their doorstep". Focus on that. He could have just as easily left Harry inside, where it was warm. Or, you know, knocked on the door. Since He didn't want to give the Dursleys the choice to refuse, he didn't knock. The supposed Blood wards were too important for him to risk(wards that were supposedly built from love), or the idea of them. Whichever works. Also, Albus needed Harry at Hogwarts. So his home life needed to be bad in comparison.

2) Mishandling Sirius can be excused. The marauders fooled a lot of people while in School. However, the moment The Longbottoms were attacked, Albus should have gone to interrogate Sirius. It stands to reason that their Spy would be the one to tell the Death Eaters how to break/bypass the wards protecting certain homes. This so that Albus can warn the others in the order to try and prevent another attack like it.

3) He put the philosopher's stone at Hogwarts, a School. Full of children. While knowing full well there was someone after it. Thus putting every single one of those kids in danger. The fact that Quirrel only use the one troll, just that one time, is a small miracle. It could have been so much worse(there's a basilisk below the school Quirrel didn't use). Another blatant example is HBP. He knew Draco was trying to kill him, and instead of keeping an eye on the idiot, albus let him execute whatever idiotic plans came up to him. Instead of, say, have a house elf follow him around(like harry did, eventually). Both Katie's and Ron's near death experiences could have been prevented if anyone had noticed Rosmerta's odd behaviour around(or just after meeting) Draco.

4) It's entirely possible he did just this. Only he didn't know he was looking for Horcruxes until Harry dropped the Diary on his desk. Keeping that info all to himself until he was Dying tho, that was pretty stupid. If nothing else, he could have asked Sirius to help him research on how to identify or track the things when Grimmauld place was re-opened.

5) Someone already mentione how hard it is for abuse victims to simply walk away. Go read that reply.

** For your first point, you're basically arguing what they argue, only you're saying it's a good thing while they believe that letting a child be abused at home to further their affection for the Wizarding World is somewhat wrong.

And well, blood protection against Voldemort? Not really all that useful unless you know the man is up and walking about. Doesn't stop a Death Eater entering and killing him, or if it does, it doesn't stop them hiring some random bruiser type to enter the property and kill him, or kidnapping him on his way to school, or whatever else. A fortified sanctuary is only really useful if you don't leave or if you can get back there quickly/easily. If Dedalus Diggle can wander up and bow to him in a shop, any idiot could find him and grab him.

The second one isn't bad because it's immoral. It's bad because it's stupid. Imagine you're Dumbledore. You're head of a basically secret vigilante group operating during a war against a racist, extremely powerful terrorist that you know will be absolutely terrible against anyone who stands against him.

Then, you find out there's a spy in your group. His friends agree it's him, the evidence agrees it's him, you have no doubt whatsoever that this man is guilty.

Fine. Makes sense you'd agree, they know the man better than you and the aurors can at least sort of do their jobs well enough that the evidence works.

Not going and interrogating him to find out what else he told the enemy is utterly stupid. Especially given the fact that there are a significant number of Death Eaters still free, both on the run and in your frickin' government. Any of these people could decide to turn on your fellow vigilantes at any moment, if your spy had told them about it.

Thus, leaving Sirius to rot is a massive mistake - not because leaving him there if he's innocent is the worst, but because leaving him there if he's guilty IS.

I agree with four completely, and can't really come up with a good Devil's Advocate argument otherwise, and I would also add that I'm pretty sure nobody but Voldemort had ever really made more than one before. I vaguely recall something about that in Rowling's Extras, but I admit I'm not 100% certain of that.

Five is... well, yeah. Technically true. I could also argue that, just because the option to leave was there, doesn't mean he hadn't convinced them not to take it. That's how abuse and manipulation work. Victims of domestic violence know they can technically make the decision to leave, they just also believe that leaving would be worse than staying. Manipulation works on a deeper level than just controlling choice, it influences the things within you that you use to make choices. If you want to take that lens to the arrangement, Dumbledore used Snape's guilt and grief over Lily to bring him into the fold, and used Harry's passive suicidal ideation to get his sacrifice. It's not a hard argument to create some logic to support.

So, yeah. Basically all of Dumbledore's issues can be summarised pretty simply - he didn't act when people think he should've. Like every set of ideas aggregating from a large group of people, some of it makes sense, some of it doesn't.

Don't get me wrong, I like Dumbledore, I think he's the most complex character Rowling wrote, but some of the arguments for him fucking up are definitely understandable, even if they're not Word of God from Rowling.

** That made me think of [[https://www.webnovel.com/book/dark-lord-dumbledore_14264431306879405][Dark Lord Dumbledore]] fanfic. Rather unique setting but fun to read and can actually explain neatly Dumbledore actions.

** While I do agree with the larger point, that people are overly harsh on Dumbledore, I think that most of your explanations aren't that well thought out.

1. He could've done so much more. Like, not leave Harry on the doorstep. Like explaining to the Dursleys in person. Maybe some subtle treats of what'll happen if he's mistreated. Regular visits. According to the 6th book, Pretty much all interaction (2 or 3 times!) happened through letters until that point. So that likely means that the Dursleys didn't even get legal documentation for the adoption of Harry. At the very least, this demonstrates a gross negligence on Dumbledore's part. But let's disregard that for a moment. I forget which book it was, but he also said that he knew how Harry would be treated. So, unless he was lying, or didn't know the full extent, he was condoning child abuse. Is child abuse OK, if it means the child will survive? I personally don't think so.\\
2. I'm going to assume that Dumbledore didn't know about the switch. But he was the head of Wizengamot, the criminal court, and probably the legislative body as well. It was his responsibility to uphold justice. His responsibility to oversee that everyone got a fair trial. Which Sirius didn't. To add insult to injury, Sirius was part of Dumbledore's private militia. To further add insult to injury, he did vouch for Snape, a known death eater. So, he has saved someone who most likely committed horrible crimes from Azkaban, someone who wasn't even dedicated in the beginning, but doesn't do the same for Sirius, an innocent man who fought against Death Eaters for much longer. Again, gross negligence at the very least. And lets not even go into the fact that so many Death Eaters walked free while he was the leader of the wizengamot.\\
3. I agree with the overall point, but I think he could've done so, so much more. Better background and security checks for new personel at the very least. Maybe a demonstration lesson. An interview under veritasium to check if the teacher means harm to the students or staff, or unbreakable vows that staff would prevent serious injury and death at the best of their capacities at the extreme end. This would've caught Quirell, Lockhart and fake Moody. Again, this shows legligence on Dumbledore's part. Sensing a theme here?
4. I agree with it, but could also argue against it. In the first book, Dumbledore says that Harry's scar might become useful, which could hint that he knew it was a Horcrux. But that's flimsy at best.
5. I don't fully agree. I agree that he's manipulative, but clearly not to the level as some stories portray. But at the same time, not so little as you imply.

But that's not even all of the criticism. His final plan to get rid of the Horcruxes is atrocious. He leaves it to 3 (admittedly, extraordinary) teenagers to find them without any support system. It relied on them actually able to find them and get to the locations. To overcome traps that one of the worst dark lords designed. That they wouldn't get killed in the war. Harry's survival further depended on D's theories about mythical objects. He personally observed all 3, but he doesn't know what'll happen if they get united. It also relies on the fact that Harry was the master of voldemort's wand. A chain of events that was overly convoluted. Something simple as Voldemort noticing that the wand wasn't responding any better compared to his normal wand would've foiled that.

The story was exciting, yes. The plan was monumentally stupid. At any point, he could've taken unbreakable vows with trusted OotP members so that they wouldn't reveal what he was about to say, and then reveal the existence of horcruxes. Why in the world would you let the downfall of Voldemort hang on such a stupid plan?

Furthermore, he never curbed Snape's behaviour. He employed Argus Filch, who, may i remind you, was gleeful at the prospect of physical punishment of teenagers. His rule over hogwarts was so lax that bullying from James & co was allowed to go so far that Snape almost died. He made vague references that Voldemort wasn't fully dead yet. So vague that people didn't even believe him when Voldemort was really back. He allowed a spy within the ranks of OotP, which veritasium and/or unbreakable vows could've easily prevented.

So yeah, Dumbledore has been painted as a very negligent or very incompetent character in the books. It doesn't help that JK threw in convenient magical concepts just to further the plot without thinking about the implications of her past writing. I like to think he's just very overworked. He had 3 jobs; Head of the ICW, Hogwarts and the Wizengamot. All of them sound like full time jobs. I do think that the bashing is mostly overdone. I generally attribute bad things to human error, so I already predisposed against the manipulative angle. But that's where most writers fail imo. They point out all the flaws without good reasons why they're allowed to happen, and it gets old fast. I could think of a couple solutions. Throw roadblocks in Dumbledore's path. Show how overworked he is. Show how he gets restricted from his various jobs. Maybe being head of the Wizengamot is largely a ceremonial title. Maybe he doesn't really have a say in how Hogwarts gets run, that the board does most of the job. Stuff like that.

#+end_quote

Yes, Dumbledore should have and he didn't, which is why there is one full chapter in OotP where Dumbledore explains almost everything to Harry and apologizes ("/I should have told you, but I loved you too much and wanted to wait . . ./").

One of my favourite point about Dumbledore is that he could easily recognize his mistakes, and tried to make amends.

For the rest, I agree with pretty much everything you have said.

** I agree with you on most points but I still think that he should not have left harry with the dursleys, like he came into the situation knowing that they were shitty people and even taking out the dursleys dislike of magic he probably knew that they were as Minerva puts it "the worst kind of muggle" and Im sorry if someone gives you that kind of warning after watching the dursleys for either a week or a day then I would probably listen to your trusted friend, while I understand the need for the blood wards it doesn't matter because if he got raised with someone else couldn't you just put strong wards on the place and or even bring harry to Hogwarts and raise him there.

Ok for your third point, there is no doubt that he put Hogwarts in danger, first year what if instead of being sneaky about everything Voldemort just decided to systematically kill everyone starting with Dumbledore when Dumbledore is like walking down the hall or something like I get Dumbledore's good but is he so good as to avoid a killing curse to the back unexpected probably not then he would move on to snape mcgonagall, ect, ect and then just stole the stone or something before Dumbledore put it in the mirror or just get someone else to get the stone. Second year there's a mother fucking basilisk running around petrifying people (everyone especially the dude who saw the basilisk through nearly headless nick got really fucking lucky with that one) and your telling me that you don't shut the school down and like send everyone home until they found the chamber and killed the monster while yes it does take a parceltounge to open the chamber I think I saw it on the wiki that apparently Dumbledore can either understand it or speak it and it shouldn't be to hard to find someone who either knows a parceltounge or speaks it especially with the connections that Albus Fucking Dumbledore has after defeating grindlewald. And killing the basilisk may be hard but rooster or like Dumbledore just does his thing and fucks shit up.

Third year there's a fucking serial killer on the loose who wants to fuckung kill one or more of your students. End of argument. Send them back home where they will be safer make good use of those blood wards.

Forth year nothing to bad happenes until the end of the tournament so no worries there.

Fifth year not too much to say here with the ministry being a cuck. And Voldemort is back so lock down Hogwarts and make that shit a fortress

Sixth nothing to bad here except for when he dies and everything goes to shit so I guess don't fucking die. Also keep Hogwarts in fortress mode.

** I think JK purposely made Dumbledores character flawed to show that no ones perfect and even the people we look up to the most (which Harry definitely did) have their own agenda and can make mistakes. Whilst I don't think he is evil like some fans believe, I do think his need for the greater good came at the expense of Harry's own happiness and wellbeing . I mean the fact he “raised him like a pig for slaughter” -thank you snape- shows that he manipulated Harry from maybe second year onwards once he'd figured out about the horcruxes and he fully intended on Harry not surviving the war which is more than enough for fans to dislike him.
