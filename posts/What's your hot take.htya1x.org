Mine is Sirius didn't attempt to murder Snape in cold blood. The entire plot twist of his character is that he is /not/ a cold-blooded apathetic murderer, just reckless and impulsive. That's like, the bloke's entire arc, whatever was left of it by book 5.

**** Yeah, I love a good redemption arc, but I think there's some value in having characters in the HP verse who aren't crazy sadists but who would support some pretty terrible things as long as it didn't require them to get their own hands dirty. That's exactly how atrocities happen in the real world - it's not just isolated villains who cause them, it's all the seemingly normal, respectable people who go along with a movement or a government because there's something in it for them or because (like Percy) it's easier to pretend that nothing's wrong. And it's important to recognize that because any of us, or our neighbors, could find ourselves in those positions, whereas your odds of waking up as Voldemort one day are pretty slim.

Empathy is less knowing what those thoughts and emotions are and more knowing WHY those thoughts and emotions are. The other person is sad, sure, but what's making them feel that way? Some people see Snape as good, others see him as bad, so why do they think that way? That kind of thing.

Theory of Mind is the step before even knowing what another person is thinking or feeling - it's recognising that the other person has the capacity to think or feel at all. If Empathy is walking a mile in another person's shoes, Theory of Mind is noticing that they have shoes to begin with. :D

********** Sure, happy to help. Feel free to ask more, if you wanna know anything else. :)

There's actually a really good experiment that demonstrates it (that you can ethically and easily do at home, if you have or know any small children aged 2-6 or so).

If you have a box of confectionery (usually a tube of smarties, which is why the experiment is usually called 'The Smarties Task'), you take all the confectionery out and replace it with pencils, then ask the child what they think is inside the box.

Obviously, they're gonna say Smarties (or whatever confectionery is on the label).

So, you reveal that it's actually pencils and do the whole magician-reveals-his-secret bit. Then you tell the child that you're going to ask someone else the same thing - what's in the box? - and ask them what they think that person will say.

If the child has Theory of Mind, they'll understand that the other person won't know what's in the box - that other person hasn't seen inside, after all - so they'll say 'Smarties'. If they don't have Theory of Mind, they'll insist the person will say 'Pencils', since the child has seen inside the tube and assumes the other person will also know what they know.

Theory of Mind usually develops at around three and a half to four and a half years old, though that's not absolute, so older children will most often pass it and younger children will most often not.

One of my uni lecturers actually did this experiment on her child, filmed it, and showed it to us in a lecture theatre. Quite a delightful watch. :)

***** Yeah but most wizards don't live in the forbidden forest so don't have to worry about these things.

The dragons are all in Romania with a couple of Ministry controlled exceptions (unless Hagrid is let loose ofc).

The giant spider colony in the FF is the only one in the UK (and again, no one lives in the FF).

The giants don't live in the UK either (well, again, unless Hagrid is set loose and allowed to bring things back, but again, Grawp lived in the forest where there are no humans. Or there shouldn't be any humans). They live in the mountains of (I'm assuming) eastern Europe and they actively avoid humans unless threatened.

Transformed werewolves can't open doors and windows any more than a regular wolf or dog could.

If people have charms/wards on their house they're things like anti theft, anti apparition (to stop people just appearing on your property without permission), maybe some sort of door locking charm so you don't have to think about keys, possibly things like charms to fireproof the house. But no wizard living in the UK (yknow, the setting for the book) needs to worry about any of the creatures you listed. The only reason /anyone/ encounters those creatures in canon is because Harry and, to a lesser (or greater, depending on your perspective) extent, Hagrid, CANNOT FUCKING BEHAVE AND KEEP OUT OF THE FOREST/OTHER PEOPLES BUSINESS.

All of the creatures you mentioned are relatively rare for the common witch or wizard, and protecting your house against them would be considered as overkill, especially since most are also foreign to the British Isles (I mean, you would not make your house tiger proof if you live in Northern Europe).

In the rare case when these creatures are encountered, the recommended approach by the Ministry is to get the hell out of there (ie Apparate), contact the Ministry and let the specialist do their job. The common witches and wizard only deal with the vermin like the occasional boggart, ghoul and doxies.

As for your second point, yes, it did get Dumbledore out of Hogwarts - temporarily. But I highly doubt the DA actually impacted anyone's survival. A Hogwarts student trained by a fifth year Canon Harry who isn't exactly a combat expert will do just about as much against a Death Eater as an untrained one will. The DA, while it was a nice thing to have, wasn't the "army" that fanfiction makes it into. It was a club that got them to pass their exams. Harry providing combat actual, worthwhile combat training makes zero sense because Canon Harry /isn't combat trained himself./

Notice how dead they look? they've been brainwashed I'm telling you! Brainwashed till all they can think about is serving the ministry. And that ministry's a hairy piece of work, you'd think their throttle hold on the population would at least help them legislate. But no! I guarantee you that powder does damage. Proper powder don't spin you like that anyway. addles the brain it does. Not that they care, better a stupid and easy to control audience than a smart, effective one.

they got the press in on it too. They tell you it's just magical photographs they use in the papers, just a little illusionary magic, but take a goood long look and you'll see. You'll see the informants in the background sneaking off the borders. to the master prints in the Daily Prophet's office, no doubt. They're spying on us! It's not even that big of a secret. I've a portrait of my great great aunt who constantly gossips about me to my distant relatives. That daft hen cousin of mine always knows more than she should! Just like the Prophet!

it's in their ink too, the compulsions. In the ink and the floo powder. It's not Fudge who did it, that was long before his time. He's a puppet anyway, but so was every minister for the past 200 years! But i'm safe and sound. You see, I don't use their laced floo powder, and god forbid I don't read the Daily Prophet. For all their spying you'd think they'd at least write something good. No, I subscribe to the Quibbler, and I'll tell you that they tell it like it is! Not only that, but if you buy the last few issues from me here, I'll throw in some of my special blend floo powder. It's absolutely OFF THE GRID, so you can be sure the ministry won't be getting their grubby bureaucratic claws into your head. Just a few sickles now. It's quality, i assure you. I use it myself and i'm perfectly fine! What's the price for peace of mind anyway?

Don't believe me? Don't think the ministry has it in them to mess with our minds? They've been doing it for years! It started with the muggles. Found out it was easy. SO they got better at it. You know how much of our taxes are getting pumped into the Department of magical accidents and catastrophes? into the obliviation branch? Too much to spent on muggles, that's for sure. Stupid things will ignore anything they don't think is real. No, what our hard earned galleons are really going to is the special obliviators. I'm talking the Wizard obliviators. It's a lot harder to make a wizard or a witch forget isn't it? But they manage it. i swear they do. Entire secret branch of the ministry dedicated to it. Lost a good friend to them I did. Acted like he didn't even know me when I was warning him about the compulsions. Clearly been made to forget. No doubt been pumped with compulsions just like you will be if you don't buy some of my special blend floo powder! again, only six sickles a pint and guaranteed untraceable by any sniffing ministry hounds. Keep yourself safe from the unspeakable unspeakables. buy some...

** *Sirius was immature, flawed, and a hot mess, but some fans & Molly Weasley and other characters are too harsh on him for his behavior. Dude was illegally tossed in the equivalent of a North Korean prison in his early 20s. He gets out and realizes some guilty people bought their way out, some guilty death eaters had Dumbledore vouch for them (Snape), while he was innocent and got nada. That would absolutely breed a crazy amount of resentment. While his teenage behavior to Snape is not justifiable and is straight up cruel bullying, his adult hatred of Snape is understandable when you consider the circumstances (he knew Snape was a marked DE and had 3 square meals and a job cause Dumbledore vouched for him, while Dumbledore left him to rot in a North Korean style prison without even getting him a trial)...and Snape shows zero shame about the situation.

*Hermione is one of my fav characters, but her behavior towards Ron in the 6th book is straight up creepy and over the line & far worse than Ron's behavior towards her in the 4th book. Fan fic where Ron is the abusive one is always kind of a head scratcher to me.

*Fanfics where James and Lily are evil/abandon/abuse Harry are just dumb. It sucks, because WBWL or Harry isn't the boy who lived is an interesting concept but almost every fic bashes James and Lily.

*The Malfoys get off WAY too easy. I'm not saying they needed to be in jail for life (well, Lucius should have been), but at least some sort of parole or magical juvie or a short prison sentence. I get that Draco was basically indoctrinated from birth, but he still almost killed someone for no good reason, joined a terrorist group, was a bigot, and cast an imperius. Narcissa was a horrible racist and complicit in many of her husband's crimes. But because she vouches for Harry, everything is fine. There was an interesting fanfic from years ago that had the muggleborns becoming extremely resentful that so many Death Eaters got off so easy & they target Harry for testifying on Narcissa's behalf.

Right?? This is my issue with WBWL too. I've said it so many times (on this sub and elsewhere) - ok I get we don't know much about Harry's parents really so in a fanfic or an AU make them what you want (Lily especially is not a well rounded character in canon. I could rant for ages about how she's purely a vessel for the emotions and or rivalries of the male characters but that is another topic for another time) BUT the one thing we definitely, unarguably, know about Lily Potter is that she /loved her child enough to die for him./ Mothers who would actually die for their kids in that way would absolutely not abandon their kids for "having less magic" or "not being the famous one."

Lily Potter is basically the fictional embodiment of mother's love as a trope, and the idea she would do anything harmful or abusive to any kids she may have had is just so out of character it doesn't work on any level. Lily sacrificing herself for her child is literally the cog that turns the wheel of the series.

Molly Weasley killing Belatrix was a bit dumb. During the books, it was never shown that Molly had the slightest skill with dueling. Having your daughter almost being killed does not mean you can suddenly fight anyone and win, especially not the one individual who is shown to be one of the most characters in the series.

** I saw a small debate on Hagrid earlier, but thought my "hot takes" were different enough to seperate it.

1) Hagrid deserved to be expelled.

I've seen several people mention that he should have gotten his wand rights back after he was cleared of suspicion in the chamber charges. However, the primary reason he was expelled was due to keeping a highly dangerous creature (acromantula) in the castle. Regardless of whether the creature actually hurt anyone, that is an unacceptable thing to do. Particularly since it's suggested that he has done something similar before and continues with such behaviour later.

Newt gets expelled for something similar, but having completed his OWLs was allowed to keep his wand. Harry was also threatened with his wand being snapped upon being expelled from Hogwarts prior to taking his OWLs. However, the Weasley twins leave/are expelled before taking taking their NEWTs and are allowed to keep their wands. I believe the reason he wasn't allowed a wand was because he had never taken his OWLs. I've always assumed that he would have needed to complete his education elsewhere (likely another country), but as an orphan didn't have the resources to go to transfer.

I've always thought of it like a driver's license. In my state, we have 9 weeks of divers Ed in school and then can apply for a permit. After passing the written test for the permit, you can drive with a parent. After you complete a certain number of hours if driving, then you can take the full test and get a complete license. In this analogy the permit is actually the Hogwarts letter allowing you to use a wand at school with supervision (not at home). The OWLs are then the driving test. If you mess up before you get the full license, they take away the permit which makes it very difficult to pass the test. Having stringent requirements for wand wielding make sense since wands can be very dangerous.

2) Regardless of how sweet he is, Hagrid probably should not have stayed around children

Hagrid is a very nice guy, particularly to Harry. He gave Harry presents and was a clear source of emotion support and comfort to him. I understand why so many people like him. However, he repeatedly made poor decisions that put the students of Hogwarts in danger. Ignoring the acromantula and werewolf pups as youthful folly (although he brought another acromantula allowing them to breed in the forest), he still made mistakes as an adult authority figure. He illegally hatched a dragon in his hut that ended up biting Ron. Ron even tried to avoid getting treated for fear of getting Hagrid in trouble. They then clean up his mess by smuggling it out putting the students in a position to be caught, lose points, and become social pariahs as well as causing Charlie to do something likely illegal. He later on illegally breeds a manticore and a fire crab resulting in the blast ended skrewts. These animals canabilize each other and Hagrid suggests the students take them on walks. He also brings a giant to the school and keeps him in the forest before introducing him to Harry and Hermione.

Hagrid simply has no concept of how dangerous these creatures are for the students and faces no consequences for his actions. If he was doing this at a dragon preserve, then the adult wizards there are fully trained. However, exposing 11 year olds to even a small dragon is really not okay. What he feels are harmless and misunderstood creatures, could kill the students. What would he have done if that army of acromantulas (known as man eaters) attacked Hogwarts? Oh wait they did. Even if things worked out fine in most cases, he didn't have the right to make the decision. If I release a rabid dog near the high school and it doesn't bite someone that great and all, but the point stands that it could have. This is why I think he shouldn't have worked or taught at Hogwarts and should have instead gone to a work at a magical creature preserve or something where he can only endanger competent adult wizards and witches.

It would have also given Ron and Ginny much, much more room to grow as characters, and Harry would have gotten to know different sides of them. There's jut so much change that would come with Arthur's death that Sirius didn't really provide. I just feel it would uproot Harry's whole world, as well as provide a whole lot more depth to the Weasleys. The supporting characters in Harry Potter are super underdeveloped, and there isn't all that much growth throughout the series in say, Ginny (I have a whole rant about that).

** Snape wasn't a "complicated" or "grey" character. He was a pitiful, bitter manchild who bullied little children, tried to have a man killed because of a grudge and endangered children and got a man killed because of said grudge(Harry told him to tell the Order they were going to the Ministry and it took Harry and Co several hours to get there. The Order can apparate and should have been there WAAAAY before the Ministry Six, which means that Snape delayed -for several hours- on purpose.)

He was a complete asshole who only joined the good guys because the only friend he ever had (and what a suprise, that he only had ONE friend in all of his life even though he was 38~39 when he died) was killed by the big bad. He would have had no problems killing and raping Muggles, Muggleborns and other Halfbloods if Lily hadn't been targeted.

"He joined the DE because Lily cut off their friendship" Lily cut off their friendship because he was associating with DE-wannabes and practising dark magic. It wasn't the other way around.

"Yeah but he only joined the DE because he had a bad childhood" Harry says hello.

** The Weasley's disliking Fleur is understandable if not totally justified.

She is an absolute cow about every aspect of British life in every scene we see and she was so stuck up about Hogwarts, a literal castle, I shudder to think how she treated the Burrow when she arrived.

Equally pairing her with Harry is nonsense as there is nothing to suggest she would go for him, either in her interactions with him or by looking at who she did end up with in Bill. Like Bill is a rebel, earing etc etc and every fic with Harry and Fleur he's this weirdo child politician wearing a suit...nothing about that is like Bill...

*** YES!

"Ginny is such a bitch because she called Fleur names and Molly is even worse for not liking her when she should have known better."

Nope. Bloody well nope. Like you say I can only imagine how Fleur looked down her nose at the Weasley home and probably the way Molly and Ginny dress or look - I know Ginny is meant to be pretty, but she's a tomboy not a polished fashion plate - and tbh I think most teenage girls would mock a Fleur type if she was going out with their older brother. Especially if her younger brother is also infatuated with this woman to the point it's embarrassing (hi Ron lol). Also, once Molly realised that Fleur wasn't a gold digger or a vacuous girl who just wanted a "fit bloke" to show off but genuinely loved Bill, she welcomed her. In all honesty a lot of families keep their kids partners at arm's length until they know it is going to work or until they get to know them. Being part of the family doesn't happen overnight, and I absolutely 100% bet Fleur didn't help herself in her early interactions with the other Weasleys.

The Harry and Fleur ship, it's a huge no from me. No stunning 17 year old girl is going to look at a short and specky 14 year old boy. 17 year old girls usually (and ok it's a while since I was one but whatever, I remember it well 😂) are interested in older boys who have left school. And a girl as attractive as Fleur is meant to be? Absolutely would be looking for someone, well, like Bill. Handsome, accomplished, fashionable and with a cool job and - to be blunt - old enough to know what he's doing with a woman's body. Not "kid three years younger still in school."

If Lily's protection was based on love, it should require that Harry live with someone who

1) Loves Harry

2) Loves Lily

3) Harry loves

4) Lily loves

The Dursleys feature none of those. Love isn't genetic.

Harry's personal experience with loving others is basically limited to Ron and Hermione. He grew up without experiencing love, and the love he witnessed from the Dursleys was pathological. More than most, Harry doesn't know anything about love. He didn't really get to know his parents, Sirius, Remus, or Ginny. His sacrifice at the end was much more "for the good of the many" than "because I know love".

Other than his mom, others loving him doesn't help defeat Voldemort either. He always ends up by himself at the climaxes and wins by his own power/guile/goodness, and that goodness isn't exactly love-centered either.

Everyone is allowed to have an opinion. This is not the world of 1984, there's no wrongthink.

Whether your opinion will offend anyone else is a different question, but what you allude to is certainly a very american-centric PoV since their concept of "race" and "racism" does not work in the rest of the world. Some of the worst atrocities in world history were racially motivated (like the Holocaust or the Japanses atrocities in China), which, by American standards were not racist because both sides were white/asian.

*** Not necessarily. If Snape bugs him about Remus' disappearances and keeps insinuating he knows something without ever saying anything (which I believe is what began the situation in canon?), an impulsive reaction could quite easily take the form of a rhetorical "Well, why the hell don't you go see where he's going, if you know so bloody much?!".

Not to say that trying to murder someone with someone else isn't bad or that what I said is the sole, absolutely-canon interpretation, but you can definitely instigate someone walking into a dangerous situation impulsively. Impulsive and reckless just means acting suddenly without thinking it through or without a sense of self-preservation respectively. Being angered into telling Snape to go look and not thinking about the possible consequences to Snape or Remus or whether Snape would die is impulsive (and if Snape did die, it would at the very least be likely to get Sirius expelled if he was found to be at fault - thus a reckless action).

Though I could see it not being impulsive - hell, if Snape actually did know that Remus was a werewolf turned in the shack, then Sirius' directing him towards Remus is about the same as telling someone to go jump off a cliff - thinking it through or not, you're not going to expect them to actually go jump off a cliff.

I'm not saying it's been carefully thought out and premeditated for months, but it wasn't him just completely losing his head either.

If James hadn't intervened, Lupin (and not Sirius) would have been in trouble. There's no chance that Sirius, who had been working on his animagus transformation for over a year, didn't realize how dangerous lupin was.

But going into the tunnel was obviously dangerous only for Sirius, not for Snape. Also, if Snape *was* suicidal, perhaps Sirius should have expressed some remorse at possibly being one of the factors that led Snape to feeling suicidal.

The fact is that Sirius endangered a life and it didn't faze him, so at best, on the assumption that he expected Snape not to go down the tunnel (which leads me again to asking why did he just say nothing if that was the case), it's 2nd degree murder.

***** Disclaimer: I see how these discussions about Sirius's murder status specifically often spiral when opposing sides argue, so I'll just say I'm /not/ trying to pick a fight. Early peace promise? I honestly find them interesting conversations but without the snark and name-calling from both sides, but I've shied away from them for these reasons.

Actually, the complete lack of remorse for me is what makes me believe he didn't premeditate on it, because let's say Sirius is this extremely brilliant murderer at sixteen, imagine if he was caught out, I feel like it'd be a huge strike to his ego, and he'd outwardly show some remorse for it, if we imagine the scenario as him being this sociopathic person and masquerade it as guilt but he's actually just glum about it. I don't know how else to phrase my meaning, but like do you get what I mean? And it can be argued that in that moment Sirius is so enraptured with trying to kill Pettigrew and so full of hate and Dementor-addled brains, that whatever misdeed other than Lily and James dying he participated in he'd try to justify. I mean, Sirius did spend twelve years obsessing over 'im innocent I'm innocent I'm innocent' and he developed a problem with it, imagine 12 years with this constant thought, it'd drive me mental and I'd project it onto everything about me someone else being wrong. Like if someone brought up at that moment how he'd woke Regulus with cold water while he was asleep that one time where he was 6 he'd immediately start saying how Regulus had hid his broom or something.

Actually this theory unsettles me most because if he did preplan it, then it's the perfect crime at like sixteen? If Snape was actually killed no one would know what happened (not even Lupin), because no one knew Sirius told him to go down there and if he was soooo dedicated to hiding the murder, he'll just hide whatever is left of the body before Lupin woke and Pomfrey went down there (transfigure it like Crouch Snr) and Snape is said to have disappeared or run away, no expulsion when he doesn't show up. Perfect murder? I can't believe a 16 year old can do that. Also, Sirius told James what he'd told Snape to do, and if he did do it nonchalantly, I don't think he had actually believed Snape would try it, but James obviously did. I can see a scenario where James is so angry and shocked but Sirius is like 'huh? But he'd never actually do it, wait why are you going down there? Wait James' and then James is gone and dashing down there. Sirius doesn't try to follow because he thinks his best friend is overreacting, and Peter is just scared shitless.

Of course a fictional character's internal state of mind is up to speculation almost by definition, since we don't have an omniscient narrator who tells us how Sirius felt after the fact. I can accept that a certain level of obsession with his own innocence had precluded him from dealing with his own remorse, even if it did exist. But consider:

The situation played out as you theorize. Sirius, who never meant for any of this to happen, finds out. Any normal person would have been slapped awake at that moment, but we know Sirius wasn't - the events of SWM follow the willow caper. That was before he was addled by Dementors. Harry's commentary on Sirius, in SWM:

#+begin_quote
  "Sirius's head turned. He had become very still, like a dog [predator] that has scented a rabbit [prey]“Excellent,” he said softly. “Snivellus.”
#+end_quote

You're right in saying a psychopath would have feigned remorse, but Sirius didn't need to, since Dumbledore covered it for him, and no one knew about his involvement.

Sirius also used potentially lethal violence on Snape in the shrieking shack 20 years later, by knocking his head against the wall when he was already unconscious (as opposed to, oh, making sure he wasn't dead, which any normal person would have done, and that Lupin eventually did, even if it did take him a while to get to it), potentially triggering second impact syndrome. Was that a joke? Was that self-defense? He did this /instead/ of focusing on Peter. After he'd been away from the Dementors for some time, he never expressed remorse. Not even toward Lupin, who would have been his second victim in this caper.

And yes, in real life, 16 year olds can be very violent, and particularly in HP, one Tom Riddle in fact did commit a perfect crime at 16.

Of course Sirius isn't Tom Riddle and he's not a psychopath. He is capable of placing others above himself, and he's sincere, as you have stated; he definitely feels remorse for switching with Peter, all these things preclude him from being a psychopath, but non-psychopaths can do atrocious things as well.

There's light and darkness in all of us bla bla bla, as he said :)))

I hate when we try to know what's their exact thought process, because they don't actually have one at the end of the day, their actions are related to the plot and that's it.

I've always seen the quote you presented with him being like a dog hunting a rabbit as him being arrogant like his family. I think Sirius's actual real flaw is underestimating others and overestimating himself (like Peter, Kreacher) and not his recklessness. So let's say after the incident went down, Sirius cannot actually believe that someone as smart as Snape can be idiotic to go down there in his mind, and he writes him off as stupid and he just stares at him with wry, arrogant disbelief from then on, maybe slips in a few comments about 'Flobberworms for brains'. Not that he's still tryna kill 'em still, he's just being an arrogant arse, and I see it as Rowling attempting to draw parallels between him and his family as much as possible. It's not a coincidence that they all speak so formally (Sirius is still using correct grammar after 12 years of no human interaction and he has other bits of dialogue, Bellatrix and Narcissa apply as well, Walburga's speech and Regulus's soliloquy before he died, like posh arrogant arses, especially Regulus). Also not a coincidence all are described as haughty-looking.

Okay as for the Snape brushing his head against the tunnel, consider: wizard culture is so much more violent than the Muggle world because they can heal everything with magic. They have bludgers and they fall off brooms in the sky, Harry ends up in the Hospital Wing too many times to count, Fred and George with Montague, Ginny using the bat-bogey hex and ramming into Zacharias Smith. Also, they literally have an entire ward in Mungo's named after some dude who died a violent death, they take this shit really lightly because a simple spell can cure it. I doubt cancer is even a real issue there.

Also, consider this point: Sirius did this as he's trying to clear his name for 13 murders. I think he's very reckless but I don't think he's dumb (everything points to him being highly intelligent in the books). Imagine the scenario where he's in front of the Wizengamot like 'so, I didn't actually commit the 13 murders but I casually killed Snape on the way'. Seeing the fact that he's also desperate for Harry to come and live with him, that'd be the dumbest thing ever. So probably it happened by accident, but Sirius just brushed it aside as (a) Snape can be cured with a simple spell and narratively, (b) casual violent wizard culture and deprivation of human interaction for 13 years. That's my interpretation in-context. But between you and me? Rowling just thought it'd be a funny scene given we all still hated Snape up until that point.

You're right that Sirius isn't Tom Riddle. Not even Bellatrix is Tom Riddle, because that dude is downright psychopathic, although I find him a really boring villain because of it. At least Bellatrix loved Draco and Narcissa, and while she calls Sirius 'the animagus Black' she still has love for Andromeda by calling her her sister (nevermind the insanity of killing Tonks but that's Bellatrix for you).

Thank you so much for the civil debate as well! I've never had a discussion about this being so easy to not want to scream! :)

******** Sure thing, I enjoy intelligent, civilized debate about these things as well, and it's so rare... so rare that I've in fact learned to enjoy the debate as it usually is (complete with snarling teeth-bearing).

I agree with you about Black and his resemblance to his family and think it's a very driving force in his development. I'll even cede the point about the head-bumping thing, because Snape did recover from what should have been lethal, and unstable and enraged as he was, he still had his faculties about him. So it could mean Snape is just that used to operating under this much stress, or that wizards are impervious to concussions (even though no one tried to cure Snape of anything), or whatever, but it was still gratuitous abuse of a helpless victim (compare with what Snape did, in the exact same situation).

Where we disagree is whether or not Sirius is intelligent (though he's certainly not dumb enough to plead mental retardation, either. More below). I never called him a cunning psychopath like Tom Riddle (whom I don't find boring at all!), he's a hothead. Before Azkaban and after. Legally, "premeditated" doesn't mean "thought over and planned for months". It wasn't that.

But Sirius did know: 1. Severus had been trying to get them expelled for a while (Remus: "well, of course Severus tried it"). 2. Remus is a transformed werewolf. He had every reason to assume Severus /will/ attempt it. And he, again, never actually cared that he imperiled someone's life and obviously scarred them. This is also the one and only time he didn't take his cue from James, who did draw the line there.

According to the Wikipedia article about murder in English law: "This intention is proved *not only* when the defendant's motive or purpose is to kill or cause grievous bodily harm (direct intent), but when death or grievous bodily harm *is a virtually certain consequence* of the defendant's act (indirect or 'oblique' intent)."

Now, if you think Sirius intended for nothing to happen, on the assumption that Severus wouldn't go in: What did he hope to accomplish by doing this? This could /only/ end up harming Lupin, or get them all in trouble for knowing how to freeze the willow in the first place. In order to accomplish /nothing/, he could have simply done... /nothing/.

At the end of the day, whether or not he's a psychopath doesn't matter to me. He's an unrepentant attempted murderer. If anything, psychopathy is a mental illness, which means Sirius is more morally responsible than someone who just doesn't have it in him to care whether people live or die (as shown, Sirius very much cares, when it's James).

Re: Sirius's intelligence. We certainly hear a whole lot about it, but I speculate that it's more to do with Sirius being the equivalent of nobility (you rightly brought up the Blacks' use of language). He switched with Peter, knowing the Order has a spy, thus bringing the probability of the Potters getting hit from .0 to .5, and the reasoning was absolutely ridiculous, IMO. He has excellent lines like "light and darkness" and the "true measure of a man", and he constantly proves that he doesn't understand what these lines mean. He goads Bellatrix, which is stupid, constantly takes stupid risks... it might be my unhealthy hatred toward the guy but it's hard for me to think of anything he did that's actually intelligent. He didn't understand his own brother, or Lupin, or Peter... He was a fine wizard for sure but it's established from the beginning that intelligence and magical skill are unrelated. As regards the willow caper, if you assume that he actually cared about /Lupin/ at this point, what he did was indefensibly stupid since it would have traumatized his friend (and it seemed that Lupin actually was traumatized by it).

Peter is constantly referred to as stupid and low in talent, but he accomplished the animagus transformation and participated in creating the map just like his "brilliant", "clever" friends. He then successfully fooled them for a year and lied to them, and then almost single-handedly resurrected Voldemort.

********* I enjoy those too! I actually never enjoy the regular 'debates' on the internet, because they just stress me out when the other side is attacking left, right and centre and we cannot ponder each others' points. So no snarling for me.

Actually, Hagrid alludes to wizards having more physical strength. Recall his outrage that a car crash can kill Lily and James, he didn't seem to think that that was possible to happen to a witch or wizard. I can't recall what Snape did in the exact same situation. Are you referring to when Harry told him they've got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden? If so, Snape was acting in his capacity as an Order member, if he tried being petty it would've ended in disaster (it did anyway because Harry is impulsive). Although given the hatred between these two, it's impressive he even remembered to alert Sirius. I can imagine the patronus conversation with the doe and the dog both growling and gritting their teeth, it would make a good crack fic.

I know you didn't call him Tom Riddle! I think the point where we disagree is about Riddle's interesting status, he's so one-dimensional to me. Why do you think he's interesting, if I may ask? I want an insider's perspective on him, because I've never actually given him a single thought as a complex person, he's just the human person of pineapple on pizza - detestable.

Okay, let us assume that Sirius did know Snape would try it. I don't actually believe Sirius knew before that that Snape strongly believed in the werewolf theory until then, when he told him. Why would Snape try it? Why would he trust his bully/rival/nemesis/secret father/whatever (this actually raises the SiriusXSnape ship, I don't know what to think of it. Do you have thoughts?). If you ask me, this is also a really stupid ploy on Snape's part too, given that he was really good at Defence as well, you'd think he'd at least be prepared. But I agree about the harming Lupin bit. I think the /only/ thing people ever agree on in this situation from both sides is that Lupin is the truest victim here. Snape for trying to out him, and Sirius for using him to prove his point. I think that given Snape's general status as someone intelligent, he should've just taken Sirius's concession as a huge red flag, and went immediately to an authority figure, given their hateful history, /then/ he'd actually get a chance at expelling them, and it was the smartest course of action. But here is the issue: we all tend to think of them as adults, when they're just teenagers. I think I'll give you an insider's view of something similarly stupid I did when I was 14 (disclaimer: my best friend was not a werewolf).

This girl and I had this deep animosity after we broke off our close friendship (she thought I spread rumours about her being a furry, which I didn't, but I told her it's your fault because you call yourself that jokingly, things escalated from there). We kept provoking each other, until the Magnus Chase book came out, and everybody wanted to read that. I thought it would be very funny if I spoiled that for her, so I put glaring spoilers on her chair, even though I knew she'd been provoking me to do /something/, she wanted the perfect opportunity to have a go at me. You know what happened? Somebody saw the opportunity to write gay slurs there, even though I didn't write these things, and I got a full week of detentions for it, although I was framed. Looking back, my thought process was I'll get a go at her, she can't find something worse than spoiling that book. Ha! I think Sirius/Snape both had similar patterns of thinking.

Okay, but this just assumes Sirius did want to cause him harm, and he was absolutely certain that Snape /would/ go down there, and it also assumes that Snape didn't have his own free will not to go. Let's be real for a moment, he could have just not went down there, simple as that, they're just both pig-headed and stupid as hell.

I actually believe Sirius is an intelligent bloke, not just academically but also in general, his problem is simply impulsiveness and underestimation. I'll provide a few examples to why I think he is intelligent. Firstly, in the dementor-infested Azkaban, he was thinking tactically enough that he knew Peter would have a go at Harry once he heard about Voldemort again (and Peter did do it, he went straight back to him). He also had enough sense of mind to let the dementors spot him away from Hogwarts so they permanently left the place (some empathy there). He was also quite close to solving the Crouch mystery with zero resources except newspapers thrown in the trash can. Goading is actually a battle technique! They use it to distract opponents, and given Sirius and Bellatrix's similarities, he'd justly think she was going to react the same as him. Also, the Peter switching plan was an intelligent plan, there was just that minor inconvenience of Peter being the mole, but it's because he's stupid or dumb, it's because he underestimates others. What he did to Lupin wasn't a sign of unintelligence, but a sign of callousness in matters of relating to others (he never actually put himself in the shoes of a werewolf).

Peter was never actually stupid, just overshadowed by the trio he was friends with. Actions speak louder than words, for me. Nothing Peter does actually contradicts what McGonagall says (Peter created a potion, McG said he was hopeless at duelling, nothing about potion capabilities). Peter caused the explosion, Flitwick never mentions he was untalented. I truly think he was just crap at Defence and Transfiguration (duelling and not being abke to distinguish between the werewolf and the regular wolf) and his true strength was 'squib magic'. Think potions, arithmancy, etc. Bottom line is that Peter is underrated by both fans and the people in the books as well.

It's fact that they do, I'm not disagreeing with you there! They regularly live to be over a 100 (those among them that make it to 40 anyway) so it wouldn't surprise me. So let's say Sirius wasn't trying to kill Snape in POA, he was only being gratuitously violent.

I'm referring to the second timeline, in which Snape wakes up, and carries everyone, Sirius included, back to the castle on stretchers, not even acting on his initial impulse to summon the dementors at the first chance, and this - while concussed, probably being in full flashback mode from what just happened, and having just heard Sirius gloating about how Snape deserved to die.

Oh, he is detestable, it doesn't make him not interesting! I have always been fascinated by cults, and once it clicked for me that the DEs are one, I've been reading Tom completely differently than I used to. He is 100% evil, yes, but he's charming, plays people like a fiddle, plays them against each other, and his interactions with his followers are very interesting, ditto for the way his followers interact amongst themselves. If you read Ch1 of DH and pay attention to eye contact and where people are looking, I think it's very telling. Of course it's because they all fear legilimency, but averting one's eyes is a gesture of submission, and it would reinforce actual submission. Lots of stuff like that, I could go on about it for much longer, maybe I'll write a Voldy character analysis some time, until then, I wrote [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/g4g3rv/the_death_eaters_as_a_cult/][this]].

Sirius might have confunded Snape into doing it, or Snape didn't believe him and thought the worst that could happen is that he would get hit by the willow, or expected to be confronted only with James, or hoped to finally catch them at some wrongdoing, or was just that desperate that he actually risked death. None of this changes the fact that Sirius knowingly told Snape how to get into a room with a predator in it. Being naive/stupid/suicidal is one thing, doing that is quite the other.

Only you wrote spoilers on a chair and got detention, and Sirius could have killed someone, and didn't care, on top of regularly and viciously bullying that person and others, and endangering innocent people at Hogsmeade by taking Lupin out on moonlight adventures with them.

But Sirius did want to cause harm, as reflected in the fact that he did *something* rather than nothing (and if I send you poison, you're free to pour it down the drain). The victim's free will is irrelevant. Sirius gave Snape the option to go die, and when Snape did, he was unrepentant. Being stupid and getting yourself killed is one thing and being stupid and getting someone else killed is quite the other, the difference being one is illegal, the other not so. Would you say, to anyone, let's be real for a moment, you shouldn't have gotten drunk with that guy, you know men only want sex? If you think it's not the exact same thing, why not?

We'll have to disagree about the plan to switch with Peter. Furthermore, the entire plot of POA could have been avoided if Sirius had simply sent Dumbledore a nice letter that says "if you want the truth about Sirius, do the anti-animagus spell on Weasley's rat." As it were, his planned involved terrorizing the whole world for a year, slashing the fat lady, pulling a knife on sleeping children, breaking Ron's leg, choking Harry upon first meeting him... Look, he might be intelligent, he might be empathic, but his intelligence and empathy are subordinate to his impulsiveness, violence, and callousness, so they're unreliable and might as well not exist.

I don't know what Squib magic is, I don't think it's a canon category, I'm sorry! McG said he was hopeless at dueling on the assumption that Sirius killed him, in actual fact he was a better tactician than Sirius (albeit perhaps Voldemort himself taught him), and constantly outwitted him. Judging by the pudding, of the marauders, Lupin is the smartest.

Re my feelings on the Sirius/Severus ship: I am fascinated by both characters, so if you know any well-done fics, I'd love to read them, but as it were, I am in the process of finishing Severus/Regulus, with Sirius being one of the main antagonists :)))) I think every ship has potential to be interesting.

*********** Hey! Sorry for the late reply, but I'd dozed off. Okay so I went through your reply and I'd written a long one but I realised that it was the same as my previous comment, and that's gonna set off a chain reaction where you also reply as if to my previous comment when I've pondered it and I think both our interpretations are valid and could've happened, but we're both convinced of ours as canon. So agree to disagree, basically. Although the only thing I'd counter is Sirus's intelligence again. I'm on mobile so it's hard to quote, but here goes:

Sirius wasn't really in a mentally stable place in POA or OotP, so I kind of look at him in GOF for the most 'Sirius-like' and go from there. In POA he didn't send an owl to Dumbledore because JK Rowling wanted a book longer than Half-Blood Prince, and that's it. She required a plot and Dumbledore would do what Sirius asked. It was going to end in September. But for an in-universe explanation, he's been socially isolated and living like an animal in the forest for 12 years and then 1, and he simply might not have found a quill and parchment. But I've read a theory about people trying to justify why the Ministry didn't find Sirius with owls, and that's just another plot hole. Is Kingsley Shacklebolt stupid? I dont think so. But you make a good point about his recklessness taking hold, I just think that if we want to see him at his healthiest look to GOF, he isn't reckless nor impulsive there, and he's clearly in his wits.

Squib magic isn't an actual thing, it's just a term used to describe magic that doesn't need a wand for the most part. So Peter would get good grades in arithmancy, ancient runes, astronomy, potions, history of magic because they're not practical like charms or transfiguration. So, no wand --> squib magic. Which is how I explain people overlooked him .

I actually don't know any stories like that! I've just read A Feast in Azkaban where they were both portrayed as really screwed up in that situation and I think for teenagers to be, is not believable.

Oh my, I love Regulus Black. How long is your fic? Is it up? I think he's my favourite minor character without ever having an arc. I see him much like he is portrayed by TheDivineComedian, who nails both brothers right on the head. How do you see Regulus in terms of personality?

I said everything I wanted to say and if you don't accept it, well - that's what makes life interesting! Other people haven't been as civil in this thread and life has been interesting in a whole other sense. /sigh

I agree that JKR needed Sirius and Lupin to a be a certain way for the books to have a plot, but in her defense, she remained committed to them being a certain way. I agree that GOF Sirius is plenty likable! He also supports Harry in starting the DA, another top Sirius moment, and he did sacrifice himself and risked death/capture for him at the ministry.

I don't think arithmancy and runes are core subjects and we don't know what electives the marauders took, but if he did go for Arithmancy and Runes, well so did Hermione! We also don't know if these require use of a wand or not, and potions definitely require magic. Maybe Peter was better at learning from "peers" and not from teachers, hence him accomplishing a lot with his friends and then with Voldemort? Makes me think of what Tom would have been like as a teacher, honestly... and with my view of Peter as someone who instinctively understands power dynamics and as a competent tactician, it's possible that he wanted to be a bystander: he got to stay out of trouble, and he got to watch his friends raise hell. Fun all around!

I headcanon that Sirius was a bit gay and attracted to Severus, and that's why he hated him so much LOL. Sort internalized homophobia, sublimated into violence. I honestly think Severus/Sirius would be very interesting, but for me it would have to take place either before the willow incident or after Sirius did some major soul searching about that.

My fic is here [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22211695/chapters/53032402]] I decided to make the Black family dynamic something like: The Blacks are shitty parents, emotionally abusive and overbearing > Sirius is contrarian who does everything it takes to be unlike his parents > Regulus does everything it takes to be unlike Sirius > This doesn't actually work > Regulus has to struggle with becoming his own man. It's a bit over 106K words and I've got a chapter or two more to go but the story is essentially complete!

I'd love for you to read it but in all fairness I portray Sirius in a way you wouldn't like, I think, given our debate! I'll definitely check out DivineComedian!

************* Yeah, I'm just a person who likes to interpret characters as grey as possible because I like complex people.

Yeah, we don't know what electives they took but I like to think Peter was good at arithmancy, ancient runes, maybe even divination if he didn't take one of the former. I like Sirius supporting the DA, but then Hermione stopped wanting it afterwards, I think people see him as immature but he's just touched, and you know, PTSD, depression and the like. He never stood a chance. And because like I said, I love greyer characters, if James and co. never fell apart, I think they'd like to at least be civil towards Snape. Like the Unbroken Universe and The Bureaucratic Error.

That's a unique headcanon, I personally think he's asexual or aromantic, but I feel Rowling wanted us to think he's straight. I too think that the Blacks were emotionally abusive.

You write extremely well, I love your style. It's crisp and to the point. I think you also write character POV extremely well, as well as train of thought. But you're right that I'm wary of reading it, and it's because I too have an extremely specific view of how Sirius is portrayed, and I'm extremely nitpicky, even with fanfictions that have him as the Good Guy, they just turn him into Patrick from Perks of Being A Wallflower and Remus is a Derry Girl, and I personally find that worse than a diabolical Sirius.

If I may ask, how do you find the time to write all of this and dedicate yourself to it? Maybe it's also because I'm trying to juggle everything with GCSE's, but I find it hard to keep up with hobbies.

Yeah, but if Regulus had just survived his experience in that cave, maybe everyone would have gotten a chance.

The Unbroken Universe is Sirius-centric, although he doesn't appear until chapter 18 or so? He remained SK and has been held captive by Voldemort for ten years, until he escapes. Peter is redeemed, Snape and Sirius kind of help each other in the second instalment until Snape basically tells him if he's on the path to become Voldemort, he'll have to stay away from everyone, although he does help him achieve it initially, because Sirius was becoming a mad man. It was released before Order of the Phoenix came out, so no horcruxes. The Bureaucratic Error has both hating each other until Sirius makes a nice comment to Snape in like...chapter 80? They then become at least civil, and courteous. Anyway, after Snape kills Voldemort, because Remus travels back in time to let them fix the timeline so Harry has a normal childhood. Sirius, Remus, Snape and Dumbledore help each other to fix it.

********** My feeling is that it was something like:

1. Snape says or does something that implies that he has at least an inkling that Lupin is doing /something/, such that it getting out could ruin his life.
2. By the time this happened, they had to be at least in 5th year, as that is when they became Animagi (and James presumably could not have held off Remus single handedly unless he was Prongs). As such, the War was in full swing, and it is /possible/ that the blowup between Snape and Lily had already occured (in which case this must be after their OWLS, based on the Pensieve memory). Furthermore, it can be inferred from her words that this was the /last/ straw, which implies that tensions had been building beforehand, anyway.
3. In any case, Sirius has the same over-the-top not-really-thinking-things-through reaction he has when Harry is in danger, which seems to be his single response to "my loved one is in danger": Do the first thing that comes to mind, even if that thing is "murder the problem" - and that's his 'matured' response a couple of decades later!
4. In short, Sirius' thought process was "He's going to get my best friend killed/life-ruined. I will respond in kind before he can do that." He probably had some kind of half-formed half-assed plan to cover their tracks or something. Maybe. TBH, in his place, with that kind of war going on, and the thing being seen as microcosm of the war, I could see teenage-me jumping to that level of escalation...
5. The part that was /wrong/ was using his friend as a weapon - and even worse, it was /dumb/ - it would cause the very thing he sought to prevent!

*********** The "prank" is before Snape's Worst Memory, Snape and Lily are still friends as of the prank, even if they are already drifting. It's why they even talk about it.

Nothing suggests that Sirius thought Snape knew, or that Snape knew at all.

Also, Canon!Sirius doesn't give a shit about Lupin.

In fact murder and attempted murder are illegal and so are all offenses you could hope to plead it down to, e.g. reckless endangerment.

Had this move worked, Lupin would have possibly been executed like a rabid dog, and absolutely devastated and traumatized, which makes it more than what I'd call a "dick move". Of course Snape wasn't assaulted (that time) - he was tricked. Had assault been involved, I would have at least ceded that Sirius might have not meant it and was merely out of rage.

Again, being stupid or suicidal is not illegal. Taking advantage of a suicidal state you contributed to yourself, though, and using your friend as a weapon to harm someone? Now that's next level evil, and the only reason I don't accuse Sirius of this level of cunning is that I don't think he's smart enough.

No, but you cannot blame another person for your own stupidity. And you are trying to blame Sirius for Snape's stupidity and call it attempted murder. What Snape tried is best described as "suicide by werewolf".

****** Telling someone how to do something lethal but not telling them it's lethal, in fact, is illegal. The fact that it's constantly referred to as a "trick", when Sirius didn't lie at all, means the lie was a lie by omission, i.e. he lied about what lay beyond the willow. in Remus's words: "A trick that involved me". This makes it attempted murder, and the fact that he did it in such a way that he he could still get away with it, if it had worked, indicates that it was premeditated. In real life, people have been convicted of manslaughter for encouraging people who were already suicidal to go through with the act. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Conrad_Roy]].

Snape being stupid and Sirius being an attempted murderer are in fact /not/ contradictory statements.

Being suicidal, furthermore, has nothing to do with being stupid.

You know nothing about the law or about ethics or psychology, stop trolling up my mailbox with that shit. Murdering stupid/suicidal people is as illegal and immoral as murdering clever/mentally healthy ones.

Sirus told him (not even that really) how to get past the willow. That is not lethal. The lethality only arises at full moon, and even then not from the willow. Sirius is not responsible for when Snape CHOOSES to go there. And Snape was suspecting that Lupin was a werewolf, hence he knew what was there. He probably overestimated his chances against one, but again, that is not Sirius' fault.

#+begin_quote

Decisions of American courts are irrelevant to debates about UK law and Snape was not suicidal in the medical sense. I used that word figuratively since he decided to go werewolf hunting without protection. And he knew that Lupin was a werewolf (he talks to Lily, she says that she "knows his theory"), hence removing any omission from Sirius since he already knew. And at that point, there is nothing legal you can pin on Sirius. If Snape had no clue, it would be omission, but since he already knew, no law has been broken by Sirius.

******** You think Snape knew because Snape had a theory that involved the marauders and the full moon. The assumption that the theory is "lupin = werewolf" is unfounded (and is wholly the result of the availability bias) and the assumption that Sirius knew what the theory was, doubly so, since if he had, step 1 would have been to get Dumbledore to obliviate Snape, not to tell Snape how to get proof.

If Lily believed Snape had a werewolf in mind when he was saved from something the other night (a full moon night), she would have surely asked him if he's retarded. Apparantly she didn't think going to the willow on a full moon night was worth discussing. She also didn't ask if Lupin is indeed a werewolf.

Sirius, in any case, didn't know Snape had any theory at all, so, yeah, lying by omission, and tricking someone to their death.

[[https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/suicide-policy-prosecutors-respect-cases-encouraging-or-assisting-suicide]]

Assisting or encouraging suicide is illegal.

If Sirius thought Snape didn't know, he had mens rea for murder. If he thought Snape did, he had mens rea for assisting a suicide.

You're acting as though Sirius have a person with a nut allergy a PB sandwich. Sirius's action would have resulted in either nothing or in Snape's death, were it not for James.

Your pathetic and ignorant appeal to the law, when no muggle legal system applies, is proof enough that you know that morally, Sirius is indefensible.

So yeah, okay, legally you can plead it down if it's that important to you. Morally, he's an unrepentant attempted murderer, and the moral judgment is the relevant judgment in a fucking children's book (and in general since fictional characters can't go to prison).

What else could there be related to the full moon? The Marauders being Soviet Spies helping their space program? Emissaries from the Nazi base on its dark side? There is a single thing in the universe related to the full moon, and that is werewolves.

Preparing some potions, for example. Polyjuice. That's in primary canon. In secondary canon, the process of becoming animagi requires that certain actions be taken at the full moon, so, Sirius accusing Snape of trying to find out what they were up to, absolutely could be a reference to that.

This does not morally absolve him of the crime he did commit and never regretted or atoned for or suffered any consequence for. I never said Sirius deserved to be framed. That's irrelevant. Morally, Sirius is indefensible. Bad guys have bad things happen to them too.
