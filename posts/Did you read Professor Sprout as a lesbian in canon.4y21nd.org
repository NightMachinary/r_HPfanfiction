I always thought there were hints of it when reading. Just wondering if this is a common interpretation.

EDIT: Okay, I possibly phrased the OP badly. I didn't mean 'Did you, the first time you read the books, as a small child', more 'Did you ever/Have you ever'


** I...never once considered Sprout's sexuality in any way, actually. This is literally the first time I've ever thought about it. Pretty much goes for every professor, including Snape, despite the fact that we get a front row seat to his sexuality.

What were these hints?

*** Well. Its possible that as an LGBT person, I'm more sensitive to and thus aware of characters' possible sexualities, if there's a possibility they might not be straight.

I think I never got the impression that Sprout /was/ straight when reading the books, and as a kid, that was enough. Now that I think about it, it seems statistically unlikely that Hogwarts employs such a proportion of single/unmarried staff!

Sprout is not described as attractive or conventionally feminine. She has a brusque manner of speaking, is quite forthright, and is described as "brisk". She has messy hair and works in a physical job and always has dirty hands. To me as a young LGBT person growing up, a lot of these traits and similar ones in other media were used to hint at a lesbian woman, so it was something I always internalized a little in the back of my mind, I think.

**** And to me those traits, not from the media but from personal experience, speak of farmworkers, married farmworkers.

You are projecting onto her.

And it is NOT statistically unlikely that Hogwarts employs such a proportion of single/unmarried staff because it is a trope of the material JKR was emulating, which in turn derived it from the actual situations at British boarding schools of the late nintheenth and early twentieth century (with the great exception of it being co-ed of course).

With respect, aren't you /also/ projecting onto her, if you're speaking from your own experience? There's no textual evidence that she is straight /or/ gay.

I didn't mean the media as in; media suggests certain things /and so/ I internalize them. It's just well known (at least among the LGBT community) that in many kinds of stories where outright mentioning a character's sexuality was considered inappropriate, hints would be left via hobbies, interests or behaviour. As such we as readers are used to 'decoding' these representations to what may be beneath.

And THAT was my point! I know the media representations you are talking but I also draw from very different experiences, experiences that influence me stronger than those media representations and as a result, and in the absence of JKR establishing any/any not ambivalent hint regarding her relationship status, my projections are completely different from yours.

There is nothing but projections to go on.

And that's explicitly what my original question was asking. How did /you/ interpret her. Not for a definitive 'yes she is' or 'no she isn't'. So much information in the Harry Potter fandom is up for interpretation in this way.

** Nope. I assumed that most of the professors were spinsters or widowers if their spouses were never mentioned. Because hen I think about it, when u was a child the marital status of my teachers or their sexuality didn't matter.

** I never have but that might be because I am a farmer and a straight woman, and I've never associated lesbianism with gardening/farming. The only thing that would make me think it is her "manly" way of dressing, but really that is just practical when youre the herbology professor.

**** Haha I guess that urban lesbian farmers is a stereotype that might be true? But I personally don't know any lesbian farmers, so I never read that into professor sprout's character. Also I live in a really rural part of Hawaii, so maybe not the best measure for the average sexual preferences of female farmers.

*** Well, perhaps I'm partly influenced by the actress's performance in the films, Miriam Margoyles is herself a lesbian. Sprout in the books is described as 'gruff', I think, she dressed in practical clothes, and her name itself - Sprout - sounds a bit masculine. For myself anyway growing up in a small traditional town, she wasn't like any woman I'd heard of, she seemed different in ways that I now as an adult recognize could be seen as 'coded'.

Having said that, when we read To Kill a Mockingbird in highschool, there was a character like Sprout who was thought of as the picture of Southern femininity. Just depends how the story is told/framed I think. I've always headcanoned as I grew older that she might've been a lesbian, partly based on the impression I first got of her as 'an unusual kind of woman' when I read HP as a kid.

EDIT: Unsure why the downvotes? Only recounting the first impressions of myself as a child. I'm not a homophobic adult in the slightest, I just was ignorant of LGBT people when growing up because their existence wasn't mentioned apart from in hushed tones. I myself am an LGBT person.
