  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

**** Cool! I'll hop on this to say that Steve/Bucky from the Captain America fandom lends itself well to epic tales of great valor and love for the ages, since they're a literal century-long love story, if you want to interpret them that way.

Here's three particularly epic faves:

  “Holy shit,” Howard says, crackling through the speakers. “You alive in there?” Lying is a sin, of course, but Steve's not sure what else he can do. He's already lied to the government and Bucky and God Almighty; and himself, himself most of all. He ought to tell the truth. That he's not quite what they hoped for. That perhaps they should put him back into the ocean.“Probably,” he says, instead, listening to Howard's tinny laughter; and waits for the blast doors to unlock.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy.

Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

  Hermione overhears something she shouldn't concerning Professor Snape and decides that maybe the House-elves aren't the only ones in need of protection. Author's Notes: It will take me a while to post all 50+ chapters but this will be a cleaned up and edited version that interested readers will be able to drop into a PDF or e-reader format.A lot of very fine artist types created wonderful art to go along with the story. You can find them here: http://petprojectcaeria.deviantart.com/

  History of Magic has something to teach after all, and two resourceful students decide that the key to having any future at all lies in the past, and in Tom Riddle's heart. Assuming he has one.

  Harry comes into a very unexpected inheritance. He is a creature both rare and very dangerous, a creature that is black listed by the British Ministry. So now he must avoid detection at all costs, whilst choosing his life partners and dealing with impending pregnancy at just sixteen. With danger coming not just from the Ministry but even other creatures, what was he supposed to do?

I'm not sure that McGonagall would agree with the characterization of this fic as "tales of great valor and love for the ages", but MWPP would. ;)

Also, for oldskool Harry/Draco, pretty much any of the original [[http://bigbang.inkubation.net/index.html][Big Bang, Baby]] fics (back before it took off in every fandom ever)... although since I am now significantly older than I was when I originally read these some of them make me a touch uncomfortable to read now.
