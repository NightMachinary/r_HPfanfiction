What i would like to know is if there are Fics that have Harry and Ginny being in a Relationship but then meet a Woman, that is attractive in both of theirs Eyes. They speak about her and Ginny mentions that she wouldnt mind if Harry is attracted to her and maybe even wants more of her, since she matches Ginnys Level of attractivity and Harry has a "taste for Women". So Harry approaches said Women and they agree with each other....or rather get to know each other. Whether Ginny is/gets involved in their "meetings" or she just shares Harry with another Women doesnt matter.

It also doesnt matter who this Women is, so H/G could also visit a Brothel/Club and meet her there as an Employee.

Said Women can be from Canon, but i would like, if she is a new Character.

To keep it Equal it would be ok, if Ginny is attracted to another Guy. So both of them share a open Marriage/Relationship, but the other Partner comes first.


** Closest thing I can think of is Linkffn(Transfiguration Trouble), which has Harry in a love triangle with Ginny and an OFC.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry loses the Sword of Gryffindor in the Chamber of Secrets, only a firm desire to at least make it through to his first kiss, a generous helping of accidental magic, and a healthy dose of phoenix tears let him survive. Unfortunately, it also leaves him with a blind basilisk, an incensed Ginny, and answers that make him wish Lockhart was still around to Obliviate him.
