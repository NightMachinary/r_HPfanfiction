Want some fics that deal with the children (or nephew/nieces ) attending Hogwarts. I am already reading Harry McGonagall and although I enjoy it, I want some fics that preferably have OCs or minor characters.


** Red Sorrow does it. Snape and Lily have a one time affair which leads to Lily giving birth to a daughter, Harry's sister. The main focus of the fic is the relationship between Snape and his daughter. Just keep in mind though, it's fucking angst filled, and tries to make Snape a better person than he was in canon, so if you don't like that, then this isn't the fic for you.

*** Is it particularly good outside the premise in terms of writing? I able to handle angst so that isn't a bug deal for me.

**** Objectively the story is good from just a writing standpoint. No errors as far as I can see, the plot points flow together well, it's just really angsty.

** I have a story about the daughter of Remus Lupin. Though, I'll admit it's a self-insert. I've been working on for a few years about the great niece of McGonagall, though it's not posted.

** linkffn(4294544) A somewhat realistic take on "Snape has a daughter" trope. Not a Mary Sue. Has several sequels.

** linkffn(12698097) features a father-daughter and best friend relationship between Remus Lupin and the OC protagonist, who is attending Hogwarts soon I assume (story starts pre-canon).

  You came, you saw, you survived. But at the end of the day, you're still children. It doesn't matter how many battles you've won, how many Dark Lords have been triumphed, or how many personal travesties become medals of honor. You deserve better; the Sun is out now.
