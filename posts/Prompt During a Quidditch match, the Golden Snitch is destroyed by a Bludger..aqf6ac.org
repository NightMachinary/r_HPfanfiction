** *Egypt VS Mexico*

A hush fell across the stadium.

Things like this didn't just /happen/. True, the Golden Snitch at professional level made a habit of flying into the path of Bludgers, the better to throw off Seekers that were on its tail.\\
But to fly between two Bludgers, both hit at the same Seeker hot on the Snitch's tail? The Seeker escaped the collision, the Snitch did not.

The crowd was first alerted that something was off when the escaped Seeker, of Egypt, doubled around and searched for the Snitch.\\
He couldn't find it. Neither could Mexico's Seeker.\\
Eventually, what /was/ found was a sprinkling of gold dust and the remains of a wing on one of the Bludgers, by one of the Mexican Beaters.

   :END:
The incident was unprecedented; there were rules for when a Snitch was deflected by a Bludger, but not for when the Snitch was destroyed.\\
A timeout was called. Some officials wanted to treat it as equivalent to a Snitchnip, the Mexicans objected that the Snitch had technically not been touched. Some wanted to repair it, or send out a new Snitch, but precedent held that that was interfering with a game in progress.\\
An annulment and restart of the game was suggested, but refused by both the Egyptian and Mexican team, who each separately felt that the other team having observed their plays would give them an unfair advantage in a rematch.

So, without a solution, the Egypt vs Mexico game continued.

Players became exhausted, substitutes were called in to allow play to continue.

Weeks passed. Three months came and went, allowing this Quidditch game to become the longest in history.

   :END:
After six months, legislation began being debated to force an interruption of the game. It didn't succeed, the only effects being to permit other Quidditch teams in the league to continue without needing to face the (eventual) victor of the Egypt/Mexico match.

After a year, the team's respective coaches began looking into the possibility of training new players during the game to increase their pool of available substitutes.

After two years, the teams started sponsoring longevity potions to increase the play-time of their star players, whom were scoring the most goals.

After five years, research into the Philosopher's Stone created by Nicolas Flamel hit several breakthroughs. After ten, it was developed enough to allow the immortality elixir's use amongst the Egyptian and Mexican Quidditch players.

Eventually, the Eternal Game took on a life of its own, away from the rest of the Quidditch League.\\
Players of all nationalities rotated in and out of the two teams, testing their skills against true masters who had played nonstop for decades.\\
24 hour news channels existed solely to cover the game, and charity organisations received thousands of 'for every goal X scores' donors.

A century onward, even once the Statute of Secrecy ended, the Game continued, with muggles joining the viewing audience.\\
When mankind developed commercial space travel, and star travel, the Game continued on their homeworld, broadcast throughout the Solar System.\\
Even millennia later, when war had brought an end to human civilization on Earth, the Game would not stop, even if the players had forgotten why it continued.

And an incomprehensible amount of time later, when humans and other magical creatures changed beyond recognition and new species evolved to sapience on Earth, the dolphin-people would find their way upon land, search the great deserts and find strangely clothed monkey-like creatures flying around an arena on sticks of wood and straw.\\
And when they asked what it all was, some of the monkey-like creatures would smile, and say, "Let me tell you of Egypt vs Mexico..."

*** Though I enjoy the idea of the referee deciding that the seekers therefore have to catch the bludger which killed the snitch.

**** There was one fic where a Harry with multiple personality disorder does this extremely dangerous maneuver called the Iron Wheel, where he somehow catches the bludger while turning his broom to send it at another player in the opposing team.
