Tl;dr:

Write a humorous story with Andromeda as Mafia Don, not taking everything seriously and with lots of cheesy lines. Harry should eventually join the "family business" with his friends from Hogwarts as next Generation of the Mafia.

* Long Version, this is just one example for a possible plot:

  :END:

- After the Potters die, Andromeda tries to gain custody of her distant nephew but Dumbledore says that Harry is safest with the Muggles.

- Dissatisfied with this result and yet unable to do much against the Chief Warlock, she goes home fuming. Edward sees his angry wife and tells her that she needs to take a deep breath and calm down so that she can better think of some new avenue to get Harry. To do that, they turn on the telly and watch the first movie they find, which happens to be "The Godfather". Andromeda mumbles that this whole mess would be a lot easier if she was a Don and Ted jokes that she'd need an enforcer to do her dirty work. One person immediately comes to Andromeda's mind.

- Through some hilarious way, Andromeda breaks her sister out of Azkaban (faked paperwork, disguising herself as Dementor, disguising Bella as a giant cake) after she promises to forsake Voldemort if it gets her out of Azkaban. Add a hilarious scene when Andromeda brings her sister home. No positive relationship with Narcissa at that point because she is a Malfoy and Andromeda despises that family for what they stand for while Bella hates Lucius for denouncing their cause.

- The two sisters track down the Dursleys and pay them a visit, where they notice the cupboard. Harry is rescued. The next day, the Dursleys suffer an "accident".

- Andromeda finds the last few days a lot more interesting than her older job and decides to build her own Mafia, using some shady business (Imports, Garbage disposal) as disguise for what really happens. Over the years, she takes over Knockturn Alley and makes a name for herself in the Muggle world as well. All while trying to keep it secret from the kids and her husband through flimsy excuses. No one is fooled, even if Andromeda thinks that she is sneaky.

- Once Harry gets to Hogwarts, he joins his "sister" in Hufflepuff and immediately builds his own Mob because everyone is making fun of his House. Using the Hufflepuff mentality, they band together and begin their life of crime with age appropriate actions, like stealing Slytherin's desserts and stuff like that while dropping corny Mafia one liners. Susan Bones is the second in command and tells her aunt, who thinks that her niece has a vivid imagination, completely overlooking all her nieces misdeeds over the coming years. Tonks teaches them all sorts of advanced charms which are useful for sneaking around (disillusionment, silencing, night vision).

- Harry and his Mafia save Hermione from the Troll, with more cheesy one liners afterwards. She joins and finds surprising ways to abuse the information found in "Hogwarts, a history" (finding "safe houses", abusing century-old bylaws).

- Once Andromeda finds out about Harry's group, she is incredibly proud and shows the entire group the ropes of the "Business". Susan tells her aunt, who again just smiles at her niece's wild imagination and thanks Andromeda for humouring Susan's fantasies.

- Megan Jones, one of Harry's fellow Hufflepuff first years, mentions her sister Gwenog, which leads to Andromeda's foray into betting and rigging Quidditch games.

- Bellatrix originally intended to turn Harry dark but finds her true calling in being the "Cool Aunt", badly disguised as Bellatrix White with her hair dyed blonde. Sirius gets the same disguise once his innocence comes out.

- The final conflict with Voldemort should be resolved through Mafia means

He also might point out that her title would be /Donna/ Andromeda.

Could be cool, but the 'fooling nobody' aspect would ruin the fun of it -- the joy of caper stories is how they effectively deceive the targets.

*** No, I mean that as in

"Ted, I will be out doing buisness with the Smiths again"

"Alright Honey, have fun."

/door closes/

"Nimmy, Harry, get in the car, we are going to Tesco since there is only half a box of washing powder left and you know that your mother goes through them very fast."

"Did Morrison forget his payments again?"

"No Nimmy, it's the Smiths this time... Hurry up Harry, well get ice cream on the way back if we make good time."

"Yay, Ice Cream."

** I would rather not get Bellatrix involved. She was too much a fanatic unless someone more powerful than Voldemort attracted her attention.

Let Andromeda break out Sirius instead.

But otherwise this sounded like a good premise.

*** Azkaban seems like a horrible place and I could see Bella doing anything to get out. Voldemort broke her out which undoubtedly reinforced her loyalty, but I can see it working against him if someone else frees her.

And Bellatrix would still get to torture people, burn down houses and stuff like that, only with a little less madness and the racist motivation replaced by buisness. She wouldn't suddenly become an angel overnight. And I don't see Sirius as a suitable right hand of the Donna.

** Interesting idea, got me thinking. How about something similar?

- Big AU. The first war wasn't a war. Voldemort was a mafia boss who was slowly taking over the wizarding world. Dumbledore saw that the authors couldn't handle it so he starts the order of the Phoenix
- Blood status isn't about who the better wizards are but is just a twisted mafia nationalism.
- The Blacks are a mafia family and don't actually support Voldemort. Bellatrix betrayed them to join the death eaters. Narcissa was actually forbidden from marrying Lucius but ended up running off with him (nice subversion of the marriage contract trope imo)
- Sirius likes his family's mafia style, but doesn't like the only purebloods part. He makes friends with the other marauders (all of a sudden Marauders makes sense as a nickname!). They are a group of cocky teenage boys with mafia connections. They start doing their own jobs on the side and start making some money.
- James and Remus join up with Dumbledore to avoid suspicion and hurt the other mafia families. Sirius and Peter join the death eaters to sabotage them from the inside.
- The Potters are very anti-crime and would be appalled at James. He hides it extremely well.
- Lily knows all about (or maybe suspects but has no proof? No-one believes her?) the Marauders activities and thinks they're scum. She joins the order for it's real purpose and spends all her time focusing on the Marauders and Snape, trying to catch them all.
- I don't know how we get from the above to this but eventually Voldemort finds out about who the Marauders actually are (maybe Peter flips) and goes after their leader, James and his family. Close to canon murder at Godric's hollow.
- With Voldemort gone the mafia has to go back into the shadows. The Marauders aren't competition anymore since 1 is dead, another in prison and a third assumed dead. Malfoy leads the mafia business and gets involved in government.

*** How about:

- Voldemort was a criminal mastermind who threatened to take over the world, Dumbledore founds the Order of Phoenix in response because the government is failing.

- The Blacks are one of the associates of Voldemort and when he fails to kill Harry, his network disintegrates.

- Andromeda, the "black sheep" of her family, senses an opportunity to prove her mother wrong and begins to fill the power vacuum with her own Syndicate while Lucius scrambles to take over Voldemort's realm.

- Andromeda looks into Harry's situation and finds out that Lily has merely faked her own death due to the Prophecy and her desire to protect Harry. James duelled Voldemort while she struck him down from behind as her husband was mortally hit. Lily decides to stay in the shadows but becomes a family friend

- Voldemort returns and takes back his old network from his "faithful servant" Lucius, a lot of businesses in Andromeda's syndicate return to their old allegiances and she has to work hard to prevent a total collapse. Due to the threat of Voldemort, Lily starts to work with Andromeda under an Italian cover name (like Il Rossa)

- While the turf war between Andromeda and Voldemort escalates, Dumbledore reforms the Order. Tonks is in as spy for her mother

- Voldemort breaks his followers out of Azkaban but Bella runs to her sister for protection. Once she realises what her sister actually does for a living, she sees the perfect chance to get back at her "loving husband" and the man who played her like a fiddle (Voldemort used her crush to turn her into a dangerous tool and then gave her to Lestrange)

- Bellatrix had a daughter at the end of the war who disappeared from the face of the earth after an Order raid (hence her hate for the Longbottoms) and they search for her. After lots of "interrogations" and "conversations, they find out that it's none other than a Gryffindor Muggleborn orphan by the name of Demelza Robins, Harry's girlfriend.
