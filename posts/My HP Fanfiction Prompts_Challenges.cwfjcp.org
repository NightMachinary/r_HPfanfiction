Hey all,

I typically don't have a lot of free time to write my own stories but have a ton of ideas for writing prompts/challenges on FF.net that I write up whenever inspiration brainstorms strike me. If I had the time myself I would probably do some of these myself but RL tends to be so busy I just don't have the time to dedicate to it (even though I would really like to). So I come up with these ideas to pass the time whenever I have a free moment. I used to post them as stories and got more bites that way but then I nearly got flagged for it so I just set up a forum on the site to post them. But since then I haven't gotten much takers. Some of these I wrote up a long time ago and sometimes update to make them more cohesive and others are more recent. NOTE: Though I will say that a lot of the crossovers have a sort of "stock" prologue in them to make it easier to start off. And a lot of them are crossovers spanning a few different fandoms.

Then I figured it wouldn't hurt to post the link to the forum and let you guys have a look and see if I can find any takers here. I wasn't sure if I should put this under prompts or not but I figured why not? So take a look and let me know some of your thoughts as I'm always looking for feedback or if you'd be interested in writing for any of these.
