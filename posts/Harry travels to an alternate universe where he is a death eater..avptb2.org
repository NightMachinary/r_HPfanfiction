I'm looking for a fanfic where Harry wakes up in an alternate universe where he is dead and formerly a Death Eater.

I vaguely remember that Harry had a younger sister who was The-Girl-Who-Lived and his parents were alive. I'll take suggestion for anything similar if this fic can't be found.


** I know that harry universe hops into a universe where he is a death eater in linkffn(*A Stranger in an Unholy Land)* but I don't think his sister is the GWL, although he does have a sister (I think) and his parents are alive. Also he wasn't dead in that one.

Actually, based on my google-fu, it's more likely to be this one based on the description: linkffn(*Serpents and Sorcerers* by Midgards Ormen)

** The closest I know is linkffn(Imprisioned Realm) where he DT during the Horcrux hunt and ends up in a world where Voldemort never died, neither did his parents, so the other Harry had like 3 siblings. He's also Voldemort's right hand, or close to. Fantastic fic overall, full of twists and angst and plain awesome world building. Not for the faint of heart though.
