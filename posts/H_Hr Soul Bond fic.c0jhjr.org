:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I need help finding a soul bond fic I read ages ago. It started with Harry and Hermione kissing at Hermione's house (I think) and moved into them staying in a bottle house sort of thing where time moved slower? It ended up with Harry, Sussan, Sirius and Daphne as Leaders of the 4 ancient and noble houses l. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!

  Who would expect that sharing a simple kiss with his best friend was all it needed to begin a journey far beyond his greatest imagination? Soul-bond fic
