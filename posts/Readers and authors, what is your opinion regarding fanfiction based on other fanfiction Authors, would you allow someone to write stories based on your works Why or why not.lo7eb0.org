** I agree with the guy who said you would be hypocritical to be against it.

I would say writer should allow everything, but endorse only what they like. As in leaving everything be written about their work, but not necessarily liking all. Maybe telling readers in their own stories "Hey, read this fic from my fic. I recommend it. Totally how it would go in that scenario. Kudos to writer."

** People have sometimes asked to use my OCs or concepts in their fics and I've been flattered. Plus, it's fanfic, I can't exactly get precious about it. If someone.eone wanted to make like, an AU of my fic or something I think I would probably still be quite flattered, but I doubt it would be a good idea.

I have had people plagiarise my work and change juuuuust enough to get away with it and that really pissed me off, but there wasn't anything I could do about it.

** It's very flattering as an author. I would be okay with it as long as they credited me, even if they never directly asked for permission (that's what fanfiction is when you think about it).

Only happened to me once, this author wrote a sort-of-sequel to my story. linkffn(13757691)

  Harry Potter and the Carrow Twins, Flora and Hestia, reunite following the final battle. Harry won't choose which is fine with the twins. An arranged betrothal threatens their futures until the contingency plan of the skilled potioneers puts the world back in balance. Rated M for situations, not florid descriptions.

** I would happily read fanfiction based on fanfiction in the sense of continuations/extensions/expansions. For instance, someone taking a oneshot as the basis for a series, or if someone disregarded the epilogue of Hermione Granger, Demonologist and went in-depth about subsequent years.

And of course, finishing abandoned fics.

** I like it ðŸ˜Š. Provided the author tags the original author and work then it's fine. Give the credit otherwise your just hijacking ideas.

But for someone to be so inspired by something you've written to then write their own thing? That's amazing. It's like when people make artwork of your fic, it's so good to see people enjoying what you've created that's why we write stories.

I've read a few. My favourite being linkao3(Flat Nine by JustGettingBy) which is a fanfic of All The Young Dudes. It's so wonderfully simple and gives a deeper insight into the world of ATYD and again, is suitably heartbreaking.

** I'm not /opposed/ to it (be pretty hypocritical if I were), but as a reader I'll take such a fic's merits on a case by case basis. For instance, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos) doesn't even try to hide the fact that it was . . . uh, /inspired,/ let's say, by linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin), but as someone who vastly prefers the former to the latter, despite its far worse prose, I'm perfectly okay with that. On the other hand, if someone were to write, say, a fic with the premise of "a day in the life of [minor character from PoS]," I'd have no interest in that, even though I might be interested if it were the same character, but based on canon, rather than PoS.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** To play devil's advocate here and give a few reasons why someone might not want fanfiction based on their fanfiction (second order fanfiction? Fic-ception? Fanfic^{2?).} With normal fanfics you're never going to usurp the original work, Harry Potter is a multi million pound cultural juggernaut. HPMOR is, from what I can tell, probably the fic with the largest sub-fandom, and it's a drop in the ocean compared to the legions of fans of the original work. But writing a fanfic for a work on ffn? It's entirely possible that the new work eventually outstrips the old one in terms of popularity, and suddenly this world that you've crafted is no longer yours to control.

** While it's very unlikely that I'd read such a fic, it has nothing to do with originality or similar (that would be incredibly hypocritical), but more the fact that it'd lead to a second tier of Sturgeon's law: if only 10% of fanfics are worth reading, 1% of fanfics of fanfics would be worth reading.
