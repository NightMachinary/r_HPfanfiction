Let's start out with that I am not disabled.

I've read a few fics with a blind or deaf Harry or what not. I think it's interesting and creative. What bothers me is when you see characters doing things that are misconceptions or myths for that disability.

Blind people don't touch your face to get a mental picture of what you look like.

Blind people don't have enhanced hearing, they just home it.

Blind people can get around places quite effectively. If they need help, you don't just drag them, you ask for their elbow and walk next to them.

Never restrain someone having a seizure and never put something in their mouth.

The deaf community has their own language. ASL has its own grammar and sentence structure. Signing exact english isn't practical.

If you want to write a disabled character, I think that is amazing! But please, do your research. Repeating what you think you know can be damaging. Plus, it's a great opportunity to learn something new!

ETA: I am aware that BSL would be used instead of ASL. I used ASL because it's what I use when talking with a deaf person. It was merely an example. Plus, sign language varies between, countries, regions, ethnicities, and schools.


** PTSD is not cured by love.

Source: I have PTSD. There are many spouses and loved ones who post in the PTSD support subreddits who wish there was some way they could fix this. It's an unimaginable blessing to have some who loves you enough to stay by you even though you have PTSD, but their love is not going to fix it and it's toxic to the relationship to put that burden on their shoulders.

******* Let me put it a different way. You know how some people try to protect handicapped parking spaces for people who actually need them. That's a good thing. But then someone gets out of a car and isn't using a wheelchair or crutches or anything and someone decides they're going to say something to this person who is clearly abusing the placard. There are tons of horror stories about people with mobility disorders who don't use assistive devices being harassed by well meaning people for using handicapped parking.

Advocacy for substance abuse can very easily make the same mistake. Because of abuse, people have to jump through a lot of hoops just to get the drugs that help. And then, people who are aware that Xanax and Adderall are often abused will sometimes harass legitimate patients. It can be bad out there with even people who should know better like some teachers and doctors jumping on the drugs always bad train.

My wording was bad before when I said that fics discussing substance abuse were /all/ bad takes. It's just that I have yet to come across a single fic that is a good take on treating mental illness with drugs. Every one I've found so far has been drugs bad.

  Blind people don't have enhanced hearing, they just home it.
#+end_quote

Only partially correct. Assuming someone blind from birth (or at least very early on), they might strictly speaking not hear more in terms of having enhanced sensory capabilities, but their brain, freed from the need to process visual information, ends up doing other things with those areas instead, including improved processing of auditory input. Experiments show that blind people generally score better on tests involving sound. Another example of enhanced capabilities elsewhere is that most blind people I know (I'm visually and hearing impaired myself and thus know people in my social circle that is completely blind) have excellent logical memory (stuff like remembering phone numbers and other such minutia). While I don't know the full details on why/how different, my assumption is that this is a result of a good memory for things like these being far more convenient for blind people compared to most others, who can get by fine with less.

Indeed. The greatest example to drive the point home I know of is to compare UK vs US. Spoken US English is almost identical to UK English. Yeah, there's some differences, but they're very marginal in the grand scheme of things. However, British vs American sign language is nothing like each other. Someone from the US can trivially understand the English spoken in the UK, but the same doesn't apply to sign language between the countries.

Incidentally, speaking of deafness, I've sometimes wondered if HP characters have name signs. I guess it's possible that Harry Potter have one since he's a popular enough character in media, but I'm far less confident in others in the universe having one.

A lot of intro ASL/BSL etc. students give themselves name signs but that is incorrect and they don't count. A name sign is given to you by others in the Deaf community. I'm DHH but was mainstreamed. I got my name sign when I was about 5 or so and did my first summer at Deaf camp. The counselors and other campers gave it to me. CODAs and Deaf children born to Deaf adults get theirs from their parents, other Deaf people get theirs when they first go away to Deaf residential school, etc.

I've seen some good videos about signs for things in the Harry Potter books including a few signs for Hogwarts. Those are different than proper name signs.

It came in very very useful, especially when we moved to Zoom because of covid and pointing to give turns didn't work anymore. And it solved a lot of the confusion from having multiple people with the same spoken name.

There's also a big movement here of using the sign language signs without the sign language grammar to assist spoken communication for kids with intellectual disabilities and/or autism. We have a system where special ed is separated into vision, hearing, cognition and behaviour. So in the schools for Deaf/HoH students sign language proper is used, and in many schools for cognitively impaired students the 'sign assisted speech' is used. They're obviously not part of the Deaf community, so there is no one to give the teachers a name sign, so they think them up themselves.

******** AH I see! The point of name signs is that other people recognize the sign without you having to tell them it's your name or someone else's name. That's why for a sign language student, unless they are a high level like interpreting student and are active in the Deaf community, they're not appropriate in the traditional sense.

For example I live in Hawai'i. Each time I have an interpreter at a doctors appointment I ask them if they know Jan, with a sign of the ASL F on your left ear. These interpreters who I just met recognize Jan. She is hearing but is the head of ASL and Deaf Studies at the local community college. The University of Hawai'i doesn't have these classes so it's all through her program. She is my academic advisor and disability advisor. When I talk to Jan later I tell her I met ___ (sign name of the interpreter) and she knows these people. It's something where it should ideally be recognized in a conversation with strangers who are part of the local Deaf community without the person whose sign name it is being there and saying their sign name is ____ without others knowing. I hope that kind of makes sense for the true purpose of a sign name. Otherwise you just have a lot of random people making up "signs" that aren't used by a larger group.

It's also why ASL has a tradition of Deaf people giving hearing and new people to the Deaf community names. It's not just that it comes from the Deaf community/a Deaf person, it's that it's a known recognizable sign because the person who is receiving it, has reached that level of being known and participation in the local Deaf community. Jan's sign name might not be known in the Baltimore MD sign community, but it definitely is well known in the Hawai'i Deaf community.

I can see why a sign language teacher would want name signs to refer to you in class, but the traditional method would be by fingerspelling your name until you're at a high enough level in the language and the affiliated Deaf community.

I can only speak for ASL, but it makes sense that famous Dutch individuals would have a well known sign name even if they are hearing and not involved at all in the Deaf community. the purpose is to have a sign that the greater community understands. A class with a hearing prof with hearing students might not necessarily be this, but a sign of a famous person that the Deaf community would know regardless of being hearing, on the other hand, would.

Please continue to share experiences and knowledge from the Dutch Deaf community. I don't know anything about it and as a DHH person, it's especially amazing to learn! Mahalo!

********* To make it clear: I'm no part of the Deaf community. I'm a linguistics student with an interest in sign language, having taken multiple mandatory and elective sign language related courses, and an even bigger interest in speech pathology in hearing children. That makes me more part of the Sign Assisted Speech community than the Deaf one.

I know my name sign isn't proper, and that's why I wouldn't use it in communication with a member of the Deaf community (other than in the class where I had to think of it, where the teacher was obviously a member of the community). My friend group did try and keep a bit of the tradition of being given a name in that we as a group threw out words we thought fit that person, looked them up in the sign language dictionary and then decided if the sign fit the person. But yeah, not a real sign name. Only suitable for the situation and purpose it was meant for, our own little bubble.

I think in the setting of the class the usual fingerspelling plain took up too much time. I'm obviously not using real names here, but we had the equivalent of 2 Anna's, an Annabell, and Anna-Maria in the class. And about half of us had the same initial. Without name signs, I think half of our class time would be spent on 'who???' (via absolute beginner attempts at sign or zoom text chat, our profoundly Deaf teacher only had an interpreter once or twice, and especially when we were all still figuring out zoom that was... interesting). When you have 450 minutes of total class time over the semester that is a lot of time that could be used teaching different things.

And obviously, in the context of special education for NON-Deaf/HOH students, that's a community apart from the Deaf community where sign can be used to assist, but it's not part of the curriculum itself so fingerspelling isn't used at all. Most students in the settings where Sign Assisted Speech is used would probably also not have the capability to fingerspell. In those settings it's used as a tool to help students who go nonverbal during high emotion communicate on very basic levels, or to use multiple input mechanisms to try and build internal meaning. If then a student in crisis can use the name sign for their favourite teacher or stuffed animal to get comfort, that's the point of using it. Said student will probably never come in contact with a member of the Deaf community, so their sign doesn't need to be understood in the wider Deaf community. Just in the school & care or family living community. In the SAS community I'm part of I don't have a name sign as I'm more in a support role for hearing staff, not in direct communicative contact with the students it is used with, but if I had one I'm pretty sure my name sign would be different there than in the class. My classmates all know my hobby, so the sign was iconic in that situation. The students wouldn't know that, so I'm pretty sure my sign there would refer to my hairstyle or something visual like that.

I think it's all just purpose. The traditional Deaf community has their traditions because it fits their purpose, but on the fringes or even plain on the outside a different purpose may be had. And as I'm not part of the Deaf community, but more the SAS community, I think as long as we recognise we're 'breaking' the rules in our own bubble, and don't -transfer- that to when we do come into contact with the Deaf community, that then the balance is found between doing what meets our purposes, and respecting the traditions of others. But I'm not part of the Deaf community so I'm not sure if I get to have that opinion. You tell me

** I do have a note to add to the ASL one, simply from a reading-writing standpoint.

If a deaf person is talking in Sign Language, you generally have two options in writing it: you can directly describe the signs (eg. She salutes. Then she slides her palms together, curls her hands into loose fists with her forefingers up and bumps them against each other, and points to him. He grins.) or you can translate it into word form with the gestures attached like standard dialogue (eg. She gestured again. "I really like the teachers here.").

Personally, if a writer does choose the latter, I would recommend people don't write deaf-people's dialogue in Sign Language grammar or structure. Signing exact English isn't how Sign Language works, yes, but it is far easier to understand as a reader. In the same way that writing Fleur or Hagrid's accent phonetically makes their dialogue obnoxiously more onerous to read, writing sign language accurately can make that dialogue far more difficult to process from a reader's standpoint.

The aim of dialogue is to convey information - how a character feels about something, what their perspective says about a situation, etc - and writing accent or in atypical syntaxes detracts from that goal. Writing Fleur's accent, or writing dialogue with Sign Language-correct grammar and structure, gives readers an extra step to overcome in order to work out what the hell that character is saying. I have an entire ramble on that topic which I've posted before, but focused on accents instead of ASL (link below), though the point still stands. Unless you're trying to make a point about your perspective-character, all you're doing with accents and atypical syntaxes is putting more work on your readers.

To readers who can't talk in ASL, it will also, most unfortunately, read as "dumber." It is just like how people with a high-pitched voice are perceived as less competent or trustworthy. Or, more approperiately, people who don't speak a language perfectly aren't perceived as smart.

If you're writing things 'accurately', you're unfortunately making them sound dumber to the uninitiated, and that can't really be the goal.

Imagine if you're translating a text form German, and keep the German grammar. It would very weird sounding.

(Same goes for writing Fleur or Hagrid with obnoxious accents or dialects, they're perceived not as smart that way.)

**** Well for Deaf people whose first language is ASL and who don't have high level English skills (because of oralism and most DHH children being born to hearing parents the average reading level of a Deaf adult in the US is like 2nd grade or so) they'll put words in ASL order. Add to that most tense and grammar modifiers are visual in ASL you get STORE- ME-GO. In written English it might be that or I go store.

What you're talking about is "sounding Deaf" which is a different issue too. That comes from literally not knowing how you sound. Here's examples of the "Deaf accent" vs "Deaf grammar" very different but they both are seen as a sign of low intelligence and even cognitive disability by hearing people.

My mainstreamed high school best friend has been profoundly Deaf since birth. She's crazy smart and has a BA and MA from a hearing college so her written English is impeccable. But she doesn't even wear hear aids or speak, so she does make sounds when she signs, her tongue clicking, lips smacking, high pitched laugh. Then there's me, I've been moderately DHH since birth but use hearing aids and did speech. Depending on the environment I "sound" Deaf when I speak words and when I sign apparently I make noises I don't hear but not as much as my other friend (according to hearing people who know us both).

On the other hand we have a mutual Deaf friend from Deaf summer camp who is a Deaf child of Deaf adults and went to the state residential school. Back when we texted emailed and messaged each other to stay in touch, people who didn't know her thought she was cognitively disabled. For example telling us about her cat who died "Car hit kitten, car green and brown, who people, know not. My mom run talk, my dad look, my sister sad. Later open dirt! Close dirt! Night kitten." When she told us that in full ASL it would be translated to something along the lines of "My kitten was run over by a car. The car was green and brown but I don't know who the driver was. My mom ran out to talk to them while my dad watched. My sister was sad as we buried the cat." The tense, syntax, S-O relationships and grammar are all visual so thats usually lost when a native ASL signer first tries to learn and use written English as a second language.

Its great we can FaceTime now and sign with each other with tech today. We usually used something closer to PSE (Pidgin Signed English) which is a mix between ASL and signed English (NOT SEE 1 or 2 those are different) because camp included everyone from kids with cochlear implants (CIs) who didn't sign at all, to people in between like me and my friend I met in high school, to native ASL users who attended residential schools for the Deaf. There's a huge spectrum.

Hope this helps! :-)

***** From personal experience I would say its probably more of a nightmare of a time with their family unless their family is also Deaf, which if they're anything like the Muggle world, means 95% of DHH children are born to hearing parents while only 5% are born to at least one Deaf parent.

I guess it depends if there's a British Magical School for the Deaf that Deaf purebloods go to at age 5 or if they are put under a very expensive, invasive irreversible ritual shortly after birth which replaces whatever hearing or lack there of they have with a mechanical version of hearing that's no where near natural but their families and professors thinks that "fixes/cures" them.

Or if they're like the Weasleys maybe they're mainstreamed with their hearing siblings into pre Hogwarts lessons at home or with the village with using Dicta-Quills and made up home signs then they're sent to Hogwarts with a Ministry provided Dicta-Quill and big bulky ugly amulet to wear around their necks to help transmit what the professors say to their ears that have a much cheaper less invasive version of the of "nu-ear" ritual.

But maybe their spell does "fix" ears even though there's hundreds if not thousands of different causes and types of hearing loss. If not the magical world is small enough that there would either be one type of magical sign which I doubt because there's still multiple spoken languages in the magical world. SO they'd probably be stuck at home if they're pureblood with no other Deaf purebloods to sign with. Half bloods and muggle borns would hopefully at least have the chance to use whatever Muggle sign language equivalent there is for their spoken language/country.

******* Ah I see. There's no reason to gloss what someone is signing if your story is in written English, than it makes sense to put what the person is signing transcribed into English. You can let the reader know the character is Deaf and signs through how other characters react or describe the person, through exposition or through the character telling the reader about themselves depending on how the story is written. You can add occasionally something like.

"Harry landed onto the pitch, the snitch in his hand, looking shocked at himself for catching it. Over in the Gryffindor stands the students went wild.

"That was insane!" signed the petite first year witch, her hands moving so rapidly her excitement was clear even to those around who didn't understand sign language.

"I know wasn't it," Hermione slowly signed to her new friend as she spoke aloud. She was the first Gryffindor to pick up conversational BSL, she had vague memories of learning some basic signs in primary school and what she couldn't remember she had picked up fairly rapidly in true Hermione style.

"That must be a record for a fastest catch for a Hogwarts game!" Ron exclaimed just as excited as his friends. Hermione was facing Ella, while not anything close to a professional interpreter, she had gotten quite good at translating the just of their classmates words into BSL."

Or something like that, sorry I haven't written fics in almost 20 years so I'm a bit out of practice. You could have it set up like that in the beginning and then of course as the story goes on, it's obvious that's how the characters communicate so you don't need as much exposition with each conversation. The people closest to the Deaf character would eventually pick up enough sign to communicate with their friend.

The only time I think it'd be appropriate to actually gloss directly would be if you were having a scene where the character was teaching BSL/ASL to other characters and explaining how it's different than English. Other wise translation makes sense, as long as you don't say something like,

"I want to go to the store," she signed one word at a time.

"Me too!" he awkwardly put the two signs together. He was starting to get this sign language thing, all you had to do was figure out the sign for each word and you were good to go!

Or something like that.

Hope that makes sense!

******** It does indeed make a lot of sense. That was the point I was trying to make in my longer comment in this post, actually - good to know a person who is actually DHH agrees with me. :)

You transcribe sign language into English because it makes it easier to read, but there can be times when not 'glossing' sign language can be useful and provide an effect that outweighs the extra difficulty in reading it. If Harry is deaf and trying to sign to people who don't understand him (maybe the people who crowd him during his trip to Diagon Alley in the first book), writing it all out in sign language instead of transcribing it can really emphasise his panic and isolation, for example.

You make a very good point at the end of your comment about keeping the realism in the translation that I didn't. I definitely agree that, even if you're transcribing, you should still keep in mind how sign language actually works.

And no worries about the writing - twenty years out of practice or not, those were well done examples and really made the idea a lot clearer. :)

I do have a little experience with both. I'm an aspiring counsellor, so I took some BSL courses while I was in University with the intention of being able to communicate with any DHH clients I might have in the future. One of the two teachers was deaf and the course was done in partnership with the local 'Deaf Centre' organisation, so we got to spend a little time there throughout the courses as well (which was great fun! The people there were incredibly welcoming).

I got relatively decent at the language, but was only a little more than tourist fluent - I could ask for directions, say please and thank you, hold limited conversation, that sort of thing. My talent lies more in psychology than language. :)

*********** Oh that's awesome, its still better than nothing! Its nice when you go out to a restaurant or store and someone knows ASL/BSL even if its not fluent. My non verbal friends like to write down orders if someone's sign isn't quite at the level to understand exactly what they want. But even if its not to have someone chat a little and say hi in ASL/BSL before writing the order down is nice. It makes you feel less like a freak show.

I remember in high school with my best friend at one point were hanging out. She's two years older and Deaf, she had hearing aids at age 3 for a few months and they hurt too much she kept tearing them off and throwing them in random places, and she's had no other hearing assistance aids since. She's profoundly Deaf and doesn't speak. She used sign language but it was more Signed English/Pidgin and so did her interpreters she had for every class. Anyway we'd go out and we signed to each other (mostly PSE) but anyway people would talk super rude about us loud, not realizing with my HAs I could understand a lot of what they said especially when there wasn't a lot if background noise and the person was close to me.

The first time I turned to face the guy directly and freaked him the hell out. After that I'd let people talk a lot and then as they left say something to them which would mess with them more.

It was funny but also hurtful. We got pulled over once while she drove and the cop thought we were faking. I was telling him I could interpret for him and he kept getting more and more mad. It was awful. My friend couldn't hear us but she was crying because she knew something bad was going on.

Its always great to have people aware of the DHH community and caring.

**** It's created for a visual forum, not for being written. Its taken 200 years since the beginnings of Deaf education with lots of attempts and failures all the way up to the end of the 20th century, to finally find a system to accommodate those two needs.

Bilingual bicultural education has been found to be the best so far, the schools that use it have had more success than previous Deaf education methodologies though most DHH students still are being taught in a different way. The idea if you teach all DHH children ASL (or BSL, Auslan, LSQ, etc) as their first language (L1). Why? Because the only way a DHH child can learn their native language exactly like hearing children is by exposing them to fluent ASL used all around them, just like hearing children begin to learn their native language by hearing it used all around them. The problem is 95% of DHH children are born to hearing parents and hearing doctors still push archaic lies like teaching children sign language will overwhelm and/or confuse them when learning speech. NO. Children have until age 7 to be exposed to a full language system and develop at least one full linguistic system. Deaf children with Deaf parents who learn ASL from birth are at the same level as hearing children with hearing parents who learn spoken English. That's why SE, SEE1 and SEE2 (Signed English, Signed Exact English and Seeing Essential English) were created but they were failures. They're man-made systems based on an existing language. ASL, BSL, Auslan etc. are complete full natural languages. To learn SEE you have to already know English which you have to learn verbally if its going to be your first language. Enter years of frustration for DHH children mainstreamed into schools with these systems, like myself. I was fortunate to have enough residual hearing to help me and to be naturally talented and inclined to love reading from a very young age which helped my English. But I'm in a purgatory being too DHH for the hearing community especially as my hearing has gotten progressively worse as I've gotten older, but my ASL still isn't at a completely fluent level despite continuing to take classes to get it to that point, like many of my other mainstreamed DHH friends have once they graduate high school and realize no one uses SE.

So enter bi-bi. DHH children are taught ASL as their L1. Then they're taught written (and spoken if they're capable) English as a second language L2. The key is subjects like science, math, etc are taught in ASL or the students L1. This includes higher level ASL poetry and literature just like you'd see in a high school English class in a US/UK high or secondary school. By continuing to advance your the level of ones L1, it actually leads to a better more advanced L2.

This can and should and is attempting to be put in place for ELA students. For example many children who's native language is Spanish, and go to school in the US learn English fluently and quickly from a young age. I taught a 100% Spanish speaking Latine Head Start preschool classroom as a special needs teacher, all the kiddos were fluent in English within weeks if they weren't already in preschool. However their L2, English, often gets stunted at the level of their L1. If they were allowed to take high level Spanish lit or Chinese lit or Tagalog lit, their English skills would improve as well. Of course unlike with DHH students and ASL, there's a lot of racism involved in ELA policies even though they come from the exact same concept.

Anyway sorry that's such a long rant on a side subject, but putting a visual language onto physical paper has always been tough and while we've found continuously improving alternatives, there's no perfect answer.

#+begin_quote
  In the same way that writing Fleur or Hagrid's accent phonetically makes their dialogue obnoxiously more onerous to read, writing sign language accurately can make that dialogue far more difficult to process from a reader's standpoint.
#+end_quote

Yes!

This is literally the reason I haven't fully gotten into Discworld. English is my second language and people forget that accents are not just in the /speaking/ person's voice, they are also in the /listener's head/.

A British person and a Canadian would probably both write out the same person with a French accent in different ways, because it would "sound" different in their ears, because their letter-to-sound mapping is different. British people think their accent is "normal" and therefore assume something written without additional modifications just "sounds normal", and the same is true for Americans, etc.

So whenever I read books by British writers that feature characters speaking "in an accent", I have to translate what I think the sounds are into what I think a british person would think the sounds are, and only /then/ can I try to decypher wtf the book is even saying. I don't have to understand /one/ accent, I have to understand THREE, mine, the writer's, and the character's, all in relation to each other.

It's exhausting.

** A few other points:

1. It's cool to see how magic can make it easier to live with a disability. But, if you want to write about a disabled character, don't use magic to /remove the disability/. For example, Blindness, despite the name, is *not* a story about a blind character - magic completely removes most of the daily challenges faced by blind people by granting him 'magic sight'.
2. Avoid letting the disability completely define a character. But also don't just tack a disability on to someone, and act like it wouldn't change who they are. Brandon Sanderson's /Dawnshard/ does an excellent job of threading the needle on this issue.
3. Remember when doing research there is a difference between people born with a disability and those who gained it during their life. For the latter group, when and how it happened can have major repurcussions on how they feel about it.
4. In general, disabled people have complex feelings about receiving help. This is especially true for those who gained a disability during adulthood. (As in 2, this should both inform, and be informed by, their character. A young child who likes being coddled and a grizzled war veteran will have different feelings about this)

***** I disagree. It is repeatedly stated in that fic that Harry is physically blind and even his magical sight isn't really sight but more like how his brain process his magical sense and even then he "sees" different lights, hues and shapes. Also, he can see only, if he use the Look, which either make other people uncomfortable or like on drug, even then he sees everything in vivid green and tire easily. Moreover, he can't see anything made of plastic or other man-made materials, so he tends to stumble in cities. So in the end, I would see it more like an example of how some real blind people use sort of echolocation to move around, it has some perks over normal sight but also big limitations (for example when Hermione made Harry watch her memories his instincts were shouting at him to get out of there, because he couldn't understand anything and his senses were overwhelmed)

On the other hand, when he is in a city, he is completely blind unless he covers the surrounding area in his magic, which still isn't the perfect solution. Moreover, like I wrote before, he doesn't really see, he can tell that the person standing before him is a human, even how old is that person and who are they, if he knows that particular person, but on his sight alone, he wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a miss America and an overweight man with hunched back.

And having a non disabled actor play a disabled character shouldn't be too big of an issue. It's a show, and they don't have to get people who actually have the disability to portray someone with it. He didn't seem like someone who had no social skills either. He struggles with interacting, but he has his own way of understanding and interacting. And there have been real occurrences of someone on the spectrum having savant, which, in Murphy's case, helped him become, as you say it, a medical genius.

******** I hate this. I hate this a lot. This line of thinking is detrimental and doing nothing but pushing it backwards. Yes, I understand wanting people with autism to portray autism. It would be, well, fantastic to have accurate representation. I mean, to /most/ autistic people. I know a few people that are geniuses and can do some extraordinary things.

The whole point of acting is to play a role -- a different character. The portrayal of autism is /not/ due to the actor, but the screenwriter. A gay person can play a straight person. A straight person can play a gay person. An autistic person can play someone without autism. Someone without autism can play a character with autism. If we keep pushing at the line of thought of, “Only autistic people can play autistic characters”, then people are going to shove back and claim that an autistic person cannot play a character without autism. This... I do not know what to call it... is hurting autistic actors. Let the actors act. It is their job. I have autism. I know damn well I could never work in those conditions. Being an actor is brutal. I do not blame the creators for seeking people without autism for the roles.

********* I think it's possible to have it both ways. I've always a had a bit of an idealistic mind, and I always hope for the best. It would be great if an actor with the disability could portray the character with the same disability if their capabilities permits it. On the other side, it shouldn't be shamed when someone without the disability portrays someone with a disability accurately, and vice versa. It doesn't always have to be complete contrast, we can have middle ground.

I've been understanding more about this thanks to many commenters. And although my mind still tends to be idealistic, I know the world seldom follows my idealism.

  And having a non disabled actor play a disabled character shouldn't be too big of an issue. It's a show, and they don't have to get people who actually have the disability to portray someone with it.
#+end_quote

I think this makes sense in isolation. I think that in any /one/ case, having a non-disabled actor playing a disabled character can be justified for some reason XYZ.

At the same time... If the vast majority of disabled characters are played by non-disabled actors, and disabled actors are not allowed to play non-disabled characters (or a physically unable to play non-disabled characters outside of voice acting) what you get is a situation where "reasonable people" are making "reasonable logistical choices" where disabled actors are being systematically removed from the only roles they could even be allowed to play.

And that just... generally worsens representation for disabled people in a lot of ways.

********** Thats so incorrect I don't know where to begin. Some of the most successful TV shows and movies in the last decade use very talented disabled actors to play characters with disabilities. Having a Deaf actor play a Deaf character doesn't require ridiculously expensive accommodations. In fact the Americans With Disabilities Act already require that sets and all other work environments already provide "reasonable accomodations" for all positions. I have never heard that having to have an interpreter on set or a ramp to the stage instead of steps, is soooo cost preventative they've just started eliminating characters with disabilities from shows and movies and plays. I'd laugh if it wasn't so insulting. I'm a professional LCSW and no one refuses my services because I have to use a relay operator and interpreter. I provide my clients with amazing support, disabled or not.

#+end_quote

Technically true, but phrased misleadingly. They're almost all in minor roles, and even then "some" is such a vague term. You know very well it's a small number.

Providing reasonable accommodations is one thing. Finding actors who not only have the precise disability needed for a role, but who also meet all the other requirements for it and, most pressingly, are actually good (both in terms of general acting skills and in terms of the specific role - e.g. chemistry with the other actors), is quite another. Being good at acting is extremely rare in general, and the populations of disabled people are obviously far smaller.

No studio could write a movie starring a disabled person unless they had a pretty specific actor in mind from the start, because otherwise no one good could fit that precise niche. And studios don't write movies around a specific actor unless they have major star power, which no one is going to get from playing a specific disabled role in the very few movies that feature a character with that specific disability.

Overall, if you want representation that mainstream audiences will actually enjoy watching, and which isn't constantly consigned to token background characters, then this strategy will do the exact opposite.

************ There are plenty of people with disabilities out there who are actors. Because of a lot of things mentioned by both me and others above, most disabled actors only have the option to play disabled characters. Whether that be because of the way they look, sound, see, hear, etc. we MUST give those roles to disabled people themselves. When we don't, that's when we ACTUALLY see the erasure of disabled people in the media.

The same argument you're making about this practice limiting the roles for disabled people could have and was made for POC in media in the 1950s. It's just not true. Over the past decade, more and more roles for people with all sorts of disabilities (both physical and intellectual) have been featured as both main and recurring roles in film and television. I can think of several examples where studios have chosen to do the right thing and cast people with those disabilities. (Ex: Several Ryan Murphy shows - he is committed to casting people with disabilities for all sorts of roles, This Is Us cast blind actors, there was a Freeform show about a Deaf girl - don't remember the name, I never watched it, A Quiet Place cast a Deaf actor) There are more I am missing for sure. But representation is growing!

************ Ever heard of Marlee Matlin?? Oscar winning Deaf actress, been in tons of movies, tons of hit TV shows and is absolutely amazing.

"Switched at Birth" has Deaf characters in multiple main roles played by Deaf actors/actresses.

Big Hollywood movies such as "A Quiet Place" and "The Shape of Water" both had Deaf main characters played by Deaf actors and actresses.

Deaf people and disabled people could be in any main role of any movie. We're regular people who lead regular lives and it's easy to put a Deaf character or someone in a wheelchair in a main role in place of an able bodied character for many movies and keep the movie the same. It doesn't have to be focused on the disability. It's really not hard.

It's attitudes like yours, thinking that people with disabilities don't have "star power" or can't be in the place of a "regular person" without making a movie unwatchable. Stop seeing disabled people as their disability and start seeing them as people. Maybe the screenplay doesn't have a character who is Deaf or in a wheelchair in it, but there isn't anything necessarily saying they have to be able bodied and not wear hearing aids or use sign language or speak but with a "Deaf accent", and an actor/actress shows up who happens to be and rocks the part.

That's like saying that black people can't try out for roles that aren't specifically black and aren't specifically about slavery or maids in the Jim Crow era south. In the first half of the 20th century that's the way it was. Now we've evolved slightly as a society and people of all races and backgrounds can play all characters whether or not they're written specifically for someone of their race or not. People with disabilities shouldn't be any different. If you think so, you need to check your prejudice and privilege and educate yourself.

** My additions/counterpoints:

- Anyone at Hogwarts would more than likely use British Sign Language, which has /yet another/ different sentence structure, grammar and sign-meanings.
- Usually, it's best to gloss over which actual signs are used - if the POV/"over-the-shoulder" character knows sign language, just give the translation/interpretation. If they /don't/ know sign-language, just mention the sign-language-user making signs without mentioning which specific ones.\\
  Mind you, it can be fun to have a "conversation" in correct sign-language play out in front of a character who doesn't know how to interpret it - but a scene like that might not fit the pace of the story.
- in /general/, if in doubt, be non-specific. I'd much rather read about a character suffering a non-specific but plausible disorder than a specific one that doesn't symptomatically match what's shown, I'd much rather read a glossed-over nonspecific sign language than a made-up-on-the-spot one that claims to be British Sign Language, etc.

So no, they wouldn't use BSL either. Someone deaf from childhood probably would, as would their family (unless the deaf person was Harry of course), but it is foolish to expect anyone else to. Someone who is merely hard-of-hearing from childhood probably wouldn't know BSL, and someone who loses their hearing as an adult is very unlikely to know it.

I know as someone who identifies as DHH because although I was mainstreaned and use hearing aids and can use my voice, I depend on CC on TV and videos, require interpreters for doctors appointments and use relay for phone calls as a newly graduated 18 year old I had a hard time fitting into the "adult Deaf community." Growing up like I mentioned I went to a summer camp for the Deaf for kids from around the US that I lived less than an hour from. We had a wide variety of DHH kids and we found a way to communicate with each other and that was that.

Luckily I was far from the only one in my situation, with the ADA Act, with rise of both mainstreaming, new day schools for the Deaf and technology that allows people of all backgrounds to connect with each other and communicate more clearly, and as such I've noticed a broadening and change within the greater Deaf community which is a good thing.

We can be more inclusive and open while still advocating for ASL use, not seeing Deafness as a disability, and more options for Deaf children than just shipping them away from home to residential boarding school or performing an invasive potentially dangerous surgery to "fix" children and "make" them hearing. There's options in the middle and pros and cons to everything and its important we advocate for education and discussion and options for both parents and children.

********* I'm really sorry you've had such bad experiences. As someone who is DHH and had a few bad experiences when I turned 18 and let it effect my involvement in the wider Deaf community for awhile, I wish I hadn't. There's a lot of great people on the whole spectrum of Deaf to hard of hearing to interpreters to CODAs etc. that are part of their local Deaf communities and would be happy to have you! I don't know what your personal situation is, if you lost your hearing pre or post lingual, if you use any form of sign at all, where you're form, etc. but if you ever want to talk to someone about it, you're many than welcome to shoot me a PM. :-)

** The irony of telling people to do their research then assuming people at a school in Scotland would be using American Sign Language...

Good points apart from that though.
