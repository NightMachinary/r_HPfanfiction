:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have tried all the googling combinations I can think of for these three:

1. I think it's a one shot, but might be a scene in a longer story, that gives some background to Molly giving her brother Fabian's watch to Harry. First she asks Remus who said Sirius didn't plan ahead enough for this, and embarrassedly admits he can't afford it. Then she goes up and looks through her brothers' trunks in the attics, gets emotional, but eventually gifts it to Harry
2. This might be a time travel, possibly to the 70s, but maybe the 90s, where Harry and a friend or two polyjuice as young children to attack death eaters
3. I don't remember any other facts from this one, except that Harry gets Dudley and his friends to beat up inferi with baseball bats and other weapons and they treat it like a zombie video game.

Thanks in advance!


** the first one is Fabian's Watch by FloreatCastellum

  Harry's seventeenth birthday is coming up, and Molly Weasley is certainly not going to let him come of age without a traditional gift of a watch.

** Could the second one be Harry Potter and the Metamorph?

linkffn(10516162)

No time travel, and no polyjuice, but Harry is a metamorph and he and Tonks shift into children to attack death eaters

  Harry decided that the only way he can win this war with his sanity intact is to train his own way without interference. But then he discovers an ability that he needs help with and only one person can provide that-Tonks. They bring the fight to the DEs in their own way so that the war will finally end.

** I read the zombie-bashing one recently, (but I have memory issues due to a really bad concussion so "recently" could be months ago so my browser history is not very helpful). I think it may have been a H/Hr?
