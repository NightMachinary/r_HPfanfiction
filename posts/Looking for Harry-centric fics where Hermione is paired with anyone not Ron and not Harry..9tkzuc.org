Slash/FemmeSlash is okay. Actually it doesn't even have to be Hermione. Can just be Harry/NoOne but there are non-canon side ships.

I don't know I just think it's cute if the author puts some evidence of a budding romance in the background but isn't central or a distraction to the main plot. I've read some RavenclawStudent/Granger and Draco/Hermione side ships that were enjoyable.


** There's some Hermione/Cedric in Linkffn(10870770), but it's a crossover and the 4th fic in a series

** Linkffn(12745758)

Harry/Lisa Turpin. There is one hint on Hermione's pairing already, but the big reveal will be during the Yule Ball (in three or four chapters). A few other pairings are mentioned (Sue Li/Terry Boot, Tonks/FOC) but are of no significance to the main plot.
