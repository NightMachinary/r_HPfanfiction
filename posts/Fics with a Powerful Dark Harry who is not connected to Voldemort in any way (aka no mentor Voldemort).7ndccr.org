I am looking for fics (hopefully good, of decent length, and complete), where Harry is dark or at least a darker grey, and powerful magically, and maybe politically or financially.

However key here is I dont want him dark because of Voldemorts influence, or because he is mentored or changed by Voldemort. He should be dark of his own will for whatever reason. Voldemort can still exist, but Harry should be operating for his own goals and gains or with his own faction.

I would prefer there be some kind of romance in the plot, and that the story is very mature or higher in rating. I don't want "teen" rated and censored dark harry in other words. No main character slash please. Violence, Smut, and darker aspects are expected and fine.

Thanks all. Oh... and Happy New Year! Heres hoping for another amazing year of HP fanfic reading lol. So many amazing authors out there.

*** Too many to name, but basically every one of them he turns dark because of some sort of Voldemort influence. Either his scar horcrux takes over, or Voldemort mentors him, or he falls in love with Bella or a Fem!voldemort or something, or similar such fics. I was wondering if there were any fics where he went dark purely on his own for some reason basically.

**** I would recommend "The Sum of Their Parts", but I'm sure you already read that one.

I think he is quite mean and manipulative in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407). Maybe not evil, but he definitely didn't shy away from killing anymore.

The ending of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]], linkffn(11922116), definitely throws a curveball, making him wonder his actual intention. Brennus is supposed to write a sequel that sheds more light on this Harry's true nature.

This is a time travel, but Harry and his girls are all prolific killers in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620), is one great dark!Harry fic.

--------------

Finally, I need to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), again. This Harry is politically, strategically, and magically on a complete different level than canon Harry, and he could be one mean SOB.

***** Yea I have read Sum of Their Parts, as it does seem to be recommended a lot. Also, read Ruthless.

I also JUST read contractual Invalidation a few weeks ago, and while I enjoyed it, its not quite what I was looking for.

As for Emperor, I have read it and agree with you that its one of the more impressive Harry based characters out there. I don't really know if I would call it "dark" simply because its so AU that it does not have quite the same meaning.

Reunion and Gothic are new to me though. I'll check them out. Thanks.

******* I don't really disagree with any of those points actually. Your take is solid.

The only thing I would say is different in how I view things is that Dark Harry having a worthwhile goal is a bit vague. Worthwhile to who? To him? To the reader? You imply readers but at the same time, all readers are different. I agree that he shouldn't just be dark for darks sake, but the goal could be as simple as power over all things, or as complex as reshaping the wizarding world, its politics, and its views, building a power base with him at its head, and revitalizing houses he heads with the help of several strong women.

At the end of the day dark for me, while it can have many complex layers, can be distilled down to simply a Harry who is willing to do anything and everything, no matter how horrible it may be, in whatever quest he sets himself on.

It has some Potters!bashing, but (i am saying it as a hater of any kind of bashing in fics) it is bearable and has a decent explanation.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

Harry forms his own faction and does his best to ignore Voldemort for a while. Fic takes quite a few turns with regard to theme and content, which has shaken off some of the people who really liked how it started out.
